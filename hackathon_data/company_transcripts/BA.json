Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analysts' and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy Jeffrey Lahr","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm Troy Lahr, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer. After management comments, we'll take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thank you, Troy, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our 2016 operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail. With that, let's move to Slide 2.","Throughout 2016, employees across our company worked to build on the strength that have positioned Boeing as the aerospace industry leader after 100 years in operation, and delivering on our customer commitments during the year and extending our broad market leadership, we generated strong revenue, solid core operating earnings and record cash. We redoubled our focus on profitable long-term growth strategies, disciplined execution of our production and development programs, growing our services business and driving further quality and productivity gains across the enterprise.","We also demonstrated our commitment to investing in our people and our business, while once again returning significant value to our shareholders. For the full-year, we returned nearly $10 billion to shareholders through the repurchase 55 million shares for $7 billion in dividend payments totaling $2.8 billion. In December, we deepened our commitment in this regard as our Board of Directors authorized a new $14 billion share repurchase program and a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increases are part of our balance cash deployment strategy and reflect the confidence we have in our strong line up of products and services and our long-term outlook for the business.","Turning to our core operating performance for the year, Boeing commercial airplanes reported revenue of $65 billion driven by 748 deliveries, which further extended our market share leadership in airplane deliveries to a fifth consecutive year. Net new commercial airplane orders were healthy 668, which added to our robust backlog of approximately 5,700 airplanes, which is more than seven years of production at current rates.","Key milestones in 2016 included first flight of the 737 MAX in completion of the first eight production aircraft. We also began final assembly of the 787-10 in December, and we started manufacturing components for preproduction testing on the 777X.","Boeing Defense, Space & Security had a solid year as well with healthy revenue and margins and with team making progress on critical program milestones including first flight of our T-X trainer aircraft.","In the quarter, we also successfully completed boom envelope testing on the KC-46 tanker program, notwithstanding additional costs incurred for incorporating known changes into the initial production aircraft, which Greg will cover in more detail later. We continue to transition from development to production with testing tracking to plan and no new technical discoveries during the quarter.","Overall we continue to see the tanker programs a profitable long-term franchise program for the company with a need for approximately 400 aircraft worldwide. The $2.8 billion contract in 2016 from the U.S. Air Force for the first 19 KC-46 tankers highlights the demand and market opportunity we see for this program.","Other key contract awards and commitments for our Defense & Space business during the year included a contract from the U.S. Army for 117 remanufactured Apache helicopters and $2.5 billion award from the U.S. Navy for 20 P-8 Poseidon aircraft.","In summary, during what was an exciting and memorable centennial year, we delivered solid core operating performance, achieved record cash generation and strengthened our business for profitable long-term growth, while making strategic investments to accelerate into our second century and returning cash to shareholders as promised. With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3.","We continued to see generally solid overall demand for our products and services across our Commercial, Defense & Space and Services businesses. In our commercial airplanes business, our global customers continue to recognize the compelling value proposition that our new more fuel-efficient product family brings to the market. Order deferral activity is approximately 2% of our backlog and remains well below the historical 15-year average of 6%.","New order activity is continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. For 2017, we expect our new order intake to be approximately the same as what we captured in 2016. In the narrow-body market, we are seeing continued strong demand as illustrated by the 550 orders we captured in 2016, including the December 737 MAX orders from GECAS for 75 aircrafts and the Spicejet order for 100 aircraft.","In the wide-body market, we are seeing varying levels of demand across aircraft models. For the full-year, we captured orders for 118 wide-body aircraft with 58 of those being orders for the 787. However on the 777, a near-term hesitation in order activities we discussed with you on previous calls resulted in total of 17 orders booked for the year. Over the long-term, we remain highly confident in our commercial market forecast that continues to project strong global demand, with customers expected to order more than 39,600 airplanes over the next 20 years. That forecast includes the need for more than 9,000 wide-body aircraft, underpinned by a large upcoming replacement cycle early in the next decade.","Our overall confidence in the long-term market outlook is based on solid ongoing replacement demand and traffic growth. Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP with IATA reporting 6% growth in commercial passenger traffic and 3% growth in free traffic for 2016 through November.","Turning to individual airplane programs, as I previously mentioned, customer demand remains strong for the 737 with a robust backlog of more than 4,400 firm orders for the NG and MAX models combined. We remain on track to raise the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 47 in the third quarter of 2017, followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be oversold. Simply put, this is a big attractive market and the 737 families positioned within it is solid.","Our confidence in the future of the 737 MAX is re-enforced by the fact that within our top 20 narrow-body customers, we continue to see a large capacity for additional orders when we compare existing order totals to their overall fleet size. For the current generation 777, our backlog at year-end was 136 airplanes. In December, we announced our decision to lower the 777 production to match supply with near-term demand. We have transitioned to the seven per month production rate this month before we lower to the production rate in August to five per month as previously announced.","Within the updated rate plan, delivery slots for the 777 are now nearly sold out for 2017. For 2018 and 2019, when we begin the phasing in 777X production, we are now approximately 90% sold out for both years, where as a reminder, we will be delivering at a rate of approximately 3.5 per month. This rate plan includes the recent agreement from Iran Air for 15 in 777-300 ERs and we continue to work a number of 777 sales campaigns throughout the remaining production slots.","Based on the current sales environment, we believe the rate plan we've put in place establishes a production floor for the 777 program. And we have a strong foundation of 320 777X orders and commitments that support our production plant for ramping up 777 deliveries.","Our 787 Dreamliner program also stands on a strong foundation for long-term production with 700 firm orders in our year-end backlog. Securing additional 787 orders to solidify the 14 per month production rate at the end of the decade remains a priority. We've booked several new orders in 2016, but there is still more work to do.","On the 747 program, we are encouraged by the modest recovery in the air cargo market and the October order from UPS for 14 747-8 Freighters with options for an additional 14. This order helps to fill the production skyline for the foreseeable future and significantly de-risks 747 program.","We continue to see the Commercial and Defense services market as a major growth opportunity for us. We are aggressively targeting this market as we strengthen our services in support areas, including our traditional parts, modifications and upgrade business, as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services.","Furthermore in December, we announced plans for Boeing Global Services, an integrated new business unit that we are forming from key elements of our commercial aviation services and global services and support groups. When this new business unit begins fully operating during the third quarter, we will leverage synergies across the company and further support our growth ambitions in this market. That market is expected to total $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. While the fiscal year 2017 U.S. federal budget is not yet finalized, DOD and congressional support for our key BDS programs is firm, and we continue to anticipate modest defense spending growth over the next five years. International demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. We are encouraged with the notification to Congress regarding the foreign military sale of 48 Chinooks to Saudi Arabia and 37 Apaches to the UAE, and we have cleared congressional notification for 36 F-15s to Qatar with options for 36 more and 28 F-18s to Kuwait with options for an additional 12.","Additionally we are pleased with the announcement of Canada\u2019s intent to purchase 18 F-18 fighters. We will remain engaged with the Canadian government as we work to finalize this sale. The F-18 has a proven track record of demonstrated results with unparalleled mission success for our war fighters, while providing the best value for our taxpayers. The Defense, Space & Security team remains focused on driving market based affordability of our products and services and increasing overall profitability.","During the quarter, we announced additional organizational streamlining and major facilities consolidations in support of these efforts. With these plans by the end of 2020, we expect to reduce facilities space by an additional 4.5 million square feet. Concurrent with the steps were taken to improve cost competitiveness and affordability, we also continue to invest in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. Much of that investment supports the priority we have placed on capturing future franchise programs, where we are leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise.","For JSTARS recapitalization, ground-based strategic deterrent, advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities, such as the T-X trainer and the unmanned aircraft carrier-based MQ-25A.","In summary, our team is intent on building upon the strategic progress and business performance momentum established over the past several years to meet our commitments to our stakeholders and accelerate improvements and quality, safety and productivity, all to drive further innovation in our products and processes and deliver long-term growth and value creation for our company.","Now over to Greg for our financial results and our 2017 guidance. Greg?","Greg Smith","Thanks Dennis. Good morning everybody. Let's turn to Slide 4 and we\u2019ll discuss our full-year results.","Revenue for the year was strong $94.6 billion on solid commercial airplane deliveries and continued growth in our services business. Core earnings per share totaled $7.24 a share for the full-year, reflecting strong core operating performance across the company, that was offset by the charges on the tanker program as well as the second quarter 787 R&D reclassification and 747 charge.","Operating cash flow for the year was a record $10.5 billion. The robust cash generation was largely driven by solid core operating performance for the full-year and a slight impact from favorable timing of receipts and expenditures at year-end.","Moving now to our quarterly results on Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue was $23.3 billion, driven largely by solid commercial airplane deliveries and healthy defense revenues. Core operating margins for the quarter were 8.9%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses that were more than offset the fourth quarter after-tax charge on the tanker program. Fourth quarter core earnings per share was $2.47, again on solid core operating performance that again more than offset the $0.32 charge on tanker.","As Dennis mentioned, we have more work to do on the EMD program but we're making good progress on the test and certification efforts, as well as retiring risk. The tanker charge this quarter was primarily on the production phase of the contract as we incorporate changes on the airplane in the factory and make investments in our production system that will allow us to build future aircraft in a more efficient manner.","Let's discuss commercial airplanes now on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, our commercial airplane revenue was $16.2 billion. Commercial airplane operating margins in the fourth quarter were 9.1%. Excluding the tanker charge at BCA generated operating margins of 10.6% on favorable delivery mix, lower R&D and improved overall performance.","Commercial airplanes captured $23 billion in net orders during the quarter, strengthening our backlog that now stands at $416 billion and more than 5,700 aircrafts. For the full year, we captured $49 billion on 668 net orders.","On the 787 program, the deferred production balance continued its downward trend declining another $215 billion in the quarter. The improvement was driven by the delivery mix, internal productivity efforts and supplier step-down pricing. Over the long-term, we continue to focus on 787 cash generation again driven by the favorable mix, internal productivity improvements and additional supplier step-down pricing.","Let's turn out to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue at our defense business was $6.9 billion and operating margins were 11.8%, largely due to solid core performance and timing of deliveries. Apart from the tanker charge at BDS, the segment generated operating margins of 12.8%. Revenue at Boeing military aircraft decreased to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting from timing of deliveries, and operating margins were 11% in the quarter.","Network & Space Systems\u2019 revenue declined $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter on lower planned satellite volume. NS&S generated operating margins of 8.7%. Global Services & Support reported revenue of $2.4 billion and generated strong operating margins of 14.9%, driven by performance and favorable contract mix.","Defense, Space & Security reported $8 billion of new business in the quarter and the backlogs now stands at $57 billion, of which 37% represents customers from outside the United States.","Turning now to Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was better than planned at $2.8 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by solid performance across the company as well as slight impact from favorable timing of receipts and expenditures at year-end. Again operating cash flow for the year was a record $10.5 billion. The robust cash generation for the full-year was driven by solid deliveries, strong core operating performance and continued efforts on disciplined cash management.","With regard to capital deployment, we paid $672 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 4 million shares or $500 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2016 repurchase activity to 55 million shares or $7 billion.","As Dennis mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization back up to the $14 billion and increased the dividend another 30%. We now have increased our dividend per share by more than 190% in four years, and over the same period, we have lowered our share count 18% through the repurchase of 174 million shares. Our capital deployment strategy demonstrates the strength of our backlog and our confidence in our marketplace and our business performance going forward. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priority for us.","Moving now to cash and debt balances on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. This financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key growth areas of our business, return cash to shareholders and execute on our balance cash deployment strategy going forward.","So now turn to Slide 10, and we\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2017. Our guidance for 2017 reflects solid core operating performance, planned productivity improvements, as we have long discussed growing cash flows. Operating cash for 2017 is forecasted to increase by approximately $250 million to $10.75 billion, largely driven by improvement 787 cash generation, higher 737 production rates and overall disciplined cash management efforts, all of which more than offset the cash impact from the lower 777 volume.","We expect 2017 pension funding to be approximately $500 million, which is an increase from $100 million of funding in 2016. As 777X investments peak in 2016, capital spending is forecasted to decline in 2017 by approximately $300 million to now be approximately $2.3 billion. Revenue for 2017 is forecasted to be between $90.5 billion and $92.5 billion, largely reflecting lower planned 777 production and military volume, which more than offset the planned higher 737 production and growth in Commercial and Defense services.","We continue to expect revenue growth over the remainder of the decade with additional commercial airplane rate increases planned, as we deliver on our robust backlog and execute our services growth strategy.","Core earnings per share guidance for 2017 is set to be between $9.10 and $9.30 per share. Our 2017 commercial airplane revenue guidance is between $62.5 billion and $63.5 billion. As we have previously discussed, this is largely based on deliveries ramping up on the 737 program offset by the lower 777 volume. In all, BCA is expected to deliver between 760 and 765 airplanes. Commercial airplanes operating margin guidance is between 9.5% and 10% on an improved operating performance that more than offset the impact of the lower 777 volume","We continue to assess the implementation of the next 787 rate increase that is currently scheduled to ramp up 14 per month at the end of the decade. A production decision could impact 2017 BCA margins but this is largely bounded within the guidance range we provided.","Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2017 is between $28 billion and $29 billion, reflecting the defense spending environment and lower planned C-17 deliveries.","Operating margins guidance at our defense business is approximately 11.5% reflecting continued productivity efforts as our team work to offset the lower volume. We expect to research and development spending to be relatively flat year-over-year in 2017 at approximately $3.6 billion, with about 75% related to BCA, primarily driven by plan increases in 777X development, while BDS continues to invest in key strategic opportunities.","Consistent with prior years and given the seasonality of our business, as we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be the lowest of the year. Core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full-year earnings and 1Q cash flow is forecasted to be near breakeven, again driven by the timing of receipts and expenditures.","Turning to 2018, let me provide you some brief insight. We focused on delivering on our backlog and continue to aggressively drive productivity, which supports our outlook for 2018. We are expecting growth in key financial metrics for 2018; growth in revenue, deliveries, BCA and BDS operating margins, core earnings per share, and finally operating cash flow.","Furthermore as we discussed over the remainder of the decade, we continue to expect to see revenue earnings cash flow growth as we execute on the robust backlog, including the 787 production rate ramp, improve 787 cash generation, capture further working capital efficiencies, further implement our services growth strategy and deliver on enterprise-wide productivity efforts.","With that, I'll now turn it back over to Dennis for some final thoughts.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thanks Greg. In retrospect, with solid fourth quarter results and focus on meeting customer commitments, we now put 2016 in the books as a year of solid core operating performance, record cash flow and healthy return to our shareholders. Furthermore we continue to de-risk our business and our advance strategies for sustaining our leadership in the aerospace industry, and overall place as enduring global industrial champion.","As we look to 2017, we are intensely focused on profitable long-term growth, disciplined execution of production and development programs, expanding our services business and improving quality and productivity across the enterprise. Our priorities are to continue leveraging the unique competitive advantage we have in operating as one Boeing; building strength on strength to deliver on our existing plans and commitments; and to stretch beyond those plans by sharpening and accelerating our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts.","We are giving clear and consistent attention to the profitable ramp up in commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our Defense and Space business, growing services, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which is to position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth and to create increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.","Now with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder in the interest of time, we are asking that you limit yourself to one single part question. [OperatorInstructions]. And we\u2019ll go to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. Good morning, Dennis and Greg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning, Howard.","Howard Rubel","Dennis sometimes I might call you the chief salesman and sometimes I want to be always worried about risk. And so could you help us walk through a little bit of some of the opportunities you have to improve operating performance? We saw a little bit in commercial in Q4 with - excluding the charges, some very good operating numbers. But what more can you do going forward or can you provide a little bit more framework as to how we\u2019re going to get to some of the longer term margin goals you\u2019ve talked about?","Dennis Muilenburg","You bet. Howard thanks. That's a very keen focus for us as a team. We are committed as an enterprise, as I said, for the longer run towards the end of the decade getting to mid-teens margins for our business. You see us stepping in that direction as we head more deeply into double-digit margins in the coming year. Exclusive of the tanker charge that we took this past quarter, you'll see that reflected in the underlying performance as well. So we see signs of progress with more work to do.","We have a comprehensive program in place to drive productivity, quality and safety throughout the enterprise. This includes our Lean and Capturing the Value of Quality Initiative. It includes an initiative around our Partnering for Success effort with our suppliers. We anticipate additional investments and our development program excellence initiative will pay off, and albeit we took at tanker charge in the fourth quarter.","It's very clear that we are driving risk to closure on that program and our development program excellence efforts are paying off. We see that reflected for example in the 737 MAX program, which is delivering on schedule and on cost, actually a bit ahead of schedule. So that comprehensive investment in productivity efforts is really important to us. I can tell you we are committed to it at the leadership level and it's in the culture of our company, and our people are committed to it.","In addition to those initiatives, we are also driving longer term investments around things like second century design and manufacturing, bringing additional automation and technology capabilities into our manufacturing facilities. And also as we invest in services, we anticipate that our services business would be accretive to margins as we grow that business.","So look at this as a comprehensive well-defined program. It's across the enterprise. We are leveraging all of Boeing's capacity to do that and we are committed to driving productivity and quality in everything we do, and in the end you're going to see that show up at the bottom line. You'll see it in margins and you\u2019ll see it in earnings and cash performance.","Howard Rubel","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Good morning guys.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Greg, couple of accounting housekeeping, and a question for you, Dennis. On the accounting, Greg, when do you hit another 100 unit block on the 876 costs? Presumably that has an impact on the deferred production. And additionally with all this moving around, are we going to get program accounting disclosures on the 777 at some point? And then question for Dennis, I hate to put it so bluntly, but we've clearly had a series of charges on the tanker program at this point and I'm just sort of wondering are we to the point where you can draw line in the sand and say you think you\u2019ve got it appropriately bounded, or I just want to get kind of take your temperature on, is the bad news fully behind you at this point? Thanks guys.","Dennis Muilenburg","Greg, you would take the first question?","Greg Smith","Yes, sure. Yes, we break into that next block in the summer timeframe, Carter, and obviously as we move forward, that's obviously helps our overall margin. There is mix obviously. There is supplier step-down and then there is learning curve. I would say with our - from an internal perspective, team is doing a great job. And when I say doing a great job, Charleston, Seattle working together focused on unit over unit improvement, sharing best practices. Teams are very engaged and really again on a daily cadence work package by work package, so certainly a lot of work to do, but they are doing a terrific job there. And then again we've got the other elements that will help overall, so kind of in that summer timeframe.","On the 777, we\u2019ll go through that disclosure as we get closer to delivery and the accounting block size and so on, so we still got quite a bit of time before we get into that.","Dennis Muilenburg","Okay. And Carter to your second question on tanker, like you, we are disappointed with the tanker charge we took in the fourth quarter but it's well understood and defined. I will say that the nature of the risk on the program is clearly changing as expected and we moved now from the development program into the initial production program.","Last year we were talking about key development risks, flight test risks. And you'll recall that we had to work through some challenges on the refueling boom just to give you a sense of the progress there that new boom is now been flown clear throughout the envelope. We've completed all of the boom envelope testing as part of the development program and we've closed out that risk. We've got five aircraft in-flight test. We've completed more than 1,500 hours of flight testing and we are steadily knocking out test points every day. So while we still have flight testing to go, it's very clear now that we are not discovering new technical risks. It's now about getting the first 18 aircrafts delivered.","The charge we took in the fourth quarter was around the previously defined configuration changes, the wiring changes that you'll recall from last year, now implementing those at the detail level in the initial production aircraft. That work is down. It's well-defined. We have some job categories that are just taking longer than planned in terms of hours per job, and that's what you see in the charge in the quarter. This is not new work. It's well understood. It's very clear to us that the risk is closing out and we are going to drive at the closure and begin delivering tankers this year.","So we are in the final stages of doing that. Then we'll move fully into the full production program. We're working very closely with an air force customer, very strong relationship. Their confident in the long-term strength of the program, and I think it's again important for us just to step back and understand while the development program has been challenging, this is a great long-term franchise program and we expect this to be 400-plus aircraft in the long run, and it will go for decades. It will be a great airplane for our customers and will be good business for Boeing.","Carter Copeland","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. So your fourth quarter commercial margins, if we back out the tanker charge, really looked quite good. Could you give us a little bit more color regarding any block changes, any catch-up adjustments, so where were period expenses, all of those issues? Thanks.","Greg Smith","Yes. Sure, Cai. Look, there was no block extensions. There is actually a contraction on the 777 as we brought that rate down. So overall margins, there was improvement there and then taking into account of course again the 777 rate change. And we did have some favorable period expense. I would equate certainly not all of it, Cai, but a lot of it to a lot of affordability action taking place as we've talked about and some of that taken hold in the fourth quarter and us being able to bring that to the bottom line. So I wouldn't say it was one single thing. Again it was across the board on product as well as support, and even on G&A as well. So team did a great job with a very strong finish to the year.","Dennis Muilenburg","Cai, just adding a little color to that. As Greg said, this focus on driving competitiveness and affordability at the team level, really proud of the progress our team is making and our team understands the connection between driving affordability and margins and our ability to invest in the future and win in the marketplace. And we know we are in a competitive marketplace. Our team is focused on winning, and you can see all of the drive on competitiveness is showing up in increasing margin performance, that allow us to invest for the future. So that dynamic is clearly owned at the team level and that some of the energy you see in the numbers.","Cai Von Rumohr","Thank you.","Dennis Muilenburg","You're welcome.","Operator","Next we go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Thank you. Good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Hi Doug.","Doug Harned","Dennis, in November you made two very important moves. One, naming the first outsider that I\u2019m aware of to lead BCA, and then standing up the new services unit. First, can you point to things that Kevin McAllister may be doing that will be different for BCA? And then for these services unit, it's not in guidance, but how large do you expect that unit to be for our commercial in the sense and what kind of growth do you expect see over the next three to five years?","Dennis Muilenburg","Doug, thanks for the questions. On the first one regarding Kevin and we are very, very pleased to have Kevin on our team. And as you know, as I\u2019ve told you many times, one of the most important investments we make is our investment in leadership and talent. Now I will say, although Kevin has come into us from outside of Boeing, he has been a very close partner for many, many years, understands Boeing well, great fit with our culture. He has been close partner during his time at GE, and that's been a seamless transition for us.","That said, I think it's also healthy for us as we build our team for the future to have both internal and external candidates and teammates. And Kevin coming in with some new lives and fresh views and new ideas, I think there is synergy to be had there and already we\u2019re seeing that in our team. The combination of some of the ideas we already had, some new ideas and approaches that Kevin is bringing to the table is going to make us better as a team, better as a company. So I'm pleased with that.","And then with Ray Conner\u2019s help, again the whole transition in ensuring that goes very smoothly with our customers and with Ray\u2019s mentorship further just accelerating Kevin's ramp up in the company. So I'm proud of that and we are going to continue to invest in our team.","To your point on services, yes, that was a big strategic move for us. As we said for some time, we are looking at and targeting services growth for the long run. And as we've valuated our options and the investments we're making, we thought one of the key strategic steps was to create an integrated services business whose number one job every day is to serve our customers and grow our services business. That's in combination with the other investments we're making in both organic and inorganic growth in growing our parts business, growing our mods and upgrades business and growing our data analytics business. It's all part of a holistic services growth strategy.","We'll have that unit fully up and operating in the third quarter of this year. At that point we\u2019ll begin showing you the integrated financials for that unit. But we expect that to be one of our fastest growing businesses going forward. And as we've told you, we've put a longer term target out here to make that $50 billion a year services business and we've got a lot of work to grow it to be that capacity, but we are focused on a strategy to enable that. We are putting the building blocks in place today. And you'll see when we roll that business out fully in the third quarter that it's already a healthy strong business but a lot of upside to grow.","We see services as a $2.5 trillion marketplace over the next 10 years. Today we have about 7% market share in commercial services and about 9% market share in defense services, so we believe there is plenty of market space to grow, and by attacking that market as a one Boeing entity and integrated services strategy with the right cost structure and the right capabilities to pursue it, we think we\u2019ll be successful in growing market share and growing within overall market that's also expanding.","Doug Harned","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Ken Herbert","Hi, good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Herbert","Hi, I wanted to ask Dennis about the defense market. It looks like when you back out C-17 revenues you had in \u201816, you\u2019re flat to down slightly in \u201817. Maybe clearly in the last couple of months both with the election, the backdrop seems to have improved. It seems like you're getting more traction with F-18 and some other programs. Two questions on it really. First, has the outlook changed post \u201817 for maybe the top line on the defense business and how are you thinking about growth of that business now? And then second, at what point do you start to feel a need to maybe start to accelerate investments in that side of the business to perhaps capture some of the more emerging opportunities?","Dennis Muilenburg","You bet. Well, first of all, we see our defense business as a healthy core business today and albeit our guidance for 2017 is down a bit on revenue based on planned delivery rates and see \u201817 coming down, longer term we still expect moderate - low to moderate top line growth in our defense business. That's been our projection previously, and we continue to see the defense business as a healthy moderate top line growth business.","We are also investing to continue to drive bottom line performance and you see that in the underlying margin performance in that business getting well into the double-digit margin range. So that's allowing us to invest for the future.","Now when we look ahead, I would say that we see some signs that are strengthening our prospects in the defense market. We think domestically we are seeing some additional strength on the underlying defense budget, alternatives to sequestration which we fully support. So we anticipate seeing some strengthening defense budget domestically. We also see continuing high demand internationally for our products and we believe the products that we have, both today and the ones we are investing in, provide a great capability cost match for our customers, leading edge capabilities at best value, and that spans commercial derivatives, satellites, fighters, helicopters, our services business and more broadly our human space exploration business.","We intend to lead in those business sectors and we are investing accordingly. To those future investments, as you alluded to, some key opportunities right in front of us including T-X and JSTARS as examples, places where we are investing and leveraging across the Boeing enterprise. So we see our defense and space business today as a healthy core business. It's got some upside potential. We see some strengthening signals in the market and we are investing for the future to both grow top and bottom line.","Ken Herbert","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hi, good morning everyone.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hi Noah.","Noah Poponak","I wanted to ask on 787 demand. The average annual new order number there has been - it's been 50 on average for, I guess, six or seven years now post financial crisis. And so I wonder if we should start to think of that as a trend or not, and with running deliveries closer to 140, if you were to have that gap for a few more years, the backlog that still looks sizable would wind down fairly quickly mathematically. And so I'm not asking if it's your base case, but I just wonder if there is any discussion in your internal scenario analysis about backing off that supply level or keeping a safer coverage in case demand stays here, or do you have a substantial reason to believe that order pace picks up pretty soon?","Dennis Muilenburg","Noah, first of all, I think it's important to note that operating at 12 a month - right now we\u2019re at record production rates for wide-body program and the program is running well and you see it showing up the numbers in terms of the efficiency of the program. We are very confident in the underlying operations of the program and confident that 12 per month rate structure","As you noted, we currently have a backlog at 700 787s. Now orders will vary year-to-year but we have 700 aircraft in backlog. And our confidence in being able to continue to operate at 12 a month is high. We are currently evaluating our decision around going to a 14 month rate towards the end of the decade. As always, we\u2019re going to be very disciplined on that decision. We are going to make sure that we match supply and demand. And while we've had some 787 sales, as I mentioned earlier, we still have more work to do to fill up the profile to 14 a month. But those are slots now what we are looking at filling towards the end of the decade. So we remain very confident in the 787 line and our current rate, and we'll make a disciplined decision on 14 a month towards the end of the decade.","The other thing to remember is longer term outlook is a 20-year market outlook. Within our 39,000 aircraft that we see in our current market outlook, 9,000 of those are wide bodies. That is a significant wide-body replacement cycle in the coming decade, early in the next decade and we had the 787 and the 777 families very well positioned for that upcoming replacement cycle.","So all of those lead us to a great confidence in the 787 line. We are going to continue to drive productivity and efficiency into that line that will further drive our competitiveness in the marketplace that we can win going forward.","Noah Poponak","I agree the 700 looks sizable for sure. I was just - just back on the envelope, if you thought about 150 deliveries depending on where you're between 12 and 14 and 50 orders, it's 100 unit annual gap, the 700 could come down pretty quickly. I guess do you have visibility into 50 - that 50 pace changing in the near to medium term?","Dennis Muilenburg","As I said that orders tend to move our around year-to-year and so don't take any one year and try to draw a trend line. Our customers will buy in cycles and you will see year-to-year variation in order volume on 787. On a wide-body production, 700 aircraft in backlog, at current production rates it\u2019s more than four years of backlog. That is a very strong position to be in. And the 787, especially now as we are getting ready to roll out the dash 10 is extremely well-positioned in the marketplace. It is the most efficient airplane in the marketplace clearly in that seat range and we are very confident of our ability to compete and win in the marketplace, and we are going to continue to drive affordability progress again internally to make us even more competitive.","Noah Poponak","Terrific.","Greg Smith","I think when the dash 10 gets into the marketplace, that's even going to put more confidence in that product line.","Dennis Muilenburg","You got it.","Greg Smith","And I think the other thing that Dennis alluded to, this airplane has opened up 130 new markets either planned routes or ones that are already being executed. This thing is a differentiator obviously in the marketplace. Our job is to ensure that we invest in that program like we are in the dash 10 and continue to lead in this segment of the market as the 787 has, and I think that demonstrated in the 700 airplanes that are in backlog. So we got a great machine here and we are focused on the day-to-day execution getting the dash 10 up to rate, getting to the market, get in the hands of our customer and we think they are going to love it.","Noah Poponak","That\u2019s great. Hey Greg, would you tell us what's in the 2017 cash guide for change in working capital?","Greg Smith","Change in\u2026","Noah Poponak","For change in total working capital?","Greg Smith","Improvements in working capital in \u201817, that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting. It\u2019s modest.","Noah Poponak","It\u2019s modest?","Greg Smith","Yes.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Greg Smith","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky","Good morning. Greg, just a quick clarification on the tanker. Can you just let us know whether the cash burn on that is - the peak of that is still in front of us, or if it\u2019s now behind us given all the charges that you\u2019ve taken? And then Dennis, can you just provide us maybe a comprehensive update on the 777X program? What milestones have you hit thus far? What\u2019s still in front of us, and how much of the risk on that program is retired at this point? Thanks guys.","Greg Smith","Yes, on the tanker cash, yes, \u201816 \u201817 is the primary burn and then we'll be cash flow positive later in \u201818.","Dennis Muilenburg","And then on 777X, we\u2019re continuing to march smartly through the development program. Development continues to be right on track. We are making the right capital investments upfront. As you are well aware, we recently opened a Composite Wing Center in Everett and getting ourselves in position to manufacture the fourth generation composite wing for that airplane. We are also pulling ahead some of the manufacturing technology to de-risk it in the current 777 line, again to get us ready for a smart and efficient ramp up of the 777X.","The development program itself is going well. We\u2019re right now working through a detailed design. We'll be completing our critical program review this year. We'll begin working our way through assembly. So you saw we\u2019re already beginning to build parts for the 777X. We'll get into final assembly in 2018 and we continue to be on track for entry into service in 2020, so feeling very good about the program. It's on track. Clearly we have work to do yet to get it to the finish line. But all signals here are the investments we've made in development program excellence are paying off and we are confident that when the airplane comes to the marketplace it's going to be high value airplane for our customers. We've seen very strong performance in all of the testing that\u2019s underway and then the production system preparation is also on track and we are confident that we'll be ready to ramp up.","Jason Gursky","Right. And the first flight is first half of \u201818 or second half? I mean...","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, flight test is scheduled to begin in 2018.","Jason Gursky","Okay, so towards the tail end of the year. Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hi. Thanks. Little more on 777X. How are you thinking about - or are you thinking about maybe extending or even deepening some of the discounting to the extent maybe a little more stability in the backlog given you\u2019ve got, I think it's almost 80% of your customers of the ME3 carriers whose results are obviously continue to weaken. So is there a concern maybe not just from the lack of order activity in general but a lack of diversification of the skyline. Are you willing to maybe buy a little bit of backlog and exchange for some longer term stability as you ramp?","Dennis Muilenburg","The key thing here is right now we are focused on filling the bridge from 777 to 777X. We do have 320 777Xs in our firm backlog and commitments with our customers. So our 777X skyline is in very good shape in terms of our production ramp up. Our key focus right now is at filling the bridge and that includes the finalizing those 777-300 ER sales through the bridge.","We are seeing the airplane pricing moving up recently low in the marketplace. It's competitive, but not unusual and we have a number of campaigns underway with our customers to fill those remaining bridge slots. We think we've made the right decisions to balance demand and supply. As we said, we are stepping down to a production rate of five per month in August of this year. That effectively sets the floor for the production program. Against that profile, we are about 90% sold out in 2018 and 2019.","Now again we still have work to do to fill those slots but the value proposition of the airplane is clear. Our customers recognize it, and we're just going to continue working on those campaigns to finish filling out those slots and move smartly into the 777X production ramp up.","Hunter Keay","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. Quick one for Greg. Greg, I think the dash 10 start to fall into the production stream in the quarter. Just curious if you can size the drag that had on the deferred production improvement, which was pretty good in and of itself, so just curious if there was a drag? And then Dennis on the broader guidance, kind of got an accustom to a healthy dose of conservatism early in the year with unlock through the course of the year. Would you characterize this guidance in \u201817 as different than prior years? If so, is it because of the risk profile or am I mischaracterizing it?","Dennis Muilenburg","Greg, you would take first?","Greg Smith","Yes, dash 10 didn't have a significant impact on deferred in the quarter, Myles. Obviously team is doing a great job getting that thing implemented into production system and frankly it's coming together very well. So it hasn't been a big drag and I don't expect it to do have significant. Now quarter-over-quarter as you know that there is going to be ins and outs on the deferred, but overall we expect to continue to improve that going forward with the dash 10 ramping up as well.","Dennis Muilenburg","And Myles to your second question, our approach to our guidance is the same. Same process, same approach. We take a diligent look at our business plans in the marketplace and how we expect to perform, and you see that reflect in our numbers. So I would say our fundamental approach hasn't changed at all. That said, when you look at the numbers that we've guided to and you see the strength of those numbers both in terms of EPS and cash, I think that reflects the underlying confidence we have in the business.","As we've mentioned to all of you previously, we are on a solid growth trajectory in an aerospace sector that\u2019s healthy. We have the right plans and products in place, and we are prepared to ramp up our commercial airplane production as we delivered in the mid-700 aircraft this year, we are guiding to higher deliveries in the coming year and we still expect that towards the end of the decade, we are going to be well north of 900 aircraft per year.","On top of that, we are going our services business and we are selectively growing our defense business. So all of that gives us top line strength. We combine that with our backlog that's allowing us to make the investments to drive bottom-line performance. We see that reflected in our EPS guidance. You see it reflected in our cash guidance. And as we told you before, our expectation is that this is a year-over-year cash growth business and our guidance reflects that confidence.","Myles Walton","Thanks guys.","Operator","Next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Thanks for the time. Just a question on the 787 side. Greg, you made a comment about a production decision this year going to 14 a month and how that could impact that 9.5% to 10% margin in BCA. Just some color here on how to think about that? And then just relating to the 787. Any color on how to think about the deferred trajectory? Through the year you gave some good commentary before, I guess, last year, so just something similar there?","Greg Smith","Yes, quarter-over-quarter we expect the furred to improve and really again, Rajeev, falls into those again three major categories obviously improved unit performance in our factories but that supplier step-down I mentioned on a question earlier that we'll move into that next block in the summer timeframe and that will be favorable.","Quarter-over-quarter, again you're going to see delivery mix impacting there but all that will be more than offset of just continued improvement quarter-over-quarter on deferred. And then of course, as I mentioned, mix, so getting that dash 10 in smoothly as it has and replicating how we did that at dash 9 is exactly the game plan everybody is working to, so that\u2019s key in there and we are assuming all that goes as it has been going per plan and that will all translate into deferred.","Now I would tell you stepping back from that, obviously big focus on cash improvement overall on the program and certainly deferred is a key part of that. So making our deliveries on all models on-time and ensuring that we are executing at that level on top of the overall productivity. The advances of associated with our current delivery rates at 12 a month and beyond, so all every element of, say, cash flow is being actively managed quarter-over-quarter, and obviously we broke - we\u2019re cash flow positive last year and we are going to be even more so this year. And that it's really all in those elements that are driving to that bottom line performance.","Rajeev Lalwani","I\u2019m sorry, Greg, the other part to the question was just - you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you made a comment about how making a decision on going 14 a month could impact on margins for this year. So just some color there?","Greg Smith","Yes. We put that in the range of the guide. Obviously we are assuming at this point that we go to 14 if the market supports that, going to 14. But as we - we don't have to make the formal decision yet, so as we get closer to that we\u2019ll continue to monitor the marketplace, filling those unsold positions and then look at, I\u2019ll say more over a longer term until may make that formal decision, so that's why we put a range in there to try to take that into account if we decided to hold that 12 a month at least for the near-term.","Dennis Muilenburg","It\u2019s founded in the guidance, and as always, we are going to make a very disciplined decision here. It's in our mutual interest to make sure we are aligning supply and demand and keeping the production system healthy while supporting our customers.","Troy Jeffrey Lahr","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","And that will be from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yes, good morning, Dennis, Greg. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning, Peter.","Peter Arment","First, just a clarification. Did you mention what the expectation is around MAX deliveries this year? And then second part of this question is just more - Greg, how you\u2019re thinking about the sensitivity in the backlog when you're thinking about in terms of customers, particularly I'm thinking EM with the move we've seen in the dollar and expectations with given the policies that are going to be going forward that we may see a further strengthening. How you think about that? Thanks Greg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Peter, maybe I'll take the first one, and Greg you take the second one.","Greg Smith","Sure.","Dennis Muilenburg","On MAX deliveries, as we said, the flight test program remains on track. We announced that we are going to begin delivering aircraft in the first half of this year and we are on track to deliver our first MAX in the second quarter of 2017. So we feel very confident and the airplane is performing well, and we are on track to begin deliveries this year.","For the remainder of the year as we ramp up the production system, the MAX will end up being about 10% to 15% of the total 737 deliveries this year, so a meaningful portion but a fraction as we begin ramping up. Our team is doing a great job in the factory and renting to make sure that we continue to deliver NGs while we ramp up the MAX. The production line preparation is on track. And again, you can see that in the underlying performance of the 737 program.","So we remain very confident in that program. The market is strong. The airplane is selling well. Flight test is on track and we'll begin delivering airplanes here in the first half of the year.","Greg Smith","Yes, and with regards to the backlog, Peter, certainly something that we look at and analyze from multiple, I'll say, angles as we assess the backlog and look for any potential areas that may be of softness and what mitigation plan. So we really try to get ahead of that if we have any of that and we'll get customers around within the skyline but certainly it\u2019s their first and foremost sustain really engage with your customer and understanding what their fleet plans are and specific timelines around deliveries. And we are going to continue to do that, and if we see any changes, then - well, I'll say we\u2019ll change accordingly, but we are not seeing anything at this point that is, I'd say, anything outside the norm of what you all have seen of where we've got, as we talked about and particularly wide-body areas of softness. So we know where they are and we are deeply engaged and we'll make - back to Dennis\u2019s point, we'll make the right decisions if we have to around supply and demand as we phase into those.","Peter Arment","I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Greg Smith","You're welcome.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I\u2019ll now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Tom Downey","Thank you. We'll continue now with the questions for Dennis and Greg. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our Media Relations team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we are ready for the first question. And in the interest of time, we ask again that you limit everyone to just one question please.","Operator","And we'll go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hi Julie.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Julie Johnsson","Dennis, could you discuss your strategy for China, especially with some of the rhetoric we've heard and the possibility of trade tensions rising. Trump last year on the campaign trail took a shot or two at the 737 finishing center and also warned potentially of hiring being affected in the U.S. Where do plans stand at this point and are you still committed to moving forward?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Julie, great question. First of all, I think it's really important for all of us to understand that healthy trade relationships between the U.S. and China are important. I'm very confident that the incoming administration understands that. Mr. Trump - President Trump is very much engaged with business. We've had the privilege of having a very open dialogue with him on business issues, and all of the actions that are being taken around things like tax reform, regulatory reform, focus on trade policy, those are all things that are going to allow us to grow economically and ultimately allow us to grow and add manufacturing capacity in the U.S. So we are very supportive of those actions, very confident that those are headed in the right direction and being done with the right tone and tenor.","Now regarding China itself, that relationship continues to be very important. I know we all understand that a productive and healthy relationship with China is key. It will be grounded in principles of fair trade and a level-playing field for all competitors. If I look at the marketplace, it's a commercial airplane marketplace 39,000 plus aircraft over the next 20 years. About 6,800 of those are in China. And so it is important that we'd be able to compete and win in China and to be a partner there as they grow their aerospace industry. It's a highly competitive environment, and so actions that are being taken to ensure U.S. competitiveness are positive actions and we support those. So we are going to continue to work hard in that direction.","Regarding our China finishing center, again that's an important part of that partnership equation here. That finishing center is at location what will be able to add value in China but every airplane that goes to that finishing center is being built here in the U.S. and this is a great example of by making the right targeted investments in China with our partners there, we are able to add volume, increase sales in China. As we increase sales in China, we increase building airplanes here in the U.S. and that's U.S. manufacturing jobs. It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.","And if I could even more broadly on the aerospace front, if you look at global trade, the aerospace sector continues to be the strongest sector in the United States in terms of trade balance with a positive trade balance of more than $80 billion per year. Boeing is a big part of that. We\u2019re the U.S.\u2019s biggest exporter, and within that, we in our supply chain have more than 13,000 companies in the United States create and sustain about 1.5 million aerospace jobs. So aerospace is a big important manufacturing sector for the U.S. Global competitiveness will help us drive that in the long run and a healthy U.S. China trade policy and relationship is an enabler for growing U.S. manufacturing jobs.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron","Good morning, everyone. I think I can support a theme developing amongst our questions this morning. Dennis given you\u2019re in the business of providing affordable solutions for the new administration as indeed as predecessor, how do you discuss the border security at all with the president, and do you think there is anything from good old days to be eying it [ph] from yester year that you can harvest for the current initiatives being discussed?","Dennis Muilenburg","That's not an area that we are currently actively pursuing. Again, when and if the government has some opportunities there where they need some assistance, we are happy to provide some technologies and capabilities. We do have some very low-cost affordable and effective autonomous system solutions, unmanned aircraft, things like the ScanEagle which have been used very effectively throughout the world for a variety of surveillance purposes. Those are the kind of capabilities that are available as we look to future solutions. And we are standing by the support where we can any U.S. government decisions that are made along that path.","Operator","Next question is from Patti Waldmeir with the Financial Times. Please go ahead.","Patti Waldmeir","Yes. You\u2019ve spoken a little bit about what kind of changes we might expect in the Trump era, tax reform, et cetera. Can I ask you a little bit of what it's like to actually operate in this new environment where the Dow breaks 20,000 because there is optimism about what Mr. Trump would do for business environment, and at the same time we never know when the next suite is going to come out of Leftfield [ph]. What word or phrase would you choose to describe your mood in the current environment? This is for Dennis.","Dennis Muilenburg","Firstly, the Trump has clearly very focused on enacting policies that will grow the U.S. economy and grow our American jobs, and we are very supportive of that. So I'm encouraged by his engagement. His approach to engaging business, having an open dialogue, discussing the issues, finding solutions, finding ways to grow U.S. manufacturing jobs I think are all very positive. And that engagement is a productive approach. We welcome it. We've got a voice at the table. And as we move forward on things like tax reform, regulatory reform, defense budget strength, trade policy, creating jobs, investing in manufacturing for the future, things like the Exim Bank, all of those are big enablers for us. And I think the direct engagement and the open dialogue is very healthy. We very much support it and I\u2019m encouraged about what it means for future economic growth and growth of the aerospace sector.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Dan Catchpole with the Everett Herald. Please go ahead.","Dan Catchpole","Hey gentleman. Thanks for taking my call here or my question. I was wondering if [Technical Difficulty] your reliance on global supply chain, if America - Trump\u2019s focus on America first economics will affect your ability to procure components and materials, and if there is any changes that you're making in terms of procurement and supply chain relationships ahead of the potential effects.","Dennis Muilenburg","We don't see any big changes here. The key thing to understand in our business model while we have a global supply chain and those partnerships are very important to us and we\u2019ll continue to invest in those partnerships, in the end is our products come together and we do final assembly, 90% of our final products base is built here in the U.S. and then delivered around the world. And that's a very strong example of leveraging our global supply base while producing U.S.-based products. And that strength is going to continue going forward.","We see the aerospace sector as fundamentally having an advantage in that regard. We do have a global supply chain, but in the end, 90% of our Boeing employment is here in the U.S. and we deliver about 75% of our product base to customers outside of the U.S. That's a big reason we have a strong contribution to a trade balance in the aerospace sector, as I said before, north of $80 billion a year favorable trade balance and Boeing is a big part of that. We\u2019re the U.S.\u2019s biggest exporter and we leverage those global supply chains to create the world\u2019s greatest airplanes and it\u2019s advantageous not only for our global partners. It's also advantageous for growing U.S. manufacturing jobs.","Operator","Our next question is from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alwyn Scott","Hi. Dennis and Greg, can you hear me all right?","Greg Smith","Yes.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes.","Alwyn Scott","Great. So productivity gains you\u2019ve made have clearly been very important in the results in operating performance you\u2019ve shown, but since you\u2019ve probably picked a lot of the low-hanging fruits, can you talk about what we can expect in terms of additional cost savings at this point, and where do you see that happening? Is it new processes? Is it automation? Is it labor reduction? Is it more supplier price cuts through Partnering for Success? What\u2019s your view on that going ahead? If you can pretty specific, that would be helpful.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, let me start and maybe Greg you can add onto that. I would say this is - this will be a relentless effort going forward. So our work on affordability and productivity while we've made some strong strides over the last couple of years, you see it reflected in the performance, we have much more ahead of us than what's behind us and I don't see this effort losing any steam any momentum. In fact I see a great deal of opportunities ahead of us. Those are both internal and external. Internally we are continuing to look at opportunities to lean out our operations both our factories and office spaces. First-time quality is a key emphasis for us. Our working capital initiative is a key opportunity for us.","With our supply chain, working as partners under our Partnering for Success initiative, our value engineering work, where we are finding win-win solutions with our supply base still much more opportunity under Partnering for Success ahead of us than what's behind us. So while we've made some good initial strides, I would say those are initial steps with an expectation that there is much more still ahead of us, and that's what drives our expectation that we are headed towards those mid-teen double-digit margins towards the end of the decade and driving year-over-year cash performance.","Greg, anything you want to add?","Greg Smith","Yes, I think as part of that, obviously we are resetting the bar of where we want to be in near-term and long-term and going - getting some market-based of, say, affordability targets put in place that not only are in our markets but also looking at, what I would call or we would call, top quartile industrial and working on how can we learn from that whether its own program cost or even functions as we look across functions in Boeing, how do we compare with those companies sharing best practices. And all of that combined with a lot of things that Dennis said, that's what's going to fuel our - that\u2019s what\u2019s going to allow us to win the marketplace. That's what's going to fuel our investments. That's what's going to allow us to return cash to shareholders.","So that combination of efforts is definitely accelerated, but at the same time bringing an outside in perspective combined with our inside knowledge and how do we leverage the best not only at Boeing but even outside of Boeing and bring that rate to the bottom line and that's - again, that's what's going to allow us to win, be competitive in the market and that's what's going to allow us to continue to invest in this business and drive a lot of the employment numbers that Dennis talked about it. So it's a unique portfolio we have here with regards to what gets made here, and the technology and the amount of investments we make in technology here in the U.S. and exporting 75% of our product outside. And that would continue to be our focus going forward and we've got a big market to plan and we are focused on capturing all the shares that we can capture in that market and deliver value back to all of our stakeholders.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Farley with KING Television. Please go ahead.","Glenn Farley","So how are you guys doing this morning?","Dennis Muilenburg","Hi Glenn.","Glenn Farley","So my question is with all the push that we are getting from the new administration on buying American, do you fear a protection as backlash from countries like China that do want to build their own aerospace industry in other places?","Dennis Muilenburg","Glenn, again we take a look at the actions that are being taken here. This is all about helping business be successful, growing the economy and we know in the global business that we operate in, as we grow our business here in the U.S., it provides lift around the world as well. That's the nature of our aerospace business. And it is a bit of a unique business in terms of its structure, and the fact that - again as Greg and I had both said, with around 90% of our employment here in the U.S., yet we export 75% of our products, we create a tremendous volume and strength in our U.S. business base and economic value that we add here.","That said, as we deliver airplanes and we enable global travel and global cargo delivery, it drives overall economic growth around the globe as well. And the administration is very focused on ensuring that we are implementing pro-business actions and policies and implementing trade agreements that will be fair and ensure U.S, competitiveness. And that's what we look for in our trade agreements is our ability to compete around the world, compete on a level-playing field and when we can compete on the level-playing field, we\u2019ll win, and that will grow our business. It will be good for our customers. It will be good for global economy.","So we are going to continue to engage and work very closely with the administration. Again, we are encouraged by the pro-business agenda. We think it's going to be good for jobs growth. It's going to be good for the economy, and in the end, it's going to be good for the aerospace sector in Boeing.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Ostrower with CNN. Please go ahead.","Jon Ostrower","Good morning guys.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Hey John.","Jon Ostrower","Just a question about DNA of Boeing right now. Dennis, you\u2019ve been on the job for 18 months and you\u2019ve had a chance to take the rates [ph] and really kind of dig deep into what Boeing is. Your 777 rate went up to 8.3 heading down 50% to 3.5 on deliveries. You've got, what looks like a very, very small, almost under-investment from an airline perspective on 737 MAX-10 with an expected huge investment coming on NMA. I\u2019m really curious, as you look to again more huge production ramp ups on the 737 towards the end of the decade, how do you see the cyclicality of Boeing internally, and is expenses on keeping a stable business? And whether or not you\u2019ve thought about how to engineer that out of your company and really whether or not there is any steps you\u2019re taking with Kevin in his new leadership role to think about cyclicality internally in a different way?","Dennis Muilenburg","Jon, the way I look at that is we are designing and implementing a long-term sustained growth business. We\u2019re in a fundamentally different position today than we've been in anywhere in the first century of Boeing. And today we have north of 5,700 aircraft in backlog and a composite level of six to seven years production rate. It's the most highly diversified backlog we've ever had with two-thirds of that backlog outside of the U.S. and Europe. We have a strong fundamental defense and space business as well with some increasing market prospects there. So that combination allows us to have a much longer term view and design the business to have sustained long-term growth rather than being a tight cyclical business. This is the longest term backlog that we've ever had by far, so we have a much longer term view of how we design our business.","We are also very mindful of the risks and now with this kind of backlog that we have in position, we can look out a little farther and think about our investments and make sure that we're matching supply and demand that's why we\u2019ve been very diligent on our rate decisions, so that those are sustainable rate decisions.","And then making the right investments for the future rather than having a choppy profile in our R&D investments, we have a very well-defined smooth profile. So just as we are now ramping up the MAX and delivering it on schedule, we are getting to the heart of the 777X development program now feathered in very nicely on the backside of MAX. We are contemplating decisions on our next generation of product lines both defense and commercial, and those investments again will continue to dovetail very nicely on the backside of 777X.","So we have a long-term investment profile that will drive innovation and drive stability in our financial structure, combined that with a strong backlog and diligence on our production rate decisions, this is all designed to be a long-term sustained growth business top line and bottom line.","Tom Downey","Operator, we have time for one last question from the media.","Operator","And that will be from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Please go ahead.","David Koenig","Thanks. My question was asked and answered, but if I can set goal up something that Financial Times I think was asked, you had said Dennis that you were encouraged by President Trump\u2019s engagement and what he wants to do on taxes and regulation. I\u2019m still curious so what it was like to be the target of critical tweaks and comments about one of your programs, and aren\u2019t you worried that that could happen again that your demand further cost reductions in some of your programs. Can you talk about that?","Dennis Muilenburg","As I said, I'm very encouraged by President Trump\u2019s engagement. And as you noted, we had some targeted discussions, well publicized discussions on things like Air Force One and fighter aircraft. I think those were very productive discussions as well. This is all about making sure we are providing best capability for our government and our war fighters at best affordability best value for our taxpayers, and we are exactly on the same page there.","So whether it's those targeted discussions on programs which I think have been fairly productive or broader discussions on pro-business decisions around trade and tax reform and regulatory reform, those have all been excellent conversations, and I give a lot of credit here to reaching out and directly engaging. President Trump has to have business leaders at the table. He is listening. He is engaging and making decisions that will help us grow the economy and ultimately grow U.S. manufacturing jobs. So I'm encouraged by that dialogue, and I think having direct open dialogue is productive and very good for the future.","Troy Jeffrey Lahr","That concludes our earnings call.

Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy J. Lahr - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's second quarter 2015 earnings call. I'm Troy Lahr, and with me today are Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer; and Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman. After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. We've provided detailed financial information in today's press release, and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussions today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statements disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","W. James McNerney - Chairman","Thank you, Troy, and good morning to everyone. As you all know, in June, our Board of Directors elected Dennis as Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective July 1. The move was the result of a dedicated effort over several years to develop the future leaders of this company, including my successor as CEO. This has always been a top priority. Our aim was a seamless transition and continuity in our business strategy and overall direction, and that's exactly how it's playing out. I look forward to continuing to work with Dennis and Greg from my role as Chairman. In a moment, I'll turn this call and all subsequent ones over to them. But before doing that, let me just say a very few words about where we are as a company at the start of our 100th year, which began July 2015.","These calls tend to have a heavy focus on our performance quarter-to-quarter, and rightfully so. But when you zoom out for a wider perspective, a clear picture emerges of an enterprise that is unified in its mission and purpose to lead the industry. It is as strong as it has ever been financially and is positioned to deliver sustained profitable growth in the years ahead. The commercial, defense and space markets we serve are large and growing at a global level. We have already captured a significant share of that growth in our unprecedented backlog. And unlike many companies, our opportunity is largely organic, and harvesting it rests on our execution, a good place to be.","As we deliver that backlog to customers, we are intensely focused on productivity and profitability to drive increased shareholder returns, and to reinvest in technology and innovation to further strengthen our market leading portfolio of products and services. The board of directors and I are confident that Dennis and the strong team supporting him, including company Vice Chairman, Ray Connor, will succeed in growing our company and serving the interests of our employees, customers and shareholders, communities and other business partners.","With that, let me turn it over to Dennis for a summary of our second quarter results and the business environment. Dennis?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Jim. And Jim, thanks for your leadership over the last 10 years and your continued support and partnership. And good morning, everybody. Let me start by saying, it is a privilege to assume leadership of this great company, and the more than 160,000 talented employees who comprise it. With Jim at the helm over the past decade we developed a winning playbook and set a solid foundation for our future. Our job going forward is to deliver on our existing commitments, build on our strengths and improve where needed to create an even bigger better Boeing in our second century.","Now, let's turn to slide two to discuss the second quarter. Boeing delivered strong second quarter operating performance across our production programs and services businesses with higher revenue on record commercial airplane deliveries. Notably, we also generated significant cash flow totaling $3.3 billion. With this strong cash flow and confidence in our long-term outlook, we continue to make strategic R&D and capital investments and return cash to our shareholders. During the quarter we purchased $2 billion of Boeing stock and paid $625 million in dividends. Year-to-date we have returned nearly $6 billion to our shareholders, which remains a top priority for us under our balanced cash deployment strategy.","As we announced last week, our very strong second quarter operating performance was impacted by $536 million after-tax charge to complete development and hold to the delivery schedule on our KC-46 Tanker program for the U.S. Air Force. That program, as you know, is being developed on a fixed price contract. The increased company investment in that program is primarily driven by required rework on the integrated fuel system that was identified as we prepared for and conducted ground and flight tests and verification of that system during the second quarter.","The integrated fuel system is the last major system to undergo component qualification testing. No new technology is needed to resolve these issues, which are well defined and understood, but that in no way mitigates our disappointment in having to take this charge. Our teams are very focused on executing the plan to meet our commitment to deliver 18 KC-46A Tankers to our Air Force customer by August 2017 and 179 tankers by 2027. To that end we completed initial air-worthiness flight testing in the second quarter, which is a major milestone. And test aircraft number one will return to flight this month, followed by the first flight of aircraft number two yet this summer.","To be clear, though, we do have a lot more work to do as we progress through the remaining ground and flight test phases, but we are on the right path. We also remain confident in the long-term financial value of the tanker program for our company. With a potential market of up to 400 aircraft worth $80 billion, we expect to realize strong returns over decades of production and in-service support.","Now, turning to our core operating performance during the quarter, revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 18% to $16.9 billion on a record 197 deliveries. Among the key milestones in the quarter was the start of wing assembly on the first 737 MAX. We also completed critical design review on the 787-10, validating that the program is on plan to meet its performance, cost and schedule requirements.","Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenue in the second quarter of $7.5 billion on the delivery of 54 aircraft, 2 satellites and healthy volume in our services business. Key contract awards included Qatar purchasing four C-17s and Australia purchasing two C-17s; an international F-15 service contract extension; and for the first time in history NASA awarded a contract for a human space flight mission to a commercial company. In summary, notwithstanding the tanker charge, we delivered another quarter of strong core operating performance, achieved significant program milestones, captured orders totaling $18 billion, and returned significant cash to our shareholders.","With that let's turn to the business environment on slide three. Our overall view of the business environment remains positive due to improving airline profitability and healthy global air traffic. Based on that traffic growth and strong replacement demand, our new long-term commercial market outlook forecasts demand for more than 38,000 commercial aircraft over the next 20 years. That new forecast is up nearly 1,300 aircraft from last year. Customer discussions continue to focus on placing new aircraft orders or accelerating deliveries as indicated by the favorable pace of orders in and around the Paris Air Show and yesterday's decision by FedEx to purchase 50 767 Freighters, with options for 50 more.","Deferral requests continue to run well below the historical average. Demand also remains strong for both the 777 and the 777X. Year-to-date 777 orders and commitments totaled 44, which puts us in solid position to achieve our target of 40 orders to 60 orders a year to bridge production of the 777X. The 777 production line is essentially sold out for 2016, more than half sold out in 2017 and has a healthy number of slots sold firm in 2018. As we've discussed before, the new 777X is scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 timeframe and will leverage new manufacturing technologies and processes that are being proven on the current 777. We continue to assess the most efficient way to phase in this new technology and adapt as necessary to optimize the 777X production system and meet our customer commitments.","On the 787 program, we've now delivered more than 290 airplanes, including 34 787-9s. The airplane's capabilities continue to draw strong interest from airlines around the world, as noted by the order and commitment activity at the Paris Air Show. Production of the 787 is now balanced between the 787-8s and 787-9s, and this is a testament to the progress that the team is making about increasing the 787-9 up to full rate production. In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel efficient 737 MAX also remains high, with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,800 airplanes from 58 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in 2017. We also continue to see upward pressure on narrow-body production rates beyond the announced 52 per month in 2018. However, we remain steadfast in our financial discipline as we assess production rate changes.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid support for our major programs. Congress has been supportive of the President's fiscal year 2016 budget request, which increases core Boeing production programs, such as the P-8A Poseidon, the Apache and Chinook helicopters. Additionally, all four defense oversight committees have added 12 F\/A-18 variant aircraft to their budget proposals.","Year-over-year budget increases have also been supported by Congress for development programs, such as tanker, long-range strike and commercial crew, though in some cases, at levels below the President's requests. Boeing's Space Launch System program has once again been recommended by the Appropriations Committee for funding increases far above the President's request.","International demand for our offerings remains strong, especially in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. During the second quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 33% of revenue, and 39% of our current backlog. The strength of our Defense and Space business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative that will ensure our long-term competitiveness.","Now, before I turn it over to Greg, let me expand for just a minute on Jim's comments earlier about our competitive position, the continuity of our focus, and the attitude and approach we are taking to further improve our business.","All in all, Boeing is financially strong and well positioned in attractive markets. We have the right products, the right strategies and the right people to continue growing and leading our industry. However, we know that standing still is not an option for staying ahead of our competitors and for meeting our customers' expectations in a more-for-less world.","In recent years, we've made large and important strides in driving productivity and first-time quality to fund our innovation and growth, working as one Boeing to fully leverage the breadth and depth of our capabilities, reducing long-term risk to our business and balance sheet, expanding internationally and developing better leaders and better teams.","Moving forward, our focus on these areas will only grow stronger. We will sharpen our strategies to win, we will accelerate our pace of progress on these and other fundamental efforts, including development program performance. And through these efforts, we will succeed in profitably executing our record backlog, leading through innovation, investing in our people and making our second century even better than our first.","Now, with that, over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Let's turn to slide four, and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased 11% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margins of 7% both reflect the impact of the $835 million pre-tax tanker charge, or $536 million on an after-tax basis. It offsets solid productivity gains on production programs and across our services businesses.","Core earnings per share for the quarter was $1.62, reflecting the $0.77 per share tanker impact that again offset the benefit of continued strong operating performance across the business. As Dennis noted, despite our disappointment in encountering the charge on the tanker program, we're confident in the path forward and as we progress through the remaining functional and flight tests. While we have a lot of work to do in front of us, we have added the necessary engineering and support staff to complete the program on schedule to meet the customers' commitments.","Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide five. For the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business increased revenue 18% to $16.9 billion on a record 197 airplane deliveries. Operating margins of 7.1% reflect the $513 million pre-tax tanker impact at BCA, and the dilutive impact of higher 787 and 747 deliveries, partially offset by stronger performance on production programs. Commercial Airplanes captured $13 billion in net orders during the second quarter and backlog remains very strong, $431 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft that equates to approximately eight years of production.","Specifically on the 787 program, we continue to expect the program to be cash positive during 2015, and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12 per month production rate later in 2016, and there's no change to these fundamental milestones.","We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we further implement production efficiencies, while meaningfully increasing 787-9 production. The team delivered 64 787s during the first six months of the year, and made further progress on reducing unit costs. On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 35% now over the last 210 deliveries. And furthermore, 787-9 unit costs declined approximately 30% over the first 34 aircraft delivered.","In line with our expectations, 787 deferred production increased $790 million to a $27.7 billion in the second quarter. As we previously discussed, we continue to anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at a similar level next quarter before a healthy decline in growth in the fourth quarter. More work to do here, but we remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution and risk reduction, while improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We continue to manage the smooth introduction and the ramp-up of the 787-9, prepare for the 12 per month rate and introducing the 787-10 while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.","Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide six. Second quarter revenue in our Defense business was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 7.2%, as the $322 million pre-tax tanker charge at BDS offset strong performance on production programs and favorable delivery mix.","Boeing Military Aircraft's second quarter revenue was $3.5 billion due to timing of deliveries, and operating margins of 3.5% in the quarter, again, reflecting the tanker impact. Beyond the tanker program, BMA captured productivity improvements on a number of key production programs.","In addition, the BMA segment significantly retired risk during the quarter on the C-17 program by capturing contracts for six aircraft. We now have one more aircraft to sell, and we continue to see strong interest in that final aircraft for delivery.","Network & Space Systems revenue was $1.9 billion, and the segment generated operating margins of 7.8%. Global Services & Support revenue was $2.1 billion and operating margins increased to 12.8% on favorable program mix and performance. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $58 billion, with 39% of our current backlog representing customers of outside the United States.","Let's move to cash flow now on the next slide. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was strong, $3.3 billion, driven by higher volumes and solid operating performance across the company.","With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $625 million in dividends and repurchased 14 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter, as we continue to deliver on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for the business. We anticipate completing the remainder $7.5 billion repurchase authorization over the next two years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priorities for us.","Moving now to cash and debt balances on slide eight. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.","Turning now to slide nine and we'll discuss our outlook for 2015. We are reaffirming our 2015 guidance for revenue, deliveries, and cash flow and updating the margin and core EPS guidance to account for the tanker charge that offsets improved productivity. Our cash flow guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at greater than $9 billion as the cash impact in the tanker program is offset by improved cash performance across the company.","Our 2015 guidance for Commercial Airplane operating margin is now 9%, reflecting the tanker impact and Defense, Space & Security operating margin guidance is now 9.5%. That is more than offset the improved performance at BMA and GS&S. Core earnings per share guidance is now between $7.70 and $7.90 from $8.20 and $8.40 reflecting the $0.77 tanker charge and $0.27 benefit from improved performance. In summary, we generated solid revenue growth delivered on our backlog, generated significant cash flow, and meaningfully returned cash to shareholders.","So with that I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Greg. With the strong first half behind us we remain focused on disciplined execution, quality and productivity improvements, and meeting customer commitments. Our priorities going forward are clear and consistent. The profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production, delivering on our development programs, with an emphasis on tanker execution and our new commercial product line, driving productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation, talent and technology, continuing to strengthen our Defense and Space business, and importantly, providing increasing value to both our customers and our shareholders.","Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Welcome, Dennis. And congratulations, Jim, on your retirement. I hope this doesn't mean you're going to hang up your skates for the Pond Hockey League as well.","W. James McNerney - Chairman","(22:10).","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a clarification and a question. Greg, the comment you made on the stronger performance on production programs, I just wanted to clarify if that was a result of any margin change on those programs? And then, Dennis, just from a high level, I mean, I know it's been a lengthy transition, and you've been with the company for a long time, but these events always cause some reflection on where the company can and will go. And I think, if you could just expand on the comments you made before in terms of now seeing where the company's been over the last couple of years and the lessons learned, when you look out over the next three years to five years, what do you see is the biggest opportunities and risks that the company will face? And more specifically, how are you thinking about long-term margin potential, the need for major new investments, programmatic risks? Any more granular details you can provide on how you're thinking about that?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Greg, you want to answer the question first?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure. We had good performance across the board on margins, Carter. We had a little bit of impact on escalation on the commercial programs, but overall I'd say, across the board and you saw it in the results today, good performance across all areas of the portfolio. Having said that, there's a lot of productivity initiatives still in place, and that continues to be a big focus for the teams on all production and our services business. So we've still got some things to do that we want to try to capture going forward.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and that'll continue to be a priority. And, Carter, to your broader higher level question, it's frankly been a privilege for me to work side-by-side with Jim for about the last year and a half, with him and the rest of the team, Greg, Ray and the whole Boeing team. So I've got a lot of confidence in the foundation that we've put in place. And as we noted, today we have a very strong company. We're well-positioned in our markets. We have a strong financial foundation. We've got the right productivity machine in place. We've got the right strategy in place. So the theme you'll be hearing from me and the team is one of strategic consistency. We like the path we're on, the direction we're headed. There are a few areas where we've continued to hone our strategy, sharpen it and accelerate our actions.","I think if I look at big opportunities and at risks, certainly going forward, our opportunity to execute on our commercial aircraft backlog and to do that profitably, and return cash to shareholders and fund our future innovation, that is the single biggest opportunity we have. Having seven years of backlog and the opportunity to execute that well, that will be a clear focus for us. On the risks side, certainly, we want to continue to pay attention to delivering on our development programs. We're seeing steady improvement overall in terms of our ability to deliver on cost and schedule. I think tanker is a good reminder to us to continue to hone that effort. But we are on the right path to continue to deliver innovation to the marketplace, and to do it in a repeatable, financially disciplined way.","And if I look out a little farther beyond that as we think about how we're going to invest that capital, as you noted, our cash opportunity in terms of executing our backlog also creates opportunity to invest in future innovation. And successfully bringing those new commercial aircraft to the marketplace is very important to us with the MAX, 787-10 and the 777X, and we feel very confident in all of those development activities. We're also investing in a few future franchises on the Defense side, including long-range strike, again, good solid opportunities for us. And if we look at uses of cash, going forward, our number one priority remains at disciplined investment and innovation for the future. Secondly, returning cash to shareholders, as you've seen through both the stock repurchase and through dividends. And then thirdly, where it makes sense, bolt-on acquisitions, but our fundamental investment priority for the future is in organic investment machine. We have a very strong position here, and we plan to leverage that.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. And first, Jim, just want to say it's been great working with you over the years, and just want to wish you all the best in your next steps.","W. James McNerney - Chairman","Thanks, Doug. Appreciate the comment.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And something you may not miss is 787 deferred production discussion, but I want to just get into that. But specifically, when you look at the 787 over the course of this year, you've said in the past that by the end of this year we should see cash positive on the 787 just by the end of the year, not for the whole year. I want to confirm that's still the case. But also, as you see the model shift towards the 787-9, 787-9 should ultimately be, we would think, considerably more profitable than the 787-8. So as you see these two airplanes mature, the 787-8 and the 787-9, can you give us a sense of the relative profitability of these two models longer-term? And when would we likely see the 787-9 cross over in terms of becoming more profitable than the 787-8?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, to answer your first question, Doug, no change on the outlook for 787 cash, so we do expect that to be positive later this year, and the team's tracking well to that. On 787-9, I mean, certainly as I indicated, the team has done a very nice job coming down that learning curve. If you think about the numbers, I talked to you about 30% over 34 deliveries. It gives you really good sense of how well that's being incorporated. But you remember, we made some investments upfront to ensure we had that smooth introduction. At the same time, lessons learned after 787-8 and getting those into 787-9, so the producibility of the 787-9 has definitely improved. So over time, that favorable mix will work in our favor. I think I've mentioned that half of our deliveries this year will be 787-9s.","And I would tell you, just from my time at the company, that is the smoothest introduction of a derivative on top of the all-time high production rate on a wide-body program. So again, I think there's more opportunity for us going forward. We got the enterprise focused on that, and whether that's on the shop floor, support or across the supply chain that remains a top priority for us. So made good progress. But as you know, we still got a lot of work to do going forward. But I think we got the right people focused. We got a lot of projects. We're working our way through, and ultimately, you got to get those projects to hit the production system. And that's what we're trying to do. Get those matured, get them implemented, implement them in a fashion where you don't disrupt the production system and capture the benefit as the result of that.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But can you give us a sense of when the 787-9 profitability will sort of be there? In a mature sense, when we should find that as a more profitable airplane?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, I think as we get into next year and we'll have \u2013 keep coming down that learning curve, we'll see higher levels of profitability on the 787-9.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. Good luck, Jim. Although, I don't think you're going away any time soon. And Dennis, it will be fun to work with you.","W. James McNerney - Chairman","Thanks, Howard.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Howard.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","There's sort of two questions. One is on the KC-46. My understanding is you have price options on the seven and 12 tankers. So how did you think about managing the risk so that when you exercise those contracts, or when Air Force exercises those contracts, we don't see a follow on charge? And then second, if I back out what appears to be the revenues associated with the 787 and 747, it would seem that there was a little deterioration in the margins on the mature aircraft. Could you address that as well, please?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Maybe I'll (31:03) and then I'll pass it back over to Dennis on KC-46.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Slightly, Howard, as I said, we had some little bit of additional escalation with oil deteriorating slightly. But again just on those particular production but very, very slight. And again good solid performance I'd say across the board, and you're seeing that in the margins, both the BDS and BCA.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Howard, on your question regarding tanker. That's one of the reasons that we're investing now during the development program to refine the production system and ensure we're ready to ramp into the low rate initial production. There was priced options that you mentioned are part of the low rate initial production program. And I think as you're aware, we've already got the first two aircraft loaded into the production line system in our commercial factory in Everett. And our ability to integrate that into the full commercial line is one of the big ways that we've reduced risk on the program overall.","And some of the charge that we've taken in this quarter is the fact that we are having to retro-fit a couple of those early aircraft that are in early build stages. But that allows us to get into a mature position now, so again we have high confidence in the production program. We've got Ray and our BCA team very much engaged on ensuring we're doing the right things now to drive profitability in the production system for the long run. So we'll complete that work here during the development phase. We're confident that as we get into low rate initial production and then full production, this program will have a lot of financial value both for the company and for our shareholders.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you both, gentlemen.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Next we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cash flow just given this cash outflow that you're going to get for the tanker program. Can you just talk about what is the offset? I know you said operations. Is it C-17, is it taxes, is it BCA, is it Defense? And where do you still see the opportunity to potentially drive higher even during this year?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","I'd say, Sam, it really was across the operations. It's not tax related. It's just purely operational performance. Both BDS and BCA that is, A, drove the solid performance in the quarter, so not timing, just pure core performance. And that's what's going to offset the impact on tanker through the balance of the year. And we're going to obviously continue to focus on being efficient on all uses of working capital.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sam, just to add on to Greg's point here, I think this just represents fundamentally how we're driving the business. This is part of our core operating engine, our focus on disciplined cash management, all of the levers that are inside the business. We are committed to that for the long run, and I think that's reflected in the guidance that you see and our confidence for long-term year-over-year cash growth.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But you didn't change the number of C-17 deliveries.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Let me add my congrats to Jim and Dennis on the post changes.","W. James McNerney - Chairman","Thanks, Noah. Appreciate it.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Greg, a question on working capital change, and specifically advances and their impact on cash flow. It looks like if I strip out what's happening with 787 deferred, and I'm just looking at total working capital change other than that, it's been about a third of total company free cash, excluding deferred, the last kind of three years to five years or so.","Should I be reverting that back to zero over time, or can that be sustainably greater than zero for a long time because it's a growth industry? And then specifically on advances, specifically given that's kind of a big part of that, has there been any strategic change with how and when the company takes advances, whether it's a competitive advantage driver or any other reason just because that's been such a big piece?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, there's no fundamental changes to how we handle advances in our contracts. I think as I've said to you before, as you think about just purely the production rate increases that are going to take place over time, and how that advanced stream is completely associated with that, you're going to continue to see advances grow going forward as we increase production rates and then ultimately increase deliveries, so that profile will continue.","Now, it won't be at the same growth rate that it's been because we don't have 18 rate breaks in front of us that we've just completed. We've got about five. So you'll still see a healthy increase in advances going forward.","And then ultimately, as you know, the bulk of the cash coming on delivery, so that's where you'll see it coming from. In the quarter, that is core cash. That is just pure core cash performance across the business. It's not timing. It's not driven by some advances from one quarter to the next, and it's purely associated with performance across, again, multiple programs in the portfolio.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I mean, if I look over a \u2013 forget about the quarter, if I look over a very long period of time, the last half a decade, decade, advances have grown at a pretty significantly faster rate than deliveries and BCA revenue. How do I square why that's happened, and does it need to mean revert at any point?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I mean \u2013 look, you've got two sides of the business, obviously. You got BDS, where you've got milestone payments associated with major contracts, as I've talked about. Those vary quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, dramatically. And then the advances are just purely the growth. So if you think about the backlog, and as you take that order and as you get closer to that airplane delivering, you're getting advances associated with that. I mean that's fundamental, but, again, think about the backlog we have today, and then think about delivering on that backlog. There's a complete correlation to cash flow. And so I'd say, no fundamental change in that model as you look back, or frankly, as you look forward.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Okay?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks for the help.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And next, we go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. Good luck, Jim, and congratulations, Dennis.","W. James McNerney - Chairman","Thank you, George. Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks. Hi, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","I question Greg, if I try and look at the deferred, it was $26 million a plane this quarter, the same as Q1. I'm assuming it stayed flat because you had more 787-9 deliveries this quarter or in the first quarter? Could you just give us at least some quantitative measures as to how much above the $26 million the 787-9 might be at this point, and how much below the 787-8 might be? And then one for Dennis, any reason to increase two 767 production rate? I know you're going up to two, but any need to go a little further with the FedEx order?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Can you go first?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, on the deferred, Howard (sic) [George], you're right. I mean, certainly mix comes into play here. But as I said to you, I mean, we're focused on unit cost performance. So unit-by-unit, are we improving? What are the opportunities? How do we capture those opportunities? And as I said, the 787-8, down 35% over the last \u2013 over 200 deliveries, and 787-9 down 30%. So to your point, mix comes into play here. But we only have 34 787-9s delivered. So as 787-9 becomes more of that portfolio on the deliveries, and we continue to come down that learning curve, we'll see more benefit as associated with that.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And George, on the 767 side, we'll treat future rate considerations like we do in all of our production lines. It's a very disciplined evaluation process. As you said, we've already planned to go up from 1.5 a month to two a month next year. That'll position us well for the tanker production program, as I noted earlier. The fact that we see the order strength here, especially with the FedEx order just announced yesterday. By the way, that 50 plus 50 is the largest single order in the history of the 767 program. So that gives you some sense of the strength and longevity of that line.","As we look at future demand, we get into full rate production on the tanker program. We have a lot of confidence in that mature 767 production line. And any changes that we might consider beyond two a month, again, we'll go through that normal, very financially disciplined assessment. Right now, we're very focused on just ramping up successfully to two a month. That will position us for what we need to do for both tanker and our FedEx customer, and we'll use our disciplined process beyond that.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And next we go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, and congratulations to the role changers. First, a clarification on the inventory. It looks like there was about a $1 billion liquidation of commercial spare parts and used aircrafts from the disclosures on the website. But the bigger question for me is on the book-to-bill. You've been targeting, I think, full year around one. I'm curious if you still have confidence in that and the pathway to get to the 1.2 implied in the second half? Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the inventory is driven by C-17. It's been the other category there, Myles. So it's the liquidation on the C-17s as we firmed up those contracts and got advances associated with that. That moves into that category of long-term contracts in progress. So you'll see that shift there.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","That's all that's going on there. I'll let Dennis address the book-to-bill.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Myles, our outlook on book-to-bill hasn't changed. We still anticipate roughly a book-to-bill of one by year-end. Obviously, timing plays into that, but we're continuing to see strong fundamental order strength. We're pleased with the amount of activity we saw in and around the Paris Air Show. We're continuing to see interest in both narrow-bodies and wide-bodies. And the fundamental marketplace still looks strong. Traffic growth trends are good. Cargo is returning a bit, and we're waiting to see that play out in terms of demand. Replacement value continues to be attractive to our customers. And we're not seeing any changes in the demand cycle or signals in the marketplace. So steady as she goes on our book-to-bill expectations.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And aside from that, feathering dynamic on the 777, when is the earliest that you'd have to think about bringing the rates down more on a demand basis?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","So the key thing there on the bridge, two things, Myles. One is building the 777 order book, and we're pleased with the progress this year. As we said, we needed to achieve about 40 to 60 orders a year to build that bridge, and we're at 44 firm and commitments so far this year. So continuing to see strong demand signals there. 2016 is essentially sold-out now; 2017, more than half sold-out, so progress there. We're beginning to fill the 2018 pipeline well also. Several campaigns still underway. So our ability to build the bridge one, we continue to be confident there. In terms of the transition, this is where we'll be feathering in the new production system. As you know, that'll start hitting the production system around the 2018 timeframe in terms of long-lead implementation for 2020 deliveries on the 777X.","So specific decisions around that will be more in the next year timeframe. But to the key thing we're doing now is de-risking that transition by pulling some of the technology and some of the automation forward into the 777 line, things like the Fuselage Upright Build, for example, and that's allowing us to de-risk the production system. And we'll continue to look for ways to make sure that feathering in is done most effectively and efficiently. We know how to do this. We've built bridges on our other production lines. We're doing the same thing on the NG to MAX transition in the 737 line. So we know how to do these transitions with discipline. And we'll make sure it's done as efficiently as we can. We'll get more into details as we get into next year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question's from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you very much, and congratulations to Jim. So quick question. You had very good 787 deliveries in the quarter. And I guess one of the blogs is talking about potential for a big Q3. What is the chance that you could exceed your bogie of 125 for the year? And relatedly what kind of impact do we see potentially on cash flow? Because you had very strong Q2 cash flow with essentially very little increase in progress and advances. You still have some deposits to come on the C-17 orders you received. So it would look like on paper as if you should easily come in well above your cash flow guide. Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Cai. On deliveries certainly we expect the back half to be healthy on 787 deliveries. But as you know quarter-to-quarter, Cai, just purely from customer ability to take the aircraft, I mean that moves around a little bit. But we're comfortable about where we are on our guide. If we have the opportunity to change that, we'll do that. But I'd say, we're well on track to hit that our objective on about 120. So I think we're in pretty good shape there. But again the back half will be important for us. On Q3 cash, I mean, as you know Cai, again, there's a lot of moving pieces in here. But we expect solid performance. We do have some milestone payments and progress payments that will come in in 3Q as well. So we're tracking those, and trying to capture those in the third quarter. But again, a lot of moving pieces quarter-to-quarter. We're comfortable about where we are now with our guidance. And we'll see where we end up at the end of Q3 and go from there.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll go to Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, and congratulations to both Jim and Dennis as well from me.","W. James McNerney - Chairman","Thanks.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I just want to spend, if you don't mind, a few more minutes on 777 program, talked about the timing on a decision sometime next year, which is great. Helpful for us all. I think it would be helpful as well to look a little bit beyond next year. And perhaps just give us an update on how you're going to manage through this process with regard to inventory that's going to get built on the 777X program for production, that may get built on that program. And just perhaps give us some guidance on when we should expect you to begin communicating that kind of stuff to us, and if there are some historical examples that you can point to so that we can begin really gauging the potential impacts on expenses and cash flows as the 777X begin to feather in. Thanks.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jason, let me start on that one. Then, Greg, I'll flip it over to you for some additional comment. Again when we look at that overall transition, Jason, it's important for us to first note that the market demand for the 777 remains very strong. So our ability to confidently build the bridge and to plan on that is part of the equation here. The bridge itself and the transition to the 777X, the key there is to flow it efficiently into the production system and into our supply chain. So long lead planning is already underway. As I said we'll make some additional decisions next year on exactly how we'll implement that and feather it into the production system. But we do this across the entire depth of our supply chain. Any technologies or investments that we can pull forward and pre-implement on the 777 line, as I said we're doing with some of the automation technology, further de-risks it for 777X, and also allows us to drive additional profitability on the current 777 line.","And that's part of how we're continuing to pay for the implementation, if you will, is by driving productivity on the base programs to fuel our future innovation and allow us to put automation into the production line. That cycle is one that we're going through right now. We expect the overall R&D and capital profile for 777X to remain stable. We've guided you to about $3.5 billion of total R&D spend this year. That remains confidently in place. Our 2016 overall expenditures will be similar to that. We'll see some incremental growth in 777X, but roll off in some of the other development programs. So it's a very disciplined process, as I said, one that we understand how to do, and rolling it efficiently so that we can continue to drive profitability while we make the transition is fundamental to the equation. We've done it previously on our other rate ramp-ups. We're doing it now on the 737 line, as you can see in the results, and we expect to use that same disciplined process on 777. Greg, anything you want to add?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, just as you think about the cash flow going forward, our comments about going into next year, year-over-year growth and continued growth beyond assumes what you described as a transition on the 777 to 777X timeframe. That's like 2018, 2019 timeframe, as Dennis indicated. Now, we step back, keep in mind, during that timeframe, we've got the 787 going up in rate, and as well as, obviously, we got to continue down this learning curve on 787. But if you think about out into that timeframe, we should be in a lot better shape on that program as well. So there is more offsets than any short-term, I'd say, impact as related to this transition on 777 to 777X. Now, obviously, that is a key franchise for us. So having that short-term transition period is very minimal considering the benefit that program, both of those programs bring to bottom line of The Boeing Company.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Gregory D.

Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks. Congratulations, Jim.","W. James McNerney - Chairman","Thank you, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Greg, the deferred step down that you're expecting in Q4, can you just talk about exactly what's driving that? Is there some sort of supplier step down in pricing that you're expecting? But just what's driving that? Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, no, I think there's mix involved, and continued productivity in our operations combined with some pricing step downs out of the supply chain. So it's really a combination of things, David. At the same time, we're continuing to make those investments I talked to you about on improving the overall reliability, and improving the long-term productivity and profitability of the program. So a lot of moving pieces in there, but all of those, fundamentally, have an impact in that step down going forward. We've got good plans in place in order to do that, so the team's focused on capturing those and coming down the curve.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","And then one quick follow up on 747, the step down to one a month, can you talk about where you guys stand from on a forward loss standpoint, how this might impact that? Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, That's already been incorporated, so there's no forward losses associated with that. Again, I think that is just, again, a focus on productivity inside and outside the complete supply chain in order to offset any of that pressure as a result of that rate coming down. The team was able to do that and hold the program profitability through that rate transition.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Troy J. Lahr - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, and congratulations to Jim and Dennis. One more question on working capital, and just thinking out over the next couple of years. You guys have done a very strong job through all the rate increases we've had over the past three years to four years in terms of managing physical inventory build. How do we think of that as a component of working capital as we move to 2016, 2017, 2018 of rate increases on the 737 and the 787?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President-Business Development & Strategy and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Seth, I guess I would just put it in the category of day-to-day business, just day-to-day business, solid execution across the board. I wouldn't differentiate that any different than trying to drive productivity in the factory or getting additional flow time. It's all key measures on our programs and objectives that we have and opportunities we're trying to capture. So again, it remains just a key element of how we're running the business.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Seth, I'll just reinforce that, this is fundamentally how we are doing business and how we'll continue to do it. We understand the linkage between that productivity machine, cash machine and our ability to return value to shareholders and invest for the future. So it's fundamental to our business model, and we remain committed to it.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","That complete the analyst question-and-answer session. I'll now return you to The Boeing Company for interjectory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Thomas J. Downey - Senior Vice President-Communications","Thank you. We'll continue with the questions for our speakers this morning. If you have any questions following this part of the session please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002.","Operator, we're ready for the first question, and as we're pressed for time we ask that you limit everybody to one question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go to Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Jon Ostrower - The Wall Street Journal","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Jon.","Jon Ostrower - The Wall Street Journal","Two parter. First one is for Jim. Jim, you told Aviation Week in May that you had a high degree of confidence that another tanker charge wasn't coming. Just curious where your confidence was coming from at that point, and when did you guys become aware of the fuel system issues and how was the process of this arriving on your desk?","The second, continuing on the tanker theme is, thinking about the pace of rework on the fuel system and looking at the history of 787 and what happened with F-35 over at Lockheed, is it wise to push headlong into production when you're not totally clear on the pace of changes ahead of KC-46A flight tests? And how are you guys going to kind of avoid manage a pile-up of post-production modification like you had on 787? And ultimately what you did last week, is that the last of the charges?","W. James McNerney - Chairman","Jon, as you know, we evaluate our position every quarter. I think the \u2013 we said back in that specific interview you're talking about, I never made a categorical statement. I said we're always reviewing it, and when we see issues we deal with them. And the facts were that in the second quarter, as we tested out the fuel system and as we got into flight tests, we began to see issues that you can only see when you integrate fuel system into an airplane. And those are the issues we're dealing with now. And so Dennis, do you have any other comments?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll just add on, Jon, to the second part of your question. The key here is the work to go is well understood. There's no technology or invention that has to be accomplished. As Jim said, this is the nature of what came out of some final ground and flight testing on certifying the integrated fuel system. This is the last major system to be qualified under the development program. So while we're disappointed in the charge, it reflects the ripple effect that is the last system. As a result there's no retrofit into the aircraft that are in the line already.","That said we have our arms around this. We understand the work that has to be done. We have found a way to execute that work and keep the program on schedule for our customer, and we're confident that we're going to do that. So now, it's about executing the work ahead of us and delivering those first 18 tankers by 2017. And part of the message here is, we have invested in system integration labs that did allow us to find some of these issues now rather than later in flight tests. And while disappointed in taking the charge now, we're doing the right thing and we remain committed to meeting our customers' schedule.","Operator","Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg News","Hi, all.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg News","Quick Ex-Im related question. I'm just wondering what the prospects are for reauthorization over the next few months and the sales impact that you see beyond 2015 if that doesn't occur.","A \u2013 [07JL49-E Dennis Muilenburg]>: Julie, let me give you the short answer first on the prospects here. We know that's a very active discussion on the Hill right now. As you know the Senate was in the midst of discussing the highway bill yesterday, and the potential of Ex-Im being included, Ex-Im reauthorization being included as part of that bill. We know it has the attention of both the House and the Senate right now.","We remain optimistic that we'll ultimately see reauthorization. But we also recognize that there's a political risk to that. So we're being mindful of that and staying properly engaged in the process. I will say, from a company perspective, as we said before, this is not something that creates near-term financial risk for Boeing. There are multiple commercial credit sources available today that the market is sound there.","We have about 15% of our customers that use Ex-Im financing as backstop financing, but in the current financing market that doesn't create risk for us. This is about long-term global competitiveness. And that's why we're so forceful on this topic that it's important Ex-Im be reauthorized. It's about allowing U.S. industry to be globally competitive. It's about American manufacturing jobs. It's the right thing for the country to do. And we're going to continue to advocate on behalf of U.S. manufacturing jobs.","Operator","Our next question is from Al Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alwyn Scott - Thomson Reuters","Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Alwyn Scott - Thomson Reuters","Great. You guys have stressed continuity and the transition to CEO, for Dennis as CEO, which raises the question. Other than the lower age, is there some ambition or vision or goals that you bring to the table that sets Boeing apart for the next 100 years? Without moonshots, what does Boeing do to be great? Merely, are you guys going to merely execute on production, or is there a bigger vision? Can you talk a little about that?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Al, I'll talk about it a bit here. Just to give you prospective, as we're rounding out our first century here we do have a great company. It's the leader in aerospace today. And the advancement that the company's made over the last 10 years under Jim's leadership has been very significant. And we do have a very strong market position today. We've created the right strategy. Jim, Ray, Greg, myself, the whole team, we've been deeply involved in that strategy. So it's something we understand and we're committed to.","It is a big bold strategy, one that is a growing business strategy. We've invested in our Commercial Airplane product line for the future. You can see that reflected in our backlog, and you can see it reflected in the new innovation that we're bringing to the market. So I would offer that that reflects a bold vision for the future, and one that will grow and allow our company to beat the competition. We continue to look for opportunities to invest in the future on the Defense and Space side of our business as well. And you can see the number of newer products that we've brought to the market there.","So we do plan to continue a path of strategic consistency, but as I said we also sharpen and accelerate where we need to. And I think this is about taking a company that's very good today and making it even better. And fundamental to business, for 100 years we've led with innovation, disciplined innovation. And that's part of how we'll continue forward. Innovation is fundamental to our mission as a company. And bringing disciplined innovation to the market for long-term growth continues to be our strategy.","Operator","And next we go to Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","Hi. Good morning. I want a clarification, something on tanker. Earlier this year Boeing and the U.S. Air Force negotiated a revision to the tanker schedule. It didn't change the end target of 2018 deliveries, but it did shift around the timing of first flight, the timing of the decision on LRIP and so on. Now, that was earlier this year. And the fuel system problem was discovered. I saw it in the last six weeks since Jim's interview with Aviation Week. So my question is, is that latest problem factored into that revision of the schedule, or is there possibly more revision to the schedule now needed because of this new problem?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Dominic, let me take that one. Yeah, in addition to what we announced previously, these intermediate program level milestones about exact flight dates and sequencing of flight tests, those are things that we will, with the customer, refine to allow us to most efficiently complete the program. As we said, we still plan to fly the first full-up tanker which is aircraft number two later this summer. We remain on track to do that. We have re-sequenced some of the downstream flight test phasing, again in the name of efficiency. All of that has been done to hold the delivery schedule at the end. And if, as you talked to our Air Force customer, the most important thing to them is for us to deliver those first 18 aircraft by 2017. We remain resolute and committed to meeting that schedule. Incorporating the latest learnings on the integrated fuel system. We've rolled that into our planning. And while we may move some of these intermediate program level milestones, we remain committed to the overarching milestone of delivering on our customer commitment. And that's all part of what we've announced with the 2Q charge.","Thomas J. Downey - Senior Vice President-Communications","Operator, we have time for one last question, please.","Operator","That will be from Steve Wilhelm with the Puget Sound's Business Journal. Please go ahead.","Steve Wilhelm - American City Business Journals, Inc.","Hi, gentlemen. Congratulations for your transition. There's a question for Dennis. When I've talked to people on the factory floor, there's still a lot of rough feelings from the vote in 2014. And I just wondered, as you move ahead as CEO, what is your relationship going to be with union people, how do you hold that and look at that? And in particular, what are you thinking about the possibility of unionization in South Carolina, and will Boeing be pushing back as actively as it has been?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Steve. First of all, I think it's important to emphasize the fact that we understand how important our people are to our business. We invest in our people. I have a great deal of respect for our team and the work they do every day, building the best airplanes in the world. I think, as you may know, I had a chance to start with Boeing about 30 years ago in Puget Sound. So I have a very deep appreciation for our workforce there as well. And during the first couple of weeks in my new role here, I've had the chance to get out on the factory floor as well and continue the dialogue with our team. So this idea of mutual respect and partnership and investing in our people is very important to me and will continue to be important.","We know this is a long-term business that demands those kind of good partnerships and relationships, and I expect to emphasize that going forward. As far as Charleston goes, we're equally pleased with the progress we're seeing there. Our team there is performing and performing well. Our business in Charleston is growing as a result. We're looking forward to the 787-10 being built there. And the investments we've made in Charleston are reflective of the quality of our workforce there. And we treat that management to workforce relationship as very important, and we'll continue to invest in that relationship as well. And going back to Puget Sound, I think you can also see the fact we're investing there for future. Our new composite wing factory in Everett, I think is a good example. So the employee relationships are important, investing in our people is important, and our ability to do work at multiple sites is important.","Thomas J.

Good day, everyone and welcome to The Boeing Company\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analysts and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy Lahr","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings call. I am Troy Lahr and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Smith, Boeing\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in today\u2019s press release and you can follow this broadcast and slide presentation through our Web site at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals included in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings, and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures, and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","Jim McNerney","Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everybody. My comments today will focus on our positive first quarter performance and what we see as a continued healthy business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook.","Now let's move to Slide 2 please. Building on the strong performance trend we sustained through 2014, Boeing delivered solid first quarter 2015 financial results including higher revenue, healthy core earnings -- healthy core operating margins and double-digit growth in core earnings per share. We also continued to return cash to shareholders in the first quarter by repurchasing $2.5 billion of Boeing stock and increasing our dividend as promised by 25% for a payout of $639 million. Revenue at Boeing commercial airplanes increased 21% to 15.4 billion and operating margins were 10.5%. We delivered 184 commercial airplanes in the quarter and added 110 net new orders.","Key milestones in the quarter included delivery of the first 787-9 built at Boeing South Carolina. The opening of our South Carolina propulsion systems facility and start-up of an automated wing panel assembly on the 737 program in Renton. Boeing defense, space and security reported revenue in the first quarter of 6.7 billion and generated strong operating margins of 11.1%. Key contract awards included orders for 43 AH-64E Apache helicopters, a multi-year combat logistics support contract and an order from SES for an all electric 702SP satellite. In addition the U.S. Air Force selected the 747-8 as the next Presidential Aircraft.","Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included launching the first two all electric propulsion satellites, double stacked on a single rocket, and building - and breaking ground on the crew access tower which will support the commercial crew program and replicating a best practice to bolstering performance on development programs by establishing a single unified defense and space development programs organization.","Our success with the similar structure put in place at commercial airplanes starting with the development of the 787-9 shows that we can leverage synergies and expertise across different development programs to reduce cost and risk and better ensure performance as promised to our customers.","This new organization will oversee current and future development efforts including work on the KC-46 tanker, the 747-8 Presidential Aircraft our commercial crew spacecraft and space launch system rocket, the 502 small satellite and our St. Louis based 777X work package. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of operating performance, achieved significant program milestones, cash at orders totaling $15 billion and returned significant cash to shareholders all of which Greg will cover in more detail in a moment.","With that let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Strong airline profitability, healthy global air traffic trends and our backlog totaling more than 5,700 aircraft all combined to underpin our plan production rate increases over the remainder of the decade. Our long-term outlook also remains positive as we expect airline fleet growth and replacement demand to drive the need for nearly 37,000 commercial aircraft over the next 20 years. As evidenced by the healthy pace of orders during the first quarter, conversations with our airline customers continue to center on new purchases or accelerating delivery slots. Deferral requests are still running well below the historical average, these remain very good times for our industry.","As I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, historically airplane orders are highly correlated to airline profitability. And lower oil prices have not fundamentally changed our customers view on fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules.","The rapid return on investment from new more efficient airplanes remains a compelling factor in purchase decisions and a fuel price environment that remains, even if it remains well below the 15 year average. As a remainder in addition to far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, our new technologically advanced airplanes also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range that grows market opportunities by allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.","Further to those points, demand for both the 777 and the 777X remains strong. The 777 production line is essentially sold out for 2016 approximately half sold out in 2017 and has a healthy number of slots already sold firm in 2018. As we've discussed before, the new 777X is scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 timeframe and will leverage new manufacturing processes and technologies being proven on the current 777 to optimize the overall 777X production system. We will continue to assess most efficient way to phase in this new technology and adapt as necessary to ensure we meet our customers' commitments.","On the 787 program, we have now delivered more than 250 airplanes including 20-9s. Notable among the strong new bookings during the quarter was ANAs order for three 787-10s, 787-10 development remains on track for first delivery in 2018. In the single aisle segment, demand for our new fuel efficient 737 MAX also remains high with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,700 airplanes from 57 customers, development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in 2017.","Turning to defense, space and security, we continued to see solid support for our major programs. The President's fiscal 2016 budget request included increases for core Boeing production programs such as P-8A Poseidon, Apache and Chinook helicopters, key development programs such as tanker, Long-Range Strike and commercial crew also saw budget increases. ","International demand for our offerings remains strong, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region. During the first quarter international customers for defense, space and security represented 23% of revenue and 37% of our current backlog.","Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and the few critical future franchise programs like Long-Range Strike and the T-X Trainer which are priorities for our customers. The relative strength of our defense, space and security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative which is focused on reducing operating cost by another $1 billion on top of the $5 billion already achieved which will ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending.","Overall, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and the opportunities of our markets and our teams are executing them well to deliver increased top line and bottom line performance, support the needs of our customers and capture new business to sustain our growth and profitability for the decades to come.","Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?","Greg Smith","Thanks, Jim and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 4 and we\u2019ll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased 8% to 22.1 billion driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 12% to $1.97 driven on higher commercial airplane volume and continued strong operating performance.","Let's now discuss commercial airplanes on Slide 5. For the first quarter our Commercial Airplanes business increased revenue 21% to 15.4 billion on a 184 airplane deliveries and reported operating margins of 10.5%. Strong operating margins in the quarter were primarily driven by higher volume, continued focus on productivity, and program mix. Commercial Airplanes captured $9.8 billion of net orders during the first quarter and backlog remains very strong at 435 billion and over 5,700 aircrafts equating to approximately eight years of production.","Specifically on the 787 program, we continued to expect the program to be cash positive during 2015 and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we\u2019ve achieved the 12 per month production rate in 2016. No change to these fundamental milestones. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we further implement production efficiencies while meaningfully increasing the 787-9 production and managing through some near-term disruption in supply chain, largely around cabin interiors. ","Despite these challenges and with a lot of hard work from the team, we delivered 30 787s in the quarter and made further progress on reducing unit costs. On the 787-8, we\u2019ve seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 30% over the last of 190 deliveries and furthermore the 787-9 unit cost declined approximately 25% over the first 20 deliveries. In line with our expectations and as declining rate, 787 deferred production increase 793 million to $27 billion in the first quarter and as we previously discussed we continued to anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at similar levels for the next couple of quarters before seeing a healthy decline in the growth later in this year.","We remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution, risk reduction and improving a long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We continue to manage the smooth ramp of the 787-9 production compared for the 12 rate per month introduction of the 787-10 while also driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.","Let's turn now to Defense, Space and Security results on Slide 6. First quarter revenue at our defense business was 6.7 billion and operating margins were strong at 11.1%, largely driven by solid performance and favorable mix. Boeing military aircraft first quarter revenue declined to 2.7 billion primarily driven by planned timing of C-17 and F-15 deliveries. Operating margins at 9.5% reflect delivery mix that offset improved operating performance.","Network and Space Systems reported revenue of 1.7 billion and increased operating margins to 9.6% in the quarter resulting from higher ULA earnings. Global Services and Support revenue was 2.2 billion and operating margins increased to 14.1% on solid operating performance in favorable program mix. Defense, Space and Security reported a solid backlog of $60 billion with 37% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.","Next slide please. Operating cash flow; operating cash flow for the first quarter was approximately a $100 billion driven by solid operating performance and as expected the timing of receipts and expenditures that were largely benefited late in Q4 of 2014. We continued to expect 2015 operating cash flow to be more than $9 billion with the majority of that being generated in the second half of the year. With regards to capital deployment as Jim mentioned, we paid 639 million in dividends and repurchased 17 million shares for $2.5 billion in the first quarter as we continued to deliver our commitments to our shareholders and furthermore this reflects our ongoing confidence in a long-term outlook for our business.","We continued to anticipate completing the remaining 9.5 billion repurchase authorization over the next two to three years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priority for us.","Moving to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with 9.6 billion of cash in marketable securities and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us very well going forward.","Let's now turn to Slide 9 and I\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2015. We are reaffirming our 2015 guidance for revenue, operating margins, core earnings deliveries in cash flow. And overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the first quarter performance as the core operating engine continues to deliver strong results and we expect that performance to continue as we remain focused on production, program profitability, rate ramp up and ongoing productivity improvement.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim for some closing comments.","Jim McNerney","Thank you, Greg. With a strong first quarter behind us, we remain focused on disciplined execution, quality and productivity improvements and meeting customer commitments. Our priority is going forward, are clear and consistent. The profitable ramp up in commercial airplane production, executing well on our development programs, driving efficiencies throughout the enterprise, continuing to strengthen our defense business and importantly providing increasing value to both our customers and our shareholders.","Now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder in the interest of time, we are asking that you limit yourself to one single part question. And our first question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","You talked about -- there could be a number of questions to ask. But you talked about being able to make some real progress with the 777 bridge. Could you elaborate a little bit on that and Jim, maybe talk about the quality and the characterization of the discussions you're having with customers?","Jim McNerney","Yes, I think 777 you've heard my speech before Howard, unique airplane in terms of its capability and where its positioned in the market, so a real opportunity to manage this bridge well. So far so good, I think last year's performance was good, I think this year where we stand now we've got 25 orders and commitments in-hand today, that's roughly half or just short of half of what we're looking forward for the entire year. I mentioned the production skyline in '16, '17 and '18 and it's beginning to firm up. So we're increasingly confident that we can implement this bridge and it's important not only commercially and to keep the rate going, but as I mentioned in my comments, we're sort of feathering in some new technology on the current airplane, the ER, so it's tested and de-risked by the time we get to the X. So this bridge has lots of value for us, lots of value for our customers. So steady she goes.","Howard Rubel","Maybe just to follow up for a second, you talk about feathering in some of this technology, and in the press release you talk about accelerating some of the development milestones. So are we to take that, that in fact the R&D programs are -- whether it's the MAX or the 10 or the X, are coming in a little bit better than your current budgets?","Jim McNerney","No, what I would say is on budget slightly ahead on de-risking, in other words, things are -- we're spending about what we had planned, but the technical advances or the reliability that we're shooting for is coming in a little bit more robustly than we'd hope. And as you recall, we've got a development organization that is 100% focused on development now and that gives us much greater visibility and much more objectivity around these kinds of milestones.","Operator","Next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","So your 787 deferreds per unit built looked like they went from 32 in the fourth to 26 million, maybe give us some color, this looks like better performance than we'd expected, was this better than your performance expectations? How did the 787-9 and 787-8 do? And is the 787-8 now in a cash positive mode with regard to deferreds?","Greg Smith","Yes, what I would say Cai when you look over that timeframe we have seen improved performance, in particular I noted on the 787-9 as they're coming down the learning curve in a very aggressive manner. And I think that goes to the lessons learned off the 787-8 and getting those into the production system. So that introduction of that airplane is going very well and as you know that will be close to half of our deliveries this year, so that smooth introduction is important.","When you look quarter-over-quarter as you know, Cai, mix comes into play so we did have some early 787-9s actually the first two coming out of Charleston, so that played into the shift quarter-over-quarter. But I'd say fundamentally, again the program continues to make good improvements on unit cost, still got a long way to go but making good progress.","Cai von Rumohr","And maybe a follow-up, you had mentioned the cabin interior disruptions, what impact did that have on the 87? And when do you think you'll have that behind you?","Greg Smith","Well, I mean Cai, we delivered the 30 airplanes which was the production rate, but it's disruptive, it added additional pressure obviously on deferred and you see by the growth in the deferred, we were able to offset some of that through our own productivity. But certainly it's been disruptive, there is recovery plans in place, we're part of that recovery, we're actively engaged with them and we don't see that impacting our deliveries through the balance of the year.","Operator","And next we'll go to Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","I'd like to just continue on that with the 787. If you look at the increases that you're seeing in deferred, and as I look at the numbers for this quarter, it looks pretty much on the trajectory you described last quarter. But can you parse this out into buckets? And what I mean by that is things that would be one-time investments, I would say higher costs on early 787-9 deliveries, and potentially other factors related to operations of the supply chain. How would you divide this up? I mean how much falls into each category?","Greg Smith","I'd say roughly, Doug, it's about a third, a third, a third through breaking each one of those pieces down. Certainly as we talked about maintaining some higher employment as we work through incorporating reliability and driving productivity initiatives, obviously getting ready to de-risk for the 787-10 to 12 a month and the early introduction of the 787-9. And as you know you\u2019ve been covering this business a long time, and this is about a smooth introduction you've seen on a wide body program and particularly one that is at record production rates. And that's attributed to really risk reduction effort and focus early on in the program. Some of the supplier negotiations that we talked about moving some of those to the right as we get more mature on the learning curve within those suppliers. And then some of the productivity initiatives as I've highlighted where we're really seeing opportunities to drive further value in the program over the long-term, but requires some upfront investment. Those are very good business cases. Those are absolutely the right thing to do to drive long-term profitability and cash for this program and those are obviously remain a top priority for us and at the same time we're looking for more opportunities to capture further productivity and cash that will require more investment.","So, we're continuing to focus on that and again I think it's absolutely the right thing to do for the program and again, driving long-term profitability and that's the focus.","Doug Harned","And if I can, on a follow-up on this, on the 787-9 in principle, I mean, this is an airplane that will have higher pricing. You've done design, a lot of design work to lower manufacturing costs for it. So in theory, this should be a very attractive airplane from a profitability standpoint. Can you give us a sense of when you expect the 787-9 to become cash positive?","Greg Smith","I don't really look at it that way, Doug. I mean I look at the program as a whole. And the productivity focus is not just on the 787-9. It's across the entire value chain of 787-8 and 787-9, but again on the overall profile, when you combine the 787-8 to 787-9, we expect to be cash positive during 2015. So that hasn't changed, but the fundamentals, again are more across the entire either supply chain or internally, whether it's a 787-8, a 787-9 or a 787-10, where do we drive additional productivity.","Operator","Next we'll go to Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Greg, I wondered if you might clarify something on the 777 for me. I'm just sort of wondering what the implications of inserting some of these productivity investments into the ER production line are on the margin front for that program. Is that -- by including those in the sort of end of line ERs ahead of the 777X does that have a negative margin impact of any significance? And then secondly, how should we think about the impact of splitting the 777X into its own block and what that will mean for overhead and non-recurring investments, is that a material upper in the other direction? How should we think about those impacts?","Greg Smith","First to answer to your last question is no. As far as the introduction of this, we extend the block by 50 units this quarter and that investment that we talked about that's going to apply on the 777, eventually 777X, that cost is incorporated. So those are in our booking rates this quarter. I would tell you, very smooth introduction. When I say that proving out this technology outside the production system in an isolated -- again outside the mainstream production, proving it out, making it rate capable and then a smooth implementation as you're continuing to build 8.3 a month.","So a lot of that prove out again risk reduction investment upfront but long-term profitability in the program, doing that outside the production system. So we've been doing that and that'll stay the plan to implement that into the mainstream production. So, I don't view that as high risk. I think the de-risking activity has been very prudent and if we see any issues along the way, we have a plan B or I'd say an off-ramp to continue with the current production system. So, I think the risk is very managed. Now, the opportunity obviously is increasing or reducing flow time, better quality and ultimately better unit cost. So, very good investments for us over the long-term of the 777 plus the 777X.","Carter Copeland","And was there any impact on the program margin as a result of the block extension?","Jim McNerney","Yes.","Carter Copeland","Up or down?","Greg Smith","Slightly down. And keep in mind too, Carter, escalation comes into play here that some of the productivity that came through in the booking rate, some of that was offset by escalation that impacted the booking rates across all the programs. But again strong productivity across all the programs. ","Operator","Next we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the supply chain and the $2 billion increase in the gross inventory. We know about the seat issue, GE talked about not being able to deliver all the engines that they would have liked and so I guess to what extent do those delays impact that inventory number and where do you see issues in the supply chain that concern you as you talk about going up to 12 a month?","Greg Smith","Well, I mean, some of that Sam is just the fact that we're going up in rate. So there is some of that. The disruption we've talked about, again, the team has done a fantastic job managing through that disruption, reaching back into the supply chain and helping wherever we can help out. And there is recovery plans in place. So watch item, certainly been disruptive but certainly not something we see impacting the deliveries for the year.","Sam Pearlstein","And can you tell us when in 2016 you plan to go to 12 a month?","Greg Smith","Later in '16.","Operator","Next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky","Jim, I was wondering if you might spend a few minutes talking about the defense business. In particular, comment on the sales efforts on the C-17 and then maybe provide some updated thoughts on, say, the next five years in the defense business historically talked about this being flattish with some programs coming up, some coming down. Maybe just an update there would be helpful.","Jim McNerney","I think the summary would be the outlook remains challenging, but recently looking a little better as I read the political dynamics, just overall comment about the marketplace, particularly the US Congress driven marketplace. But to the specifics of your questions, C-17s, we've got orders and commitments that leave about five to go. We have a lot of action on those five, so I think the team made the right call on when to curtail the program.","You always want to curtail these things where you end up having a little more demand than you've got airplanes at the end, so hold pricing and production and that is playing out well for us. I think in the face of sequestration, the reason for my optimism and it's not wild-eyed optimism, it's a matter of sort of Ryan Murray 2.0 sort of maybe extending the kind of budget compromise that had been fashioned a couple of years ago, another couple of years, and that may turn into a broader consensus dealing with sequestration in a balanced way.","So, it's little more optimism that that will sort out and based on newspaper reports I've seen, Murray and Ryan are working together again trying to come up with some kind of a budget compromise that would include the defense portion. We're well marked up in the President's budget request, more than our fair share of sort of the jump balls, I guess is the way to put it. And so our backlog remains strong, our profitability because our productivity plans assume the worst and what we would like to do is be surprised and so that's the reason you're seeing strong margins in the first quarter in our defense business, notwithstanding some timing on the deliveries which we'll sort out by year-end, did that give you the flavor you were looking for?","Jason Gursky","Yes just -- maybe just to put a little bit finer tooth on this. You've got risk on F-18, F-15 towards the end of the decade, its long talked about tanker and PA offsetting those declines. Is that still the broad brush stroke view of the world?","Greg Smith","Yes, and I think F-18 and F-15 may have more legs to them yet to be proven than the last time I made that comment, so little bit more bullish there. But long-term, that is the way I look at it. The only other thing I'd add to that is that there are three or four major development programs that are in play right now, Long-Range Strike is one, tanker is another one, the U-class is another one and so there's some major programs and if we win our market -- sort of our market share's worth of those or maybe a little better, that will provide some upside to the equation you mentioned.","Operator","Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrell Lynn. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Just a quick question on customer advances, it seems like more recently that's been more volatile than it has been in the past and just kind of thinking about it, has there been a change in policy around how you collect the PDPs? Meaning with backlogs going out so far, is it to your advantage to try to collect some of those PDPs maybe sooner, monetizing it sooner than waiting eight years for those PDPs? Does that make sense?","Greg Smith","No change, Ron. No change. I mean what you're really just seeing is just the timing of those. And as you've heard me talk about before, as you go up and rate obviously and with the strong order book we've seen more advances but the timing of those quarter-over-quarter very difficult to see a trend there. And you really got to look at it over a year-over-year and frankly over a 24 month period because of the size of those, some of those, as well as milestone payments, so very difficult to look at quarter-over-quarter base but no change.","I would say as far as cash flow goes, the outlook for operating cash from us remains unchanged, and we still see strong cash flow this year, again greater than $9 billion and continued growth as we come out of '15 into '16. Advances are certainly a part of that, but just the core operating performance and the fact that our delivery rates will continue to go up as we deliver on the 5,700 airplanes. So our view on cash flow, again, is very solid and remains unchanged","Ron Epstein","And if I can, just follow on with just a more technical question. On the 777X, I think you guys have said that the center wing box is going to be aluminum as oppose to carbon fiber. What can we read into that, with that move on that aircraft compared to what was done on the 787?","Greg Smith","I wouldn't read anything into it, Ron. Obviously when we go through the design of the airplane, I won't pretend to be a design engineer here, but everything's taken into consideration as far as efficiency of the operating economics of the airplane and the weights and that gets taken into consideration, maturity of technology and obviously development costs and recurring costs to build the airplane. So those are a few things that obviously is important key factors we take into account when we're making tradeoffs between one type of I'll say application versus another.","Jim McNerney","And there was no change there. That was always the plan.","Operator","And next we'll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Greg, you did 10.5% of BCA margins in the quarter, it looks like mix and volume would actually be modest helps for the rest of the year. Doesn't look like R&D should be much of a headwind and it sounds like the 777 kind of extension was a negative in this quarter. So other than conservatism, how do you put it to the 9% to 10% guidance for the year?","Greg Smith","I kind of put it into three main areas, Myles. I mean R&D we do expect R&D to pick up a little bit in the back half, in particular 777X ramping up. We'll have more 787-9 deliveries, 787-9 deliveries and then with more 747s as well. So that's I'll say the dilutive impact for the margins going through the balance of the year. Having said that, obviously we got everybody extremely focused on continued good productivity and we will through the balance of the year. But it's really that mix that's driving it.","Myles Walton","And just one clarification. You said the majority of cash in the second half, are you thinking two-thirds or are you talking 80%?","Greg Smith","Well, I would say traditionally as you know we're back loaded, but third quarter and fourth quarter will be heavier than first quarter and second quarter and again, progress payments, milestones, and then just delivery profile.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Spingarn","Just wanted to get a clarification from Jim and then a question for Greg. Jim, on the 777 you mentioned 25 orders and commitments but I think you printed just the seven orders in the quarter. So are these still in process? Are they falling to Q2?","Jim McNerney","Well, we don't mention commitments unless things are largely done. So things are largely done. And there is timing considerations and some cases driven by customer requirements and things and so we let the customer decide when to finally approve and release. But I have a very high degree of confidence in the 25 number.","Rob Spingarn","And then Greg on cash flow just going back sort of follow-up to Ron's question. So you probably have let's call it after tax a $1 billion to $2 billion tailwind on 787 deferred. And you're guiding to a flattish operating cash flow, somewhat flattish net income and I know timing's at work there a little bit. But given that, how should we think about the advance and inventory -- physical inventory balances at the end of the year here? I imagine that there is some offset to the deferred tailwind in terms of a headwind on advances and physical inventory.","Greg Smith","Like I said, Rob, timing around advances in milestones can swing significantly quarter-over-quarter and as you said year-over-year. So that comes into play, as well as, as I said, delivery mix and even the way the orders are profiled through the balance of the year. So again, the outlook on cash flow for this year unchanged. Greater than $9 billion, that's what everybody's focused on generating. Again, quarter-over-quarter, you're going to see variance in there. And those elements I described are really what the big shifts in quarter-over-quarter; I'll say fluctuation you're going to see. But nothing's changed on the cash flow, Rob and we continue to remain extremely focused and I think you've seen, $2.5 billion share repurchase in the quarter alone I think should give you some idea of the confidence we have in executing to our business plan and just the overall business environment and executing on the total backlog.","Rob Spingarn","But Greg, just to be clear, you can do the 9 billion even if advanced balances decline?","Greg Smith","We don't anticipate any change from what we talk about when we gave guidance. So again, I see advances about flattish year-over-year from 2014. But those are all scheduled. We know where they're timed and we know where they're coming from and we have the confidence that we'll obtain all those as we normally do. So, I don't see any change there.","Operator","And our next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Jim, a question on the -- you mentioned the deferral request continuing to run at record low rates and kind of accelerated purchases. Do you still feel confident about kind of the bookings environment? I guess it speaks to the health of your backlog, but you still think you can get a book-to-bill one this year?","Jim McNerney","Yes, I think we'll get a book-to-bill of one, I mean there -- when I look at the pipeline I look what's happened so far in the first quarter, that remains how I see it coming in. And I think that's a healthy sign after a number of years well above that, but remember a lot of the demand out there is replacement demand, new technology replacing old technology. We're in a technology cycle now we're not tied to GDP growth. We're tied to very favorable replacement economics and so half of our growth is replacement, the half is sort of new routes, new airlines opening up and new deliveries, more tied to GDP. But that's the nice thing about what innovation can do for you.","Peter Arment","Yes and is there any concern about just in when you mentioned oil that you're not seeing any push back just related to that, are you, some of your leasing customers have asked production rates not to go up as where they as high as they indicated, are you worried about kind of the capacity aspect or is it just related to replacement cycle?","Jim McNerney","Yes, I think said another way, the replacement cycle numbers still work really well with oil at current prices. Remember we launched the 787 at roughly 25% lower oil prices than we have today. So we felt very confident then and we even more so do now in a higher oil price environment from then that is an attractive proposition for our customer. And as I said, the order trends relating more when you just look at the stats, you look at the R squared, the relate more to airline profitability than it does to temporary fluctuations in the dollar or in oil prices. And they might be very profitable now.","Greg Smith","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Sort of a follow-up for the previous question actually, it was about the sort of the comments you've made Jim over the last couple of calls about running below historical deferral cancellation rates. Can you give me some more color on that? How are you tracking that? Did you look back at that metric to sort of where we are in prior cycles at this point in time or did you sort of like a rolling historical look back? Is there any way you can sort of give us some color on how you look at that metric and help us sort of think about it and quantifying it?","Jim McNerney","It's sort of rolling look back the specific back metric. I think this question, I started working this into our presentations when we -- this is the forego last sir -- back in the last dip and people were concerned likely so about that metric and we just sort of kept it in place. But just to my experience over the last decade, we have remained at bottom-ish part of the cycle, top part of the cycle. The last decade or so, we've remained below that historical average which is a good thing. We can breakout the number for you a little more finally if you like, but in general I think the point is valid through the cycles of last 10 years.","Hunter Keay","And Greg maybe a quick follow-up for you on the comment you made about advances came roughly flat. I thought you said at the conference last month or they are going to be maybe down a little bit because of lack rate breaks, or you just trying to PDPs or are there any other noise in the advances line that would cause that maybe disconnect or might I just -- did I mishear you?","Greg Smith","I mean I was talking on commercial, there is a little bit more on the BDS side that's driving that.","Operator","That completes analysts' question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Tom Downey","Thank you, we will continue this morning with media questions for Jim and Greg, if you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question and in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question please.","Operator","And we'll go to Jon Ostrower with the Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Jon Ostrower","Question about Boeing South Carolina, I am just -- withdrew their quest for election there late last week, I am just curious, Jim, your thoughts on the site today and looking forward as far as the relations with the union more broadly? And whether or not there any lessons to learn from how Boeing is dealt with workforce there in terms of more broadly looking at what's going on back in Puget Sound and sort of how to manage that relationship and whether or not there potentially Boeing South Carolina your view to have sustained on union for to be a competitive site?","Jim McNerney","Listen, you're right, they decided not to go through with the election presumably because they felt they didn\u2019t have the votes, but you'd have to ask them specifically about why they were through. We are very happy with our relationship with our teammates down in South Carolina, the site is technically and on manufacturing, certification, engineering basis doing very well, I am very pleased with its progress. But I also highly value the relationship that we all with our employees in Puget Sound. I mean we -- one group has a union and one doesn\u2019t, we prefer to have a direct relationship with our employees but when they choose to have a union we want to work with them. So it's not either or, our task is to work with both environments and to grow them to their potential and so -- but very happy with developments down South Carolina that place is really doing well.","Operator","Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson","Airbus said today that they're looking at boosting A320 production past 60 months and I am just wondering if Boeing is studying a similar increase in narrow body output. And if there are concerns at this point about the supply chains ability to keep pace with some of the increases coming down?","Jim McNerney ","Didn\u2019t see Airbus\u2019 comments today, but it's the -- I think our supply chain has anticipated robust growth probably from both of us, they see the orders and the backlogs as we do, we spend a lot of time talking with our supply chain working on them with readiness. On readiness issues I should say we\u2019ve announced 52, they count a little bit differently 60 is not -- is roughly the same as 52, 54, I've forgotten how the math works. But I think the supply chain is ready and we\u2019ve spend a lot of time investing in getting them ready.","Operator","Our next question is from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates","I wanted to ask for an update on tanker and very specifically we learned from the GAO report this month a couple of things, first of all that the flight tests are -- you're going to start production ahead of the flight test. So could you speak to the risk of that? And a very specific question, the GAO report says that Boeing\u2019s own estimates of the cost over on the initial development phase is $380 million, is that amount covered by the charge you took last July the pre-tax 425 million or is that some anticipated new charge later?","Jim McNerney","I am not sure about the last number\u2026.","Greg Smith","There is no anticipated charge Dominic, our\u2026.","Jim McNerney","I don\u2019t know where they got it from.","Greg Smith","I mean our estimates taken all that into consideration on first flight as well as completing the balance of the airplanes. Certainly there is work left to be done here and we\u2019re going to get the airplane into the air sometime this summer and that will be fully militarized and we\u2019ll see how that goes and continue to execute the balance of the program. There is no change to the financial position on program at this point.","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","And that will be from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alwyn Scott","I wondered if you could say a bit more about why you feel confident that the zodiac seat problems are resolved. They have said today they got to the root of the problem, but that they are still anticipating from disruption. Can you tell me more about that what gives you confidence that it won\u2019t disrupt your deliveries this year?","Jim McNerney","I think that all of the problems are not resolved. We do have a high confidence in the plan to resolve them, we have and it's because our people are deeply involved with them in the resolution. We don\u2019t anticipate a lot of it being work through till the end of the second quarter. But it's -- we\u2019ve all figured out a way to work together that it's not going to disrupt our production plans and we\u2019re pleased to see their response now to getting this fixed.","Troy Lahr","That concludes our earnings call.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead.","Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy.","After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.","We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussions today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our News Release, various SEC filings, and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our Earnings Release and presentations for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. My comments today will focus on our third quarter results, the health of our business environment, and our performance and growth plans. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. Also we are for the first time providing the operating performance and outlook across what is now our three major business segments: Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space & Security, and Global Services.","With that, let's move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our employees throughout our company, Boeing delivered third quarter 2017 financial results that included record commercial aircraft deliveries, solid operating performance, and robust cash generation. During the quarter, we generated $3.4 billion of operating cash and repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock. We also paid $855 million in dividends, reflecting a 30% increase in dividends per share from last year.","We continued to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, while investing in innovation, future growth, and our people.","Revenue in the third quarter was $24.3 billion, reflecting planned production rates and mix of commercial and defense deliveries. Core earnings per share of $2.72 were driven by solid execution, which more than offset higher spending on the KC-46 Tanker program, which I will touch on shortly.","Based on our confidence in the business, we are raising full-year guidance for operating cash flow and earnings per share. Greg will provide additional details in his comments.","Now let's look at the third quarter operating performance for our businesses.","First, let me spend a moment on the KC-46 Tanker program. The flight test airplanes continue to perform well and have surpassed 2,000 total flight hours. And recently we successfully completed electromagnetic effects testing and the first tanker-to-tanker refueling.","However, the program did see additional cost growth due to incorporating changes into initial production aircraft, as we progress through late-stage testing and the certification process. We have not experienced any new significant technical discoveries. And we continue to make steady progress closing out technical risk on the path to final certification and to delivering the first 18 tankers next year. We remain very confident in the long-term value of this franchise.","Now onto Commercial Airplanes. For the quarter, BCA generated revenue of $15 billion on a record 202 deliveries. Operating margins of 9.9% reflect higher 787 margins and strong operating performance on production programs, partially offset by cost growth on the KC-46 Tanker program. Continued healthy sales activity contributed to 117 net new airplane orders worth $7 billion during the quarter, adding to our robust backlog that stands at nearly 5,700 airplanes.","Key commercial milestones in the quarter included the 737 program successfully transitioning to the higher production rate of 47 per month, along with the continued smooth introduction of the 737 MAX. We have now integrated the MAX into two of the three 737 production lines.","On the 787 program, after carefully assessing market conditions, recent orders, and our robust backlog, we confirmed our plan to increase the 787 production rate from 12 to 14 airplanes per month in 2019.","The 787 Dreamliner family also surpassed 1 million passenger flights, reaching that mark faster than any other twin-aisle aircraft in commercial aviation history.","Also in that quarter, we started building the first complete 777X wing for structural testing, as this exciting new development program remains on track.","Now over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported third quarter revenue of $5.5 billion with operating margins at 10.2%, reflecting solid operating performance and mix, partially offset by cost growth on the tanker program.","Across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio, we continue to provide the best value for our customers through innovative solutions, as evidenced by our $6 billion in new orders booked during the quarter. Those orders included an initial contract award for the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program, an important future franchise, and a preliminary design contract for the next Air Force One.","Additionally, Saudi Arabia became the 20th global Chinook operator, as Boeing received a contract for the first eight CH-47F aircraft.","We also captured an award for 14 Super Hornet aircraft for the U.S. Navy, contracts for our autonomous Echo Voyager underwater vehicle, and an order from SES for seven medium-earth orbit satellites.","Key milestones for BDS included the successful flight test of an unarmed Boeing-built Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile and the Super Hornet and Growler family reaching 10 million flight hours, demonstrating their proven performance and value to our customers.","Turning to our newest segment, Global Services began operating in the third quarter, as we strengthened our focus on capturing value over the lifecycle of our products. BGS reported revenue of $3.6 billion with operating margins of 14.2%, reflecting product and services mix.","During the quarter, BGS won new business that highlights the value that we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers. These included awards from the Defense Logistics Agency to provide spare parts for the F-18, and the Italian Air Force to provide performance-based logistics for their KC-767A tanker.","In addition, our Boeing AnalytX portfolio has more than 200 contracts year-to-date to provide digital solutions to our airline customers. And more than 40 commercial airline customers have signed up for our digital navigation applications in the quarter.","Currently, more than 60 airlines operating more than 2,500 aircraft are enrolled in our Global Fleet Care program, which offers comprehensive maintenance, inventory management, and engineering services. One of our largest digital offerings, Airplane Health Management, allows airlines to make better and faster data-driven maintenance decisions using the digital information flowing off their airplanes. Currently, more than 90 customers with nearly 4,400 airplanes are enrolled in this subscription program.","Overall for the quarter, we delivered solid execution across the company, generated strong cash flow, and returned significant cash to shareholders. And we positioned the company to capture more profitable growth with the successful launch of our dedicated services business.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy demand in our commercial, defense, space, and services markets.","In the Commercial Airplanes market, airlines continue to report solid profits. And passenger traffic growth continues to outpace GDP, with traffic growth of 8% through August. Also, cargo traffic is experiencing a healthy recovery, with 10% freight traffic growth over the first eight months of the year.","We've also seen, over the past few years, an evolution in key market dynamics that we believe, in the aggregate, are driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry. We see more diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective, as well as across the spectrum of airline business models. There's also more balanced demand between new airplanes needed for fleet growth and those replacing older aircraft. And we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns.","Our 20-year commercial market outlook forecasts demand for approximately 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, comprised of more than 29,500 aircraft in the narrow body market and approximately 9,100 aircraft in the wide body market. This long-term demand, combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog, provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates.","Turning to our product segments, starting with the narrow body. Our planned production rate for the 737, going to 57 per month in 2019, is based on our backlog of over 4,400 aircraft and a production skyline that is oversold through the end of the decade. We continue to assess the upward market pressure on the 737 production rate.","In the wide body segment, we continue to see varying levels of near-term demand across aircraft models. However, we have seen steady orders and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide body replacement demand early next decade. For the current generation 777, we have 101 orders in backlog. We continue to make progress on filling the remaining 777 production slots, as highlighted by the recent order from Aeroflot for six 777s. And we also recently firmed up additional customer commitments into orders, and these will be reflected in our next backlog update.","As we have previously mentioned, the 777 production rate moved to five per month starting in August of 2017, per our plan. This will result in 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019, as we transition production to the 777X. At that rate, and with the existing orders and commitments in place, we are in an oversold position in 2018, and approximately 90% sold out in 2019.","And while we still have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on the current environment and our ongoing sales campaigns, we believe the rate plan we put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current 777 to the 777X. As we look forward to the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 340 777X orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft.","Our 787 Dreamliner program also stands on a strong foundation for long-term production, with nearly 700 firm orders in our backlog.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. While the fiscal year 2018 U.S. federal budget has not been finalized, congressional support for our key BDS programs is strong. We've seen support for funding levels above the president's budget request for a number of programs, including the F-18, CH-47 Chinook, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, AH-64 Apache, P-8 Poseidon, and others.","International demand for our defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, and satellites. We are making progress towards completing a healthy mix of previously announced international sales, including 36 F-15 fighter aircraft for Qatar, 28 F-18 fighter aircraft for Kuwait, up to 40 more Chinook helicopters for Saudi Arabia, and the final C-17 for India.","Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, human space exploration, and autonomous systems. As part of these efforts, we are leveraging capabilities and technologies from across the Boeing enterprise for winning future franchise programs such as the T-X trainer, Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, unmanned carrier based MQ-25A, and JSTARS recapitalization, along with other important opportunities.","Turning to the services sector, we see the $2.6 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. Combining the key capabilities of our former Commercial Aviation Services and Global Services and Support groups, BGS is a dedicated services business focused on the needs of government, space, and commercial customers worldwide.","Our objective is to deliver agile, cost-competitive solutions to our customers so they can reduce costs, drive efficiency, and ultimately optimize their operations. Global Services will continue to accelerate our capabilities across all Boeing services and support areas, from our parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, and training business, to strengthening our data analytics and information-based offerings.","We plan to grow this business by leveraging the joint infrastructure of our commercial and government businesses, realizing cost savings to improve competitiveness, building vertical capabilities with life cycle value, and expanding our data and analytics offerings. We will also pursue key investments to expand our services portfolio. Our service expertise, the global reach of our business, and our strong customer partnerships, have us well-positioned to compete and win in this important sector.","In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our teams remain intensely focused on growth, innovation, and accelerating productivity to fuel investments in our future. One such investment announced earlier this month is our planned acquisition of Aurora Flight Sciences, a world-class innovator that specializes in autonomous technologies to enable advanced robotic aircraft in the future.","Other leading-edge investments are being accelerated through our HorizonX unit, such as the investment in Near Earth Autonomy announced last week. We see these investments as strategic complements to our existing capabilities across our businesses.","With that, Greg, over to you for the financial results.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everybody. Let's turn to slide 4, and we'll discuss our third quarter results.","Third quarter revenue increased to $24.3 billion while core operating earnings per share were $2.72, driven by solid operating performance across the portfolio, which more than offset the impacts of the cost growth on the tanker program. And just as a reminder, the prior-year quarter included $0.98 per share impact for favorable tax items.","Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Our Commercial Airplanes business reported revenue of $15 billion, reflecting planned production rates and delivery mix. BCA operating margins increased to 9.9% on higher 787 margins and strong execution on production programs, again partially offset by the $256 million pre-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program.","Third quarter operating margins, excluding the tanker charge, were 11.6%. As Dennis mentioned, BCA captured $7 billion of net orders during the third quarter and backlog remains very strong, $412 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft, equating to more than seven years of production.","On the 787 program we've delivered 35 aircraft in the quarter and booked 83 net orders year to date. And additionally, we extended the 787 accounting block by 100 units. This resulted in higher margins on the program and moderates the decline of deferred production balance, which was down $513 million in the quarter.","As we previously discussed, the moderation of the decline in deferred production balance is an outcome of the accounting block extension and has no impact on the cash profile of the program. Our teams remain very focused on improving 787 cash generation, driven by favorable delivery mix, additional supplier step-down pricing, and a relentless effort to further drive internal productivity and quality.","Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. Third quarter revenue in our Defense business was $5.5 billion, reflecting lower planned deliveries and mix. BDS operating margins increased to 10.2% on solid operating performance and mix, offset by a $73 million pre-tax tanker charge. The third quarter operating margins excluding the tanker charge were 11.6%.","And again, as Dennis mentioned earlier, Defense, Space & Security won key contract awards worth $6 billion in the quarter. Our backlog stands at $46 billion with 35% from international customers.","Let's now move to Boeing Global Services results on slide 7. In the third quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $3.6 billion, reflecting growth in commercial parts, partially offset by the timing of government services revenue.","BGS operating margins of 14.2% reflect solid core operating performance combined with parts and services mix. Based on year-to-date performance, BGS is on track to hit full year operating margins of between 15% and 15.5%.","BGS continues to focus on expanding its global footprint and providing value to its customers by accelerating our capabilities in parts, engineering, maintenance, modification, training businesses, and digital aviation and analytic offerings.","Let's now turn to cash flow on the next slide, please. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at $3.4 billion, driven by solid operating performance across the company and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures.","During the quarter, we repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock and paid $855 million in dividends. Our continued balanced cash deployment efforts reflect our ongoing confidence in our long-term outlook for the business. Since the end of 2012, we've returned approximately $40 billion to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchase, while investing substantially in products, services, and our people.","We continue to expect operating cash flow to grow annually through the end of the decade. And we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to investors. Returning cash to shareholders, along with combining investments to support future growth again remains the priority for us going forward.","Moving now to cash and debt balances on slide 9. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, combined with stable debt levels and credit ratings. Our cash position provides us flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities, while also returning value back to shareholders.","Let's now turn to slide 10, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2017. As a result of our strong performance, we're increasing our full-year operating cash flow guidance by $250 million to now be approximately $12.5 billion for the year. We are reaffirming our revenue guidance of $90.5 billion to $92.5 billion. And we are increasing our core EPS guidance by $0.10 to now be between $9.90 and $10.10 on lower-than-expected tax rate.","As a result of our new service business segment, we are revising our segment guidance. We expect full-year 2017 Commercial Airplane revenue to be between $55.5 billion and $56.5 billion with operating margins being between 9% and 9.5%. Defense, Space & Security revenue for 2017 is expected to be between $20.5 billion and $21.5 billion with operating margins greater than 10.5%. And finally, we expect Global Services revenue for 2017 to be between $14 billion and $14.5 billion with operating margins being between 15% and 15.5%.","We feel good about the strong finish to 2017. And as we look to 2018, we continue to have confidence in our growing revenue as well as earnings and cash. And we'll provide full 2018 guidance during our January earnings call.","Longer term, we are aggressively driving productivity through the business to maximize profitability as we strive to continue to improve cash generation and to achieve mid-teen operating margins by the end of the decade.","In summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results and increasing momentum for our company. We remain focused on ensuring the continued seamless ramp up of Boeing Global Services and leveraging our new three business unit strategy in the marketplace.","We will also continue to expand our efforts in driving key cross enterprise levers to improve productivity and affordability and accelerating innovation across the company, all with an eye towards profitable growth in our second century.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","All right. Thank you, Greg. With a strong three quarters behind us, our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. In addition to the stabilizing commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we've also taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business, including remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts, and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical.","As the world's largest commercial airplane maker, our nation's second-largest defense contractor, a global leader in space flight, and a growing force in lifecycle services, we are as optimistic about our future and the future of our industry as we have ever been.","Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments, and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts.","Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on profitable ramp up in our commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, delivering on our development programs, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, and continue to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry.","All of which positions Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and to create increasing value for our shareholders, our customers, our employees, and our other stakeholders.","With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So R&D was a little bit lighter than expected in the quarter. And you've taken your guide for the year down to $3.4 billion. That's down $200 million. Why was it light? And what does that imply for R&D going forward?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yes. Hey. Good morning, Cai. Yeah. It was two things, really. I mean some of that's timing, just on 777X, which continues to make good progress. So we got \u2013 but we got a little bit of timing there and performance. So it's really a mix as we look at through the balance of the year, our expenditure profile.","As we look into 2018, we should see moderate levels of R&D from what you're going to see this year. So obviously this has been something that we've been laser focused on around efficiency. At the same time, optimizing our timing of our spend across the enterprise.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC","Thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Thanks, Cai.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Morning, gentlemen.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","As we look at the breakout of BGS that you provided today, the year-over-year trends on margins and revenues don't really jump off the page versus some of the things that we've talked about. Can you just help us reconcile that with sort of the growth in opportunity that we've all been looking for going forward?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yes, Rajeev. I think when you take a look at third quarter, obviously this is the first time we're reporting separately in those three operating segments. And the services business that you see reflected there is in line with our expectations. It's a good, solid foundation to start.","Obviously, we're making a number of investments to help grow our portfolio going forward. As I outlined in my opening comments, we see the services market of about $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years as very attractive. We're investing in our core businesses around parts and modification capabilities. We're also investing in new analytics capabilities. And we're making some very good progress there on building that platform of products and services. And we expect to translate that into long term top line and bottom line growth.","In our current portfolio we're investing in a number of areas that allow us to grow our proprietary parts business, low-cost mods and upgrades, our training businesses. You saw some of the progress we've made with our airline customers on a number of those fronts. Global Fleet Care solutions and performance-based logistics solutions in particular have a lot of strength right now.","We're also investing in supply chain capabilities, digital aviation and analytics capabilities. I think a good sign post that you saw was so far this year more than 200 orders in our new AnalytX portfolio. More than 40 airlines signing up for digital solutions in the quarter.","So a lot of good momentum as we build a foundation for growth. And we see this as a great growth opportunity for our company. And by getting all of our efforts aligned under a single business unit we expect that to accelerate our growth, both top and bottom line, going forward. And we expect services to be accretive to the bottom line as a result.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Dennis, I was wondering if you could spend a few minutes kind of giving us your most updated thoughts on the narrow body market, particularly the 100 to, let's call it, 140, 150 seat market in light of some of the recent competitive dynamics that have gone on with the CSeries and Airbus. Just remind us kind of your view overall of that market from a size perspective? ?How Boeing might look to address that market going forward? And whether this move really makes a difference at all Thanks.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Jason, great question. First of all, we continue to see the narrow body marketplace as a very attractive, very strong market. We've said that we're seeing strong passenger growth characteristics around the globe. We're seeing customer diversification.","Our backlog is very strong. We have laid out a current market outlook of roughly 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. And roughly 29,000 of those are in that narrow body marketplace.","We're continuing to ramp up very significantly on our production lines. As you know, we just moved to 47 aircraft a month on the 737 production line this quarter. You didn't hear a lot of news around that, because it went very smoothly. And that's credit to our team for the way they've ramped up the production there. We're stepping up to 52 a month next year, 57 a month in 2019.","As I said, we're sold out through the end of the decade. We continue to see upward market pressure on narrow body production rates.","So it's a very healthy marketplace. We have a very healthy production system. And the MAX ramp up within that 737 production system has been very smooth and strong. We've delivered 30 MAXs now. We expect MAX deliveries to make up 10% to 15% of the 737 deliveries this year. I think that's also a very encouraging sign that we're bringing the latest, leading edge technology and innovation to the narrow body marketplace. And production ramp up is going very smoothly.","We have high confidence in our strategy, high confidence in our product line. The MAX family is winning in the marketplace. In that 100 to 150 seat category that you mentioned, the [737] MAX 7 is performing strongly. And again, as most of our customers look at family of narrow body products, the MAX family is the strongest family in the marketplace. So we're going to continue to fuel that effort.","Some of the recent developments in the marketplace are not surprising to us. As we've said before, it's an attractive market with a lot of global competitors. We like competition. It makes us better. We're confident we can win. But it's important that everybody plays by the same rules. And we're going to continue to invest to win in the narrow body marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Dennis, on the heels of that, you mentioned the [737] MAX 7 targets below 150 [seats], but not a lot below 150. You don't really have a dedicated product there. Airbus, and I think Bombardier before them, have talked about 6,000 aircraft over, I guess a 20-year period, in the below 150-seat market.","Strategically, what do you do? Do you want to get into that space? You already talked about the larger number you have in the space that you target, which is 150 and up. But is there an opportunity maybe for you to have a joint venture or a partnership with somebody else? Or to \u2013 does this change your product development strategy on narrow body for the next go round, maybe having two programs, one smaller and one larger? How do we wrap our heads around that?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, hey, Rob. First of all, go back to the fundamentals here. Again, we have high confidence in our strategy. We've laid out a game plan. Our product lineup in the narrow body arena is centered around the MAX airplane and smoothly introducing that into our fleets.","You can see the strength of the ramp up that we have planned for those production lines. It's very important that we focus on that core effort and the successful implementation of the MAX family.","With 4,400 aircraft in backlog, we're very confident in the position we have and the fact that we're oversold on our production line capacity. We have lots of growth opportunity, both top and bottom line, in our core narrow body business. We have a number of customers who operate 737s today who still have not made their next-generation selection. So, additional upside on MAX orders clearly ahead of us.","Now, along with that, we continue to evaluate all of our strategic options, as we always have. And as I said earlier, recent changes in the marketplace, the discussions between Airbus and Bombardier, don't change our plans. We have a strong strategy in place. We'll continue to look at our strategic alternatives.","But we don't need to change the path that we're on. We're very confident we're going to continue to look at ways to accelerate our core business, grow organically as our primary growth engine. That will continue to be our growth engine.","As we said before, we have clear priorities on usage of cash. Our first use of cash is invest organically. Secondly, returning value to our shareholders, roughly 100% of free cash flow. And then thirdly, mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, that complement our organic strategy. We're going to continue down that path.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey. Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Greg, just wondering. You had the \u2013 first, on the unit versus program differences were, I think, negative for the first time on a clean basis since you started delivering the 787 a few years back. And so I wondered if you could give us some color on the moving parts there. Obviously, I think the 787 makes sense. But really the 737, with the early MAXs and the lower 777 volumes, what you saw there in that line, any color would be helpful.","And also, away from the 787 block extension that you highlighted, did you have any other block extensions or changes in booking rates on the other BCA programs? Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yes. Maybe I'll address that one first, Carter. So on 737, we did have a block extension, 200 aircraft; 767, we also had one at 12 aircraft; and then as you mentioned, 787 at 100. And then when I look across the booking rates on the production programs at BCA, frankly, just due to good solid performance, we had increase on margin across the board on all of our programs. So again great, great performance across all elements of the portfolio in BCA this quarter.","Yeah. On the unit versus program it \u2013 as you know, quarter-to-quarter, there's a lot of mix going on here between whether we have early builds or a customer mix or early entry, I'll say, into service aircraft. And this quarter was really, I'll say, kind of pretty even, as far as no early builds. And didn't have, I'll say, some of the nuances that we've had from quarter to quarter over, again, customer mix or early introduction.","So, good solid quarter all around again on unit-by-unit performance, again across all the BCA platforms, and also great performance on the period expense.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Yeah so that \u2013 go ahead.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Our investment in productivity initiatives and getting that down to the team level on the production factory floors, you can really see the momentum of that investment. And it's showing in the unit cost reduction. And we're making steady progress across all the production lines. And that unit cost focus really drives the right behavior.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","So it's fair to say that there wasn't any big offset. We should assume that the...","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","No.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","...non-787 production programs had very small if any differences?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Correct.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Noah.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Dennis, at the Investor Day, you sounded relatively enthusiastic on actual change to sequestration, not just for 2018, but on a multi-year basis. Wondering if you could update us on how that feeling has changed, if at all?","And specific to 2018, you mentioned the budget process. If you have a view on sort of milestones there, or where you think investment growth could shake out?","And then, as it flows through into your business, do you expect BDS to return to growth on a full year basis as you move into 2018?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet. Hey, Noah, on your first question, if we take a look at the overall defense marketplace, again, an attractive market for the long run. Here in the U.S. with the defense budget, we do see momentum towards increasing the defense budget.","Now obviously, the process of getting through the budget resolutions and the FY 2018 budget, we're still in the midst of that process. But the president's budget request shows an increase of roughly 10% over the current BCA [Budget Control Act] caps that are represented through sequestration. We're seeing support on the [Capitol] Hill, and from both parties, in terms of finding an alternative to sequestration.","And I think as you see, the realities of the security environment around the world, the need for national security, growing momentum for a strong and growing long term defense budget. And I do think that's important for the country. And we're seeing strong political support with that framework in mind going forward.","So I remain hopeful that we'll see an alternative to sequestration. And that that will translate into a long term stable defense budget with some upside to the current budget.","And I think when you look at specifics around Boeing programs within that, again we see strong support for those core programs. And I mentioned a few of them, F-18 fighters, Apache and Chinook helicopters, the V-22, the P-8, frankly, the tanker program. As we transition to production, we see some upside on that program.","So across our portfolio \u2013 satellites as well \u2013 we see strength there. And so that gives us some momentum for growing top line in our defense budget through the end of the decade. It'll be modest growth but we see some opportunity to grow the top line of the business. As you can see, the team has been doing a great job of bringing that to the bottom line as well.","And then additive to that is we continue to see strong international demand. And it's important to note that about a third of our backlog is \u2013 of our defense backlog is outside of the U.S. And we continue to see robust demand around the world for our defense products.","So that combination gives us strong prospects for our defense business. And that will also dovetail with growing our services business.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Should we expect BDS to grow top line in 2018?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, we expect it to be flattish. But the trajectory that you're going to see over the next few years towards the end of the decade is going to be flat to moderate growth, top line, and as we've talked before. And it will be dependent on what happens with the U.S. defense budget. And as momentum grows on the defense budget, you'll see that reflected directly in our defense business. But we see that as a solid core business that's stable to moderate growth through the decade.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was hoping, Greg, you could just clarify on Kai's question. I think you said moderate for 2018 R&D. I just wasn't clear if that's moderate expenditure or moderate growth.","The question I had for you also, Greg, was on the deferred production decline. And obviously because of the block extension, it's probably masking the improvement that you saw on a unit cost basis. And just kind of back of the envelope, it looks like the unit cost per aircraft probably improved about a couple million dollars a copy. Is that the right ballpark? And that's it for questions.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yes. No, you're right on, Myles. I mean we saw improvement quarter over quarter on unit. And again I'd say that's coming from all aspects of the cost structure and the mix that we talked about. But I think \u2013 and certainly you got to see some of that when you were in Charleston, and you'll see that as well in Everett. And as we talked about getting that into the supply chain as well.","And frankly, there's been some productivity best practices that we were able to show you in Charleston that we're trying to replicate across the company. So you saw some of that really coming to a level of maturity and hitting on those units in the quarter.","So good performance. Obviously still a lot of work to go going forward, but we got some good momentum taking place there.","On your first question, relatively stable from a dollar basis. That's the best way to think about it for 2018. But as I said earlier, that's been an area obviously that we've been spending a lot of time on, looking for efficiencies, not only within the program, but across the company. And across multitude of programs of where we can institute best practices and where we can really drive efficiency on the R&D as far as not obviously expenditure, but also from a timing perspective and bring these cycles down.","And so there's still a lot of work again to be done there. But good progress so far year to date. And we'll expect that to continue next year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. Dennis, you spoke about upward pressure on 737 rates. I wonder if you could characterize that pressure a little bit more. Tell us kind of is it intensifying? What are the types of things that you're looking for before deciding whether you would increase that rate?","And on the supply side, how you think the supply chain is coping with the ramp that's underway now? And even if you wanted to raise the rate, when they would be ready to handle it?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yes, Seth. We continue to remain very disciplined on those production rate decisions. As you know, that's an important part of how we're going to manage our backlog going forward.","As I've characterized it earlier, we're in a very strong position on the 737 line now as we bring the MAX online. And the fact that our team smoothly cut to 47 a month this quarter I think is a great signpost and a great demonstration of our ability to ramp up and do it in a disciplined, methodical way.","We're going to step up to 52 next year and then 57 in 2019. As I said, we're oversold against that profile. We continue to win campaigns. And so the general direction of the pressure is upward. And as always, we continue to evaluate additional rate increases as possibilities for the future. But all of that is done through the lens of ensuring we can do it in a good, disciplined, stable matter.","Right now we're very focused on successfully ramping up to 57 a month, bringing our supply chain along. As I said, things are going well on the MAX. But we want to keep an eye on every dimension of our supply chain to make sure as we incrementally step up that we can bring this whole supply chain along with us. And that's where we're going to focus for right now.","And as we consider alternatives and the upward market pressure, we'll be looking at it through that supply chain lens. That's certainly one of the key decision criteria associated with that.","Market forces here are very clear. Passenger traffic trends are strong. As the MAX has been introduced, we're getting great feedback from our airline customers. Reliability of the jet, performance of the jet is outstanding. The value proposition for our customers is clear. So we expect to see continued upward pressure. And we're going to continue our disciplined production rate decision process.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Dennis and Greg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Dennis, just maybe a quick one. There's been a lot of talk about kind of the 767 production, just kind of as there's been some interim demand out there that may be looking for that market size. Can you give us an update on your thoughts on maybe taking production up there? Or what the demand looks like for 767?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet, Peter. We continue to feel very strong about the 767 production line. As you note, we just recently stepped up to 2.5 a month on that production line. That's fueled by both commercial interest, including strong freighter interest, as well as the upcoming ramp-up on the tanker program. The fact that we have a combined line that can serve the needs of our commercial and military customers is a unique strength of that line.","We continue to see broader customer interest. So we'll evaluate those opportunities. But the fact that we have a healthy production line, an airplane that provides a unique value proposition, both to commercial and military customers, and we don't see the 767 line as a sunsetting production line. It's a strong, long-term production line, and it does have some growth opportunities for us.","If you look at that current market outlook that I mentioned earlier, sort of in that small widebody class, if you will, about 5,000-airplane market size out there is part of our current market outlook. So it's a substantial marketplace. The 767 is well positioned. And for some customers, it's a great value proposition.","So we're investing in that line. And that's one of the reasons I have great confidence in the future of the tanker program as well as a decades long franchise for both production and support. Our ability to have a combined commercial\/military line is a unique strength.","Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.","Thank you.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks for the color.","Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.","Operator, we have room for one more question.","Operator","And we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I wanted to go back to Global Services. Now that it's set up, you've clearly got some very aggressive growth targets for the long term there. If you look at this, can you give us a sense, how would you \u2013 how do you split it between commercial and defense? And I'm thinking in terms of what the mix is today and revenues? Kind of how the margins compare? And where do you see the relative growth opportunities over the next five years or so?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah. Doug, right now, I won't give you the precise split here. But it's about a 50\/50 split between our commercial and defense businesses. That comes and goes with timing of various contracts and how we provide service support to our customers. But we expect to see growth across both the commercial and defense dimensions of that business.","And we expect it to be fairly balanced when we look at overall fleet positions that we have with our defense and commercial customers in their fleets around the world and the new investments we're making. And our ability to provide global support to customers on both defense and commercial provides some unique opportunities. It gives them a chance to combine infrastructure, warehousing, spares distribution. There's some real cost advantages to our customers when we can serve them across these commercial and defense sectors. So we're interested in maintaining that balance and critical mass.","If you look at the components of that business, just to give you a rough breakdown today, things that are related to parts and supply chain are about 40% of that business, engineering mods and maintenance is about another 40%, and then items around digital aviation, analytics, and training is the remaining roughly 20% of the business.","We're investing in all of those sectors. We think we have a lot of upside in our core parts business, as we rebuild intellectual property and some of our vertical capabilities. And we expect that to create lifecycle value. I would say in terms of percent growth opportunity, where we really see the greatest opportunity in our digital aviation and analytics portfolio.","As we drive information-based solutions, you see some of the uptake in our customers on things like our AnalytX solutions with more than 200 new sales and portfolios distributed this year, our health monitoring services. As our airplanes, platforms, and spacecraft get smarter and smarter, there are more and more opportunities to leverage that data to provide value for our customers. And the key here around our whole services business growth is looking through that customer value lens. And we think we have a unique opportunity to provide that. And that fuels our growth expectations.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Are there timing differences when you look at some of the things you mentioned, where some of the growth \u2013 some areas you may expect to see the growth in the near term, in the next couple years? And some other ones may be very attractive but longer term?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah. I would say in the supply-chain area and mods and maintenance, those are critical mass capabilities that are in place today that we can grow rapidly, more rapidly in the near term. The digital solutions, while the rate of growth is strong in the near term, building that critical mass will take some time. And those are some areas where we're investing for the future as well, both organic and inorganic. And I expect those investments to pay off significantly in the longer term. So that's the way I would look at the balance.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question and answer session. For members of the media . I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Phil Musser, Senior Vice President of Communications. Mr. Musser, please go ahead.","Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.","Thank you very much. We'll continue now with questions for Dennis and Greg. And so if you have any questions following this part of the session, please make sure to call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002 after this call.","In the interest of time, operator, I think we're ready for the first question. And I just ask that folks limit their questions to one so that we can get to as many questions as possible in the time allotted.","Operator, let's go ahead.","Operator","And first go to Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Sorry, I just picked up the phone. Is it me?","Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.","It is.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Doug.","Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Excellent. Sorry about that. Dennis, you've had six weeks to digest or at least work out what you might say more on industry consolidation and particularly following United Tech\/Rockwell. At the time, you said \u2013 again, Boeing said you were ?skeptical that there were any benefits for the industry, for your customers, and I'm guessing by definition yourselves.","So how has your thinking evolved there in the past six weeks? And how do you think you might react, given you'd previously flagged that you might seek to exercise contractual rights or follow regulatory paths, et cetera? So what's the thinking six weeks down the line?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Doug, no significant change on that front. We've taken an initial look at the proposed deal. We remain skeptical.","We continue to look at this through a customer value lens. And it's really important that as we see consolidations in our supply chain that those consolidations produce value for our customers and produce value for Boeing. And it's important for us to protect the health and diversity of that supply chain in the long term interest of our customer and our industry. And until proven otherwise, we still remain skeptical.","And we do have tools related to contractual obligations and regulatory matters. And if necessary, we're able to leverage those tools and make use of them.","We continue to get more details on the deal. But until we've been able to look at that in some more depth, we can't make any final decisions here.","But just go back to the bottom line. This needs to produce value for our customers, value for the health of our supply chain. And we're skeptical until proven otherwise.","Operator","Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Oh, hi. Good morning, everyone.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Julie.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","I just wanted to focus on tanker for a little bit. Have \u2013 what confidence do you have right now that the technical issues that have cropped up for the first 18 planes are now resolved? Is this the last charge that we can expect for that block? And what does Boeing need to do going forward to avoid a repeat of this with the next big defense aircraft program that it wins?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Julie, first of all on tanker, I think it's important again to put this in the context of the long term value proposition of this program. And we remain very confident there.","As you know, the opportunity is measured in hundreds of aircraft. We expect this to be a long term production and support franchise, one that will add tremendous value for our customers. And the need for the new tankers is very clear. So the fundamentals of the program are strong, the long-term value proposition is very strong.","Now it's been a challenging development program, as we've said all along. And we're not completely to the finish line yet, but we are clearly closing in. We've completed more than 2,000 hours of flight testing. We have six aircraft in the flight test program now. We have more than 30 aircraft that are flowing through our production system.","I can tell you that the flight test aircraft are performing very well. We're about 80% complete with the flight testing required for initial delivery. And while we've had some issues that have occurred during flight tests that are normal to tanker testing, like the boom scraping issue that you've seen in the news, these are not unusual items. And I can tell you the feedback we've heard from the customers flying the airplanes is that the airplanes are flying well. And the controllability of the boom is excellent. And overall, the tanking capability of the airplane is going to provide great benefit to our war fighters and our service men and women.","And we're going to continue to march through the remainder of the flight test program and finish up certification of the aircraft. The challenges we're having right now are related to just implementing final detailed changes on the aircraft to get them to a final certification standard. These are not unusual. But we do have a lot of airplanes flowing concurrently through the production system. So it's a matter of just working through those volumes of airplanes.","Having been out on the tanker production line multiple times as recently as last week, I can tell you the airplanes are coming together very well. The first delivery tanker is out of the factory, it's through paint, it's through the fuel dock, and we're getting it prepared for final certification and delivery. And we'll deliver those first 18 aircraft in 2018. And then we'll move into the production program.","So, work to go yet. We're not completely through the flight test program, but we're clearly closing in on delivery.","Long term lessons here, to second part of your question. It's important, on these fixed price development programs, that we have firm and stable requirements up front. And an understanding when we get to the back end of these programs on certification, as we work through details of concurrent development and production.","We still have some items to work through on how we do concurrency and do it efficiently. We're learning on that. And those lessons learned get applied to the next development program. And again, we're confident on the future.","And I think this all goes back again to the long term value proposition of the tanker program. It's clear. It's a strong value proposition. We're going to deliver the airplane. It's going to add a lot of value for our customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","Hi. Good morning, Dennis and Greg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","If I \u2013 first of all, I'd just like to ask about, the levels of employment here in Washington state have been sinking, partly for cyclical reasons, partly because you've moved work to other places for five years now. And we've passed the 20,000 milestone.","But just recently, some of the programs fell short of people. And Boeing has been asking retirees to come back short term, very short term. So what is the outlook? Did you perhaps cut too much there? And what is the outlook for employment? Do you see it continuing \u2013 that 20,000 job reduction continuing? Or do you see perhaps an end to the job cuts here at some soon moment?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Dominic, let me frame that for you. As you've rightly pointed out, we have been on a trend of reduced employment over the last few years. We've been doing that in a very respectful way, focused on our workforce, leveraging voluntary layoffs and natural attrition.","And while that's true to the overall employment levels for our company, it's important to note that underneath that, we have areas of growth and we have other areas of decline. So it's not a one-size-fits-all in terms of that approach.","And I think it's worth noting that, while we've come down in overall employment over the last three years, during that same time period, we've actually hired 11,500 new people into The Boeing Company. So you can see the ebbs and flows of the workforce that come with a big global industrial company.","Now the most recent action here, as you noted, we've asked a small segment of retirees to come back to help us on some of our production programs in Commercial Airplanes, unique knowledge capabilities where we can quickly apply their expertise to our production lines. Again, that's a normal ebb and flow of the workforce as we work through our production programs. So nothing unusual there from my viewpoint.","We're going to continue to be very thoughtful about how we manage our employment levels going forward. And I'm not going to give you specific projections on the future. But it's important that we continue to be respectful of our workforce. We put a lot of value in our people. And when we need to make reductions, we're going to do it in the right way. And when we have growth opportunities, we're going to make sure we hire and build the best talent in the world.","In the end, our people are our most important investment, and we're going to continue to operate that way.","Operator","Our next question is from Benjamin Zhang with Business Insider. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Zhang - Business Insider","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. I just had a quick question about the Airbus\/Bombardier CSeries tie-up. Do you believe the \u2013 your complaint with the Department of Commerce, does it sacrifice or put in jeopardy your relationship with Delta Air Lines? And also, does the tie-up with the CSeries \u2013 Airbus tie-up \u2013 make you more interested in jumping back into the 100 to 150 seat market? Thanks.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Benjamin, let me give you a little context around that again. First of all, really important to understand that our fundamental strategy is strong. We're confident in that strategy. We're going to continue to exercise that strategy. We expect heavy competition in the marketplace, because it's an attractive marketplace.","And we like to compete. Competition makes us better. But it's really important that everybody play by the same rules. And that was the reason that we initially brought the trade case.","I think as you've seen in the initial determinations by the Department of Commerce, there are questions about the steps that have been taken with the CSeries aircraft. The Department of Commerce will continue to run that process. We expect to see outcomes from that over the next few months.","And our position on all of this is that we simply want all the competitors to play by the same rules.","And we're trying to do this in a very respectful way. We have great relationships with our customers in Canada, great deal of respect for our Canadian customers. We've been in Canada for 100 years. We have 2,000 direct employees in Canada. We have hundreds of suppliers. We contribute $4 billion of economic base to Canada through our supply chain every year. And we're going to continue to serve our customers there.","Likewise, Delta is a very important customer to us. And a great deal of respect for them. We want to continue to work with them and support them for the future. So these are not actions that are targeted at customers or countries. These are matters of fair trade. We are happy to compete. We just want everybody to play by the same rules.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Jon Ostrower with CNN. Please go ahead.","Jon Ostrower - CNN","Hey. Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Jon.","Jon Ostrower - CNN","Hey, question about the process that unfolded over the summer. There's been numerous reports that Boeing was first approached by Bombardier, and Boeing rejected those advances. I wonder if you could discuss why Boeing decided not to pursue additional talks? And what was your thinking around that?","And also just a second piece of this. As you dive into the acquisition of Aurora Flight Sciences, and how it's been working on the D8 airliner concept and the technology around that, how much of that process and that work that's been going on there are you hoping to ultimately bring into the commercial product line, whether it's for existing products or for NMA [New Midsize Airplane] over the coming years?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah. Hey, Jon, on your first question, I'm not going to speculate or offer comments on any speculation around conversations we might be having in industry. I'll just go back to the point that we remain very confident in our strategy. We've described that strategy. We've invested in our product lines. We'll put our product lines up against any competitor.","We want to compete on a fair and level playing field. And with that, we're very confident in where we're headed. And recent actions that you see that Airbus and Bombardier have announced are not actions that change our game plan.","And while we execute our strategy, we're going to continue to evaluate all of our alternatives. As always, we're making a number of organic investments. We evaluate different opportunities for inorganic or partnership models as well. And we're going to continue to keep those options open.","And the key here is we have a strategy in place. We're going to grow organically. We are resourced to do that. We're confident in our product line. And we're going to complement that with other inorganic actions. And we're going to stick to that strategic path. Nothing has changed on that front.","To your second question on Aurora, I think this dovetails exactly with what I just said. When we have an opportunity to make an acquisition that complements our organic strategy and allows us to advance our overall strategic game plan, we're eager to do that. And Aurora brings leading edge capabilities in unmanned aircraft, commercial technology applications, as you pointed out, an innovative culture, agile culture, advances some of our work on building out our autonomous vertical capabilities.","All of those are very valuable. And we are really looking forward to the combination of Boeing and Aurora and what we can together bring to our customers now with this acquisition. And that will include applications in our commercial market segment.","Operator","Our next question is from Patti Waldmeir with The Financial Times. Please go ahead.","Patti Waldmeir - The Financial Times","Thanks for taking the call. You have said that your trade complaint was not aimed at any particular customers or countries. But can you comment on whether you are concerned that the situation may jeopardize future defense orders from the U.K. or Canada?","And also your general counsel said that Bombardier would have to pay duty even if it builds the planes in Alabama. Can you clarify how you would expect that to happen if the production is taking place in the U.S.?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Patty. First of all, again I'll go back to the fundamentals here of we're happy to compete, but it's important that everyone plays by the same rules. That's why we brought the trade case. And we're mindful that while we bring a trade case like this, that there are ripple effects and implications to various customers and country relationships. And we value those relationships.","So when we make a decision like this, it's based on the fact that, for the long term, we have to have a fair and equal playing field. And we're mindful of how we're taking our actions on the trade case, so that we respect our customers while we do that.","And we do think our long term relationships in the U.K. and Canada will certainly outlast this current trade matter. We've been together, as I said, for 100 years in places like Canada and in the U.K. And we expect those long term relationships to be sustained. And we're going to continue to work with our customers in both countries.","Regarding the announcements around production plans and the potential of ramping up a new plant in Alabama. Again the Department of Commerce will go through its evaluation. And I think you've seen in the initial evaluation that there are concerns. It's clear to us that Bombardier's actions on the CSeries, where they have received illegal subsidies and they've exhibited dumping behavior, those will be evaluated by the Department of Commerce. And we'll await the outcome of that evaluation.","And we don't see the recent announcements around the partnership plan or new production lines changing that process or changing our position on the fact that the trade matter needs to be addressed. It's important that everybody plays by the same rules.","Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.","Great. Operator, I think we have time for one more question if we can do that?","Operator","Certainly. And we'll go to Ted Reed with TheStreet. Please go ahead. Ted Reed, your line is open if you're on mute possibly? And we will move on to Glenn Farley with King TV. Please go ahead.","Glenn Farley - King Broadcasting Co.","Hi, guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Glenn.","Glenn Farley - King Broadcasting Co.","Looking at your production rates on the 737 and the upward pressure, you're going to 57, that's been announced for some time. It has been said that Renton could possibly accommodate up to 63 airplanes. You're talking about the pressure, and then we have NMA, which we all expect will come to fruition. Could NMA take the pressure off, considering we would be sort of a borderline area there? Or does Boeing have to build a bigger plant to keep building more 737s?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yes, Glenn, first on your 737 question. You're correct that we're seeing that upward pressure in the marketplace. We are evaluating production rates beyond the 57 a month. That's always part of our due diligence around production rate plans for the future.","I think the great thing that you see is our team on the 737 program has found a way to continue to drive efficiency in that line, so that we can accommodate production rate increases within the factory footprint that we have and to deliver the highest value airplane in the marketplace. And you see that with the MAX that's now being introduced and the value proposition to our customers is very clear.","So I'm very proud of our 737 team, what they're doing. And that productivity advancement is what is allowing us to look at expanding production rate for the future, both the committed rate to 57 a month as well as options beyond that.","And now regarding the Middle of the Market airplane, or NMA, again, we continue our studies there. We haven't made a decision to launch or not launch that airplane. We're continuing to evaluate with customers.","We continue to see a potential entry into service in the 2024, 2025 timeframe. So we have time to do our homework and do it well. We do see that as a market segment that is complementary to our 737 market segment. And we don't see those as overlapping segments.","So this is really a separate decision. And we'll make that decision based on the business case merits of that marketplace. I can tell you, we're going to be very disciplined about that decision. And we still have work ahead of us.","Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.","Great. Thank you all very much for your questions. That concludes our earnings call for today. Again, for members of the media, if you have further inquiries or questions, please call our team at 312-544-2002.

Good day and welcome to the Boeing Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analysts and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","","Troy Lahr","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. I am Troy Lahr and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Smith, Boeing\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in today\u2019s press release and you can follow this broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals included in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I will turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","","Jim McNerney","Thank you, Troy and good morning. Let me begin today with some comments on our strong operating performance and strategic progress in 2013 followed by an overview of the business environment we see moving into 2014. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook.","Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 2. Strong fourth quarter results across our company capped the year of outstanding core operating performance and significant business achievement for our team. We successfully delivered on our strategies to convert our record backlog into profitable growth, executed well on commercial and defense development programs and drove productivity and affordability gains throughout our business and enterprise functions. For the full year, we reported record revenue and earnings, improved operating margins, increased cash flow, a large portion of which was return to shareholders and we reached our highest product backlog ever now totaling $441 billion on net orders from $135 billion.","We also continue to retire legacy business risks, including settling the longstanding A-12 litigation with U.S. government that dated back to 1991. Our commercial airplanes business reported record revenue of $53 billion for the year on an industry record 648 total deliveries including the highest ever deliveries for the 737, 777 and 787 programs. We successfully executed our planned production rate increases and expanded our market share leadership in deliveries that we regained in 2012. In a strong year for orders across the industry we captured record gross orders of 1531 airplanes and net orders of 1355 airplanes which increased our backlog to 5080 jets with a record $374 billion. Commercial airplanes also achieved key development milestones in 2013 including firm configuration of the 737 MAX-8 and to start our flight testing of the 737 MAX-9 and we solidified our long term market leadership in the high value twin-aisle segment with record orders and commitments in launching both the 787-10 and 777X.","On the other side of our business despite continued domestic budget headwinds and tough global competition Boeing Defense, Space & Security also had a very strong year with revenue of $33 billion on increased deliveries of aircraft and satellites, higher operating margins, significant program wins and clear progress in further improving productivity and increasing our competitive position. Key contract awards captured during the fourth quarter included a $750 million order from the U.S. airforce for engineering services on the B-1 bomber fleet, a multi-year service support contract for the B22 and an option exercise by Inmarsat for a fourth satellite.","Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included fuselage and wing joint on the first KC-46 tanker. The P-8A achieving initial operating capability within 10 days by the way of a target established more than 10 years ago and successfully launching the first Inmarsat-5 satellite. Strong operational performance throughout the year driven by our relentless focus on business execution and competitiveness, increasing cash flow and our confidence in the future all supported the new $10 billion share repurchase authorization and 50% increase in the dividend we announced in December.","In summary, 2013 was truly a milestone year for Boeing. Thanks to the tremendous effort of our employees, our partners and our customers all around the world. With record revenue in earnings, substantial cash generation and progress on our path to continued growth and profitability through product rate increases execution on development programs increased productivity and further growth in our record backlog we strengthened our market position and our outlook for the future.","With that let\u2019s turn to the business environment on slide 3. Global customer demand for our fuel efficient and value creating commercial airplane family remains high. As evidenced by the 508 net orders booked during the fourth quarter and 30 added so far this month. Global passenger traffic trends are strong. Air cargo traffic is gradually improving and appears more stable than we have seen over the past year. Recent 747-8 Freighter orders from Cathay Pacific Airways and Silk Way Airlines highlight the airplanes superior value proposition and potential as market conditions improve in the cargo area. The placement of older airplanes in fare of new models that offer compelling operating economics and increased fuel efficiency continues at a healthy pace. Many airline customers around the world also are expanding their fleets to support the ongoing growth in passenger traffic. Deferral request from customers are still running well below historical average while request to accelerate deliveries continue at a steady and quite frankly encouraging rate.","Overall commercial aviation remains a very attractive near and long term growth market and our product strategic advantage continues to position us for significant and sustained growth. Launch of the 777X accepted to buy airshow was the largest launch by dollar value in commercial jetliner history. With commitments in firm orders totaling 259 for this game changing, fuel efficient family of airplanes. The airplanes all new composite wing, flight deck and flight controls leverage technologies developed on the 787 and provide customers with unprecedented operating economics. We\u2019re pleased that our employees who are members of the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, 751, ordered to extend their contract from 2016 to 2024. This solidifies production for the 777X in the Puget Sound region within our broadened geographic production and engineering footprint. In an environment, where customer expectations for quality, reliability and affordability have never been higher, contract extension ensures 10 years of business continuity and further improves our productivity and competitiveness while still also providing our workforce highly competitive wages and benefits.","With the firm backlog for our current 777 family of more than 300 airplanes coupled with strong customer demand and airplane availability this decade, we have high confidence in the successful transition to the 777X. 777 is an outstanding performer and a valuable asset. Based on buying patterns among wide-body customers, we expect the production bridge to be filled over the next few years. The 787 production system is now operating at the 10 per month rate in final assembly, including both the Dash 8 and Dash 9, which entered production last year. Flight testing of the Dash 9 is progressing well with first delivery on track for mid-year.","The in-service of 787 fleet, which now totals 115 airplanes making more than 200 flights per day, continues to set new records for fuel efficiency and passenger satisfaction. While there is still more customer by customer variation than we would like, we have made good progress improving dispatch reliability, which is now up around 98% on average. More work to do on that one, but we are moving closer to the goal line. In the single-aisle segment, airline interest in our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains high with nearly 1,800 cumulative orders to-date. Robust customer demand for the 737 family led us to the planned rate increase to 42 per month in 2014 and the announcement of an additional production rate increase to 47 a month in 2017. Recently, Air Canada recognized the value of the 737 MAX by committing to 61 airplanes and becoming a new Boeing narrow-body customer.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security, we are pleased that a fiscal year \u201814 budget agreement has been signed and fiscal year \u201815 deliberations have progressed providing some near-term sequestration relief for the Department of Defense and our other U.S. government customers. This averts another disruptive government shutdown and provides our customers at least a near-term planning horizon. That said we remained very concerned about longer term budget uncertainty, the ultimate consequences of sequestration on national security and the potential devastating impact to the nation\u2019s industrial base. Fiscal year \u201814 budget strongly funds core Boeing production programs like P-8, F\/A-18, rotorcraft and satellites as well as key development programs like the KC-46 Long-Range Strike and the space launch system. It also provides advanced procurement funds in support of continued production of the F\/A-18 line into 2015. Support for critical Boeing national security programs continues to be driven by strong on cost, on schedule performance that customers expect to meet their needs in a more for less world.","Our Defense, Space & Security portfolio of reliable, proven and affordable systems and services remains a competitive advantage in today\u2019s budget environment. We also continue to target organic growth through investments in technology and innovation in areas such as commercial derivatives, space unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, cyber security and a few critical future large-scale programs identified as priorities by our customers like Long-Range Strike new class and the T-X trainer. Combined with our market-based affordability initiative, these investments strengthened our long-term position and differentiate us from our competitors, many of whom have scaled back R&D in these more austere times. And we continue to leverage our unique one Boeing global advantage and our efforts to mitigate domestic market pressures.","International Defense, Space & Security business represented more than 30% of BDS revenues during the quarter and remains just under 40% of the BDS backlog. We also continue to strengthen our competitive position in all markets by driving further efficiency, quality and productivity to our own offices and factories and through our partnering for success initiative launched last year. We\u2019re seeing tangible benefits of our partnering for success work with suppliers recognizing the growth opportunity that\u2019s available to those who fully embrace its objectives.","These productivity efforts along with an enterprise wide focus on reducing spiraling cost of development programs remain top priorities for improving our program profitability and enabling investment in future growth. One final note before I hand it off to Greg. In December we announced the series of personal moves to strengthen our overall leadership structure as we scale up for future growth and competitiveness. We promoted Ray Conner and Dennis Muilenburg to Boeing Vice-Chairman and named Dennis Boeing President and Chief Operating Officer.","We also appointed Chris Chadwick, President and CEO of Defense, Space & Security replacing Dennis and named Shelley Lavender of Boeing Military Aircraft replacing Chris. While assuming some corporate duties as Vice Chairman Ray\u2019s primary focus will remain on delivering the growth and profitability at commercial airplanes. Dennis has joined us in Chicago where he is working with me in the day to day oversight of the company\u2019s business operations with a particular focus on growth enablers including our global relationships and development program performance.","All four are highly capable; high performing leaders with demonstrated track records and will continue to strengthen our company and drive business results and just to be clear I\u2019m not planning to retire anytime soon. So while you may be seeing more of them it doesn\u2019t mean you will be seeing less of me.","Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?","","Greg Smith","Thanks Jim and good morning. Let\u2019s turn to slide 4 and we will discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $87 billion reflecting 6% growth from last year driven by higher deliveries across our commercial and defense businesses.","Core earnings per share was $7.07 for the full year representing a 20% increase. The increase in EPS was driven by strong operational performance across the company. Operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $9.7 billion before the $1.5 billion discretionary pension contribution. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance as well as favorable timing of receipts and expenditures both of which will ultimately factor into 2014 and expected cash generation.","Moving now to our quarterly results on slide 5, fourth quarter revenue increased 7% to 23.8 billion driven by again strong commercial airplane and defense deliveries. Core operating margin in the quarter was 7.7% excluding the $406 million non-cash charge associated with the A-12 settlement core operating margins increased to 9.4% in the quarter primarily driven by favorable mix in commercial deliveries and solid productivity gains of both businesses.","Core earnings per share increased 29% to a $1.88 in the quarter on higher volume and continued strong operational performance. The $0.28 benefit from the recent IRS tax regulation change for research credits partially offset the $0.34 earnings per share impact from the A-12 settlement.","Let\u2019s discuss commercial airplanes now on slide 6, for the fourth quarter our commercial airplanes business increased revenue 4% to $14.7 billion on a 172 airplane deliveries and increased operating margins to 10.3%. Higher volume, favorable delivery mix and strong performance was offset by the anticipated increase in fourth quarter R&D spending and higher 787 dilution.","Commercial airplanes revenue for the year was a record $53 billion an increase of 8% as we successfully executed on our planned production rate increases resulting in record deliveries totaling 648 aircraft.","Commercial airplanes captured $43 billion of net orders during the quarter, an increased backlog to a new record of $374 billion in over 5,000 aircraft. Gross inventory for the company included $33.1 billion related to the 787 program, an increase in the fourth quarter of approximately $1.7 billion. This increase was primarily driven by the higher planned inventory and to support the production rate increase to 10 per month and the introduction of the 787-9 program. Included in the work-in-process inventory are deferred production costs. The deferred balance for the 787 program was $21.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators and unit cost as we further implement production efficiencies and stabilize the overall production system on the 787 program.","Unit cost is improved approximately 20% over the past year on the 787-8, but we are introducing the Dash 9 into the production system and at the same time increasing production rates by 40%. Overall, the team has continued to make good progress in reducing production flow times and reducing part shortages at both Everett and Charleston facilities. These are key enablers to reducing unit costs and achieving planned production rates and deliveries. We are also seeing good initial progress on the 787-9, where we have seen 25% improvement in unit costs from the first airplane to the fourth airplane to roll out of the factory. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us on the 787 program, we anticipate continued improvement as production stabilizes at 10 per month rate. We are also remained focused on improving program performance and successfully completing the flight test program on the 787-9 and the development of the 787-10.","Let\u2019s turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue on our defense business increased 6% to $8.9 billion and operating margins were 10.8% driven by higher volume, delivery mix and improved performance. As a result of our continued focus on productivity and driving market-based affordability efforts, we have had significantly reduced our cost structure and we are on track for additional reductions that will further enhance our productivity and strengthen our competitive position going forward. International customers accounted for 33% of our defense revenue in the fourth quarter and we continue to drive towards sustaining 30% of defense revenue from international markets going forward.","Revenue at Boeing Military Aircraft increased 9% to $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter primarily driven by higher deliveries. Strong operating margins of 10% in the quarter were due to increased volume and solid operating performance. Network & Space systems revenue at $2.3 billion increased 12% primarily driven by higher sales on ground-based missile defense and Space Launch Systems. Operating margins were 10.3% in the quarter resulting from continued focus on execution and productivity along with favorable delivery mix in the quarter.","Global Services & Support reported fourth quarter revenue at $2.2 billion and solid operating margins of 12.8%. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $67 billion with 37% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 8. Boeing Capital net financing portfolio declined to $3.9 billion on normal runoff that exceeded new aircraft volume. Fourth quarter unallocated expense from core operations of $532 million was primarily driven by the $406 million charge associated with the A-12 settlement and an increase in deferred compensation expense driven by higher stock price and overall stock market performance.","Let\u2019s now turn to cash on Slide 9. Operating cash for the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion. And the strength of our cash flow was driven by higher volume, strong operating performance and timing of receipts and expenditures. With regard to capital deployment, we paid approximately $400 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 7.6 million shares for $1 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased 25.4 million shares for $2.8 billion.","Let\u2019s now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $15.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us very well going forward. Again, our financial strength allows to continue to invest in key growth areas of our business, return cash to shareholders and execute on our balance cash deployment strategy going forward. Let\u2019s turn now to slide 11 and we will discuss our outlook for 2014.","Our guidance for 2014 reflects solid core operating performance and higher deliveries at commercial airplanes business while reflecting impact of the current DoD defense budget environment.","Core earnings per share guidance for 2014 is set between $7 and $7.20 per share. We expect first quarter revenue core EPS and cash flow to be the lowest during the year based on timing of deliveries and phasing of expenditures and advances.","First quarter core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% for our full year earnings. On a GAAP EPS basis first quarter is expected to be impacted by a $140 million non-cash pension curtailment charge associated with the IAM contract extension. Again this will not impact core EPS.","The financial effects of this agreement include the initial cash payment associated with the approval of the extension and the enhanced employee benefits as we transition from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan.","The long term benefits to both employees and the company are clear as the unprecedented 10 year agreement further derisk the business and 777X production providing a stable foundation for productivity improvements and employment of our highly skilled workforce as we strive to remain competitive. Revenue for 2014 is forecasted to increase between 87.5 billion and 90.5 billion.","Our commercial airplane revenue guidance is expected to be 57.5 billion to 59.5 billion reflecting approximately 10% growth as we execute on our record background. 2014 commercial delivery forecast is between 715 and 725 airplanes, this includes approximately a 110 deliveries from the 787 program including 17 new custom introductions and additional flow time to support early introduction of the 787-9.","Commercial airplane operating margin guidance is approximately 10% on improved operating performance offset by greater dilution impact on higher 787 deliveries and further investments to support future business growth. Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2014 is between 30 billion and 31 billion reflecting the continued challenge defense environment partially offset by ongoing international growth.","Operating margin guidance at our defense business is forecasted approximately 9.5% reflecting continued productivity efforts offset by impact of lower volume and delivery mix. We expect research and development spending for 2014 at approximately 3.2 billion primarily driven by 737 MAX, initial 777X and 787-10 development along with continued key strategic investments in our defense business.","Turning to cash flow, we expect operating cash flow before pension contributions to be approximately $7 billion reflecting higher 737 and 787 deliveries and continued strong operating performance. The cash flow in 2014 also reflects favorable timing of receipts and expenditures last year. Higher cash tax payments associated with the improved 787 unit cost in 2014 as well as fewer 767 deliveries as we efficiently transition to tanker production and then finally includes the payment of the signing bonus to the IAM employees associated with the contract extension.","Our required [ph] pension contributions for 2014 will be minimal while we aggressively look for additional opportunities to reduce future pension liabilities we continue to proactively manage the funded status and anticipate a $750 million discretionary pension contribution in 2014.","Regarding our cash deployment, in December we announced the next steps in our balance cash deployment strategy with the new $10 billion repurchase authorization adding to the 800 million left in the prior authorization at year end. We anticipate completing the repurchase authorization over the next 2 to 3 years and further more we increased our quarterly dividend 50% at the end of the year. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investments to support future growth remains a tough priority for us.","So overall strong 2013 results were driven by our continued focus on program execution, production rate increases and productivity improvements. We expect this performance and focus to continue into 2014.","Now, I will turn it over to Jim for some final thoughts.","","Jim McNerney","Thank you, Greg. 2013 was a very successful year for Boeing. We continued to convert our record backlog into deliveries through strong core operating performance that allows us to return cash to shareholders while investing wisely in our products, technologies and people to sustain our growth and competitiveness. Our priorities going into 2014 remained clear. The profitable ramp up in production on our commercial airplane programs, executing on our commercial and defense development programs, driving productivity and affordability throughout the enterprise, continuing to strengthen the position in our defense business with investments in growth areas amid further international expansion, and importantly, providing increasing value to both our customers and our shareholders.","Now, we\u2019d be glad to take your questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. Good morning.","","Jim McNerney","Good morning Doug.","","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","I may have two parts in this, but on today maybe you gave guidance for \u201814 revenues, earnings, cash, they were less than we were expecting, I think others too. Our assumption was that there is some, always some conservatism here, but this appeared to be tied to lower than expected delivery rates. And what I wanted to understand is on the 787 you are now at 10 a month, but you still have a large number of Change Incorp airplanes that should be delivered, so the 110 guidance seemed low to us. And we are trying to understand how you expect 787 production and deliveries to evolve over this year in 2015? And then also how we should be looking at the ramp to 42 a month on the 737 and what that means for production and deliveries, so that we have a good sense of where you are at in terms of these delivery rates? And also just if you expect were these numbers are the delivery rates you are looking at, are those consistent with what you were hoping for say a few months ago?","","Jim McNerney","Okay. They were, Doug, let me just start there and then let me give you some color on 87 and 47. On the 87, I think there is one thing to keep in mind is although we are executing at 10 a month, we are not delivering at 10 a month yet. So you got some transition there of going from 7 a month on the delivery basis to 10, but you got to factor that. And there is a handful of Change Incorp airplanes that are in our guidance going forward for this year and frankly less than last year. So you are taking that into account and then some final deliveries at the end of the year as we work with customers on their ability to take certain amount of airplanes within certain timeframe. So this is all within our expectations. Team is executing very well as you saw from last year\u2019s deliveries, very focused on meeting these objectives in 2014. As you look to 2015, I think you will \u2013 if you just kind of calculate on production rates, you will certainly get closer to delivery expectations, but certainly right now, we are focused on meeting our objectives for 2014 and getting these airplanes into the hands of our customer.","On the 737, we are making great progress, 38 a month and stabilized at 38 a month. You look at the operating metrics around us operating at 38 a month, we have record low shortages. They are improving flow time on final line and making good progress as we look at production readiness getting to 42 a month. And obviously that will come into play a little bit later this year, so you won\u2019t get the full benefit of the 42 through the balance of the year. But again, that team is executed flawlessly and making rate breaks, keeping the production system stable at the same time looking for opportunities to improve. So that\u2019s kind of how we see at least 87 and 37 deliveries going into this year.","","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","And can you say when that transition is on the 37? When you\u2019re expecting the BA-42 and what the implications are for deliveries this year.","","Jim McNerney","We will break 42 here in around second quarter on a production basis and then the deliveries will start to flow out from there and I think you saw in the 87 we just pushed our first airplane out at 10 month earlier this week. We\u2019re making good progress.","","Operator","And next we go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","","Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So I would like to follow on to Doug\u2019s question but specifically with respect to the cash flow guide given that Boeing is very much cash flow story today and again understanding the guide maybe somewhat conservative but the market is actually I think reacting to the other option which that is just disappointingly low. So beyond the delivery discussion we just had, Greg can you simply this to framed 2014 cash flow in a longer term context understanding there were some acceleration in the \u201913 but that\u2019s just simply going to make some investors wonder if \u201913 was peak and if it's not can you help us figure out where peak is, when and how we get there and perhaps within that could you speak specifically to 787 cash flow profile over the next few years?","","Greg Smith","I will give you some additional color kind of going from \u201913 to \u201914 because that is important as you think about timing because we certainly had some very favorable timing late in the year that was really more expected to be in \u201914 so you kind of got a step back and look at the guide, recognize where we\u2019re in the year and then at the same time look at 2013 performance and as you saw from the guidance we issued we far exceeded that. So timing is a big aspect of this from \u201913 to \u201914 as well as cash taxes. So as we continue to make improvements on 787 unit cost obviously we will pay more in cash taxes and that will continue going forward.","Now that will also be long term, be more than offset by us continuing to execute on the rate increases we have talked about and continued focus on 787 unit by unit profitability and that\u2019s ultimately going to continue to drive the cash flow profile over the long term. Another moving piece as I mentioned in my remarks from \u201913 to \u201914 is 767 deliveries which again planned out lower production rate as we successfully transition from commercial on to tanker transition. So again well planned out, we know we need to do there and then from there really lower volume at BDS but those are really the big moving pieces from 2013 to \u201914.","Now to answer your question kind of more long term and I partially address this earlier but the fact is again when you step back and think about you know our production rates and what we need to do to execute on those rates and again 787 unit by unit profitability that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive the cash flow profile throughout again kind of over the long term so we feel very comfortable with that and I think as you saw by our cash deployment announcements on the repurchase and the dividend you know we have the confidence in our ability to do that and return good portion of that cash back to shareholders.","","Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So Greg that presents a fairly sizeable bridge from \u201914 to \u201915 and beyond but you feel comfortable that peak is somewhere in that future? We shouldn\u2019t be looking back at \u201913?","","Greg Smith","No I would tell you, you know certainly you know think about where we\u2019re in deferred and I would kind of put the peak more out in the 2016 going forward timeframe and again that\u2019s I think the production rate increases over that time as we talked about on 87 in particular and then the unit cost progression and improvement on 87.","","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","On the margin side within BCA if you net out R&D and net out dilution from 87 and 47, looks like you had a pretty good quarter sequentially? Usually you have a step down from Q3 to Q4 and period cost I guess at year end and that didn\u2019t happen this quarter Greg? So, as we think about the margin profile maybe you can talk a bit about what happened in Q4, why you didn\u2019t have that step down and why we shouldn\u2019t think that your margin could be quite a bit above what you\u2019re guiding for 2014.","","Greg Smith","Yeah I think Joe certainly the performance on the core programs was the biggest driver in fourth quarter, particularly 37 and 777, so they executed very well. To your point, very tight controls over the period expense, R&D and other elements that supporting a bit, so just good solid execution from the team on there.","As you look forward into 2014, certainly we have the dilution of the 787 as being one of the bigger contributors at the same time, a slightly higher R&D as we peak out on MAX, but really start to get ramping up on Dash 10 and 777X. And then again slightly more forecasted on period expense as we double our production on 87 and get more customers in our fleet and how we are supporting those customers initially as they take deliveries. So those are kind of the moving pieces. Team is very focused on driving productivity. We are continuing to make investments on streamlining. I talked about the production flow on the 87 and the 37, but we are continuing to look for further opportunities there and making more investments frankly over this period in things like automation and productivity tools than we have in the past. So team is very focused on executing and meeting these objectives.","","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","It seems like partnering for success probably played a pretty \u2013 it\u2019s playing a pretty big role in the margin improvement and I was wondering if you could maybe confirm that and talk about what inning you think you are in of the process?","","Jim McNerney","Yes, I think we are pretty much in the same timeframe we talked before. We are at the beginning. We are at the early stages of this. We have certainly, you and I have talked about 37 margin, the 777 margins and particularly 37 through the transition of the NG and the MAX and that certainly has helped. But it\u2019s early on, we have got people obviously that have signed up and we have great partnerships in place to execute that going forward, but we got a lot of opportunity and a lot of work to do from here. And I think again we have good plans in place and we are really engaging with the suppliers and really trying to figure out how do we collectively work together to drive additional productivity and profitability. And again I think we have got some good plans in place to go execute that. It\u2019s going to take time.","","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Thanks.","","Jim McNerney","You\u2019re welcome.","","Operator","And next we have Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Good morning gentlemen.","","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","","Greg Smith","Good morning.","","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Just to expand a little bit on that Greg on the 777 program margin given what\u2019s going on there with the transition.","","Greg Smith","Yes.","","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Now, Jim you said that you expected to sell that bridge out over the next couple of years, but obviously there is \u2013 there are price considerations associated with that, non-recurring costs associated with that and then on the other side partnering for success and productivity, you guys had a \u2013 it seems to be the right assumptions for the 737 transition. And in your comment, in your response to Joe\u2019s question you imply that you are appropriately protecting to those items and you think that the 777 margin can be maintained and expanded or is there some risk there due to the items I mentioned?","","Jim McNerney","Well, I think the big picture here is that a fewer stronger customer franchises out there than the 777 franchise. And there are customers who have invested heavily in this airplane, who are beginning to order the new airplane out in the future. And the reason is it represents incredible productivity versus almost any alternative and whereas we were building a bridge on the 37 in competition with an airplane that was somewhat comparable depending upon who is making the argument. With the 777, we are building a bridge with a franchise that is pretty singular in its strength. And so we do anticipate inability with these customers who are driving the productivity associated with it and the performance associated with it. We anticipate being able to build that bridge over the next number of years as we approach 2020 and then \u2013 and beyond with the new airplane. And it\u2019s all about what the alternative would be as they are trying to build lift in the meantime. And so we are working with them on combined orders for the current 777 as well as the new one. And we anticipate at least the same kind of result that we had with the 37. So we are working it and we don\u2019t think the economics of our current projections don\u2019t suggest that the economics is going to change dramatically. Now are we building a hedge with partnering for success and driving internal productivity? That\u2019s the way we live life around here okay? Now the partnering for success will be hitting and some would say this is coincidental but we will be hitting it's mid-stride right around the time that the bridge is being implemented and that\u2019s not by accident.","","Operator","And we will go to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","I want to go Jim can you talk a little bit about the strategic partnering that you\u2019ve done with the union?","","Jim McNerney","Yes.","","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies","And could you elaborate a little bit more on how you have tried to form a partnership with them when what we see is a little bit of angst over this contract extension? Maybe just to put it a little bit more I mean you\u2019re making a big investment by paying each member $10,000 today and so what do you expect to get tomorrow?","","Jim McNerney","Well Howard this is a good question I mean I think again just starting at 50,000 feet here for a second, we\u2019re exiting a period where every few years we had a dramatic event and we\u2019re entering a period of 10 years of stability. So that\u2019s the big picture. Now having said that the (indiscernible) was close there, there were emotions on both sides of equation but I think eventually everybody centered on this huge business opportunity we have got with the 777 and we came together. Now, just as in the past every few hours we had to go through a period of rebuilding relationships we now have an opportunity to do it for a 10 year period and I think Ray and his team are reaching out and I would also say that the unions, the union out there is also reaching out. I think both sides I\u2019m seeing signs of both sides seeing the size of this opportunity through the drama, heartfelt as it was and there are still some emotion but I think we\u2019re now focused on the business opportunity. There is more interaction right now between IAM-751 and the management in Seattle than there has been in a long time. I mean I think there is they are beginning to come together. So I think there will be a period where we have to work together where emotions will stay play a rule but I\u2019m convinced for the 10 year opportunity in front of us like we have got I think fairly quickly we\u2019re going to come together and capitalize on that.","","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies","Well follow-up if I can a little bit. I mean can we see you know either some change I mean obviously you offer a lot of new people and opportunity to enter the workforce and that will lower the average age over time and that\u2019s constructive development and also not spending all of the capital to move a plant somewhere else. Could you at least provide us with a little bit of indication of how that\u2019s helped competitiveness of the Boeing company?","","Jim McNerney","Yeah I think with the agreement that we were able to come to with the union that became the best opportunity for the company. You\u2019re right it's capital avoidance versus moving the work, it is using some of the best very best aerospace workers in the world that don\u2019t have to go down the learning curve to get things done. A very committed set of folks around the Boeing brand and around our customer. So this was the right answer for both economic, risk and leadership reasons. Now having said that if we didn\u2019t come to that answer we were prepared to move the work not withstanding some of the risk I mentioned but given the agreement I think this is the right answer for the company and it will benefit us going forward both with our customers and economically.","","Operator","We will next go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","So you know to get back to one of the early questions, cash flow guide for \u201814 is considerably below I think where most people were. So could you give us some more granularity in terms of some of the key issues, for example, 787 deferred, how much are they likely to be up? Your 787 tooling was up more than I guess than the fourth quarter, how much is that up? Do you have to pay the $400 million on the A-12? You mentioned the IAM, how big is the cash bonus? And then some color, if you could on progress payments and excess advances? Thanks.","","Jim McNerney","Okay, Cai, I will take a shot of that. I don\u2019t think I captured all of that, but I am sure you catch me if I don\u2019t. Deferred, there is no change in deferred and then that kind of profile as we have said kind of reaching the $25 billion by late \u201814? So that has not changed in from what we talked prior. And with the \u201813 to \u201814 the biggest driver certainly be in timing and as I said we had some real favorable timing in the fourth quarter that initially we expected to be in early \u201814. The cash taxes, I talked about that, but again when you step back, the cash taxes on the 787 are the result of improved performance on the 787. So continuing to kind of come down that learning curve and improving unit by unit, we are going to pay more in cash taxes. And so there is some headwind in \u201814 that wasn\u2019t in \u201813. And then as I said making the successful transition over on the tanker will have fewer airplanes we will deliver on the 767 this year from last year. So those are the big moving pieces. And then everything beyond that is more rather smaller than those pieces. So that\u2019s what it is. We understand it. Team is very focused on cash management as you have seen over the last couple of years and how we have executed on meeting our objectives and quite frankly exceeding them a couple of years in a row. So it\u2019s early, we are going to stay focused on it. And just one other point, you mentioned A-12, that was a non-cash, so there is no impact there. But again, looking forward, it\u2019s all about us meeting our production rates and coming down on that learning curve on the 787. Those are the two biggest elements as we look forward in continuing to grow cash flow going forward.","","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","So you had also mentioned the investment in the 87, your 787 tooling was up in the fourth quarter, is that going to be up and how big was the IAM bonus and IAM pension?","","Jim McNerney","Yes, I don\u2019t expect the tooling to be up. There was a one-off in there related to suppliers meeting summit, key performance objectives. So I wouldn\u2019t see that growing over time. The IAM agreement was about $300 million.","","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Thank you.","","Jim McNerney","You\u2019re welcome.","","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee","Yes, good morning Jim and Greg.","","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","","Greg Smith","Good morning.","","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee","Hey, Greg can I just circle back quickly on the 787 delivery guidance, you mentioned there was going to be less of the Change Incorp aircraft delivered this year?","","Greg Smith","Yes.","","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee","Is that just \u2013 is it driven by the customer timing and acceptance? Are you still struggling to complete some of the early ones? And then just related to that, if you could also address how things are going in Charleston in terms of there has been some articles written, just reducing the flow times, the part shortages Jim mentioned, I think you have made some progress, but you are talking about adding some people, maybe you could just provide a little more color?","","Greg Smith","Yes. Well, let me maybe start there and then I will bring you back to deliveries, but certainly when you look at flow time, you look at unit cost at Charleston whether it\u2019s final, mid or at, it made great progress there. And the team has been very focused on continuing that progress going forward. We have experienced some \u2013 a higher number of jobs behind the schedule in the mid-body section and that\u2019s really due to if you think about it you are introducing the Dash 9 at the same time going to 10 a month. And just a reminder, a most significant structural change in the airplane going from a Dash 8 to a Dash 9 is in the mid-body. So to address this, we have applied additional resources, we know how to do this and we will get those jobs back to what we view as a more acceptable level. So we got mitigation plans. They are building at 10 a month. And as you have seen, we just finished that first airplane at 10 a month. So we know what to do here. We got the right people addressing it. And this is again, this is just all part of bringing this program up to a wide-body rate that obviously has never been done and they are doing it successfully. But there is going to be points in the production system where you are going to have to put additional resources from time-to-time and this just happens to be one of them but stepping back from there that team is doing a great job as is obviously the team endeavor [ph]. On the 87 deliveries for the year yeah there is fewer EMC, some of that\u2019s customer, some of that is that the airplanes that are in flow this year are longer flow. So they have more outstanding work to be completed and some of them had in 2013 so you kind of got to take that into consideration and then at the same time as I mentioned you have got additional flow in there for Dash-9 again progressing well but as we got to introduce that into the production system and get the flow time being equal on the Dash-8 to the Dash-9 there is some transitional period there and then of course on top of that we\u2019re introducing 17 new customers in 2014 so there is some consideration for that through the 2014 delivery.","So those are kind of the big moving pieces within 87 deliveries.","","Operator","And we will go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just wanted to circle back on this kind of came up on a couple of previous question but maybe from a different point of view. When we think about maybe a little bit of a longer term picture and we have got the transition between the 737NG to the 737 MAX. We have got the R&D program ahead of us on the 777X. How should we think about that as a potential impact on margins? I mean do you expect a smooth transition I guess first part of the question between the NG and the MAX that would be interesting and then two, it seems like despite a scope of the project even though it's a derivative a new big wing on a big airplane but that\u2019s I don\u2019t know $8 billion plus or minus a couple of billion sized program right? So, how should we think about those as headwinds in the future?","","Jim McNerney","Well Ron I will take a swing at that one. I mean my view is that the next 10 years are significantly derisked when compared with the previous 10, okay? And why do I say that? You mentioned derivative elements in the new and the two big programs lie in front of us I would add to Dash-10 to that 787-10, technologies harvested largely from the 787s that have now matured. Lord knows we went through the maturational process not as elegantly as we would have liked but we\u2019re now in a position that we can move those technologies into our new platforms and so it is a huge opportunity because the economics of a new 777 the Dash-10 and the MAX are very strong, customer acceptance as you have seen is very strong and the risk that we will absorb in developing them as well as introducing them into production is I would characterize it as significantly less than we have had over the last 10 years and now that doesn\u2019t mean that these are free throws okay? But just more specifically on a 37 I mean it's basically the same line, there are some changes to the structure obviously and certainly the engine build up and the engine itself is different. 777 will also use the same line you\u2019re right, the developing the wing is something that lies in front of us but it's our fourth generation airfoil with the composite materials [ph] we\u2019re going to use on that wing. So we have got some experience with it, it's bigger but scaling up is something is one kind of a challenge a completely new material for any kind of an airfoil is a totally different kind of challenge, challenge that we observed in the last decade and the Dash-10 the third derivative type program is really a stretch of the Dash-9 with some modifications that actually give us an opportunity to make the Dash-8, Dash-9 and Dash-10 more common.","We\u2019re going to use the which will reduce the production risk to the program overall. So whether add a 50,000 foot level or a program by program, we\u2019re highly confident that these are programs where we can harvest the growth opportunity that our customers have told us are there would the huge number of orders with them on all those planes.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","","Jim McNerney","Sure. You are welcome.","","Troy Lahr","Operator, we have time for one more question.","","Operator","And now we have Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Good morning.","","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","","Greg Smith","Good morning.","","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Greg, just wanted to go back in terms of some of the free cash is just directly is advances a source of cash this year? And then related to that, can you talk a little about cash deployment? Are you still thinking 85% of that will go back to shareholders this year or given the $15 billion in cash from the balance sheet, could we see a higher number this year?","","Greg Smith","Yes, I think you will see a higher number this year, Sam. And we are obviously, as I said, we are committed to executing on that balance deployment, the $10 billion of authorization in the dividend. So I think I said before plus or minus 80%, it\u2019s going to vary from year-to-year, but I expect this to be north of that in 2014. So we are committed to doing that.","","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","And then just on the R&D, can you breakup a little bit the $3.2 billion this year, how much of that is commercial versus defense, because it just looks like you are going to see the growth in the commercial, I am trying to thinking should we assume that, that\u2019s going to continue to grow until the MAX entering into service?","","Greg Smith","Yes, it depends. It\u2019s kind of flat. It\u2019s about $1.2 billion, $2 billion. So you are seeing a slight increase there in \u201814. And again that the Dash 9 coming down 37 MAX picking up in investment and that will peak in \u201815 and then again early introduction on the 777X and the 10X. So those are kind of the big moving pieces in \u201814. As you look to kind of \u201815 and now and certainly, we are early in having that discussion, but we are going through program by program and doing what Jim said where are we leveraging our prior investments in technology, where are we applying replication and really where are we leveraging in kind of key technologies that we have on other programs, real obviously team focus on. Affordability and disciplined operating rhythm around R&D expenditures and I think frankly you saw some results of that in \u201813. So we are continuing to kind of work through the next three to five years on that profile, but again, real focus on affordability there.","","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thank you.","","Jim McNerney","You are welcome.","","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I will now retune you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","","Tom Downey","Thank you. We are running a little tight here, but we do have time for some questions from the media for Jim and Greg. If you have any questions after the session ends, please call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002. Operator, we are ready for the first question and in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question please.","","Operator","And we will go to Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","","Jon Ostrower - The Wall Street Journal","Hey, good morning guys.","","Jim McNerney","Good morning Jon.","","Greg Smith","Good morning.","","Jon Ostrower - The Wall Street Journal","Just looking back at the IAM contract debate, Boeing really talked how airplanes are being sold for lower \u2013 sorry much higher relative discounts than the past, as you look at Airbus\u2019 next move potentially putting new engines on the A330 and you are looking that as a lower cost option for delivering the kind of efficiencies that airlines are clamoring for. As you look at it from a strategic perspective, is there any regret from your perspective about not continuing to invest in the 767 as a lower cost offering to airlines, we have more of these I think 767 fleets?","","Jim McNerney","Absolutely, no regret, I think if you look at the operating performance of virtually any of the 87 family compared with whatever they may do with the A330 and it\u2019s pure speculation Jon as far as I know. I know nothing. The operating advantage that we have is very, very compelling. Now could they build an airplane and lower the price to a point where it brings even on some NPV analysis maybe, but paying for that the development you alluded to and still having it all work would be tough in that kind of environment. So, no, we are highly confident that we have got an answer for anything they might do with the A330. And the 767 as you know is alive and well, selling freighters to great customers like Federal Express and will become the basis of a 40 year plus as some people say I don\u2019t know how long it will be but some people say that the tanker program will last 40 years. That\u2019s a pretty good deployment of that capability in my mind.","","Operator","Next we go to Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times","Jim my question arises out of the recent Machinists deal which as you know they had to give up their defined benefit pensions. Many (indiscernible) workers and others in Washington state are pointing to your personal defined benefit pension which will pay out more than 3.6 million a year. I\u2019m asking where is the shared sacrifice from you and other top executives? What would you tell them?","","Jim McNerney","I think the IAM deal first of all was a necessary deal that makes this company very competitive, okay? Now in addition we do have a very, very large even after that deal and some other deals that we have cut. We still have a very large pension obligation that we need to address over the next few years and we will address it and we\u2019re not prepared to have a discussion about that today but the principle of dealing with that in a fair and equitable way is something that we\u2019re mindful of but stay tuned.","","Operator","Our next is from Al Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","","Al Scott - Reuters","I wanted to ask last summer you were saying in terms of the U.S. budget cuts and sequestration that we\u2019re not out of the woods we\u2019re going into the wood. I wonder if you could talk descriptively about how that picture has changed now that we\u2019re seeing more clarity on the 2014 horizon and also just on the commercial side in terms of your sense of the readiness of the suppliers to support your ramps in production?","","Jim McNerney","On the commercial side?","","Al Scott - Reuters","Yeah.","","Jim McNerney","As for sequestration I think what really happened with the deal the Ryan-Murray deal was sort of one way to think about it simply is that it delayed the full impact of sequestration by 18 to 24 months by about a half, okay? And so it's sequestration still lurks out there. It could be dealt with legislatively again. There is time to have a rational debate about that and in the meantime there is relief for 18 to 24 months so that\u2019s the quick way to think about that and in terms or readiness and Boeing by the way as I think both Greg and I said in our remarks did very well with that incremental funding in terms of program allocation.","Supplier readiness, look it's an incredible part of the work that we do to be prepared for this rate breaks. It's growing well we have gone through a series of rate uppers over the last 2 or 3 years. We\u2019re actually entering a period now over the next 2 or 3 years where there is a more, there is the rate changes is dramatic and therefore there will be somewhat less pressure on suppliers but we\u2019re feeling very confident in their ability to deliver the program that we have described to you out in the next few years.","","Operator","And next we will go to Andrew Parker with Financial Times. Please go ahead.","","Andrew Parker - Financial Times","Jim I wonder if I could ask you a sort of broad macroeconomic question please, you all have seen I mean for some time now China, India, Indonesia several emerging market economies reporting economic slowdown and now we\u2019re seeing significant currency volatility of a currency like the Indonesian currency against the dollar. Are you at all concerned that this is going to have a negative impact on your commercial aircraft or the backlog in other words are you alert and concerned about the risk that some airlines as a result of lower growth currency volatility, you could actually cancel orders, differ deliveries et cetera. How do you look at it?","","Jim McNerney","We haven't seen that yet and we have had no sort of leading indicator discussions with people either. So I think from time-to-time we do have these currency flurries. China as they go through their leadership transition, there is some uncertainty and a point or two of slowdown in the overall economy as they try to get their feet underneath them with the new leadership. I don\u2019t think the China story has changed firstly. I see the currency as a country by country. And I think the big picture and so I don\u2019t see an epidemic at this stage.","And the other thing to be my flow is that half of the planes we sell are a very, very big value proposition to these airlines. The planes they are replacing are dramatically inefficient versus the ones that we have whether it\u2019s the new 777 and 787. So a 10% move in currency, even the 20% move in currency, is it going to get in the way of providing 30%, 40% improvements in overall economics that these planes have. So we are a little insulated in that way too.","","Operator","Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg","Hey guys.","","Jim McNerney","Hi.","","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg","Obviously, you had blockbuster year for orders last year, just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color for what you expect for 2014 and also what your thinking is for book-to-bill, do you see orders exceeding deliveries?","","Jim McNerney","Well, I think this year will be as we look at it, it feels like at least a book-to-bill of 1-to-1 coming up this year.","","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg","Alright, that\u2019s it.","","Tom Downey","Operator, we have time this morning for one last question please.","","Operator","And that will be from Josh Freed with the Associated Press. Please go ahead.","","Josh Freed - Associated Press","Hi there. You mentioned the customer by customer variation in the reliability for the 787, so I just wondered if you can say more about that, I mean, why would there be differences from one customer to the next? And what kinds of reliability what are maybe sort of the top one or two reliabilities you are just still dealing with on that?","","Jim McNerney","Well, each customer has different ways of using and operating the airplane. There is also some randomness about it, but 98% which is the average is a pretty good number. About I think about 45% of the fleet is operating above the 98.5%, which is getting closer to our 99% plus objective. So there is just sort of standard randomness, but also some operating things, the operating differences across the airlines, but there is still some software debugging that\u2019s going on. There is some electromechanical systems that have to be replaced a little more often than we want them to be replaced, but all those trends are coming down. And so we remain confident that we are that this year we are going to reach our goal of getting over 99% reliability.","","Tom Downey","That concludes our earnings call.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy J. Lahr - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm Troy Lahr, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer. After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release, and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings, and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Troy, and good morning. My comments today will focus on our first quarter results, the ongoing health of our business environment, and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook.","Now let's move to slide two. Boeing delivered solid first quarter 2016 financial results that included higher revenue, increased operating cash flow, and core earnings per share that reflect the underlying operating strength of our company. We also continued to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy of investing in innovation, growth and our people, and returning cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we repurchased $3.5 billion of Boeing stock and increased our dividend per share 20%, for a payout of $717 million.","Revenue in the first quarter grew to $22.6 billion. Core earnings per share of $1.74 were driven by continued strong operating performance across our core production programs, offset by an additional investment we made to maintain our schedule commitments on the KC-46 tanker program. Net of tanker, core EPS was strong. And as Greg will outline in more detail, our year-end guidance is reaffirmed, driven by our solid operating performance.","The $156 million after-tax charge on tanker primarily reflects the cost of incorporating engineering changes identified during testing into aircraft already built and in production, along with the certification of those changes. To meet our commitment to deliver this much-needed capability to U.S. war fighters and ramp up production on schedule, we are concurrently building production aircraft while we move through the remaining testing.","Overall, we continue to make progress through the late stages of development and ongoing flight testing, with all four development test aircraft now in the air, giving us confidence to make this investment. We have completed more than 500 flight test hours and have refueled an F-16, an F\/A-18, and an AV-8B Harrier, and we've received fuel from a KC-10, all requirements on the path to achieve the Milestone C production approval from the U.S. Air Force, which we expect around the end of the second quarter.","Recognizing the risks inherent in any large-scale development program, including from start to finish of flight testing, we remain on path to meet the commitments we've made to our customer, and our team is keen to move forward with production and deliver the first 18 tankers by August of 2017. With a long-term market of up to 400 aircraft worth approximately $80 billion, the KC-46 remains a franchise program, and we expect to realize solid returns over decades of production and in-service support.","Now let's look at the first quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing Commercial Airplanes [BCA], we delivered 176 new jetliners and added 121 net new orders worth $6 billion. First quarter revenue was $14.4 billion. Operating margins were 7.2%, reflecting overall solid core operating performance, offset by the impact of the tanker charge and planned R&D spending.","Key milestones in the quarter included the start of 737 MAX flight testing and major assembly of the 787-10 and the launch of the next-generation 737 freighter conversion program.","At Boeing Defense, Space & Security [BDS], first quarter revenue increased 19% to $8 billion. Operating margins were a healthy 10.3%, reflecting strong performance, offset by a portion of the tanker charge. Key new business awards included a contract with the U.S. Navy for 20 P-8A Poseidon aircraft and finalization of a U.S. Army contract for 117 AH-64 Apache helicopters.","Also during the quarter, our Puget Sound-based engineering union ratified a new six-year contract that will provide labor stability as we move through our slate of key development programs while rewarding our world-class engineering and technical workforce for their contributions to our success, and strengthening our balance sheet by completing our shift to defined contribution retirement plans for all employees.","In summary, we reported solid core operating performance, achieved critical milestones, and returned significant cash to shareholders, all of which Greg will cover in more detail in a moment.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide three. We continue to see a generally healthy commercial airplane marketplace, driven by improving airline profitability, strong passenger traffic growth, and meaningful replacement demand. According to the International Air Transport Association [IATA], passenger traffic is off to its strongest start in eight years, with traffic growing 8% in early 2016. Over the past three years, we have seen passenger traffic growth consistently outpace global GDP and airline capacity growth, a key indicator that the supply and demand dynamic remains positive.","Additionally, global airline load factors are at record levels of about 80% and daily airplane utilization at an all-time high of nine hours. Those figures attest to the airlines' efficient management of capacity and utilization of assets.","In contrast to the strength of passenger traffic, the global air cargo market is off to a slow start this year, with air freight traffic declining 2% over the first two months. However, we continue to expect approximately 3% growth for the full year. As always, we continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced.","With regard to oil prices, while we have seen a rebound from the February lows, prices are still well below the 15-year average. With that said, our customers are telling us that current oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules.","Airplane order activity is continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. Meanwhile, requests to change deliveries remain well below the historical average. As a matter of fact, in the past year, deferrals, accelerations, debookings, and cancellations combined for about 1% of our backlog. That is well below the 6% average over the last 15 years. We believe this speaks to the compelling and enduring value proposition that our airplanes provide to our customers. This ongoing market demand coupled with our sizeable and diverse backlog of more than 5,700 airplanes reinforces our planned production rate increases through the end of this decade as we ramp up annual deliveries to well above 900, and continues to position us for steady revenue, earnings, and cash growth in the years ahead.","Turning to individual airplane programs, demand remains strong for the 737, with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. To satisfy the demand, we remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 a month to 47 a month in 2017, followed by 52 a month in 2018, and then 57 a month in 2019. The production bridge between the current 737NG and the 737 MAX remains in an oversold position. To accommodate customers with nearer-term needs, we will continue to manage the 737 skyline in a manner that creates value for both us and them.","Turning to the twin-aisle market, with a strong foundation of 306 orders from six customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high. For the current generation 777, our backlog as of the end of the quarter stood at 205 airplanes. We are sold out of production slots in 2016 and more than 80% sold out in 2017. Building on our favorable existing base of sold firm slots, 2018 is a priority for us this year, as we work to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X while remaining flexible to respond to market dynamics. So far this year, we have added 11 new 777 orders, a solid first step towards our target of 40 to 50 orders a year to finish filling the 777 production bridge.","On the 787 program, our backlog of about 750 orders remains the foundation behind our planned production rate increases to 12 per month this year and 14 per month later this decade. In fact, during the quarter, we began final assembly on the 787 program at the 12 per month rate. To date, we have delivered more than 390 787s, including nearly 100 787-9s. And the airplane continues to excel at opening new routes and delivering profitability and performance in operation.","Finally, the air cargo market headwinds I mentioned earlier continue to pressure demand and pricing for the 747-8 Freighter. As you recall, in the fourth quarter of last year we made the necessary adjustments to align our 747 production rate to the current market environment. This past quarter, we also recognized an adjustment in market pricing, which Greg will cover in more detail. Thus far this year, we have captured four 747-8 Freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to fill the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market will remain challenging until the air cargo market fully recovers and we reach the 747-400 Freighter replacement cycle, expected to begin in 2019.","Overall, the outlook for our commercial airplane business remains strong as we continue to execute on our robust backlog with planned rate increases on the 737, 787, and 767, smoothly transition 737 production to the 737 MAX, and complete development of the 777X and 787-10.","Now turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms amid a diverse global threat environment. Domestically, the President's budget request fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs, including the P-8 Poseidon, KC-46 tanker, V-22, ground-based missile defense, Apache and Chinook helicopters, as well as space programs like NASA's new space launch system. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites, and services. During the first quarter, international customers represented 37% of BDS revenue and 37% of the current backlog.","The strength of our Defense & Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation, along with our continued focus on affordability and productivity through our ongoing market-based affordability and Partnering for Success efforts. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, space, services, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. We are also investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X Trainer, JSTARS recapitalization, MQ-XX, formerly known as UCLASS, advanced weapons programs, and other important opportunities.","One last comment before I pass the mic to Greg; as an enterprise, we remain steadfast and confident about our position and future prospects, yet we also recognize that we cannot stand still and sustain our industry leadership in the face of intense competition. For Boeing to continue winning in our second century of business, it is imperative that we seize the initiative to get on and stay on a steep and steady glide path to lower cost performance. We intend to play offense and accelerate our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity, and organizational improvements throughout the entire One Boeing enterprise and in our supply chain, enhancing affordability and our competitive position in the market, creating capacity to invest, increasing operating margins, and driving shareholder value.","In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and our teams are focused on innovation, growth, and delivering solid operating performance.","Now, over to Greg for our financial results.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everybody.","Let's turn to slide four and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased to $22.6 billion, driven by solid commercial deliveries and strong defense revenue growth. Core earnings per share of $1.74 was impacted by the $0.24 tanker charge and $0.07 747 charge, which is partially offset by improved execution and higher volumes. The 747 charge reflects a change in the estimated revenue on future 747-8 Freighter sales.","Let's now discuss commercial airplanes on slide five. For the first quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $14.4 billion on 176 airplane deliveries and operating margins of 7.2%. Operating margins in the quarter were primarily impacted by the $162 million pre-tax tanker charge and the $70 million pre-tax 747 charge, as well as higher planned R&D as we ramp up on the 777X.","Commercial Airplanes captured $6 billion of net orders during the first quarter. And the backlog remains very strong at $424 billion and over 5,700 aircraft, equating to more than seven years of production. Specifically on the 787 program, we've now delivered more than 390 aircraft, including approximately 100 787-9s. And as planned, the 787-9 deliveries will notably exceed 787-8 deliveries in 2016.","787 deferred production was better than planned and increased $141 million to $28.7 billion in the first quarter, reflecting the favorable mix towards more 787-9s as well as continued unit cost reductions. This reflects a 30% decline in quarter-over-quarter deferred production growth. We expect a similar rate of decline in deferred production growth in the second quarter. And for the full year, the deferred production balance should be flat year-over-year, again, no change to this fundamental milestone.","As Dennis indicated, we began final assembly on the 787 program at the 12 per month rate, and we expect to begin delivery at that rate by mid this year.","We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning production of the 787-9, increasing deliveries, reducing production flow times, lowering unit cost, and improving overall aircraft reliability. However, more work ahead of us as we strive to further reduce unit costs and smoothly introduce the 787-10 into the production system, which is on track for later this year.","Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on slide six; first quarter revenue at our Defense business increased 19% to $8 billion. And operating margins were solid at 10.3%, largely driven by strong performance that was offset by the BDS $81 million pre-tax tanker charge.","Boeing Military Aircraft first quarter revenue increased 34% to $3.7 billion, reflecting higher F-15 and C-17 deliveries. Operating margins of 9.1% reflect the impact of the tanker charge, partially offset by favorable delivery mix.","Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion. Operating margins of 8.5% reflect the timing of ULA launches.","Global Services & Support revenue increased 14% to $2.6 billion, reflecting higher volume in aircraft modernization and sustainment and training systems. Operating margins of 13.3% was driven by solid performance and favorable program mix.","Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $56 billion, with 37% of that business now from customers outside the United States.","Let's move to slide seven to discuss cash flow. Operating cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first quarter was better than planned and was primarily driven by solid operating performance and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. We continue to expect 2016 operating cash flow to be approximately $10 billion, with the majority generated in the second half of the year.","With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $717 million in dividends and repurchased 29 million shares for $3.5 billion in the first quarter, as we continue to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $10.5 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next two years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued invest to support future growth remains top priority for us.","Let's now move to cash and debt balances on slide eight. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.","Let's now turn to slide nine, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, segment margins, core earnings, deliveries, and cash flow. The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results, and we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation, and providing efficient deployment of that cash.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Greg.","With a solid first quarter behind us, we remain focused on growth, disciplined execution, quality and productivity improvements, and meeting our customer commitments. Our priorities going forward can be framed by two overarching objectives: first, to continue building strength on strength to deliver on our existing plans and commitments and improve them where needed; and second, to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts to achieve our full potential.","Achieving both objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our Defense & Space business, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and to create increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.","With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Dennis, there are certainly more and more press articles every day in terms of your interest or the company's interest in getting a larger presence in the aftermarket stream aside from some manufacturing and handing off aircraft from your sites. I was wondering. Can you talk a bit about initiatives you have in place there and maybe contextualize with where your non-manufacturing revenues are today at BCA and where you could go in the next few years? Thanks.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Myles, great question. And as we mentioned before, growing our services business across the Boeing enterprise is one of our top priorities going forward. We do see a significant opportunity there. If you look across the commercial and defense sectors over the next 20 years, that's about a $4 trillion market space, and we have significant opportunities to grow within that existing market space.","Our strategy includes organic investments in areas like parts streams and our ability to deliver high-value spares to our customers, low-cost modifications and upgrades to existing fleets that leverage our OEM knowledge. And we also see a growing opportunity in some of the information-based services markets and providing value-added services associated with the wealth of information in our new airplanes. So that deep OEM knowledge we believe differentiates us in the services marketplace, and we'd like to take some of the prowess that we have in the production capacity and move that into the lifecycle support element of the fleets. We're doing that in collaboration with our customers and in many cases in collaboration with our supply chain. But we do think that represents significant both top line and bottom line growth opportunity for us.","Similarly, in the defense space, we see opportunities to do that and cross-leverage in areas like our commercial derivative platforms. And I think somewhat uniquely when we look at our global industrial base and our global presence, our ability to service commercial and defense fleets around the world better than anybody else can be a differentiator for us.","So bottom line there, we see services as a big growth opportunity for us. It's primarily organic investment that we're making. And where we can complement that with selective inorganic investments, we will.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is there any metric that you can provide, Dennis or Greg, around where non-aircraft manufacturing is in BCA right now, where you want it to go on whatever metric you want us to look at?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not going to give you specific target numbers, but what I will say is that if you take a look at our services business today and look at market growth opportunities, these are opportunities that are measured in 5% to 10% growth rates.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you very much. Could you comment on were there any changes in the block sizes, changes in the profit accrual rate, and the impact of price escalation on your profitability in the quarter and moving forward?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Yes, thanks, Cai. On the 737, we had one block extension. Obviously, that was 200 units, all 737 MAX airplanes, and that was favorable to the overall block, Cai.","Escalation did impact us I'd say across the product lines slightly throughout the quarter. Just again, with the decline in oil prices that's taken place, we've had to adjust the revenue profile of that going forward, but not a big impact to the quarter but a slight impact.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","And on pricing, no change related to pricing there, Cai, overall.","Operator","And next we'll go to Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jason.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I wonder if you could \u2013 hey. Can we just step back for a second and talk about cancellations and deferrals? It's great that you provided a little bit more detail during the quarter on historic cancellations and deferrals. And as you noted, Dennis, in your prepared remarks, they're running well below average. So I think it would be helpful for everyone just to understand what happens to your announced production rates if for whatever reason we accelerate back up to those historic averages on cancellations and deferrals. Do planned production rates stick? Do we see a deceleration of the growth in the production rates? Do we need to see production rates decline? Just give us some context around cancellations and deferrals and what happens when they go back to historic norms.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Hey, Jason, let me take that one on here. One of the reasons we're confident with the production rate adjustments and ramp-ups that we've already announced is that we factored in those historical trends. Now the fact that the current trends with cancellations and deferrals operating at about 1% of backlog are favorable compared to history just further strengthens our confidence. But the decisions we've made to ramp up 737 to 47 a month, 52 a month, and then 57 a month and the ramp-ups we have planned for 787 all take into context these historical factors. So if we were to see deferrals and cancellations begin to creep up, we wouldn't change our plans. We've in fact designed our plans to envelope those historical averages.","Now that all said, we're not seeing anything in the data right now nor would I speculate that we're going to see those deferrals and cancellations move back to those historical levels. We continue to see strong passenger growth. We are mindful of that quarter over quarter, and we continue to watch it closely. But the strength of passenger growth is consistent, so I said about 8% growth so far this year. Independent analysis is saying 6% to 7% globally growth year over year. And we're going to continue to watch that and be mindful of it. But all of the trends right now support the analysis that we've done. And even if we would see some creep back towards historical levels, we remain very confident in the production rate decisions we've made.","As you well know, when we go through these production rate decisions, these are not decisions we make lightly. We take a hard look at all of the historical factors, risks, and opportunities, and we believe the decisions we've made are well within the envelope of balanced supply and demand.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee CRT. Please go ahead.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Hey. Good morning, Dennis and Greg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Hey, good morning.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Back on the 787, great progress on the deferred. Greg, can you walk us through or just remind us a little bit how the impact of the 787-10 is going to have, as I assume it would be similar to the 787-9 in terms of its commonality and yet it's higher priced? How should we be thinking about that as that enters the production block?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","I think you hit it, Peter. That's exactly the way to think about it. On the commonality side, as you know, that was a key factor as we developed that airplane to get it into the production system and get the commonality to the 787-9. And we're well north of 95% with regards to commonality in the factory. So that's going extremely well. That will certainly help as we introduce that into the production system and start ramping rate up on that, and I'd say that's progressing well. And as you know, we'll start to deliver that airplane in 2018. So we're watching that progress through the system. And like I said, development has gone very well as is early assembly and fabrication efforts. So I think we're tracking well, but think of it just like you did, like you mentioned on the 787-9, very smooth, deliberate introduction into that system and then get the rate up...","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","...because that will become an important part of the mix within the overall profile of the 787.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","And that's on existing final assembly lines, right, not on the side (30:43) anymore?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Great, thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And next we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. On the defense side of the business, I wonder if you could talk about some of the opportunities that are particularly on the fighter side. There has been some news about potential orders for Kuwait and for Qatar and the potential of starting an F-18 line in India. And how you're thinking about the fighter franchises going forward, and whatever specificity you could provide about if those orders for Kuwait and Qatar were to come through, where that would take production on those programs in St. Louis?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Seth. Thanks for the question. When you take a look at our fighter lines, it's both domestic and international opportunities. I think it's important to note that as you've seen in the fiscal year 2017 budget deliberations here in the U.S., some strong support from our U.S. Navy requesting additional F-18s for the domestic fleet. And we're hopeful that as part of the FY 2017 budget deliberations that there will be additional Super Hornets included in the budget. I think as you're aware, the U.S. Navy's request here has an unfunded request in the system for 14 additional aircraft plus two via OCO [Overseas Contingency Operations] funding. So there are domestic opportunities, and supporting our customer here in the U.S. to make sure that they have the right fighter fleets and capacity for the future I think is an important part of the equation. And we continue to see strong support for the Super Hornet as well as modifications and upgrades to the F-15 Eagles.","Internationally, as you alluded to, there are a number of opportunities and campaigns that are well underway. They are global, including opportunities in the Middle East. And while I can't comment on specific campaigns, I want to respect our customer's process here. We do see opportunities in the Middle East. The press reports you've seen around Qatar and Kuwait are certainly two very important customers for us. Remember, those are all governed by the foreign military sales process and are government-to-government arrangements. We're supporting those, but we do see opportunities for both the F-18 and the F-15 internationally, Middle East, Asia-Pacific, potential opportunities in Europe and Canada as well. And all of those give us some level of confidence that we'll be able to extend those fighter lines into the early 2020s.","And that presents an opportunity for us that's important and one that we continue to pursue. And that business base gives us the capacity to invest in future product lines as well that leverage our St. Louis workforce. So we're encouraged by some of the progress there. But again, those international deals are really government-to-government arrangements, and we'll continue to support those appropriately.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I wanted to follow up a little bit, Dennis, on what you were talking about at the end of your monologue about playing offense and your greater attention to the total lifecycle opportunity. So while it's clear that you see something for Boeing here, to what extent is this effort being driven by the carriers? You did mention your customers, and it sounds like there's some thrust from them in this process.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","When we think about growing the services business, Rob, and more broadly lifecycle support, that starts with our customers because our objective here is to make sure that the airplanes we're delivering and the usage they're getting from those airplanes is profitable and productive and reliable. And our business thrives on reliable, productive fleets for our customers, and that's true in both our Commercial and Defense business. And we believe that our OEM knowledge and depth of detail on the airplane design can add value throughout the entire lifecycle.","I think as you're well aware, if you look at the installed commercial fleets, you could argue that we're about 50% of the installed fleet. Yet if you look at our market share in terms of services today, we're about 6% to 7% market share in services. And I believe it's reasonable for a company like Boeing with the OEM depth and knowledge we have to have a larger share of the services market, and I think that's to the advantage of our customers. And part of the value equation that we're bringing to bear here is Boeing, with our supply chain providing better capability, better efficiency, better profitability for our customers, it's adding value both for them and for Boeing. Those are the kind of business models we're pursuing.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, Dennis, I guess the natural follow-on question here is this is a bit of a zero-sum game. We're talking a bit about a share shift toward Boeing. How do you manage that with your supply chain? Because if we're benefiting the airlines and if Boeing is going to take a larger share, how do we do this without disrupting the supply chain?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, Rob, I don't see this as a zero-sum game. This is a growing marketplace that we're operating in. As we've mentioned previously, we look at what's happening in global growth of commercial traffic, our market outlook for the next 20 years, 38,000 new aircraft needed by our customers, growing passenger base. This is a growing market and one in which we expect to gain market share in a growing market. That's good for our customers. And if done in partnership with our suppliers, with our supply chain, it can be good for them as well.","Now there may be some sectors where we will take market share, and where we can add value for our customers, we'll do that. But I prefer to look at this as a growing marketplace and one that the growth is accelerated when we provide efficient service. And when we can do that in partnership with our supply chain, it's good for all of the industry and it can be good for our customers.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Next we're going to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","You have talked about eventually getting to mid-teens margins at BCA, and that would be well above where you are right now. Can you talk about what needs to happen in terms of cost reduction and other initiatives to get there? And when should we see movement in that direction, and what's the approximate timing for reaching a mid-teens type goal?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, let me give you a top-level answer to that, and then I'll ask Greg to augment that. In working very closely with Ray and his team on this, we're all aligned on where we're trying to take the business and grow both top and bottom line in BCA. And as you heard our margin performance year-to-date with a couple of headwinds that we're dealing with in terms of R&D investments this year and mix, but if I look ahead to next year, we are pushing towards returning to double-digit margins in our Commercial Airplane business next year. And when we look at that mid-teens margin, the more aspirational target, this is something that we intend to focus on here over the next several years as we head towards the end of the decade. So this is within our planning view. This is not some aspirational target that's out beyond what we envision for the business. This is part of our planning effort. And driving that level of productivity and performance is important because it creates the capacity to invest in the future and it creates shareholder value, and we intend to accomplish all of those objectives.","Sub-elements of that include the strategy that you've seen us lay out. This is why we're working with our supply chain on Partnering for Success to drive bottom line performance. It's our Lean initiative, our capturing the value of quality effort, market-based affordability, and frankly, just a relentless pursuit of productivity. That's good business. It's the right way to run the business, and we are committed to that path. And that's a path that allows us to compete and win. It allows us to invest in innovation and it allows us to return value to shareholders. Now, Greg, do you want to add anything to that?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","I think you hit all the big levers and the things we've been focused on. Certainly there are levels of maturity of each of those of where we are. But I would say the focus in each one of those categories, including the services that we just talked about with Rob and as well as the development efforts of trying to become more efficient and leveraging the enterprise around development efforts, those are all the major categories that I'd say are led by Dennis ultimately, but then by each one of us to try to look for more efficient ways to execute on those activities.","But as I said before, I would view it as no rock has been left unturned. It is an objective. It's an aspiration. But as you know, it's happening within our own business today, and that certainly gives us a clear understanding of the art of the possible here. And I think what Dennis said, it's competing to win. It's investing in our future and ultimately driving value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. So we're going to continue on this path. We're going to talk about it a little bit more at the investor conference here coming up. But it's a very consistent, I'll say, and high-priority task for all of us on the team.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I also want to recognize Ray's and Leanne's [Caret] efforts on this at the business level. We are all aligned on the objective here and working this as an enterprise team. And Ray and Leanne have really been driving this at the business level. And I just want to acknowledge all the great work that they're doing.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can you say that this is really a steady progression that you envision toward the aspiration as opposed to something where you see a turning point in the three years ahead, or this is something that we should see progress on, on a year-to-year basis?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You got it, Doug. Characterizing it as steady progression is exactly the way I'd look at it. And just as we said, we expect with the opportunity ahead of us, with the backlog we have and the long view that gives us, and the production ramp-up ahead of us in Commercial Airplanes headed to well north of 900 aircraft a year, we have the opportunity, both top and bottom line, to create this steady progression. It's revenue growth, it's cash growth, and it's margin and earnings growth. And that is our plan.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Dennis A.

Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I want to stick with the profitability quickly. Greg, can you just clarify? If you were to look in BCA at period expenses excluding R&D in the quarter, was there any big variance versus last year? And maybe speak to any change in the cadence over the course of this year because I know that can weigh on the margins.","And then secondly, I wondered if you might hit on the unit versus program differences. $28 million (sic) [$28 billion], that's the smallest since before you began delivering the 787. But I would assume given where the deferred production has been running that the 787 was still a pretty big number there. That implies that you had some negative differences elsewhere. Was that 737 customer mix or 777? Any color there would be helpful.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","You got it, it's mix. It's narrow-body mix within the quarter. That's really the biggest driver there, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So you have a couple hundred million dollar upper on the 787 and a couple hundred million dollar downer on the narrow-body?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Yes, a little bit less than that on the 787.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And on the period expenses?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","They're not a big difference. I'd say relatively flat. When you look at the margin for the quarter, it's what you said. There's some mix in the quarter, a little bit on escalation, and then higher R&D, as we said, as we're ramping up the 777X. So as I look at the next three quarters ahead, we'll have more favorable mix in there, and the R&D profile will be a little bit different. So that's how we see the path to the guidance for the balance of the year.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And on that 737 margin comment you made with the block extension, that's net of the escalation adjustment? You extended the block and had a favorable?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks for the color.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Next we'll go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, thanks, appreciate it.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Dennis, do you still feel good about achieving book-to-bill about one this year? And if you want to, provide any color on what mix you might be assuming. As you mentioned, I think you said 40 to 50 777 orders annually. Obviously, a little bit of a change from (44:16), not surprising, obviously. But how should we think about the rate in terms of the mix of 777 orders this year and beyond, and then, of course, the book-to-bill question? Thanks a lot.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. On the overall book-to-bill, once again this year we're anticipating a book-to-bill of about one, so similar to last year. As you know, timing of orders is a little hard to predict. But generally when we look at order volume and energy in the marketplace, we'd say book-to-bill of about one; and continuing healthy opportunities around the globe, most of that again driven by passenger growth and replacement demand from our customers, the lesser of that driven by cargo. As I mentioned earlier, the cargo market remains flattish.","The prominent demand there is in the narrow-body arena. So 737 sales opportunities for the 737 MAX remain very robust globally. Wide-body demand not as hot as narrow-body demand but still strong, especially in areas where it's driven by passenger growth, Middle East and Asia-Pacific in particular. We're seeing that in continuing solid orders volume for 787 and for the 777. And as I said on 777 current generation, we're targeting 40 to 50 sales a year to fill the bridge. We still have work to go, but we've completed 11 or successfully sold 11 so far this year, so roughly on track. But we still have some work to do to fill the remainder of the bridge. We have about a dozen or so very significant campaigns underway for the 777. So while we have work do, we also see the opportunity to complete filling up that bridge.","On the other side of the bridge, the 777X remains in a very strong market differentiated place. And if we look out to the future on wide bodies between 787 and 777X in particular, we feel very strong about the product lineup that we have. So overall healthy, steady market demand, book-to-bill of about one this year, heavier weighted to the narrow-body side, but we're seeing reasonable demand in both narrow bodies and wide bodies.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Howard.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Howard.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. Dennis, you've done \u2013 actually I should push Greg on this. You take a $0.24 charge and you don't change guidance. So something else must have worked out a little bit better as you go and look for the year.","But I also want to ask Dennis about the KC-46 for a moment. You still have a couple of milestones to complete, for example, C-17. And it appears as if the offer to the customer has been pushed a little bit to the right. So could you talk a little bit about what you're doing? I know you've invested a lot of money in this program and a lot of time and effort, but it's still proving to be a little bit more challenging than you addressed. So could you talk about what you've done to change it so that you put a nail in this thing so that it doesn't bite you anymore?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. You bet. Hey, Howard, good questions. And just first of all on your overall margin question, Greg, I'll look back to you on the back end of tanker to comment on that.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But you saw in the first quarter that we did take the $0.24 charge on tanker. We were able to offset the majority of that with just good solid performance. And Greg can walk you through some of the offsets there. But one of the reasons that we've reaffirmed our year-end guidance is that the first quarter performance that we've seen broadly across the enterprise, some of the work we're doing do drive productivity that I talked about earlier, and our plans for the rest of the year give us confidence that we will overcome that $0.24 charge. And that's one of the reasons we're holding our year-end guidance. And I'll let Greg comment more on that later.","But specifically to tanker, you're right, a lot of focus on that. I can tell you that we have raised the level of enterprise focus on executing and delivering on that program. We've, as you've seen, made some personnel changes to provide some additional oversight and emphasis on the program. Leanne, as she has stepped into her new role, is playing a strong role there along with Scott Fancher and teaming up with Ray and the team on the Commercial Airplane side. So we've got the right people on the program.","Key milestones ahead of us is completing Milestone C testing, the production approval decision. We are about 80% complete on the flight testing that's required for Milestone C. And we are moving towards completion of that milestone and approval around the end of the second quarter. Again, that's subject to the normal U.S. government process. The next major milestone beyond that will be delivery of the first 18 tankers, and we remain on schedule to do that August of 2017.","And you're right, we have invested some money to hold that schedule. We think it's the right thing to do. It delivers on our customer commitments. It delivers on an important program, and we're committed to hitting that schedule. And it allows us to accelerate our movement into the production program. Ultimately, we still see this in the long run as a franchise program, a market of around 400 aircraft, and one that will produce profitable growth for decades to come, both in terms of production and support to our customers. So without question, this is an investment worth making.","While we don't like taking a charge, we're confident that we're doing the right things here. We've got the right people on it. We are now in the final stages of the development program. And to your point about putting a nail in it, we are not now discovering new technical issues. Frankly, this is about the fact that we are concurrently finishing up development and ramping up production. We've got the first seven production aircraft flowing through our Everett factory now. In our supply chain, we're already out to airplane number 15. So you can see there's some concurrency cost. That is an intentional investment we're making to keep the program on schedule.","We are closing in on it. We're not done yet. We're going be very focused on getting to the finish line. But I'm confident we'll get there and also confident that this is going be a great program for our customers and our company for decades to come. Greg, do you want to provide any other color on...","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","I think you hit the high points, Dennis. Certainly, Howard, the balance of the year just got more challenging, and we've got a path forward to meet the guide even taking that into consideration. But we're accelerating our productivity efforts and focus in there to ensure that we do, and we're all committed to doing that. So we'll keep marching ahead quarter by quarter to make sure we achieve what we put out there.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. Yes, great.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, thanks, Howard.","Troy J. Lahr - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, a two-part question. One, Greg, with R&D, it was a little higher this quarter than I thought. If I just annualize that, you'll get to about where your expectation is. So do I assume that R&D is relatively flat in subsequent quarters?","And then for Dennis, if you could, just provide some color on some of the articles we've been seeing about potentially coming up with a different 737 derivative to stave off the Bombardier CSeries, as to what the status of that might be. Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","I think on the R&D, George, that's about right. There are obviously some moving pieces in there as 777X starts to ramp up and 787-10 profile turns down around with 737 MAX. But generally quarter by quarter, you're going to look at a similar trend right now.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, George, on your question about the 737 family, we continue to have a very good dialogue with our customers about their future needs. As you know, the 737 MAX 8 is now in the production system. We've got three aircraft in flight test. That airplane is looking very good, and we're confident that's going to add a lot of value for our customers. We're continuing to see strong sales of the 737 MAX family overall.","As we take a look at the 737 MAX 7, the lower seat end of that family of aircraft, that is an area where we're having active discussions with our customers. It's too early to give any specific details or decisions, but I think it's worth saying that that airplane is viewed very favorably by our customers. We have a very clear value proposition that will add value and operating cost reduction for them. And we also have the flexibility to design it to meet their needs. So we'll continue those discussions, and as we reach decision points, we'll make sure to make everybody aware, but we remain very confident on the 737 MAX introduction, the transition, and the value it will add to our customers.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. I'll now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead","Thomas J. Downey - Senior Vice President-Communications","Thank you. We will continue with the questions for Dennis and Greg. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002. Operator, we're ready for the first question. And in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question please.","Operator","And we'll go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Hi, everybody.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Julie.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Hi.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Hi. Just to follow up on some of the earlier questions about productivity initiatives, I'm wondering if you can give sort of us a target for companywide head count changes or reductions. And also, I know 4,000 jobs at BCA is a lot, but I mean these are job reductions coming through attrition and voluntary layoffs. And I'm wondering frankly if that's going get the job done, or if more meaningful restructuring is needed, especially given your margin goals for the unit.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Julie, let me give you a little context around this because when we pursue productivity and cost competitiveness, we look at all categories of costs. So, certainly direct labor cost, head count is one of those, but there are many other factors, in fact, other factors that are larger than direct head count, indirect costs, overhead, infrastructure, facilities, supply chain. As a reminder, a good portion of our cost is outside of Boeing, so that's where our Partnering for Success initiative comes in. So we have set cost reduction and productivity targets that span all of those cost categories.","In some cases, that does put pressure on head count, and you've seen that, but it's not something where we set a head count target or apply the same formula everywhere. It's really important that we give our business leaders and functional leaders the flexibility to tailor their cost structure to be competitive. So it's not one size fits all, and the business dynamics are very different in different parts of our businesses and different sites. So that's important from an overall context standpoint.","Now the reductions that we're making in Puget Sound that you've seen in the news, again, those are being done within this overall cost reduction effort and also being done in a way that's very mindful and respectful of our employees. We're starting first, as you noted, with voluntary layoff packages and\/or attrition. I think it's a good reminder that in a company of about 160,000 people, normal annual attrition is about 4% to 5% just when you look at the workforce demographics. So that alone provides us some flexibility on how we can make head count reductions and do it in a way that's mindful and respectful of our employees. And so that's where we start. In some cases, we have had to do involuntary layoffs, but that tends to be on the margins and done very selectively where we don't have other options. So that's our game plan going forward.","I won't give you any specific head count targets because that's not the way we do our business. We set cost reduction productivity targets. We look at all elements of our cost structure. And if it comes down to direct head count, we deal with that in a way that's very respectful of our employees and trying to do our best to help them transition when that does become a necessity.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Jon Ostrower - The Wall Street Journal","Hey, good morning, guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Jon.","Jon Ostrower - The Wall Street Journal","Just a question on the strategic future of how you account for everything at Boeing. You've told your investors over the last five years or longer to really focus on cash, not earnings, as you go through the 787 process. Certainly the windfall that they expect really anchors a lot of their expectations for what they see as the future of Boeing. So you've got this Mason SEC (58:22) probe on the projections for 787. You've got downgrades that are causing volatility in your share price as a result of those projections. I just want to ask. Is program accounting still the right model for Boeing? Airbus uses IFRS, Bombardier and Embraer, and the analysts tend to expect a certain level of volatility in the cash that comes in during the development program. Is it still right for Boeing when you look at all that's transpired in the last few months?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Well, Jon, I would say our accounting is compliant with GAAP. That's first and foremost, and that's what it is. And obviously, Airbus is under a different accounting standard, and they're adhering to that one. So that's our focus. That's our priority, and that's how we account for everything we do within the business.","As far as focus on cash, I think just like any business, it's about the bottom line at the end of the day no matter what accounting standard you're under. It's about how efficient you are with your cash and how effective you are with managing that and deploying it. So I wouldn't view our focus on cash frankly any different than any other business. At the end of the day, it's all about what's left over and what your costs were and what you sold your product for and then what do you do with it. And we're trying to keep it simple in that regard because ultimately we want to reinvest in the future and we want to return cash to those that are putting their trust in us through the shareholder base and invest in our people. And that's the priorities.","Operator","Our next question is from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey. Good morning, Dominic.","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","Hi, two things I'd like to ask about. First of all, just following up on the Puget Sound head count question, Boeing has projected that by midyear you'll have managed through attrition and voluntary buyouts to lower head count by about 4,000. Do you anticipate that you'll need more than that in the second half of the year?","And then second question, your push to get more out of the aftermarket in services, that's been talked about by Boeing for years and years and years. What's different now? How are you going about it more aggressively? Jon's recent article mentioned a change in what you're doing with Spirit. Are you actively taking steps that are different to take those services back? Headcount first, though.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Dominic, let me field both of those. First of all, on head count, as I said earlier, we have set some aggressive cost reduction and productivity targets for the year that are aligned with our overall business strategy, and we are looking at all categories of cost. And that includes beyond head count both in our internal indirect costs as well as in our supply chain. And I think it's important that we continue to keep that in mind. Our direct head count is one important category, but not the only one. And our business leaders are looking across all of those cost categories.","I will say the overall macro trend that we have for this year is that we expect employment will be net down moderately. I can't give you a specific number there, but we are on a moderate downward trend enterprise-wide this year as we drive productivity. As I said earlier, we're also doing that and trying to be very mindful of our employees. And as you know, I have a great deal of respect for our people. They are world-class. They're the best in the world at what they do. And where we can leverage attrition and the voluntary layoff programs that we've put in place, we will, and so far that approach has been very effective for us. And I think that's good for the business and good for our people, ultimately good for our customers. So that's our headset on that approach.","On your second question about services, you're right. It's something that we have talked about for some time. I can tell you that we are very serious about growing our services business. So as we've laid in our strategy for the next planning cycle and more broadly for the next decade, that is one of our focused growth areas. The market is large, as I said, about $4 trillion over the next 20 years. We have market share room to grow. But again, I want to emphasize that we are growing services in a growing marketplace. This is not about taking share from others or dividing up a fixed pie. This is clearly a growing marketplace. And with the right kind of business model, this can be good for our industry and our customers.","We are taking very specific actions on that. Our services business leaders, Stan Deal and Ed Dolanski, are teamed up. I think our One Boeing approach where we work across commercial and defense globally is a differentiator for us. In some cases, we are looking at specific parts inside of our aircraft, as you've seen in the days (1:03:43) where our unique OEM knowledge we think can provide value for our customers. In some cases, we're pursuing modification and upgrade businesses. The 737 freighter conversion program I think is a good specific example there. And then some of the work we're doing in information-based services like GoldCare and performance-based logistics, those are specific things that we're doing. So it is a focused high-priority strategy, and we have actions underway to support that strategy.","Troy J. Lahr - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for one last media question.","Operator","And that will be from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alwyn Scott - Thomson Reuters Corp.","Hi, thank you. Also on the productivity question, how worried are you about the significant change in the value of the dollar and the competitive edge that that potentially gives Airbus in coming years? And to what extent is that factoring into your cost containment and productivity efforts, cutting jobs and cutting other costs even as you produce more than ever?","Gregory D. Smith - Executive Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Chief Financial Officer","Certainly it's a factor as we think about competing. And it goes really to just the broader objective that Dennis outlined on competing in the marketplace to win no matter what. Whether it's exchange rates or whether the competition being more efficient or inefficient, it's all about competing in the marketplace, as we've discussed, being able to invest going forward, and then rewarding all the stakeholders that have put their trust in us. That's fundamentally what's behind this.","But exchange rates are going to move around over time. We don't rely on exchange rates. But the fact is, there are some times where there's an advantage, there are some times with a disadvantage. And we have to have the flexibility in our own enterprise to be able to compete no matter what that exchange rate is. And that's the headset that we have across the team, and that's the focus that's going to continue to take place going forward.","Thomas J. Downey - Senior Vice President-Communications","That concludes our earnings call. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002.

Good day everyone and welcome to The Boeing Company's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy Jeffrey Lahr - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's second quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm Troy Lahr and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer. After management comments, we'll take your questions. In fairness to others on the call we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussions today are likely to involve risk which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now I'll turn the call over to Dennis Muilenberg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Troy, and good morning. My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, the health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. Now let's move to slide two.","Our second quarter financial results included both the continued solid underlying operating execution and strong cash flow performance of our commercial and defense businesses and a substantial impact to earnings from decisions we made on the 787 and 747 programs and increased investment needed on the KC-46 tanker program.","I'll come back to explain each of those items in a moment, but let my say up front that we're confident that the decisions we made on 787 cost reclassification and 747 production were the right proactive ones to reduce future financial risk and strengthen our position and focus going forward. The added investment on tanker, while not insignificant, enabled completion of important testing while sustaining our view of the long-term multi-decade value this program will generate for our customers and our shareholders.","Excluding those items, both of our businesses produced double digit margins in the quarter and we continued to deliver on our commitments to invest in innovation while also returning cash to shareholders. We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $2 billion of Boeing stock, and increased our dividend per share 20% over the prior year for a payout of $691 million in the quarter.","Revenue in the second quarter increased to $24.8 billion on strong commercial airplane deliveries and growth in our services business. We reported a core earnings per share loss of $0.44, reflecting continued solid operating performance across our production programs that partially offset the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and tanker charges.","On the 787 program, during the quarter we reached a decision point on whether to move forward and invest funds for the refurbishment and future sale of the two remaining initial flight test aircraft. We elected not to do so and subsequently we reclassified unit costs associated with those aircraft from program inventory to R&D expense resulting in a noncash $847 million after tax earnings impact.","On the 747 program, we decided to reduce future production expectations and revenue assumptions to account for current and anticipated weakness in the air cargo market. These program assumption changes drove the $814 million after-tax charge in the quarter. These charges also include the write-down of the remaining 747 deferred production costs which significantly derisked the program going forward. Despite the ongoing challenges of air cargo market, we continue to see the 747 as a unique and significant value creator for our customers over the long-term.","A $393 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 tanker program reflects our assessment of the cost to address previously announced program schedule and technical challenges, including implementation of the hardware solution to resolve the refueling boom axial load issue identified during flight testing, delays in the certification process and concurrency between late stage development testing and initial production.","To the credit of our team working with the Air Force, the hardware solution to the boom issue worked as planned. With the aircraft's recent success in refueling an F-16, A-10 and C-17, we have now completed all required testing to receive the Milestone C production approval from our customer which is expected next month. Recognizing the risks inherent in the remainder of the flight test program, our team is dually focused on the work ahead on meeting our commitments under the revised program schedule and providing our Air Force customer the best aerial refueling tanker ever built.","While we are reducing core EPS guidance for 2016 to reflect the impact of these three items I just covered, we are maintaining our revenue and cash flow guidance based on the underlying strength of our business. Greg will provide more details on that later. Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for both of our businesses.","At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, second quarter revenue increased 3% to $17.5 billion on 199 deliveries. Notwithstanding overall solid core operating performance, the charges and cost reclassification led to an operating earnings loss in the quarter. Key milestones in the quarter included successfully delivering the first 12 per month rate aircraft on the 787 program, declaring the 787-10 production ready, opening the 777X composite wing center and completing high-altitude flight testing on the 737 MAX which continues to run ahead of schedule.","At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. Operating margins were 8.3%, reflecting strong performance offset by a portion of the tanker charge. Key contract awards during the quarter included an order for 12 CH-47 Chinooks for the Royal Netherlands Air Force and 24 AH-64 Apache helicopters for the Qatar Air Force. In summary, notwithstanding the accounting charges and the cost reclassification in the quarter, we had solid underlying operating performance, achieved critical program milestones and returned significant cash to our shareholders.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide three. Our overall view of the business environment remains generally positive due to healthy industry fundamentals. We recently updated our 20-year commercial market outlook and based on solid traffic growth and continued replacement demand, we now forecast nearly $6 trillion of demand for 39,620 commercial airplanes, an increase of nearly 1,600 from last year. Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP, with IATA reporting 6% growth year to date. On the cargo side, the market remains sluggish with year to date freight traffic down approximately 1%.","We continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced, with particular attention being paid to the wide body segment. While oil prices have meaningfully rebounded from lows earlier this year, our customers continue to tell us that movements in oil prices have not substantially changed their view on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. As always, we see isolated pockets of market softness such as Russia and Brazil. However, we will continue to manage our skylines to maintain production schedules and health.","New order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace as indicated by the flow of announcements at the Farnborough Air Show. As a result of the compelling and enduring value proposition of our airplanes, requests to change deliveries are holding well below the historical average. Over the past 12 months, deferrals, accelerations, debookings and cancellations remain at about 1% of our backlog. We continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to ramp up beyond 900 aircraft per year through the end of this decade, driven by ongoing market demand in our sizable and diverse backlog.","Turning to individual airplane programs, demand remains strong for the 737 with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. We remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 per month to 47 in 2017 followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be oversold.","Turning to the twin aisle market, while long-term demand remains strong, we have seen some hesitation in near-term demand in recent months varying by program. For the current generation 777, our backlog as of the end of the quarter stood at 175 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added eight net new 777 orders and commitments. For the full year, we are targeting approximately 40 orders as we focus on ensuring a smooth profitable transition to the 777X production.","Our 777 delivery slots are completely sold out for 2016 and more than 80% sold out for 2017. For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of the 777X test aircraft, we are nearly 60% sold out at the lower planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month. We are working an active customer pipeline to fill the remaining 2017 and 2018 delivery slots, but we clearly have more work to do over the next few months to hold the current 777 production plans. With a strong foundation of 306 orders from six customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high and the development of this next game-changing wide body remains on track.","On the 787 program, our backlog of more than 700 orders remains the foundation behind our production rate plans. As we discussed at our investor conference, securing additional orders to solidify our end of the decade 14 per month production rate plan remains a priority. As always, aligning supply and demand to maximize profitability will guide our decisions on 777 and 787 production plans.","On the 747 program, as I mentioned earlier, air cargo market headwinds continue to pressure demand and pricing. So far this year, we have captured four 747-8 freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to build the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market remains challenging. We will continue to monitor it closely while aggressively driving productivity and cost reduction to win additional orders.","On the commercial services side, we continue to deliver on our strategy to grow this element of our business. We recently announced agreements with six airlines from around the world to provide advanced analytic solutions to increase their efficiency in operating over 500 airplanes. Furthermore, in the largest commercial airplane services deal in Boeing history, Norwegian committed through 2034 to Gold Care coverage for both its 737 MAX fleet and to expanded coverage of the airline's entire 787 Dreamliner fleet.","Our significant global scale and depth, intimate aircraft knowledge, and our substantial installed base combine to provide a meaningful opportunity to continue growing our services and support business, including our traditional parts, mods and upgrade business as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services. Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX, and complete development of the 777X and the 787-10.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continued to see solid demand for our major platforms. Domestically, the President's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs and we are anticipating a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next five years.","Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the second quarter, international customers represented 29% of BDS revenue and 37% of the current backlog. The strength of our defense and space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation and affordability, as well as leveraging our One Boeing advantage.","We continue to focus on areas that are priorities for our customers such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. We are investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, JSTARS recapitalization, MQ-25 A, formerly known as UCLASS, advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities. We are also encouraged by the domestic and international opportunities for our proven, affordable and highly capable fighter aircraft.","In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets. Our teams are focused on innovation and growth and on delivering solid operating performance. We remain confident about our position and future prospects. Our focus is on accelerating our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity and organizational improvements through the implementation of lean, capturing the value of quality, partnering for success and our second century design and manufacturing initiatives.","Now, over to Greg for our financial results.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. Let's turn to slide four and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased to $24.8 billion driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries and solid defense revenue. Core earnings per share was a loss of $0.44, impacted by the previously announced $3.23 of charges and cost reclassification. Notwithstanding these impacts, the core business performance was solid in the quarter.","Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on slide five. For the second quarter, our commercial airplane business reported revenue of $17.5 billion on 199 airplane deliveries. BC operating margin in the quarter were impacted by the $2.8 billion related to the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and tanker charges. The results were also impact by higher planned R&D spending as we ramp up on the 777X program. Excluding the charges and the cost reclassification, BC operating margins were solid 10.3%.","Commercial Airplanes captured $11 billion of net orders during the second quarter and backlog remains very strong at $417 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft, again equating to seven years of production. 787 deferred production declined by $1 billion in the quarter driven by the cost reclassification, bringing the balance at the end of the quarter to $27.7 billion. When normalizing for the cost reclassification, deferred was better than planned at an increase of just $33 million.","As we previously discussed, recovering the 787 deferred production over the remainder of the decade will be a significant driver of cash flows. Our confidence in this recovery and the cash generation comes from the shifting of the delivery mix for more -9s and -10s, improved pricing over the remaining 900 aircraft and supplier stepdown pricing as well as internal productivity. We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning to the 12 per month rate, increasing deliveries of the 787-9, reducing production flow times and lowering unit cost while introducing the 787-10 into the production system.","Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide six. Second quarter revenue in our defense business was $7.2 billion and operating margins was 8.3%, largely driven by the strong performance that was offset by the BDS $219 million pre-tax tanker charge. Boeing military aircraft second quarter revenue was $3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and Chinook deliveries. Operating margins of 5.9% reflect the impact again of the tanker charge. Network and space systems reported revenue of $1.8 billion, operating margins of 8.5%, reflecting the timing of ULA launches. Global services and support revenue increased 12% to $2.4 billion, reflecting higher volume in aircraft modernization and sustainment. Operating margins were 11.1%, reflecting program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $55 billion with now 37% of that business from customers outside of the United States.","Let's move to the next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the second quarter was primarily driven by solid operating performance. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $691 million in dividends and repurchased 15 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchase to 44 million shares for a total of $5.5 billion as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects the ongoing confidence in a long-term outlook of our markets and our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $8.5 billion repurchase authorization over the approximately next two years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priorities for us.","Let's move now to cash and debt balances on slide eight. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.","Let's now turn to slide nine and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, deliveries and cash flow. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is lowered by $2.05 a share to now be between $6.10 and $6.30, reflecting the second quarter charges and cost reclassification totaling $3.23 that was more than offset by improved core operating performance and tax benefits.","The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results as we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation and efficient deployment, at the same time taking appropriate actions to derisk our business going forward.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Greg. As we move into the second half of 2016 and begin Boeing's second century in operation, we know we cannot stand still if we are to further our industry leadership and honor the rich legacy of generations of talented, hard working people that built this company. Our teams remain intensely focused on growth, disciplined execution, quality and productivity improvement and meeting our customer commitments. Our priorities are to continue building strength on strength to deliver on our existing plans and to stretch beyond those plans by sharpening and accelerating our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts.","Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent attention to the profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, delivering on our development programs, driving world class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which is to position Boeing for the next 100 years and continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and to create increasing value for our customers, our shareholders, our employees and other stakeholders.","With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","First with Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So if you back the charges out of your BCA results, they look particularly strong. You did better on 787 deferreds. Could you comment on any profit accrual rate changes you had, any block changes you had in the quarter, and how should we think about those opportunities and the deferreds on the 87 going forward?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Cai, on 737 we did have a block extension there and we had an increase in overall booking rate on program, and also on 67 we had a block extension there. We had a little bit better spending with regards to G&A and some other period expense, in particular fleet support. Those were really the primary drivers in the quarter. Just good solid performance across the programs.","On the deferred, I'd say the profile of the deferred remains intact of what we talked about. Again, as we focus on unit cost day by day, airplane by airplane improvement and getting that model mix up with more -9s, now the introduction of the -10, it's all about cash. and so how are we improving the overall cash flow of that program. Teams are doing a great job. We got certainly lots of work in front of us, but I think when you're out in the factories today, you'll see some very good momentum and very good focus on overall productivity initiatives that are also obviously going to help that cash profile going forward. So the fundamentals as far as the cash flow story on 787 remain intact.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, good morning everyone.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jason.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Greg, I think this one will be for you. I wanted to talk a little bit about working capital and apply that to cash.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","There's been a lot of chatter out there in the media, even amongst some of your suppliers that have hosted earnings calls this quarter about a lengthening payables cycle at Boeing. So I was wondering if you could just chat a little bit about your strategy there, how long it's been in place, how much more we have to go, and tie that to the sustainability of cash flows. Are we getting a one-time bump this year, or have you been working on this for a while and it's been masked? I just want to get a sense of whether we're going to have some lumpy cash flow outcomes here really in the next several quarters or the next several years because of this deployment of your new strategy here.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah I mean, Jason, I'd say this is just back to fundamentals around working capital, how we're collecting, how we're paying and then ultimately how we're managing our inventory. And we've got initiatives in place for each. When it comes to payables, we have changed our frequency of pay that we have gone from daily to twice a month. Again, that's in line with industry practices. At the same time, we're looking at terms across all of our contracts and again looking to get those to industry standards, but ultimately we want to get those to top quartile standards. And there's no reason why we shouldn't, and frankly a lot of our supply chain is already there.","And then again, finally on the inventory, we're looking at all aspects of the inventory across the programs. Float time on 787 is a great example of that, and we're going to continue that focus. So I wouldn't view it as anything special or different. Is there enhanced focus on those elements of cash flow, there certainly is. But that's the objective, certainly get to industry standards and then beyond that as Dennis has talked about, what is top quartile or a global industrial champion look like, and there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to get to those levels of efficiency.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Jason, to the second part of your question there, as Greg has pointed out, this is not a one-time event or implementation. We see this as a key element of our longer-term cash growth plan and consistent with our plans for the business to grow cash year over year.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Dennis, you mentioned services in the monologue and it also was a little bit more prominent in the release than it's been in the past. And so I wonder if at some point maybe you'd consider disclosing the services contribution at Boeing commercial. And then just as a question, we talk about services, but I think it really means kind of aftermarket more broadly and that includes spares and parts. And so what part does that play in the strategy? And is there investment required there to either qualify new parts yourself or to incentivize the alternative suppliers to qualify new parts? Is that going to be meaningful at some point and it would it have only an impact on sort of new platforms going forward or could it have an impact on existing and production platforms?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great question, Seth. And what you're pointing out here is, as we discussed at our investor conference, we see services growth broadly as one of our strongest growth areas going forward, and that spans both commercial and defense. It is a place where we are investing for the future, have been all along, and you're beginning to see the fruits of that investment and we're going to continue to work on that front. That includes modifying our approach to our intellectual property and how we manage and control that, our proprietary parts business and what I'll call the traditional parts and modifications businesses that leverage our OEM knowledge base. It also includes a more significant investment in data analytics and information-based services, and you can see some of the progress on that front.","I mentioned a couple in my opening comments, but more broadly, we now have for example 60 airlines enrolled in subscription contracts for Boeing maintenance and engineering work that covers about 2,200 aircraft. We have another 84 customers with about 3,800 aircraft that are benefiting from our airplane health management services, and we still see a lot of runway ahead of us in these data analytics and information-based services agreements where we can add value for customers and also add value for Boeing. And this includes a increased focus from our senior executive team on growing services, investments both inside of Boeing and with our supply chain as you pointed out, and we do see this as a long-term growth area both top line and bottom line. In general, services is accretive to our margins and our bottom line performance.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, gentleman. Thanks for the time. As it relates to the 777, can you just talk about your comfort from here as it relates to getting the additional 40 orders that you mentioned as well as the point at which you'll know whether or not the production cuts going in next year are sufficient?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah Rajeev, let me just take that one head on here. On 777, we understand the reality of where we're at. And as I said, in 2017, we've already announced we're going to a seven per month production rate. We're 80% sold out against that production rate. In 2018, as we introduce the 777X into the line and we build test aircraft, as we have announced before, the effective delivery rate in 2018 will drop to 5.5 a month, and we're 60% sold out against that profile. So we know exactly where we're at today.","Now the fact is year-to-date, we've got net orders for eight 777s against a target of approximately 40. So clearly we have work to do yet over the next few months to fill out that orders book. And we're working hard on a number of key campaigns. Ray and his team are out with our customers and we are aggressively working that every day. We do see that the value proposition of the airplane is holding up, but the wide body market is clearly a challenging place right now. So we've got work to do to find those additional orders.","Now in the case of if those orders don't materialize, we're going to continue to keep a close eye on our production plans and make sure that we keep supply and demand in balance. That's the key to our future, and we're going to make sure we make a profitable and efficient transition to the 777X. So we're going to continue to work those campaigns hard. We're going to work to fill out the production plans as we currently have laid them out, while being mindful of keeping supply and demand in balance.","Now all of this, I think it's important to take a step back from all of this to look at our overall plans over the next five years. Regardless of how that scenario plays out on 777, this is a growing business where we're going to be delivering north of 900 airplanes a year by the end of the decade, and we see this as a year over year cash growth business spanning all of those scenarios that we're talking about. So we're going to do the right thing here, keep wide body supply and demand in balance, make sure we have the right transition to 777X, and I think it's also worth reminding that in the long term, the wide body marketplace is still an attractive marketplace. And as you get out into the 2020s, there's a large replacement cycle that's very clear to us. So this is about efficient transition to the 777X and the 777X is the right airplane for the future, all within the context of a compelling growth story and year over year cash growth.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","This question I think could be for either of you, but going back to the investor day, you talked about BCA margins improving double digit I think next year and mid teens toward the end of the decade, if I have that right. And obviously you have a lot of initiatives ongoing to get there. I wanted to ask you, how much of this margin improvement is negotiated or in place at this point, and how sensitive are those targets to any downside in 777 essentially relative to what you just talked about, Dennis?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Rob, let me just paint the broad brush on that and I'll ask Greg to tag team on this one. But our plans for the future remain consistent with what we described, and that is we're headed towards double digit margin in our commercial airplane business next year, and pleased with the performance this past quarter. But we still have work to do to make that sustainable. And then in the longer term, towards the end of the decade, headed towards that mid teen margin aspiration. And that's a tough, challenging target, but I think the right one for this business for the long term, and it will drive the right behaviors and investments for the future.","And achieving those kind of margins spans all of our internal and external work, so it includes our internal productivity work, the relentless focus on capturing value of quality and our lean plus efforts. It includes our development program excellence initiative, all of the things we're doing to drive internal productivity to incrementally pick up margins, things like block extensions on our programs are accretive to margins in general as well.","And as I mentioned earlier, as we grow the services business, that also tends to be accretive to margins. In parallel with that internal work, we're also working with our supply chain. Partnering for success is a key element of this, and while we've made a lot of advancements on that front, we still have a lot of work to do across our supply chain, and we'll continue to be relentless there as well. But think of this as a portfolio of effort all headed in the same direction. Greg, do you want to add anything to that?","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Dennis, if I could just interject for a second just to clarify. Could you clarify or quantify the internal versus the external or the supply chain versus the internal in terms of the margins themselves, the upside?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean, Rob, frankly, we're looking at market based certainly across the board. And so whether that's internal or external, it's all about market based. And really kind of backing into that, and as you know, the greatest certainly percentage of our cost structure is outside, and so we're equally focused there. But at the same time, you've heard us. You've been in the factory recently during the investor conference. You can see, there's a relentless focus inside. So I'd say no rock unturned. We're looking for all opportunities, but just think about it as being market based type targets that are driven through all the elements of the cost structure, whether it's in home office here or out on the programs.","And I think as Dennis said, each of these are at different levels of maturity. Some of these we've obviously, we've captured some in certain aspects of the business. But I'd say everybody is very aligned on all the elements that Dennis talked about, this portfolio approach, and we're all \u2013 I'd say it's all on our score cards in being held accountable to try to achieve the aspirational targets that have been put out here.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is a clear and enduring focus for us, and it's about winning, competing and winning in the marketplace. It's about returning value to our shareholders, and it's also about funding our future investments and our innovation. And we intend to accomplish all three objectives.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And the 777 sensitivity for this process?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, well as Dennis said, I mean we've run certainly sensitivity analysis against the 777 bridge over that I'll say short period of time between the current platform and the X, and we've taken that into consideration around our comments about cash flow continuing to grow through that period. So we think we can do that through that period. But we got a bunch of different scenarios obviously we're running through there, but we're sticking with the plan we have and staying focused on trying to fill that bridge and particularly in near term. But we got work to do, and like Dennis said we'll match production \u2013 demand to production at the right time and it's one element of the portfolio, and I don't want anybody to over rotate on that element. It's an important one, but there's a lot of other things going on in this company that are either driving profitability or cash, and it's not just lying on one program having a transition rate for 18 to 24 months.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're going to do the right thing to make sure we have an efficient transition to 777X and all of that is enveloped by an expectation of year over year cash growth, and that spans all of the scenarios we've looked it.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you both.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Next we go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'd like to, if we can understand a little bit more on the ramp down in deferred production for the 787 and there are really three aspects of it I'm interested in. One is, first if you end up not going to 14 a month and staying at 12, what impact would that as a rate, what impact would that potentially have?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Second, if on the 787, you've talked about the advantage of the -9. You've got better pricing and that costs ultimately can come down to be comparable to the -8, and what timeframe would we expect to see those -9 costs become similar on a unit basis to the","-8?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And the third one of these is on the 787-10, what kind of disruption would we expect given the high degree of commonality between the -9 and the -10 when it goes into service? So sorry, it's three parts but all related to deferred.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think I got them all, Doug, and if not, I'm sure you'll tell me. So first one, if you looked at \u2013 obviously we're not at the point of making any different rate decisions or assumptions than what we got in place, but as Dennis said, we got work to do to fill out to the 14. As you know, that's an end of the decade implementation. But if you were to assume holding 12, it pushes that deferred curve out about 6 months. So not a significant impact. When you look at -8 and -9, you saw it when you were out here. I'd say, the design improvements that were taken off the 8 and put onto the 9, now that we're I'll say ramping up at, we're at about 10 a month right now on the -9. You're really seeing those come together in the factory.","And so unit cost now is about in line with on -9 versus -8. So the team again has done a great job. Lots of work in front of us, but the fact is over 125 units and they're now at the same level of -8, I think gives you a good sense of the design for manufacturing implementation that's taking place on that airplane. And listen, there's still a lot of ideas in the hopper. Some of those will mature; some of them won't, but they're not slowing down. And Mark Jenks and his team are doing a terrific job looking for more opportunities.","Disruption from 9 to 10, I think you said it. It is not as big of an impact certainly as it is from the 8 to the 9. That was by design. So that's in the production system today. So we certainly have provisioned for some longer flow times on those initial -10 units. Similar, I'll say methodology that we did from the 8 to the 9, but we're again I think as far as producing that airplane and a risk associated with that, it's a very different risk profile than it was from the 8 to the 9. So again, credit to the team on really focus on commonality in the production system to minimize that disruption as we enter it into the production system.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Real manufacturing commonality that's north of 95%. And Doug, as you know, we've already begun major assembly work into the 787 line on the -10. So that manufacturing commonality is holding up as we're going through implementation.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And just if I can on the rate change, the 12 to 14, what is the lead time that you need to pull the trigger to decide you're going up to 14 at a certain date?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, let me give you a little bit of a feel for that. Right now we're sold out through 2018 if you look at the skyline on 787. We have a few open positions in 2019 that we're working and we're largely focused on filling out the 2020 production skyline. So that will give you a feel for the timeframe that we're looking at. As Greg said, this is a toward the end of the decade implementation. So you can back off from that a couple of years. We haven't pinned down a specific decision point yet because we're going to keep a close eye on the market, the signals from our customers. We've got time to do our due diligence here.","And again, our principle here is to keep wide body supply and demand in balance. And we're confident in the 787 program across that span of scenarios, and we're going to continue to work campaigns to fill out to the 14 a month rate step-up, and we'll evaluate timelines and decisions around that. But you can be very confident that whatever we decide, we're going to keep supply and demand in balance. We're going to do it efficiently and productively, and all of this again is enveloped by our expectation of a year over year cash growth business. It spans all of the scenarios we've talked about on both 777 and 787.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I guess maybe a question for both of you just to see if we're thinking about this right. Does the roughly $1 billion of deferred that was moved pre-tax to R&D, does that imply if you take that $1 billion and divide it by what's left in the block that the profitability per airplane goes up by about $1 million on a program basis? And then I guess the second part of that question is, when do you expect the program on a unit basis to be cash flow breakeven for 78?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we broke even late last year.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. On a unit basis?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so obviously as we move forward with the supplier stepdown, contractual stepdown pricing, we improved productivity. But even more, as I mentioned at the investor conference, Ron, the mix is a big play in here going forward. So getting these -9s into the productions that we have and you heard me talk about the unit costs recently and where they are, getting that -10 in, are obviously big drivers of cash flow going forward. The program margin did go up slightly in the quarter overall, and but it's still very low single digits.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But just curious, Greg, is it about $1 million per plane? Are we thinking about it right? Is it essentially $1 billion divided by 900, what's left in the block?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we're not really \u2013 I'm not really completely following your math there, Ron, but I would just tell you that we took $1 billion out obviously and put it into R&D. So obviously research and development went up, and the overall program margin went up slightly as a result of that move. But again these are obviously two aircraft that we've been heavily utilized in flight test, and we made the right decision because it was the time to start spending company funds to modify those airplanes, and a limited marketplace for them. So we made that decision and reclassed them and it was absolutely the right thing to do.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Cool. Thank you so much.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning gentlemen.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Carter.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a clarification on that last answer, Greg, and then a quick question. But you said unit breakeven last year. Do you mean cash breakeven on the program last year?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Cash on the program, yeah.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So we're close to eclipsing deferred production flipping over, but when do you -that's obviously at one end of the line. When you've got stuff coming off the line is when you'd get to see unit versus program. When should we expect that to flow from the deferred production all the way out to where we see it in the cash and unit.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Later this year.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Later this year.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And I wanted to ask about the 737 margin increase that you referenced associated with the block extension. I know you had taken a rate adjustment downward associated with escalation in the past. Is this a reversal of that? And does it get it back to, have you recaptured that downward amount that you had before with this move?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, there's actually was still escalation pressure in the quarter across all the programs, not as much as prior quarters, but there was. And then the balance of that was offset by improved productivity and mix. Those are really the big drivers in there, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just volume in there, okay.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And with respect to escalation, when does that \u2013 I know it operates with a lag. And so you've seen the oil price come back up. That has a positive impact on that index. When does that make its way through the lag of the escalation formula?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm hoping very soon. But again, we saw it minimized this quarter, and we'll have to wait until the publications come out for third quarter. But you're right. I mean the fundamentals are heading in the right direction. So we should start to see this as bit of more of a tailwind versus a headwind.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you gentlemen.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll go to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. It's a two-part question related to some of the things you're doing internally. Greg or Dennis, you indicated the MAX EIS had accelerated so that, and I think Norwegian even used a May date which is pretty notable. Could you just address two things? One is what are you doing with the benefit of this acceleration and improved process, and how much of it is being used to either accelerate deliveries or do other things with the MAX?","And then also you commented on G&A being better, and I suspect it's probably due to, I'll call it the 787 performance hitting some of the standards that you've aspired to. So could you maybe put it together in an answer that sort of talks about some of the other things you're doing too outside of just production to make The Boeing Company and its customers better?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Howard, I'll take the first part and then ask Greg to take the second part. On the MAX, as you've and, we have the opportunity to accelerate EIS. We had originally planned third quarter of 2017, but we now have publicly talked about that as first half of 2017. I won't be specific to individual customers as we have a number of discussions ongoing, but we have opportunities to accelerate into the first half of the year. And what you should read through that is that the MAX development program is going very well and running on cost and ahead of schedule. We've got all four test aircraft in the air, more than 300 hours on the airplanes, and the performance is looking solid, and the development program is clean.","And more broadly, if you get to your underlying question, I think this is a good example of how we can and should perform coming out of our development program excellence initiative. And this is about understanding the statement work clearly upfront, managing that statement work, keeping it balanced, doing the right systems engineering work, working with our supply chain. This is about disciplined innovation, and we're going to bring it, a product to the marketplace that has a great value add for our customers and do it in a way that's disciplined and on cost and schedule. And that formula that we've put in place now with our development program excellence initiative, we know it works, and we're taking the lessons learned from MAX and we're cross deploying those now into programs like the 787-10, the 777X, and into our future defense development programs.","And our objective here is very clear, and that is to have disciplined effective development programs that perform on cost and schedule that allows us to do reliable R&D planning and allows us to make best use of our innovation investments. So it's a good sign post for us, Howard. I think clearly a step in the right direction and we're going to leverage lessons learned from MAX across the whole enterprise. Greg, do you want to hit the second part?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah I mean, Howard, I guess with regards to the nonproduction, it's the same approach. I mean, we're really kind of trying to look at just even functional costs across the enterprise and looking at what is market-based affordability, what's best-in-class look like for an industrial company and challenging ourselves and where we are versus where they are and trying to learn for some best practices and then trying to implement them. Now some of this is still in the planning stage. Certainly not all of it is implemented, so I wouldn't run with any of it. But that's the framework, and that's the operating around it.","But it's all about how do we compete in the marketplace no matter what marketplace we're in across the portfolio, how do we generate cash in order to invest in our future as we have, and then deliver value to the shareholders. So those are kind of the, I'll say the framework that's around the approach, but it goes back to my comment about no rock left unturned. So whether it's functional costs that are supporting a program or program-specific, everybody has an affordability target. And again, different levels of maturity, some are making more progress than others, but the focus and the operating rhythm is all around that.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","So I just want to make sure I understand then, that is some of this that you saw in this most recent quarter going to translate into either permanently lower G&A or also a little bit better R&D profile for the back half of the year?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think the R&D profile will be similar to what we outlined. I don't see that changing. On the G&A, I mean quarter over quarter, as you know, you're going to see it move around a little bit. But some of that certainly is sustainable, and some of that is just timing.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Troy Jeffrey Lahr - Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","That will be from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess really, Greg, I was going to ask you just we've seen a lot in terms of the interest rate move this year, and I know you don't include pension in the core earnings, but can you just talk about required contributions or how to think about pension contributions over the next several years and how that may be changing in terms of with lower interest rates?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, no certainly something, Sam, we're watching. Obviously with the transition that we made from the defined contribution to the \u2013 or defined benefit, defined contribution, that certainly helps us going forward when it comes to pension contributions. But we're certainly monitoring the interest rate environment. This year is obviously minimal. As I see it today, there will be contributions required next year. They'll be again in the hundreds of millions, not more than that. And kind of see that in the year following, but again we'll have to see where interest rates fall, and we'll make the required contribution. But we run that at kind of various levels, and again, because of the pension turnover, I don't see obviously that kind of headwind that I would have normally seen as far as required contribution if we were stuck with a DB plan for the next five years.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analysts' question-and-answer session. I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Thomas J. Downey - Senior Vice President, Communications","Thank you. We will continue with the questions for Dennis and Greg now. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002. Operator, we're ready for the first question, and in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question, please.","Operator","And we'll go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Hi, everybody. Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Julie.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Dennis, a quick question. Could you just step back and sort of spell out your expectations for 747 following this latest reset? Do you see a future for this program beyond Air Force One?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Julie, as we announced the decision we made here, it takes into consideration a sluggish cargo market, and our projections for future production rates. And the decision in essence that we made was to maintain our current production rate of half an airplane per month that we're implementing this year and to extend that out into the future rather than assuming we would ramp back up to one a month in 2019. That's the fundamental assumption change here, and it reflects what we see in the cargo market.","Now we still see a cargo or freighter aircraft replacement cycle out in that 2019, 2020 timeframe. We have a number of ongoing customer discussions in the cargo marketplace in addition to the two Air Force One airplanes that you referenced. So a number of very viable campaigns underway to fill to that half a month production rate. That said, we still have our work cut out for us.","Cargo is a tough market right now. I will say that the decisions we've made on 747 I think put that program in a much more solid footing for the future. It's aligned with the marketplace. As noted, we also wrote off any remaining deferred production inventory, so we've significantly derisked that program from a financial standpoint for the future. And we're going to continue to work to fill out the skyline.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Jon Ostrower - The Wall Street Journal","Hey, good morning, guys.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jon.","Jon Ostrower - The Wall Street Journal","A question about this change in supplier payment frequency. You talked about the need to be more competitive, aligned with how your suppliers are paying their own suppliers. But ultimately what is the goal here? What are you trying to be more competitive on? You've riled up GKN and Rockwell Collins, two of your closest suppliers that have \u2013 Rockwell Collins most notably has been held up as your sort of greatest example of how you want to be partnering for success as far as part of your cost cutting, and now they're out there really upset that they're missing their bottom line targets in the quarter. So I just want to understand what exactly you're trying to accomplish by doing this beyond just an industry norm practice when you've got your closest suppliers who very rarely air public grievances calling you guys out.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Jon, I guess I would start with, obviously we're in a competitive environment, and so it all starts with market-based affordability and then how does that impact your business. So as I indicated, when it comes to working capital, we're looking at where we are on different measures around working capital, and where everybody else is in this industry. And certainly the two suppliers you called out are great suppliers to us, and we've been working with them over the last year on transitioning to a more, I'll say, industry standard around payments. And we were paying daily millions of transactions, and we were paying daily. That's not an industry standard. We're going to twice a month. And then we're looking at terms again to be competitive, managing our working capital efficiently, and allowing us to invest in our future that ultimately everybody will benefit from, from our customers down to our suppliers. These are important partners.","But hey, we got to face into the environment that we're in and be efficient across the board. And as you know, under partnering for success, this is also us reaching back into the supply chain, taking best practices that we have encountered in other parts of our business or the supply chain and sharing those with the supply chain to ultimately make them better. So I'd say it's across the board, and again it's all about being market based and facing into those realities. And frankly in this case just getting to industry standards.","Operator","Our next question is from Al Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alwyn Scott - Thomson Reuters Corp.","Hi. Good morning. Dennis, you mentioned the slowing wide body sales and keeping an eye on rates to maintain balance and it seems like there's a bit more emphasis there on that rate adjustment possibility. Given your pledge really not to cut prices to win orders, is the 1 to 1 book-to-bill ratio now really an aspirational goal? And if not, what are you doing to improve sales?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Hey Al, first of all more broadly, we're still targeting a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 for the year. And again, we don't get too encumbered with the exact timing of those orders, and it's very clear that this year's order cycle is more favorable on the narrow bodies. And so if you're looking at numbers of aircraft, we expect the predominance of that orders flow this year to be in the narrow bodies arena. That all said, we're going to continue to work hard to fill out the wide body skylines as well.","We don't need to make drastic changes to pricing in order to capture market share. We're not going to be driven to just get market share for market share's sake. I will say in the wide body marketplace, even though we're seeing some hesitation in buying, the value proposition of our airplanes is holding up well. So this is all about a look ahead to efficiently managing our production skyline and keeping supply and demand in balance.","And clearly we've got more work to do on the wide body front while narrow body orders are trending to be very healthy and continuing to be healthy this year. So that's our headset. And as normal, we do a lot of scenario planning around this and different assumptions around wide body orders and what that future skyline will look like. And as you heard earlier, our commitment is to make the decisions that allow us to make the transition on the 777 efficient and productive. And we will do that.","Thomas J. Downey - Senior Vice President, Communications","Operator, we have time for one last question if there is anyone remaining in the queue.","Operator","And we'll go to Benjamin Zhang with Business Insider. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Zhang - Business Insider","Good morning gentlemen.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Benjamin Zhang - Business Insider","I just wanted to take a step back and talk about the 787 program. I was wondering if you guys could give us an update on the remaining terrible teens inventory of the early build aircraft. How many do you guys have left and what are your plans for them?","Thomas J. Downey - Senior Vice President, Communications","Yeah, they're all sold. And so they'll deliver here over the next couple years.","Thomas J. Downey - Senior Vice President, Communications","That concludes our earnings call.

Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analysts and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcasted live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am going to turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead.","Maurita Sutedja","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja. And with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance & Strategy.","After management comment, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder you can follow today\u2019s broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which is detailed in our news release in our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this rough presentation.","In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our 2018 operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. With that, let's move to Slide 2.","Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our teams across the company. Boeing delivered strong 2018 financial results that included record revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow, driven by record commercial air craft deliveries, higher defense space and securities and services volume and strong performance. And all of our three businesses increased their backlog in 2018.","We sharpened our focus on profitable, sustained long-term growth strategies, disciplined execution of our production and development programs, delivering greater life cycle value, including growing our services business and driving further quality, safety and productivity gains across the enterprise.","For the full year, we generated record operating cash flow of $15.3 billion. We repurchased 26.1 million shares for $9 billion and made dividend payments totaling $3.9 billion in 2018.We continue to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders while investing in our people, innovation and future growth. In December, our Board of Directors authorized a new $20 billion share repurchase program and a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increase is a part of our balanced cash deployment strategy and reflected the confidence we have in our strong lineup of products and services in our long-term outlook for the business.","Turning to our core operating performance for the year, Boeing Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $60.7 billion reflecting a record 806 deliveries, including the delivery of the first 787\u201310 Dreamliner and the first 737 Max 9. During the year, we delivered 256 Max airplanes nearly half of the total 737 deliveries. Continued healthy sales activity contributed to 893 net new airplane orders during the year adding to our robust backlog stands at nearly 5,900 airplanes and is worth $412 billion. Our backlog equates to about seven years production at current rates.","B Commercial Airplane milestones in 2018 included the delivery of the 787 Dreamliner and the first airplane from the new 737 completion center in China. The 737 program increased its production rate to 52 per month and made good progress on its recovery plans to mitigate supply chain challenges with the 173 aircraft delivered in the fourth quarter. Also in the year, we completed the first flight of the 737 Max 7 and delivered the first Max Boeing business jet airplane. The 777X program achieved a number of key milestones last year as we rolled out the static test airplane and began production of the flight test airplanes. We recently completed Final Body Join for the first flight test airplane and turned on its electrically powered systems. We plan to start flight testing this year and remain on track for the first 777X delivery in 2020. Meanwhile the 787 program further matured its rate readiness. We have started transitioning 14 per month in our factories and supply chain as we prepare to begin delivering at this higher rate. We expect to complete the transition in the second quarter.","Now over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported revenue of $23.2 billion, a 13% growth year-on-year, reflecting higher volume across its business. BDS booked $36 billion of new orders during the year, including wins on important new franchise opportunities like the T-X trainer, the MQ-25 unmanned aircraft and the MH-139 helicopter. More recently, in the fourth quarter, BDS was awarded contract to modernize the entire Spanish Chinook Helicopter fleet and a joint ground system to provide tactical satellite communications for the U.S. Air Force. BDS made progress on a number of critical program milestones, including delivering the first two KC 46 tankers to the U.S. Air Force earlier this month. Two more tankers have been accepted by the Air Force, and we expect to deliver these aircraft imminently. We look forward to working with the Air Force and the Navy during their initial operational test and evaluation of the KC-46, as we further demonstrate the operational capabilities as this next generation aircraft across refueling, mobility and combat weapon system missions. Additionally we receive the contract provide the second KC-46 international tanker to Japan. This highlights the broader demand in market opportunity that we see for this program. Other key operational milestones for BDS included the unveiling of the SB-1 Defiant helicopter Boeing and Sikorsky are developing for the U.S. Army's joint multirole technology demonstrator program and completing another Minuteman III flight test.","We continue to ramp up the activities for the T-X and MQ-25 programs. These wins are the culmination of years of unwavering focus, improving our technology and derisking the programs. We have developed and flight tested two all-new production ready T-X jets with 76 flight tests having been completed to date. We've already seeing strong interest as well for the T-X from outside of the U.S. On MQ-25, we have demonstrated deck handling and engine trials. Our MQ-25 prototype aircraft is currently in ground test and expected to undergo first flight this year.","Now turning to Global Services. BGS reported revenue of $17 billion, representing 17% growth year-on-year. Business operations begin in July of 2017. BGS growth is consistently outpaced the average for the services market. BGS continues to win new business, highlighting the value we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers and the strength of our One Boeing offerings. BGS booked new orders totaling approximately $18 billion in 2018. The awards included support services and sustained the contracts for military customers globally such as the recent C-17, F-18 and F-22 contracts with U.S. Navy and Air Force and F-15 for Qatar.","In addition to the strong momentum in its parts and supply chain business, BGS continues to expand its market-leading digital solution portfolio and customer base. In the fourth quarter, more than 5,300 commercial and military aircraft were monitored in flight by airplane health management, a cloud-based real-time health monitoring solution. Adding to the list of our digital analytics customers Shenzhen airlines recently signed up for crew pairing and rostering services. Shenzhen will be the first airline in China to use Boeing analytics power crew management solutions bringing the most advanced data analytics capabilities to the airlines, allow them to focus on their core business is serving their customers while improving efficiency and cost.","In the fourth quarter, we also completed acquisition of KLX, a major global provider of aviation parts and services. Boosting our supply chain capability enables us to better serve our customers while profitably and purposefully growing our business. Our integration activities continue to progress well. We've retained the top KLX talent and are on track to achieve or exceed our business case synergy value.","Additionally, last year we started operations for our airplane seat joint venture with Adient, and an Auxiliary Power Units joint venture with Safran. These partnerships support Boeing's vertical integration strategy to strengthen in-house capabilities and depth in key areas to offer better products that deliver greater value to our customers, grow our services business and generate greater life cycle value. We've also made progress in our strategic partnership with Embraer. We've recently received approval by the Government of Brazil and signed definitive agreements with Embraer. The Embraer shareholder votes scheduled for February 26 is the next major milestone. Over the coming months we'll continue to work with Embraer global regulators and other stakeholders to complete the transaction and create the most important strategic partnership in the aerospace industry. Assuming the approvals are received in a timely manner, we expect to close the transaction by the end of this year.","In summary, we delivered another year of strong operating performance, captured noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog, returned significant cash to our shareholders, invested in our people and in our business to drive innovation and excellence and complemented our organic growth with planned strategic inorganic investments. With that, let\u2019s turn to the business environment on Slide 3.","We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in commercial, defense, space and services. These are sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals with a combined market opportunity of $8.1 trillion over the next 10 years. I would note that as a global company with customers in 150 countries, we're always mindful of the potential impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic forces. We continue to track a host of near-term issues and mitigate potential risks as appropriate. We value and maintain strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world, reinforcing the mutual economic benefits of the strong and prosperous aerospace industry.","In commercial aviation, global passenger traffic continues to grow faster than GDP and long-term trends. The 2018 passenger traffic grew 6.6% through November, representing the ninth straight year of above trend growth. We believe the changing nature of travel with more connected city pairs and the rising middle-class has fundamentally expanded traffic patterns and supports sustained growth. At the same time, airlines are maintaining capacity discipline, keeping supply demand imbalance as industry profitability remains near historic highs. Meanwhile, Air Cargo continued its solid momentum in 2018 with traffic increasing nearly 4% through November.","Our customers continue to recognize the superior value proposition of our more fuel efficient airplanes as reflected in the strong intake of new orders we saw last year. For 2019, we expect to see our new order intake to be moderated but still at a healthy pace.","Our sales expectations are built on the diverse demand that we\u2019re seeing around the world and across airline business models. There also is more balance between airplanes purchase for fleet growth and replacement leading to more stable purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in these key market dynamics in aggregate continues to drive less cyclicality for our industry. Over the long term, we remain highly confident in our outlook, which forecasts demand for nearly 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, which will help double the size of the global fleet. These long-term demand fundamentals combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates.","Now turning to our product segments, starting with the narrow-body, our current production rate of 52 per month and planned increase to 57 this year is based on our backlog of more than 4,700 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. The 737 program added 13 new customers during the year and the Max family surpassed 5,000 net orders in December. We continue to assess the market upward pressure on the 737 production rate.","As with all rate increases, we continue to assess the supply chain readiness as well as the market demand in an integrated manner as part of our disciplined decision-making. In wide-body segment, we have seen steady orders for the 787 and the 777, and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide-body replacement demand early next decade. The current generation 777 continued its steady sales momentum with 51 net orders. The 777 program is captured more than 2,000 orders since its launch. These additional orders brought the backlog to 100 aircraft and provide further support for the 777 bridge.","Turning to the 777X, we've recently launched our Boeing Business Jet variance, the longest range business jets ever that can connect virtually any two cities in the world. We have a strong foundation of 340 orders and commitments for the 777X, which support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We\u2019re focused on further bolstering the 777X skyline.","The combined 777, 777X production rate is slight for month. As we transition to 777X, we continue to expect the delivery rate to be approximately 3.5 aircraft per month in 2019, and we expect the delivery rate to increase slightly in 2020 as we continue to assess 777 demand as well as 777X timing.","The 787 Dreamliner extended its status as the fastest selling twin-aisle jet in history with 109 net orders last year or more than 1,400, since the program launched. Highlights include Hawaiian Airlines and Turkish Airlines becoming new 787 customers. American Airlines and United Airlines added to the growing list of repeat 787 Dreamliner customers, highlighting the strong market preference for the 787 family and its superior value. With more than 600 in the backlog, our plant increased Dreamliner production to 14 airplanes per month this year is well supported.","Turning to our 747 and 767 programs. With our unmatched freighter product lines, we are well-positioned to capture the increased cargo demand. We added four new orders for the 747 in the fourth quarter. And as previously announced, we planned to increase 767 production rate from 2.5 per month to 3 per month in 2020. As Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. The BGS portfolio is well-positioned with the mature world-class set of platforms to address current needs and innovative capable and affordable new franchise programs to build the future. We expect to continue to see broad support for our products in the Pentagon and Congress.","Fiscal year 2019 defense bills authorized a fourth multiyear procurement for the F-18 fighter, added funding for additional rotorcraft, funded the requested quantities, our key programs across our fixed wing and commercial derivative aircraft portfolios and supported our missile, space and satellite products. While the fiscal year 2019 NASA appropriations have not yet been enacted, Congress is also demonstrated robust support for our key space exploration programs.","Demand from outside the U.S. for our defense and space offerings also remains high, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers. We will continue to leverage capabilities and technologies from across our enterprise to win important opportunities such as the ground based strategic deterrent.","Turning to the services sector. We see the $2.8 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. BGS provides agile, cost competitive services to our customers worldwide. We aim to continue to growing faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share.","BGS' 17% year-over-year revenue increase solidifies our confidence and the growth opportunities and our team's ability to capture it. Strong orders of $18 billion as the year reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition and helping them optimize the performance to their fleets and reduce operational cost through the lifecycle. Our focus for BGS remains on optimizing the businesses and expanding our portfolio offerings through organic growth investments such as strengthening our vertical capabilities, complemented by strategic acquisitions and partnerships positioned BGS for sustained long-term and profitable growth. Our expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well-positioned to compete and win in this important sector.","In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remained intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future. For example, the first test flight of our autonomous passenger air vehicle prototype last week chose our efforts to continue to lead with the safe, innovative and responsible approach to new mobility solutions. Our One Boeing strategies and offerings across our three businesses are key differentiators that helps demand our position as the world's leading aerospace company.","With that, Greg, over to you for the financial results.","Greg Smith","Great. Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everybody. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our full year results. We booked record revenue of $101 billion in 2018, exceeding $100 billion for the first time in the company's history. This is driven by record commercial aircraft deliveries, higher Defense, Space & Security volume and continued growth in services. Core earnings-per-share totaled $16.01 for the full year, and other record reflecting higher volume, improved mix and solid execution across the company. Operating cash for the year was also a record at $15.3 billion. The robust cash generation was largely driven by higher volume and strong operating performance across the businesses. Let\u2019s move now to our quarterly results on Slide 5.","Fourth quarter revenue increased to $28.3 billion driven by growth in all three businesses while core earnings per share grew to $5.48, driven by higher volume and strong operating performance across the portfolio, which outweighed the favorable tax reform impact in the fourth quarter of last year.","Now let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue of $17.3 billion during the quarter reflected higher deliveries and favorable mix. BCA operating margins increased to 15.6%, driven by higher 737 volume and strong operating performance on production programs, including higher 787 margins. BCA captured $16 billion of net orders during the fourth quarter and the backlog remains strong at $412 billion with nearly 5,900 aircraft, representing approximately seven years of production. We delivered 238 aircraft in the quarter, including 173 737s. And as we discussed, the 737 deliveries for the year were back loaded due to production and supply chain recovery efforts.","Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue increased to $6.1 billion driven by higher volume across the BDS portfolio, including F-18 satellites and weapons. BDS margins increased to 10.9%, reflecting solid performance and favorable mix. BDS added $5 billion of new orders in the quarter, bringing its backlog to $57 billion with 30% of that from outside of the United States.","Turning now to Global Services results on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, Global Services revenue increased $4.9 billion, reflecting higher volume predominantly driven by increased sales of parts and supply chain solutions. Year-over-year growth of 17% for the full year, which was predominantly driven by organically more than meets our objective to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%.","BGS operating margins were strong at 15%, reflecting the mix of products and services in the quarter, as well as improved performance partially offset by higher period costs for investments focused on expanding our portfolio of offerings going forward. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $6 billion bringing our backlog to $21 billion. These wins underscore the strength of our One Boeing offerings to our customers.","Let's turn now to cash flow on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the quarter and full year was strong at $2.9 billion and $15.3 billion respectively. These results were driven by planned higher volume strong operating performance across the business and some timing of receipt and expenditures. We remain focused and on track with our balanced cash deployment strategy. In 2018, we invested $5 billion in R&D and CapEx, repurchased $9 billion of Boeing stock and paid $3.9 billion in dividends reflecting a 20% increase in dividend per-share from last year. And we also completed the KLX acquisition in the fourth quarter.","The strength of our business and our confidence in the sustainable long-term outlook are powering investments in productivity, innovation and growth, while delivering on our commitments to return cash to shareholders. As Dennis mentioned earlier in December, last year we reinforced our commitment to returning value to shareholders as our Board of Directors authorized a new $20 billion share repurchase program in a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend.","Over the last five years, we've repurchased more than 205 million shares and increased our dividend by more than 180%. At the same time, we've invested nearly $35 billion in key strategic areas of our business to support long-term growth sustainability for Boeing, for our customers and our shareholders. We remain committed to continue to execute on our balanced cash deployment strategy going forward.","Let's move now to cash and debt balances on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $8.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, $13.8 billion of debt and stable credit ratings. Our cash and debt position reflects the acquisition of KLX in the fourth quarter. And our balance sheet position continues to provide us with flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities while again returning value back to shareholders.","Turning now Slide 11 to discuss our outlook for 2019. Building on the strong performance in 2018, our guidance for 2019 reflects higher volume, improved core operating performance, additional productivity capture and continued focus and effort to drive growing cash flows.","Total company revenue for 2019 is forecasted to be between $109.5 and $111.5 billion, largely reflecting higher plan 737 and 787 production rate and growth in both services as well as defense, space, and security. Core earnings per share guidance for 2019 is set to be between $19.90 and $20.10 per share on higher volume, favorable mix and improved productivity and affordability.","Operating cash flow for 2019 is forecasted to increase by $2 billion to be between $17 billion and $17.5 billion. This is largely driven by improved 787 cash generation in 2019, higher overall volume, including 737 and 787 production and improving tanker cash profile that partially offset by increased plan 777X inventory related test aircraft and early build units and higher cash taxes, primarily due to improved unit profitability, as well as higher planned R&D spending in 2019.","Capital spending is forecasted to be approximately $2.3 billion and includes the timing shift some expenditures that were expected in 2018. Our investments align with our long-term growth and productivity strategy that supports for programs, innovation, productivity verticals and services.","And before we discuss the business unit guidance I would like to highlight the beginning of in January 2019, we are changing the realignment of our military derivative aircraft contracts, such as the KC-46 tanker P-8 Poseidon VC-25 Air Force 1 between BCA and BDS. This changes to better reflect the contractual relationship with the end customers as BDS calls the prime contract.","This accounting realignment does not change how BCA and BDS execute together on these contracts. Also it does not expect total Boeing sales, earnings assets, cash flow assets or liabilities. Our 2019 segment guidance includes the impact this realignment, and beginning in January 2019, revenue and costs associated with military derivative aircraft that was previously reported in both BCA and BDS will now be 100% reported in the BDS segment. And for comparison purposes as part of the earnings release, we provided restated 2018 and 2017 financial information incorporating this accounting change.","Now for 2019, commercial airplane revenue guidance it is set to be between 64.5 and 65.5 billion. And as we've discussed this is largely driven on the higher deliveries of 737 and 787 program, partially offset by the impact of the military derivative aircraft realignment the BDS.","The ramp up on the 737 Max production continues and we expect 737 Max to account for approximately 90% of total 737 deliveries in 2019. In all BCA's expect to deliver between 895 and 905 airplanes for the full year. Incorporating this delivery guidance assumptions, our plan 737 and 787 production rate increases and the inter company deliveries of the military aircraft from BCA to BDS.","Commercial Airplane operating margin guidance is set to be between 14.5% and 15% on higher 737 volume and improved operating performance, which more than offset the higher period costs including R&D. The margin guidance also reflects all plan production rate increases.","Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2019 is between $26.5 billion and $27.5 billion, reflecting the higher volume in our new programs, strong backlog on core programs and the impact of the military derivative aircraft realignment from BCA.","Operating margin guidance for defense business is greater than 11% based on continued productivity efforts across the portfolio, offset by less favorable mix. Global Services revenue guidance is set to be between $18.5 billion and $19 billion with operating margins of greater than 15%. BGS margin guidance reflects solid performance, mix of products and services as well as investments to expand our portfolio of offerings. And as we discussed, we aim to grow faster than the average service market growth rate of 3.5%, as we expand our broad service offerings and gain market share while maintaining and growing margins.","We expect research and development spending to increase to approximately $4.1 billion in 2019, with approximately 60% related to BCA as we invest in future growth. BDS and BGS also continue to invest in key strategic growth opportunities and productivity enablers. In addition, we will continue to make investments at the corporate level for technology and innovation, with enterprise applicability. This 2019 R&D forecast also includes some timing shifts and some expenditure previously planned in 2018. Our R&D funding will continue to be focused on our core programs, key future franchises, productivity enablers such as automation, prototyping and capabilities to further are vertical content, lifecycle capture, and other key growth areas such as economy and mobility solutions. We will continue to make the required investment innovation and technology to ensure our products and services continue to win in the marketplace. And going forward, we expect our overall R&D spending as a percentage of revenue to be relatively stable. While our organic investment remains the primary engine for growth, we may partner with other industry players and investments that accelerate our lifecycle value strategy and strengthen our vertical capabilities and content, as demonstrated by the proposed strategic partnership with Embraer, which assuming all approvals are received in a timely manner we expect to close by the end of the year.","Now consisted with prior years and given the seasonality of our business, as we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter to be the lowest quarter of the year for revenue. With the relatively light commercial airplane deliveries, January is expected to have slow delivery activity consistent with prior year trends and reflects the supply chain recovery plans. Core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of the full year earnings, and first quarter operating cash is forecasted to be approximately 10% to 15%, again driven by lower volume and the timing of receipts and expenditures.","As we look towards the remainder of the year our key focus areas are continuing to manage the 737 recovery progress within our factories and throughout our supply chain, including assuring rate readiness for a smooth transition to 57 a month, also working together with our U.S. Air Force customer delivering additional KC-46 tankers, continuing healthy order momentum, especially our new program such as the 777X, as well as strong execution across the portfolio including T-X and MQ-25 development.","So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. We continue to use our three business unit strategy as a key differentiator to win in the marketplace, make prudent strategic investments and leverage the talent and innovation from across the company. At the same time, we will set challenging goals and objectives around elements of operations and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency to generate cash, improve working capital while drive value to our customers. All these will help us achieve our growth goal to grow year-over-year revenue, margins and cash flow.","With that, I'll turn it back to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis Muilenburg","All right. Thanks Greg. 2018 was the year of strong performance and record results on many different fronts operationally and financially. A demonstration of how our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. These results were achieved through the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnerships that we have with our customers and suppliers. In addition to the strong commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we have taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business. This includes remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, derisking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts, and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical.","We've executed on our long-term strategy of robust and continuing organic growth investment and returning value to shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. The planned strategic partnerships with Embraer, the recent KLX acquisition, and the seats and APU joint ventures are entirely consistent with the strategy. Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continued building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts.","As always, we'll continue to keep a close eye on the geopolitical and macroeconomic forces and prudently manage the risks. Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, continuing to strengthen our Defense, Space & Security business, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, disciplined leading-edge investments and a balanced value-creating cash deployment strategy and continuing to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth and increasing value for our customers, shareholders and employees and other stakeholders.","With that, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","On the 737 at what point you expect to be caught up on deliveries? And what are the pressure points identically? Also how does that inform the latest thinking and timeline on decision beyond 57 a month?","Dennis Muilenburg","Certainly 737 production system health remains a key focus for us. As you can see by the fourth quarter deliveries with 173 in the quarter and 69 in December, good signs of recovering to our production plan. You can also see the increased rates reflected in our full-year guidance for deliveries for 2019, as we continue to ramp up. I would say we still have work to do on the recovery efforts. We have seen some good solid progress. We still have work to do inside our own factories and in our supply chain. And that is the daily and weekly focus for us, very intense effort. I'll say within the supply chain, we have seen some solid recovery in several areas. We still have some areas that need work including engines. And we are doing some additional work with CFM, including deploying some additional Boeing personnel to their factories and to their sub tier suppliers. So that\u2019s one area that will have some additional focus for us in the first quarter. And as Greg mentioned, just in terms of production profile for the year, we expect the first quarter to be the lightest quarter of the year, and we expect January to be the lightest month within that quarter. So we are going to continue to work hard on production system holds and recovery. And then as you alluded to, at same time, we are moving forward on our plans to ramp up to 57 a month during the year. Some elements of the supply chain have already moved to that position. We still have some work to do before we move the entire line to 57 a month. And we are going to be very, very disciplined in that process. Again we are making good progress. We know exactly what needs to be done, but we are going to just look at this through very clear eyes and step through it day-by-day, week-by-week, and make sure that we in a very disciplined and smooth way move to 57 a month. I think we learned some lessons from the 52 a month step that we did last year. And those lessons are certainly being applied this year on the 57 a month are rate changes. But you see all of that again reflected in our plans and our guidance for 2019.","Operator","Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Could you catch us up on your latest thinking on the NMA? And maybe tie that to your view on moderating demand, I guess, if -- demand would obviously fluctuate a bit if you chose to launch the aircraft with the pile of launch customers, I would imagine. So maybe just juxtapose those two different points.","Dennis Muilenburg","Myles, I would say -- first off, to take a look at NMA, we are still working through that same disciplined decision process that we talked about previously. We\u2019re making progress on that. We had very productive conversations with customers. We understand the markets. It's clear that there is a market need, but we\u2019re working through the details of the business case. And as we said, we are going to be very disciplined on how we do that. And while we\u2019re making progress, we're not up to our decision point yet. And just to provide clarity on that, as we mentioned before, we do see a decision point this year and that is a decision of whether we would offer the airplane in the market. And we need to complete the business case analysis before we arrive at that decision, but that is one that\u2019s for this year. And then assuming a positive market response or depending on the market response, we will make the final launch decision next year. So it's a two-step decision process as we've always done with Commercial Airplanes and a very disciplined process. All of that, we're continuing to work our development program work and maturing the technologies, reducing risk in parallel to protect a 2025 EIS or Entry Into Service. We think that remains important to our customers. So we\u2019re working all of that in parallel. And again will March in a disciplined way through our decision process. Our assessment of the market and the size of that market hasn\u2019t changed. Now, to our broader question on orders and how the markets looking, again, we continue to see strong demand signal. So I think you see that reflected in orders volume for this past year with 806 deliveries and 893 orders. And, while as I said, we expect some moderation or timing on orders going forward, we have a very robust backlog position with about seven years of backlog -- equipment backlog in position now.","If you look at the stats on traffic growth, Cargo, global expansion of route structures all the fundamentals remained very strong, and we\u2019re encouraged by that. So we expect to see continuing steady orders volume. I wouldn't expect that to change significantly depending on the NMA decision. So we\u2019re going to be in the marketplace continuing to compete and win. I guess one other reminder on NMA, if we do decide to proceed with the authority to offer -- don't expect a big change in the R&D profile. This is all part of our planned R&D profile. As Greg said earlier, we expect R&D to continue to be roughly the same in terms of percentage of revenue going forward. So as revenue grows, you will see some R&D growth. That will be at the same percent. And if we launch NMA, it will better end on the backside of 777X. So from a profile standpoint it fits very nicely. Greg anything, do you want to add on that?","Greg Smith","No. Thanks. We got it.","Operator","Next question is from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn ","So your margins of BCA are now in your target area of the mid-teens, with the 2019 guidance where it is. And you're still not fully ramped with production rates as more upside there, and you built the higher R&D into the 19 forecast. So I wanted to ask how much of this 2019 improvement in margins is volume versus mix versus productivity? And with the supply chain initiative still ongoing, what is your longer term margin potential now? How much further can you go. I was going to ask you how much it differs with and without a new airplane. But I think you just answered that part. So the components of the improvement in 2019 and then what the potential is long-term not that you've gotten this far.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. No, no. It\u2019s a great question, Rob. I would say it's all the above. I mean certainly, the increased volume is a big driver to that, but the mix of that volume is important. And we have talked about and particularly 787 executing on bringing in the -9 or -10 flawlessly into the market and meeting the commitments to our customers there and ensuring that happens smoothly while going up in rate. You saw that in '18, and you are going to see that in '19 as we look to go to 14 a month there, but the productivity engine. So -- I'll say the targets that we've set for ourselves is the same play book that we put in place for last number of years of really just looking where we have opportunity, where we can leverage best practices. We have talked a lot about this for One Boeing effort. But there is a lot of -- there is a lot behind that. and leveraging things that are going on F\/A-18 on 87, and leveraging things on 87 over onto Chinook and vice a versa. That's now part of our operating rhythm. And certainly it's how we are all rewarded and ultimately how the company is rewarded. So this complete alignment to leverage these practices same in the supply chain. So the whole partnering for success effort is -- some of that is also where we have had productivity gains, how do we take those back in the supply chain frankly make the supply chain even better. But to come up with ways where we can both take that to the bottom line and reinvest in growth for the future.","So I would say, it plays into all three, but I, Rob, I would think about the playbook, the same playbook you saw for the last couple of years that\u2019s the playbook. And I would add to that benchmarking ourselves outside. The full global industrial champion effort that you could imagine that target keeps moving. So when we look at the cost of the function what's the cost us to run a function or how efficient are we with our capital and with our R&D and what are some best practices within industrials, outside the industrial, how we bring them back in the Boeing, make it part of our operating rhythm and hold ourselves to a standard that it's not necessarily industry, it could be -- its best-in-class. And then again, holding ourselves accountable and targeting ourselves to go achieve all that. So I would say same playbook so we don't really have a cap. I think I would say it's really just continuing to look for opportunities and compete to win, use some of that.","Robert Spingarn","It is your pace of improvement because you hit your target or at least you will in '19 based on the guidance. And again, you are not done improving the organization. So is there a new target?","Dennis Muilenburg","Rob, we are not slowing down. So as we said we set a target. We've been aggressively pursuing that. We've made some great progress and part of the team's efforts there. But the competition is only getting tougher, and we are not going to slowdown. So the pace of progress you have seen is the pace of progress we aim to sustain. And what we are looking for is continued year-over-year margin and cash flow growth. That's part of our planning. That's the framework that we set up for the team. And we are going to push with that pace.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Greg, I wonder if I just get a couple of clarifications on the quarter and then a question about the guidance. With respect to what you printed, just wanted to check on the unit earnings that the --, it looks like the 737 is still unit below your program margin, but not by much. And then with respect to the 87 deferred, it looks like you had a margin expansion there that kept the deferred down. I just wondered if that was correct. And then just building on Rob's question, what\u2019s built into your 19 plan? Do you have any material differences and period expense outside of R&D that you envision for next year that we should be considering. And so, can you help us quantify how we think about that?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. I mean, I would say outside of R&D, we definitely got some investments around productivity and systems that were making again, thinking about kind of long-term competitiveness. So we've got some money put aside in there and budgeted for the year.","Carter Copeland","Does that help year-on-year.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. So obviously, we will manage that extremely tight as we always do, but we got budgets in place there and clear initiatives in business cases to go drive that. They're at a little over and above what we we're spending in 2018.","Carter Copeland","All included in that.","Dennis Muilenburg","All included. Absolutely, yes.","Greg Smith","And your Unit 2 program, you got it, you right on it. I mean 737, but increase in 787, we had a block extension in the quarter that was a big driver of that units, sorry, that program margin increase.","Operator","And next we go to Douglas Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas Harned","I wanted to continue on the 787. And just to understand a little bit better, how you\u2019re looking at this longer-term and in terms of cash margin improvement? I mean, at a point now where you don't have that many shades in the mix anymore, and then you're going to have more [indiscernible]. And then, if I look at pricing, I wouldn't expect you to get a lot more from there. So can you talk about, as you look at the next few years, how you see that cash margin trajectory evolving and what's likely to drive it?","Greg Smith","Yes. Well, it's going to continue to grow, Doug. And as Dennis said, I mean the team's done a great job executing to our commitments, our rate breaks. But I know I keep going on about this, but we\u2019re not bringing two derivatives in while going up and rise. There is no small path and they done it extremely well, and then at the same time, leveraging the best practices. So that's all going to continue to play out. As you go forward here, you're right bringing in more --10s because the mix of the higher 9s and 10s, right now, it's predominantly 9, and --10 is good. You\u2019re going to see the benefit of that over that longer-term period from the cash perspective and then going up in rates. So you'll see the cash associated with those advances as well as with that higher rate. But again, at the same time bringing down the expenditures, and do not forget we've got step down pricing as well on the supply chain that will play into that along with our own productivity. So it's probably fits into about six categories of things that need to happen or things that are just going to happen through time as we execute through each of these blocks and having a more favorable mix combined with continuing to have a step down from the supply chain. So, again, we see growing cash flow on the 787. They have done a great job in delivering on their commitments to shareholders, but also the customers and now we\u2019re moving into the next phase, ","moving up into 14 and continuing to capture productivity gains.","Douglas Harned","And then just on the -10, when you delivered, I think, nine of them in Q4. So would it be fair to say that your -10 margins were probably a little less mature in the quarter we just saw and you should get some improvement out of that as well. Is that clear?","Greg Smith","To your point still relatively early in the production system and in the supply chain. So as that becomes more mature just like we would normally will come down that learning curve as the supply chain will and we will capture the benefits of that.","Dennis Muilenburg","To that, Doug, there is also big benefit from the high level of manufacturing commonality between the -10 and 9, which accelerates and reinforces what Greg said. And then the value proposition for that airplane in the market with our customers is very clear that it's generating value and its winning in the marketplace on the pricing side. It's holding up well there as well just because of the value its creating for our customers.","Operator","Next question from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","So you mentioned the idea of, I think, trying to bolster the backlog for 777 and 777x. And you talked a lot in the past about call wide-body replacement orders coming in the early part of the next decade. Does that mean in the near-term, are there 777x order opportunities or fewer opportunities in the near-term kind of focus on more of the classic and freighters and we are we kind wait until we get into the early part of the next decade to see the orders for the 777X comes through.","Dennis Muilenburg","Seth, we\u2019re working both in parallel. Certainly during the last year we've seen some great progress on the 777 with the 51 net orders in the year. And that's really strengthens that the bridge that we\u2019re building 777 to 777X. We still have some work to do to fill out the remainder of the bridge, but our confidence continues to grow in our ability to do that. And as we've made that progress, we are now shifting our teams more and more to 777X opportunities. As you said we do see a high wave of replacement demand early in the next decade. But that means those sales campaigns are underway now. So those are very active, we\u2019re engaged with a number of customers around the world. The 777x clearly is bringing a value proposition as the market gets attractive. And you'll see us focusing more and more on those 777x campaigns here during this coming year. So that's a very near-term effort as well. And all of that is consistent with the investment profile and the production system ramp and transition that we talked about earlier.","Operator","Next, we will go to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","In the free cash flow walk that you provided, you highlighted the headwinds from 777x in 2019. Could you maybe talk about, is 2019 going to be the peak year for 777x investment, I\u2019m thinking mainly working capital. And how many airplanes do you plan on kind of having in flow before you actually start making deliveries?","Greg Smith","Yes. The profile, David, certainly for the reasons you described building the inventory and the test aircraft and so on. So this year there is more headwind. And then as we move into 2020, that headwind will moderate. And so we will start to have some more positive cash flow with the combination of 777X moving into production and then into delivery. So this is kind of a peak year for us on, I will say, cash usage on 777 combined with 777x. So as Dennis said, transitioning the airplane today in the factory and moving through building up that move from development to production will be key, and obviously, a big driver on the cash flow and things are going well out there today. So we got very good early signs that the aircraft is moving into production system smoothly and any challenges we're having we\u2019re working through we know what they are, but so far so good. So that'll be a big driver of cash flow going forward.","David Strauss","And did I hear you say that 777 deliveries in 2020 would actually step up a bit is that just the legacy kind of 777 rate holding and 777X starting to deliver?","Greg Smith","Well, it's really the combined of the two. So it\u2019s the X and the 777. Now having said that, it's indicated we\u2019re still seeing lot of demand for the 777, in particular, in the area freight. So we\u2019re feathering all this together and making sure that we're in the marketplace and we are meeting the demands of the customers in the near-term, but at the same time feathering in the 777X. So that\u2019s kind of a key in 2020. But we're not seeing good demand there on the 777. So we will -- that will be a combined production rate on those two programs.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Just for clarity, 2020, production system will be operating in five months, when we look at that delivery rate, slightly increasing over the current 3.5 months delivery rate, that's the combination of 777 and 777X as Greg mentioned.","Operator","Next we will go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Going back to commercial profitability just because this is such a standout, how sustainable is the 100 bps of margin improvement? Are there any mix impact we should be thinking about with the 777 coming in with this changing customers dynamics for any pricing dynamics that would alter that trajectory?","Greg Smith","You're thinking kind of beyond '19?","Sheila Kahyaoglu ","Yes.","Greg Smith","Well, I mean, there is a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, when you get into '19, we're more stable at 14 a month and we're more stable at the 57. So again, we should be able to capture productivity and we're expecting to capture productivity in that. And there are some mix movements certainly between the 777 ramping down and the X moving in. So there's a lot of moving pieces, but I think, Sheila, and I will let Dennis comment here. But the objective we have in place is the same one as I address in the prior question. We\u2019re looking for opportunities where we can derisk production system and bringing in automation where we can bring in automation and bring in best practices with an overall objective to grow margins and fund our future and return cash to shareholders. So that's playbook. You should just think of that is the same no matter what the mix. So we don\u2019t let mix be the deciding factor. Mix is mix. It's our job to try to offset that or use that to our advantage the best way possible.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, and just to reinforce that Sheila, as Greg said, a lot of moving parts here, but the sustained margin growth trends is one that's long-term. So we expect to continue to see year-over-year margin growth in 2019 and further growth in 2020 and beyond. So this is all about long-term sustained top and bottom-line growth. And the gain book that we're operating here will drive that year-over-year.","Operator","Next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Let's think about the NMA for a second. I don\u2019t want to mid pick little bit, but again, as you just mentioned that NMA was going to be a two-step decision process with the final decision coming in '20. Are you saying that you would make the announcement for the public so to speak in '20 after talking your customers in '19? So if you could just clarify that announcement. And then the second part of the NMA question is how are these conversations going with your customers around this plane being used as a replacement aircraft versus opening up new market maybe relative to new designs in the past? Thanks.","Greg Smith","Yes, Hunter, let me take on the first one there. The process we are talking about here, the decision process, is identical to what we do so in all of our previous programs. So this year's decision is what we call authority to offer, that\u2019s based on a business case and our ability to go and have detailed discussions with customers that will be something that will be publicly announced once we make our decision around that. So that will be information that you will see and that will initiate deep and meaningful customer conversations. And then depending on market response and our ability to build the right kind of group of launch customers then we get to official launch -- authority to launch decision next year. So both of those steps are typically public steps, and ones that you would see. Again, I want to reemphasize the discipline that we are putting into this figure not only decisions related to the airplane in that market, they are also decisions related to the enterprise transformation objectives that we have in terms of production system for the future. So we are looking at this as a total enterprise effort and really being very disciplined in our business case analysis. And then your second question Hunter?","Hunter Keay","Yes, it was sort of just how the conversation is going through your customers preliminarily at least around this plane being used as sort of an enabler of opening up new point-to-point markets versus replacement relative to say really I was thinking about 787 specifically, but just broader in general. Thanks.","Greg Smith","Yes, we have talked extensively with customers here, more than 60 customers and very consistent feedback. And we do see several different market segments and potential applications for this airplane. We do see a market need here that's in between today's narrow-body and wide-body families. It\u2019s a market area that really cannot be addressed by modifying those existing platforms and aircraft. Some of that is medium haul -- medium-range segments that today are being served by -- I'll say inefficient use of wide-body. And we see that as an opportunity for airline customers to gain efficiency. But a good portion of this is also creation of new medium-range route structures. And just as we saw with introduction to 787 where we saw roughly already 200 new city pairs emerged because of the capability of the airplane in the medium-range marketplace, are again 4,000 to 5,000 mile kind of range. We see an opportunity for significant regional city pair growth from this airplane. And that's another area where we are gaining customer feedback. So there are multiple segments of applicability, significant customer interest. The key here is for us to build a business case that\u2019s going to create value for our customers as well as value for our company and our shareholders. And that's the work we still need to finish.","Operator","Next we go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Just a question, and maybe a follow-up. How do we think about the 900 airplanes like where do you have to transition 73 and 78 to get to 900. That\u2019s a lot of airplanes. Total make 75 a month right on average?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, Ron, you've made the right calculation here. So as I mentioned, we\u2019re well into the 14 a month rate step on 787, and we expect to complete that transition in the second quarter. So that's a moving forward very briskly and on track. On the 737, we've already moved parts of the supply chain to 57 a month. But we still have some work to do on some elements of the supply chain in particular with engines and CFM. And we\u2019re not going to make that full transition of 57 a month. And so we\u2019re very confident that were ready. And it's important that we do that in a very disciplined way. So you can back into the number mathematically with about 900 deliveries for the year note that 900 roughly deliveries for the year also includes the military derivative. So P8 tankers are all included in that number, just for clarity.","Ron Epstein","And the maybe one follow-on on the NMA question. In the business case you may think about NMA, how do you think about it and the potential relationship it could have with the future family of narrow-bodies?","Dennis Muilenburg","It's one of the parameters that we think through anytime we're thinking about investments for the future make us we realize earlier. We fundamentally have changed our R&D investment strategy for the companies that it's feathered over the long term where we can sequence development programs so that we gain the benefits of continuous development and lessons learned program-to-program rather than stacking multiple development programs on top of each other. And that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking through NMA as well. So not only the development programs or that particular airplane in the market it will serve, but also how do we sequence it, how do we leverage learning\u2019s from 777X, how do we leverage what we're learning from things like T-X and roll that into NMA, and then how could we use an NMA investment to think about leverage and creating the production system for even more distinct future whether that be some future narrow-body airplane or other alternatives that we might invest in. But think of this is a continuum of R&D effort. This again is all key to creating a sustained growth business where top and bottom line of both long-term sustained growth levels. That is our approach here. And so we\u2019re thinking about NMA in that multi-program context.","Ron Epstein","Got you. Can I ask one more at the tail end here?","Maurita Sutedja","I think, we're \u2026","Ron Epstein","Can I ask just sort of quick one? Just for Greg. Greg, when we think about the 727 engine versus the MAX, just for modeling purposes it's going to review 90% MAXs this year. How do we think about the margin profile of one variant versus the other?","Greg Smith","Well, it's still kind of early introduction, right. So you take that into account, but net-net, you\u2019re in a similar margin profile as you're on NG. It's really just more around on timing from a unit perspective. It's how they are feathered in. So I wouldn't think of it any different. It's really just again more timing.","Maurita Sutedja","Okay. So operator, we have time for just one more analyst question.","Operator","That will be from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Hey, Dennis, just maybe an easier one on book to bill expectations in 2019, I guess, specifically around 737 MAX orders, you mentioned you had 13 new customers in 2018 and you had, really I think 5,000 aircraft since the launch. So that\u2019s close to 68%, I think, of the covers of NGs. Just how you are thinking about the order momentum with that program? Thanks.","Dennis Muilenburg","Peter, we continue to see strong order momentum there I think just another sign of it this week earlier you saw ANA's announcement about their intent to buy the MAX. And that\u2019s another addition to fleet there. So we see continued momentum on the MAX sales front. That airplane is creating value in the market for our customers. And we are oversold against our production profile. We talked earlier about ramping up to 57 a month. We are oversold against that profile. We're filling skyline slots way out in 2023. We continue to see upward market pressure overall on the production rate as result. And we think the demand for that airplane continues to be sustained. So while we have great orders volume and momentum this year. And I mentioned we might see some moderation in that demand this coming year. We still expect book to bill to be in that one-to-one range and there is always timing variability. But in terms of the MAX, the demand signals in the marketplace continue to be very strong.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Interim Vice President of Communication. ","Ms. Toulouse. Please go ahead.","Anne Toulouse","Thank you. We will continue the call with media questions for Dennis and Greg. And if you have additional queries following this session, please call our Media Relations team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we are ready for that first question. And in interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to one question please.","Operator","And first to the line of Andrew Tangel with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Andrew Tangel","Some other manufacturers have reported seen economic weakness in China, the major headwinds. What are you all seeing? And are the orders from China setting lines picking up and overall. Where do you expect to see that moderating order intake coming from around the world? And where is either demand slowing a bit or gross slowing a bit from what you all see?","Greg Smith","Yes, Andrew, let me touch on the China question first. We continue to see strong demand in China overall in terms of market dynamics. As I said earlier, over the years, we see a world that needs about 43,000 new Commercial Airplanes. We remain very confident in that outlook and about 7,700 of those 43,000 are in China. And that remains solid traffic patterns in China continue to progress. We're seeing passenger growth there that exceeds the overall market growth around the world and we also see passenger traffic growth there continuing to exceed GDP growth. So those market fundamentals remain strongly in place. In terms of our orders volume in China that's typically pace by timing of their five-year planning. So it tends to come in waves. So that\u2019s why we, again, as we look to the future we expect to see some timing adjustments on orders, but overall volume over the long-term remains very strong. And that really applies to my broader comment to about moderation of orders in 2019. As we look to the long-term the market fundamentals are very strong. And we see long-term volume of orders continuing to grow and adding backlog. It just gets into a question of local timing quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year as our customers meet their fleet needs. So nothing here that I would say is a macro trend or substantial change. We just see fundamental aerospace growth and air traffic growth as a long-term sustainable trend. And with the backlog of about 5,900 aircraft to roughly seven years of production, that gives us the ability to whether any local variations and maintain a long-term view in terms of sustain growth.","Operator","Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson","If I just wanted to make sure that I understood what your -- that point you're making on China, Dennis, do you potentially see a low in orders this year because the next five year plan is looming in the headlights. And then totally unrelated question and apologies for that, but where does CFM stand on its catch-up plan for the LEAP? How unusual is it for Boeing to embed your people in their supply chain?","Dennis Muilenburg","Julie, on your first question regarding China that was exactly my point earlier, given the five-year planning cycle there, we are having ongoing discussions with our customers in China, the Chinese government, the U.S. government. This also factors into the trade dialogue between the U.S. and China. But these are all factors that we\u2019re very much engaged in. Again, we expect China as a long-term growth market for us. But exactly how those efforts play out over the next quarter or two is still an open question as we proceed with trade discussions. I can tell you having been intimately involved in the discussions and engagement with the governments both U.S. and China, we see our progress on that front and we see convergence. And we also see that there is clearly a mutual benefit of having a healthy aerospace industry for both the U.S. and China. China needs the airplanes for growth to fuel their economy and to meet their passenger growth and cargo growth needs. And here in the U.S. our aerospace business is a tremendous U.S. jobs generator, manufacturing jobs. We hired 34,000 people last year. And we, as an aerospace industry here in the U.S., create about $80 billion a year trade surplus for the country. So there is mutual interest, and I hope the aerospace business. We expect that to lead the reproductive pre-discussions between the U.S. and China or at least be part of that. And then that will factor into the ultimate orders volume and timing with China. That's just a little additional context there. Regarding your CFM question, it's not unusual for us to have Boeing personnel at our suppliers sites and down into their supply chain. That's a very typical process that we would have. But I will say again as it goes 737, one of the supply chain health issues that we're spending a lot of time on right now is engines and our work with CFL. And so we\u2019re deploying additional resources with them into their factories and supply chain. Now we do expect to recover. We\u2019re seeing signs of recovery. But we still have work to go. And being deeply engaged in our supply chain as part of how we do business.","Operator","Our next question is from Sylvia Pfeifer with Financial Times. Please go ahead.","Sylvia Pfeifer","I had the China question which was one of my main ones. Can I just ask you about Brexit then? I know you\u2019re in a very different position to Airbus here in the UK. But I just wondered whether you see any risk to your operations in the UK in the event of hard Brexit just a few weeks ago before the 29th of March.","Dennis Muilenburg","Silvia, we're continuing to seek a very close eye on that as you might guess. And again, we\u2019re very involved in the discussion. That's -- we\u2019re committed to our operations in the UK. We've ramped up significantly over the last many years roughly doubling the size of our operations, roughly tripling the size of our supply chain in the UK and those are long-term sustained investments. And we don't expect that to change based on the outcome of Brexit. That's said we are keeping a very close eye on it and making sure it doesn't impact our operations. I think just as further sign of our commitment in the UK. You will note that during the last year, we opened our new operation in Sheffield where we\u2019re doing some advanced manufacturing work. It's also helping us to build out our actuation vertical capably, so just another example of our long-term commitment to the UK and the investments that we will continue to make.","Maurita Sutedja","Okay. Operator, we have time for one last question from the media.","Operator","And that will be from Dominic Gates with the Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates","As I\u2019m going back to the 737 MAX situation and CFM, in December with the delivery of 69 airplanes, it did seem like you have almost fully recovered. Has there been some further setback? And is the need to send people to CFM, is that because there's a problem with the ramp-up of the engine production? Or is there some configuration change that\u2019s become necessary? Can you just tell us a bit more? Also what's the timeline you expect to be back to normal, let's say?","Greg Smith","Yes, Dominic, first of all, as you saw in our December deliveries, as you alluded to, we did see some recovery across our supply chain, including engine supply and that enabled us to drive those December deliveries of 69 aircraft. But we were not yet fully recovered at that point, so we've continued to work supply chain recovery and there still work to go there. There is nothing here that I would say is an issue associated with having to change configuration or make that kind of alteration to the engine. This is really about just ramping up production and doing it efficiently and being able to get a liner profile engine deliveries that matches up with our factory production rate for the airplane and synchronizing those production systems. That's really what we're focused on. We still have work to go to get CFM to be supporting our 52 a month production rate and having those systems synchronized and then even more work to go yet to get them ramped up to 57 a month. And that's really what we're focused on. This is about production system ramp-up and synchronization. And by us getting deeper into the factories, it's going to give us better insight on long lead items. And, frankly though, I think help us do best practice sharing between Boeing and CFM, which is part of how we operate, right. That will make us better and it will make CFM better. And that work that we plan to be very focused on in the first quarter and timing of that is reflected in our overall delivery guidance for the year. So you can see that factored in. But we're going to be very, very disciplined about insuring supply chain health before we fully move to the 57 a month production rate.","Anne Toulouse","Okay. That concludes our earnings call.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Please go ahead.","Maurita Sutedja","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy.","After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.","We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussions today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our News Release, various SEC filings, and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our Earnings Release and presentations for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our 2017 operating performance followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that Greg will walk you through the details for our finance results and outlook.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of employees throughout our company, Boeing delivered 2017 finance results that included record earnings, record cash flow and record commercial aircraft deliveries. Furthermore, all three of our businesses increased their backlog in 2017. We sharpened our focus on profitable, sustained long-term growth strategies. ","Disciplined execution of our production and development programs, delivering greater lifecycle value, including growing our services business and driving further quality and productivity gains across the enterprise. We also demonstrated our commitment to our customers and to ongoing investment in our people and our business, well, once again returning significant value to our shareholders.","For the full-year, we generated record operating cash flow of $13.3 billion. We repurchased 46.1 million shares or $9.2 billion and made dividend payments totaling $3.4 billion in 2017. In December, we reinforced our commitment to returning value to shareholders as our Board of Directors authorized our new $18 billion share repurchase program and a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increases are part of our balanced cash deployment strategy and reflect the confidence we have in our strong line of products and services and the long-term outlook for the business.","Turning to our core operating performance for the year, Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported revenue of $56.7 billion driven by record 763 deliveries, including the delivery of the first 74 737 MAX airplanes. This was our sixth consecutive year of leadership in airplane deliveries. Net new commercial airplane orders were healthy 912 and brought our robust backlog to a new record of more than 5,800 airplanes, which equates to about seven years production at current rates.","Key commercial airplane milestones in 2017 included the successful launch of the 737 MAX 10 and the smooth transition of 737 production lines as we met our MAX delivery expectations, while increasing production of 47 airplanes per month. ","Also, in the year, we completed the first flight of the 787-10. Earlier this month, the 787-10 received an amended type certification from the FAA, clearing the airplane for commercial service. We plan to deliver the first 787-10 to our launch customer, Singapore Airlines in March. ","The 777X development program remains on track as well as we began production of the first 777X flight test airplane. Boeing Defense Space and Security had a solid year, posting healthy revenue and margins and with the team securing some key awards and making progress and critical program milestones including continued progress on the tanker program. ","In the quarter we received FAA certification for the 767-2C aircraft, verifying that the fundamental design of the KC-46 Tanker is safe and reliable. This is a key building block for the program as it retires risk and builds confidence as we continue our test efforts and work to complete the next phase of certification. We continue to make steady progress, closing out technical risk on the path to final certification and to delivering the first 18 tankers this year. We remain confident in the long-term value of this franchise.","Additionally, the contract to provide the first KC-46 international tanker to Japan, highlights the broader demand and market opportunity we see for this program. Across our Defense Space and Security Portfolio, we continue to provide the best value for our customers to innovative solutions, as evidenced by our $10 billion of new orders booked during the quarter, which included the contract to provide 36 advanced F-15 fighters to Qatar.","Other key milestones for BDS included meeting our commitment to the Missile Defense Agency to have 44 ground-based interceptors in place by the end of 2017 and delivery of the 150th EA-18G Growler to the U.S. Navy. ","During the quarter, we continue to make progress on the commercial crew program. As we successfully completed design certification review, which is a requirement prior to docking with the International Space Station.","During the year, we reorganized our business to establish Boeing Global Services, as we strengthened our focus on capturing value over the lifecycle of our products. Since beginning its operation in July of 2017, BGS is continue to win new business and that highlights the value we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers. The awards included a contract for F-15 sustainment for Qatar. In order for 7 737-800. Boeing converted freighters from GECAS a 787-landing gear exchange agreement with All Nippon and P-8I training agreement for India. These awards highlight the strength of our one Boeing offerings.","Before I close this 2017 recap, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on Amber Air and the potential combination announced at the end of last year. We have a longstanding history of collaboration with Amber Air, spanning multiple decades. We're interested in the business combination because we see strong strategic value and clear synergy in a number of areas, including highly complementary product lines, advanced vertical capabilities, broadening service offerings and leveraging world class talent and other combined resources. ","This deal is aligned with our long-term strategy of first robust and continuing organic growth investment and returning value to shareholders complemented by strategic acquisitions and enhanced and accelerate our growth plans. Our commitment to balance cash deployment and returning cash to shareholders remains unchanged. For obvious reasons we cannot share any more details about the ongoing discussions but these discussions are productive and we\u2019re continuing to have active dialogue with the key stakeholders. ","In summary, during what the momentum building year we achieved record earnings and cash flow, delivered strong core operating performance and strengthened our business for profitable long-term growth while making strategic investments to accelerate into our second century and returning cash to our shareholders. ","With that, let\u2019s turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see health demand in our commercial, defense space and services markets. In the commercial airplanes market, airlines continue to report robust profits and passenger traffic in 2017 grew by more than 7% through November exceeding the long-term trend of approximately 5%. Also, cargo traffic exceeded 9% growth in 2017 through November driven by strong trade and industrial production in all regions. ","As we look to 2018, we expect passenger traffic to grow between 5.5 and 6%. Our global customer continues to recognize the compelling value proposition that our new more fuel-efficient product family brings to the market. The strong new order activity in 2017 reflected this healthy demand. ","For 2018, we expect our new order intake to be moderated but still at a very healthy pace. We have also over the past few years seen an evolution in key market dynamics that we believe in the aggregate are driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry. We see more diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective as well as across the spectrum of airline business models. ","There also is more balance demand between new airplanes needed for fleet growth and those replacing older aircrafts and we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns. Over the long-term, we remain highly confident in our 20-year commercial market outlook which forecasts demand for approximately 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, comprised of more than 29,500 aircrafts in the narrow body market and approximately 9,100 aircraft in the wide body market. This long-term demand combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates.","Turning to our product segments starting with the narrow body, our planned production rate for the 737 going to 57 per month in 2017 is based on our backlog of more than 4,600 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. We continue to assess the upward market pressure on the 737-production rate. ","In the wide body segment, we have seen steady orders for 787 and 777 airplanes and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide body replacement demand early next decade. ","For the current generation 777 we received 40 net new orders in the year bringing the backlog to 102. We continue to make progress on the 777 bridge as highlighted by the recent orders as we transition production to the 777-X, we expect 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019 as previously announced.","While we still have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on our progress of maturing commitments into firm orders, managing the skyline and working new campaigns, we continue to believe the rate plan we put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current 777 to the 777-X. ","As we look forward to the 777-X, we have a strong foundation of 340 orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We also captured nearly 100 orders for the 787 Dreamliner family in 2017. A strong foundation for long-term production. With more than 650 firm orders in our backlog, our plan to increase Dreamliner production of 14 airplanes a month in 2019 is well supported.","Turning to Defense Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms of programs. While the fiscal year 2018 U.S. federal budget has not been finalized, congressional support for our key BDS programs is strong. We've seen support for funding levels above the President's budget request for a number of programs, including the F-18, CH-47 Chinook, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, AH-64 Apache, the V-22 and space launch system.","In addition, just recently the Missile Defense Agency announced its intention to issue a sole source contract to Boeing for expansion of the ground based Midcourse Defense Program. ","International demand for defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular the rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. As I mentioned earlier, we signed a contract to provide 36 advanced F-15 fighters to Qatar and we\u2019re making progress towards completing other previously announced international sales, including 28 F-18 fighter aircrafts for Kuwait, up to 40 more Chinook helicopters for Saudi Arabia, and the final C-17 for India.","Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration, and autonomous systems. Much of that investment\u2019s supports priority we placed in capturing future franchise programs where we are also leveraging capabilities and technologies from across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, unmanned carrier based MQ-25A, and JSTARS recapitalization, along with several other important opportunities.","Turning to the services sector, we see the $2.6 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. In this market, both our commercial and defense customers remain focused on improving aircraft readiness and availability while driving improved operational efficiencies. The formation of Boeing global services by integrating the services capabilities of government, space and commercial sectors into a single customer focused business, allowed us to offer market leading portfolio of service solutions that our customers can use to optimize their operations. We aim to grow faster than the average services market growth of 3.5% as we expand our broad services offerings to gain the market share.","Operating as a third business unit of Boeing, BGS provides agile, cost competitive services to commercial and government customers worldwide. Our global fleet care program that currently has more than 60 airlines operating more than 2,500 enrolled airplanes is an example of where we bring a high value, low risk and efficient fleet maintenance operation solution to our customers. ","Digital Solutions remains a key enabler for us as well with our portfolio reaching around $1 billion in 2017. This market leading position helps us empower our customers by leveraging the data, coming of the airplanes to reduce lifecycle cost. This capability combines with our operating and parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics, support and training as well as the BGS business to drive is the accelerating force across all Boeing services and support areas. ","Our focus remains on optimizing the business and expanding our portfolio offerings to position BGS for long-term sustain profitable growth. Our services expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well position to compete and win in this important sector. ","On a macro level, one significant development that took place in December last year was the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The new tax law about US companies to better compete on the world stage, create more quality jobs for US workers and invest in innovation. For Boeing, this tax reform gives us the stronger foundation for the investment in our future help us win in the marketplace. The tax reform will have a clear and direct benefit to Boeing, our employees, suppliers, our communities and other stakeholders. ","As we announced in December, we will make a $300 million investment in corporate giving work force development and workplace improvements as a result of the new tax law. We will also make additional investments and innovation driving new products, new services and new capabilities. Greg will go through the implications of the new tax law and our financial results and outlook in more detail later.","In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future. ","With that, Greg over to you for the financial results. ","Gregory Smith","Great. Thanks, Dennis. Good morning everybody. Let\u2019s turn to slide four and we\u2019ll discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a strong $93.4 billion on record commercial aircraft deliveries and continued growth in services and solid defense base of security execution. Core earnings per share totaled $12.04 for the full year another record reflecting strong operating performance across the company and favorable tax reform impact of a $1.74 per share. ","The tax reform earnings impact primarily resulted from the re-measurement of our net US deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter to reflect the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. ","Operating cash flow for the year was also a record at $13.3 billion. The robust cash generation is largely driven by strong operating performance across all businesses. ","Let\u2019s move now to our quarterly results on slide five. Fourth quarter revenue increased to $25.4 billion driven by growth in all three businesses while core earnings per share grew to $4.80 driven by strong operating performance across the portfolio as well as favorable tax reforms impact as I mentioned of $1.74 per share. ","Let\u2019s now discuss commercial airplanes on slide six. Our commercial airplane business revenue increased to $15.5 billion during the quarter on higher planned production rates and delivery mix. ","BCA operating margins increased to 11.5% on strong execution across all programs. BCA captured $25 billion in net orders during the fourth quarter and the backlog remains very strong at $421 billion and now more than 5,800 aircrafts equating to around seven years of production.","On the 787 programs, we delivered 36 aircrafts in the quarter and booked 94 net orders for the year. The deferred production balance declined as planned by $591 million in the quarter. Our teams remain focused on improving 787 cash generation driven by favorable delivery mix, additional supplier step down pricing and a relentless effort to further drive internal productivity and first-time quality. ","Turning now to defense, base and security results on slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue increased to 5.5 billion reflecting higher weapons and rotorcraft deliveries and operating margins were 10% driven by performance slightly offset by mix. During the quarter, BDS won key contract awards worth $10 billion and our backlog stands at $50 billion with now more than 40% of that from international customers. ","Turning now to Boeing Global services results on slide 8. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased to 17% for the quarter and 5% growth for the full year met our objective to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%. TGS operating margin was strong at 15.4% reflecting solid execution offset by a mix in the quarter. TGS results were a testament to team\u2019s focus on achieving topline growth while maintaining disciplined execution. A key win during the quarter underscores the strength of our one Boeing offerings to our customers. ","Let\u2019s turn now to cash flow on the next slide 9 please. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and full year was strong at 2.9 and 13.5 billion respectively. The results were driven by strong operating performance across the enterprise. Cash generation will continue to be a top priority going forward, in fact half of our employee incentive score is based on cash flow to ensure that we are fully aligned to this important objective across the company.","Now turn to slide 10. In 2017, we repurchased $9.2 billion of Boeing stock and paid 3.4 billion in dividends. As Dennis mentioned earlier in December last year we reinforced our commitment to returning value to shareholders as our Board of Directors authorized the new $18 billion share repurchase program and a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend. ","Our continued balance, cash deployment activity reflects our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. Balanced and prudent cash deployment is a product of our consistent focus on shareholder value and disciplined cash management. ","Since the end of 2012, we returned approximately $40 billion to our shareholders through dividend and repurchases. During this period, we raised our dividend by over 250% and reduced our share count by more than 205 million shares and significantly reduced volatility and risk around our pension through freezing our plans and pre-funding efforts. While executing these we also continue to invest in key strategic areas to ensure our long-term sustained growth for Boeing. ","Prudently and strategically manage our R&D and capital expenditures to create value for our customers and for our shareholders.","We will continue to expect operating cash flow to grow annually through the end of the decade and we remain committed to returning approximately a 100% of our free cash flow to investors, while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities.","Let\u2019s now move to cash and debt balances on slide 11. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities and stable debt levels and credit ratings. Our cash position once again provides us flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities, while returning value back to our shareholders.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 12 and we\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2018. Building on the strong performance we posted in 2017, our guidance for 2018 reflects improved core operating performance, additional productivity capture and as we long discussed growing cash flows. The guidance incorporates the estimated benefit of the tax reform on earnings in cash flow, net of additional investments that we will make as a result of the new tax law. The guidance also includes the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition and pension post-retirement accounting standards, which came into effect January 1, 2018.","Our expected effective tax rate for 2018 is approximately 16%. The two primary drivers for the difference between this rate and the new federal rate of 21% are one being the R&D credit and due to our considerable investments in innovation and new technologies that allow us to bring market leading products and services to our customers and the other key element is the deduction as a result of selling our products and services to non-U.S. customers, while creating intellectual property, excuse me, and manufacturing of our products here in the United States.","Obviously, we're still in the early stages of the implementation of the new tax law and therefore we may refine our estimate impact of the future quarters and we'll update you accordingly. ","As I mentioned, we have adopted a new revenue recognition standard as of January 1, 2018 to meet the required implementation timing under U.S. GAAP. Under these new standard contracts that previously recognized revenue based on deliveries, our performance milestones will now recognize revenue as costs are incurred. It will not change the total amount of revenue recognized, only accelerate the timing of when the revenue is recognized. The change in revenue standard will not affect cash flows. The new standard primarily impacts our defense contracts including certain military derivative aircraft contracts in our BCA business. It will not however impact revenue recognition for commercial airplane contracts in BCA.","The new pension and post retirement accounting standard involves reclassification of certain pension and benefit items from our operating to non-operating. The adoption of the new standard has no impact on our sales, core earnings, cash flows or liabilities. And for comparison purposes as part of this earnings release, we have provided restated 2017 and 2016 financial information, incorporating the adoption of these new accounting standards.","Revenue for 2018 is forecasted to be between $96 billion and $98 billion, largely reflecting higher planned 737 production and growth in defense space and security and services which is more than offset by the planned 777 volume, lower 777 volume as we transition for the 777x. We continue to expect revenue growth over the remainder of the decade and additional commercial production rate increases plan as we deliver on a robust backlog and execute on our defense space and security and services growth strategies. ","Core earnings per share guidance for 2018 is set to be between $13.80 and $14.00 per share on higher volume, improved productivity and affordability and the impact of tax reform. ","Operating cash flow for 2018 is forecasted to increase by $1.7 billion to be approximately $15 billion largely driven by the following. Improving 787 cash generation, higher 737 production and improved tanker profile partially offset by the cash impact from the 777 investments and planned 777 lower volume. ","At the same time the net impact of higher cash tax payments is incorporated and although we have a benefit from the lower effective tax rate, our cash tax payments will still increase compared to the prior period as our unit profitability continues to be improve on the 787 programs. ","Capital spending is forecasted to be approximately $2.2 billion returning to our more normalized level and includes the timing shift to some expenditures that were expected in 2017. Our 2018 commercial airplane revenue guidance is set to be between $59.5 billion and $60.5 billion. And as we previously discussed this is largely based on the higher deliveries on 737 program offset by the planned lower 777 volume. The ramp up was 737 MAX production continues and we expect 737 MAX to account for between 40% and 45% of our total 737 deliveries in 2018. In all, BCA is expected to deliver between 810 airplanes and 815 airplanes for the full year. ","Commercial airplanes operating margin guidance is greater than 11% on improved operating performance that more than offset the impact of the lower 777 volume. The margin guidance also reflects all planned production rate increases. ","Defense space and security revenue guidance for 2018 is between $21.5 billion and $22.5 billion reflecting the sale of our last C17, increased weapons volumes and strength of our overall international fighter business. ","Operating margin guidance for our defense business is approximately 11% based on continued productivity efforts across the portfolio. Global services revenue guidance is between $15 billion and $15.5 billion with operating margins of approximately 15.5%. And as we\u2019ve discussed we aim to grow faster than the average service market growth of 3.5% as we expand our broad service offerings and gain market share while maintaining and growing overall profitability. ","We expect research and development spending to increase to approximately $3.7 billion in 2018 with around 70% related to BCA as we invest in future growth while BBS and BGS also continue to invest in key strategic opportunities. This R&D spending forecast also includes the timing shift of some expenditures that were planned in 2017. ","Tax reforms certainly provides a stronger foundation for us to make additional investments in our business such as R&D. Our funding will continue to be focused on core programs, key future franchises, productivity enablers such as automation and capabilities to further expand our vertical content, life cycle capture and other key growth areas such as autonomy. ","We will continue to make the required investments at innovation and technology to ensure our products and services continue to win in the marketplace. And going forward, we expect our overall R&D spending as a percentage of revenue to be relatively stable. ","While our organic investment remains the primary engine for our growth we continue to look for opportunities to partner with other industry players and investments that accelerate our life cycle value strategy and vertical content as we demonstrated by the recent joint venture with Adient for seats, announced earlier this month.","Consistent with prior years and given the seasonality of our business as we look into the next quarter we expect first quarter revenue to be the lowest of the year of revenue. Core earnings per share is estimated to be approximately 15% of full year earnings and Q1 operating cash flow forecasted to be approximately 10%, again driven by the timing of receipts and expenditures in the seasonality of our business. ","So, in summary our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results and increase our momentum for our company. We remain focused on ensuring we continue the seamless ramp up of Boeing global services and leveraging our three business units strategy in the marketplace. ","And as I mentioned, we\u2019ll continue to make prudent disciplined investments to create value for our customers and our shareholders, while at the same time set challenging goals and objectives around elements of our operation and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency to generate cash and improve working capital all with an eye towards profitable growth in the second century and maintaining our commitment to balanced cash deployment and returning value to our shareholders and to our customers. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thank you, Greg. As I reflect on 2017, this first full year of our second century was a year of strong performance and record results on many different fronts both operational and financial. We would not have been able to do it without the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnership we have with our customers. ","In addition to the stabilizing commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we\u2019ve also taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business. including remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically pacing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with the long-term contracts and expanding our services business which is also less cyclical. ","We have executed on our long-term strategy for robust and continuing organic growth investments and returning value to shareholders complimented by strategic acquisitions that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. As we look to 2018, our teams remain focused on further driving both growth and productivity. As the world\u2019s largest commercial airplane maker, our nation\u2019s second largest defense contractor, a global leader in spaceflight and a growing force in lifecycle services we are optimistic about our future and the future of our industry as we have ever been.","Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments, and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts.","Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on a profitable ramp up in our commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund in innovation and growth, disciplined leading edge investments and balance value creating cash deployment and continuing to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry.","All of which positioned Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.","With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Just a quick clarification and question, Greg, on the unit versus program net differences were small, I wondered if you could just tell us if there was anything on a gross program basis that was significant in that and if you took any margin revisions on the various programs this quarter? ","And then on Boeing Global Services, you\u2019ve got some variability around the margin and at least the quarterly data that we've seen to-date and you commented about mix having an impact there and just in terms of understanding the algorithm, the profit algorithm here, how much variability should we expect in those sorts of numbers and how much mix impact could we see quarter-to-quarter in that business, just help us understand that one if you would?","Gregory Smith","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question because you're right, it's obviously considering the type of portfolio on the contract and the number of contracts, you are going to see variability just through whether customer mix or product offering mix quarter-over-quarter. ","But I think the ranges that you've seen it in and then as we kind of restated the numbers you get a good sense of kind of where it operates, but on a quarter-to-quarter basis, yeah, we\u2019re going to see some variability in there. But I would say that the team's very focused as we brought these units together and we talked about this prior is the cost structure. ","And so, they're not only are kind of working on what they're offering in the marketplace, but they're also working across the enterprise on the synergy opportunities as they bring the defense and the commercial, say, backroom services together there. So, part of the objective here obviously is to grow the margin profile, but you're going to see variability just because of the nature of the business. ","Dennis Muilenburg","On program margin we had a couple of moving pieces, we have the last early builds 787 deliver and then we have a couple of the 737-test aircraft in flow for fourth quarter. But other than that, we had margin expansion across all BCA programs. ","And Carter the only thing I'll add on the BGS front is, both Greg and I says we\u2019re focused on long-term profitable growth. So, while you see some variability on margins depending on particular contracts in customer frameworks, we expect to grow both top and bottom line and we are focused on that at top line growth will be profitable growth. ","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Seth Seifman","So, another question about services and just thinking about growing in excess of the market at 3.5% and looking at maybe 5% this year which is kind of what we were expecting. But, you could grow 5% for a very long time and not get close to $50 billion. And so just wondering if acquisitions are playing a greater role and your longer-term outlook for the services business?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. Seth, let me take and cut it down quicker. First of all, you\u2019re right for the total year we performed at about 5% growth versus 3.5% in the market. Saw a bit of acceleration beyond that in the fourth quarter, note that we just launched the business in the middle of the year, so we\u2019ve got six months under our belt. So, I\u2019d say that a good start but a lot of work is still ahead of us. ","We have set that longer-term $50 billion target for growth in this business achieving that over the next 10 years we\u2019ve been very focused on achieving that. We still see organic growth as a primary engine here. And continuing to outpace the market, growing at 5% to 6% a year at the start is a good start, we see some opportunities to accelerate that as we expand our parts business. ","Our engineering mods and maintenance business has some significant potential, our training business and then as we ramp up digital solutions in particular we see that as an enabler. Again, we\u2019re at the early part of that digital growth, we surpassed the $1 billion milestone just this past quarter in terms of volume in our digital business. That\u2019s a market meeting position that still has a lot of headroom.","We see organic growth is our primary engine as we head towards that $50 billion mark. We see an opportunity to complement that with M&A to your point, but we don\u2019t see the M&A is the primary growth engine here. It\u2019s primarily organic growth with complementary actions. I think a good example of that is the seats JV that we announced with Adient during this past quarter, that\u2019s the way for us to generate lifecycle value for our customers. It\u2019s something that complements our product line platform businesses and it\u2019s a services growth enabler for the longer-term. ","And we\u2019re going to continue to look for those kind of partnership or acquisitions to augment our services and business. Also, as we build out our vertical capabilities with both organic and inorganic actions, we expect those verticals capabilities to transition into lifecycle value or services growth. ","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Douglas Harned","I wanted to go back to BCA margins because when you look at guidance you\u2019re guiding to above 11% for 2018 that would be the best that I think maybe ever. Now, when you go there how do you see the different programs progressing to get you there and then when you look longer term out for 2020, you\u2019ve talked about getting to around 15% margins. Is that still the trajectory you\u2019re looking at and what needs to happen to get you to a target like that?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, Doug let me jump on that first thing, Greg and I [indiscernible] on the program specific. First of all, Doug that 15% margin target mid-teens target remains our clear focus and getting there towards the end of the decade and we are unwavering in that focus and I think what you see is this progress along that path in 2017. You see our guidance in 2018 as another step towards that. ","As we mentioned before we expect our progress to be steady over a multi-year timeframe to achieve that long-term target. That includes actions we \u2018ve taken throughout the enterprise to reduce our cost structure, market-based actions, reducing every element of our cost structure both in terms of direct labor cost and also significantly in our supply chain, we\u2019ve made some significant progress and are partnering for success initiative but we have more ahead of us than what\u2019s behind us. We see that as a significant lever for the future, balanced R&D deployment and making sure we\u2019re continuing to execute on the development programs as another complement of that. And then also on the pricing side, ensuring that our pricing is holding up in the marketplace by bringing in the highest value products. ","So, we\u2019re on a solid trajectory, we remain very focused on the end goal here, lot of hard work to go yet but it's an achievable target and one that we will relentlessly pursue. Greg do you want to add anything?","Gregory Smith","Yeah, just maybe a little bit detail on the programs. Obviously, we\u2019re expecting 787 to improve through time and I think the team has done a great job getting us to this point but the amount of initiatives that they have in place as they look forward is key to capturing that margin and I think again off to a great start and frankly setting some standards for our company about best practices, right down in the factory floor reducing flow time and improving first time quality in all aspects of the operations. So that\u2019s obviously going to prove in the mix Doug as we\u2019ve talked about we\u2019ll have a different mix profile on the 787 line that will also be favorable. ","You now 737 managing through the implementation of the math, team has done a great job, done a great job a lot of de-risking done upfront, that\u2019s really helped us from a margin perspective and just an overall cost objective as we made that transition and that obviously is off to a great start and will continue that momentum as we get more MAX aircraft in the line and that\u2019s more than offsetting the investments we\u2019re making in 777-X and then this transition between the rates on 777 to 777-X. ","So, and that beyond and then the other things that Dennis mentioned around period cost and the overall broader one company initiatives where we\u2019re leveraging best practices and getting them implemented and a reminder we\u2019re all on one company score here and so that\u2019s the primary driver. ","So, we\u2019re really embedding these best practices and bringing them across whether it's from states, fighters to commercial or vice versa really trying to amp that up because we\u2019ve got some great practices in segments of our business that we really went to leverage more going forward. ","Dennis Muilenburg","And to Greg\u2019s last point there, Doug as you recall, we launched Boeing analytics during the past year and we\u2019re just starting to see some of the benefits of applying those advanced analytics tools across our whole enterprise as another way to optimize, close, gain efficiencies in our factories, take out cost and I think we're just beginning to see the benefits of what those high-powered analytics tools can bring to our overall enterprise operations. So that will be another important ingredient going forward.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes, good morning. One for you Dennis and then one for Greg. The question for you Dennis is, with the seat venture that you have and you\u2019re talking of, doing some avionics. Do you have an objective is to how much you want to build internally now versus how much you outsourced to suppliers and how that mix might change? ","And then the one for you Greg, is this R&D in 2017 was $400 million less than your initial guide. Did all of that get shifted into 2018 or was there just some underspending in 2018 has some of that for something else? Thanks.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hey, George. On your first question regarding the verticals, that strategy is one that we launched this past year and we focused in on some key areas where we believe deepening our vertical capability will add value for both Boeing and our customers and at the same time produce lifecycle value to grow our services business. And so, we really began to focus that in the few areas that we see is as needle movers for us. ","One key area is in actuation, as you noted previously, we've stood up operations at Boeing Sheffield and Boeing Portland to begin building actuators for 777 and 737s, we expect to continue to grow scale in that vertical area. We see avionics as an attractive area both hardware and software and stand up of Boeing avionics this past year. That\u2019s scaled up now to several hundred engineers and we\u2019re working together across the enterprise and with our supply chain in that area. We see interiors selectively in the interiors area as a growth segment, that's where the seats JV comes into play as an example. ","And so, we're going to continue to invest in these vertical areas. We're going to be disciplined about it. We don't intend to be vertical everywhere, but where we can add vertical capability that's not able for Boeing and customers and creates long-term services value, we're going to invest. ","And in some cases, that will be done in partnership with existing suppliers, in some cases we may be looking at shifting more content between internal work and our supply base. Again, we\u2019ll do that in a disciplined manner in a way that produces value. Greg, do you want to take the second question?","Gregory Smith","Yeah, yeah. Really good question on R&D, I mean frankly, it's a little bit of both. I mean, there's some timing that we moved into 2018 and we've incorporated that, but there was also some underrun in as you know, this R&D expenditure, all elements of that, we've got very strong discipline and oversight in place. So, we are working and when we talk about affordability, R&D is a key element of that. So again, little underspending and then some shifting into 2018.","George Shapiro","Okay. If I\u2019m still on, Dennis could I pin you down just maybe a little bit like seating. Do you have an objective as to how much seating you rather supply yourself versus buying from outsiders?","Dennis Muilenburg","That balance is to be determined over time, George. We're going to start by ramping up this joint venture. We know we have some pinch points in the current supply chain and we can release some of those pinch points with this capability. We think we can bring unique value to customers and the scale of that business will be determined over time. It will be balanced between internal and external capabilities, but we intend to produce value here and we\u2019re very serious about these investments. ","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Sheila Kahyaoglu","I guess could you comment on working capital assumptions for 2018. How we should think about that and then the moving pieces there and particularly with regards to the 777 and inventory impact and any offset to that. Thank you. ","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. No, question Sheila. This is the [indiscernible] this transition between 777 and 777-X and building the static aircraft as well as the test aircraft, there is more headwind with regards to working capital on 777. That\u2019s more than offset by the elements that I talked about where 87 is getting better, 37 productions will improve. On top of I\u2019ll say the productivity initiatives, tanker and I mentioned as well. ","So, all of those more than offsetting the inventory build as we work through transaction from 777 to 777-X. And then lastly as I mentioned even though the tax rate has come down and we are going to pay more cash taxes in 2018 as a result of the improving unit cost performance on the 787. ","So those are the big moving pieces, but we\u2019re very steely eyed on all the elements of working capital and as I mentioned in my remarks that this is a top priority and you\u2019ve seen it in our results and you\u2019re going to continue to see it in our results going forward that we\u2019ve got again everybody diligently focused and it\u2019s on everybody's scorecard around working capital, inventory, payables, receivables. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to work that engine as we work through these great transitions, product transitions and rate increases. ","Sheila Kahyaoglu","And just a follow up, how do we think about advances and the assumptions there?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. There is not a big impact on advances from 2017 to 2018. Again, there is some moving pieces in there, but certainly not a big contributor to the cash flow profile year-over-year from 2017 to 2018.","Operator","Our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Just curious on the MAX integration into the three lines \u2013 and do you have the MAX on all three lines right now or maybe not quite yet since it\u2019s not half of the total deliveries. And as we going through that are you seeing any execution problems at all, the yellow or red on the risk register or looking now to CNE and your suppliers. Just wanted to get more color there given the ramp.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. Pete the ramp continues to be right on track. We delivered 74 MAXs during the past year. Greg mentioned in his comments as we ramp up -- continue to ramp up production overall going to 47 a month to 52 a month this coming year during the rest of 2018 and then 57 a month next year. That rate planned ramps up are continuing on track. ","This year we expect deliveries -- MAX deliveries to be about 40% to 45% of the total 737 deliveries. So, implementations on the lines is right on track. I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m just very impressed by what our 737 team is doing. I had a chance to be on the line again just recently and they\u2019re implementing productivity improvements, production lines, flow improvements, tax time improvements, all while rolling the MAX into the line. ","So, while it\u2019s a challenging situation it\u2019s a high-volume line, fast moving line, we\u2019re continuing to ramp up while we introduce the MAX into the line. It requires daily focus and daily attention; the ramp up continues on track and we\u2019re not seeing issues or any problems that are out of the ordinary. And we remain confident that we\u2019ll achieve our MAX ramp up cost for 2018. ","Pete Skibitski","That\u2019s right, good to hear. One quick one in the 787-10 certification, congrats on that number one. But maybe for Greg, Greg given how you guys have talked about the cost structure on the -10, should we expect to see kind of an immediate improvements to 787 unit margins as that kind of gives you a more meaningful part of the mix or is it going to take maybe a couple of years before that impacts the year. ","Gregory Smith","It's going to take a little bit of time Pete, as we bring it into the production system and it becomes I\u2019ll say more heavily weighted versus the overall delivery. But I tell you what, when you look at again to Dennis\u2019s point like 37 MAX implementations how the team has implemented the -10 in the factory and minimize disruption in that, you remember that objective we have around commonality has really paid off. So as its transitioning through the factory and the cruiser cycling, the amount of disruption is really minimized and frankly I would characterize it as the best practice going from one derivative to another. ","And so that\u2019s really going to help the overall margin profile and the flow of the aircraft in all other I\u2019ll say operational aspects of the business. So, they\u2019re off to a great start bringing that aircraft into the production system but you\u2019ll see more of that as a weighted as the overall deliveries going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Lalvani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Rajeev Lalvani ","Honestly there is a lot out there on middle of the market aircraft maybe even return of the 767 passengers. Just with tax reform coming through, how does that impact the thinking as far as how you\u2019re purchasing the middle of the market in particular and should we expect some sort of decision this year as to whether or not you\u2019re moving forward?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, Rajeev we continue to have productive discussions with our customers on middle of the market more than 50 customers have engaged, we\u2019re continuing to expand those discussions. We still this as an airplane if we launch it is one that would enter into service in the 2024, 2025 timeframe. So, we haven\u2019t made any changes there. ","As you\u2019ve probably noticed over the last couple of quarters, we did stand up a program management team with Mark leading the day by day program activity. So that\u2019s a serious investment on our part as we get more into the details of the program, not only the specifics around the airplane and the systems but taking a look at production systems and all elements of the business model. ","We still have time to do the work and determine the business case, we\u2019re not going to launch this airplane unless the business case makes good sense for both us and our customers and we also have some enterprise transformation objectives that we wanted to achieve as we look at our second century production and supply chain systems. ","So, all of that is interwoven and we haven\u2019t change the timeline we\u2019re going to continue to have a very disciplined process on how we evaluate this and we still have time to do our homework and make the right decisions. So, we\u2019re not going to be rushed into a decision here.","I will say with the tax reform as Greg pointed out, it does increase our ability to invest in innovation and in the future not only in product lines but also the underlying production and supply chain systems and that will just help us further solidify the business case and if we launch give us even additional confidence.","Maurita Sutedja","All right. Operator, we have time for just one more analyst question.","Operator","Thank you and that will be from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv ","Hey, curious you\u2019d talked about higher R&D, you also have higher CapEx ticking up a little bit, you mentioned some timing elements there? What do you see as the long-term trajectory for CapEx and how much of that growth is defense versus how much commercial, I guess especially on the defense side where you're seeing growth comeback on some of those budget mark-ups and where do [indiscernible] of DCs pointed to even higher growth ahead?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, well, right now, obviously, it\u2019s predominantly weighted to BCA, really supporting the rate increases that we've talked about. And at the same time, I would say there's some enterprise initiatives and business initiatives around investments in things like automation and I\u2019ll say lean efforts of where we can optimize the factory. So, there's some investments in productivity, balanced with investments in growth. So that kind of what you're seeing in there right now. ","I mentioned this is that 2.2 is kind of more of a normalized level. It's going to shift year-over-year depending on our growth opportunities that come. So that you'll see more capital going into services as an example. But as you mentioned in defense as we see opportunities there, if they make sense and they deliver value back to the bottom line, we're going to make the right, the prudent investments in capital in that business. So as those opportunities come up on themselves, frankly, if we have an opportunity to get ahead of it and de-risk some of those initiatives or investments, we\u2019ll do that as well. ","We have -- again we\u2019ve got a firepower to do that which I think positions us uniquely, but we're going to be really smart, and prudent about it as we have been for the last number of years. So that discipline is going to continue to be in place when we see these opportunities in the future.","Operator","Ladies and gentle that completes the analysts question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019ll now return you to the Boeing Company for Introductory remarks by Mr. Phil Musser, Senior Vice President of Communications. Mr. Musser, please go ahead.","Phil Musser","Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. We're going to continue now with media questions for Dennis and Greg. And if you have questions following this part of the session, please follow-up with our Media Relations team by calling the office or emailing us directly.","Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question in the interest of time, and we\u2019d ask that you limit your questions to just one question. So, let\u2019s go ahead and enroll.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron","So, to press I'm asking what appears to be the first tax question after 1,700 analyst questions, but its Greg's fault, so Greg you kind of pin some things you might do with the tax benefits, but at the same time you said that R&D would be relatively stable, CapEx is turning to more normalized level. So, the kind of simplistic question is what's changed? Will you actually do this different if R&D is relatively safe stable and CapEx is going through a more normalized level, I don't quite understand it.","Dennis Muilenburg","Doug, let me comment on that, and then I\u2019ll let Greg to jump in too. Couple of things on tax reform benefits and how we're rolling that into our plans going forward. One is, some very targeted investment in our workforce, our workplace and our communities and that\u2019s a previous announcement we made on $300 million investment with more opportunities ahead, but those are very important investments for us on the talent side, on training for the future, enabling our employees with advance capabilities, workplace improvements that will enhance productivity and investing in our communities along important lines like veterans and veterans' support. ","We will also complement that with significant additional investments in innovation and while we said R&D stable note that was R&D stable relative as a percentage of revenue. So, we\u2019re growing revenue, we\u2019re also going to be growing R&D and the tax reform benefit will allow us to accelerate some of that work on advance prototyping activities and we\u2019ll accelerate work on productivity initiatives and our factory spaces, some of what we call our second century design and manufacturing capabilities, analytics, building out some of the vertical capabilities that we talked about earlier. You saw some of those items on Greg\u2019s cash deployment chart. And we will be ramping up our investment and innovation as a result tax reform in a meaningful way. Greg, you want to say anything.","Gregory Smith","Yeah. Doug there is some of that in the CapEx as well, obviously as Dennis indicated more of it in the R&D, but the CapEx without tax reform would have been slightly lower. And so, we are making some strategic investments in there and utilizing those resources to really feel winning in the marketplace at the same time making the investments in productivity, training and development as Dennis indicated. ","So, I think we\u2019ve really taken a hard look at this and looked at what\u2019s the best use of our capital to win in the marketplace. At the same time, meet our overall objectives that is to drive profitability that again will allow us to continue to invest in the business. So, that\u2019s kind of the cycle I\u2019ll say the streams that these investments need to go through, but we have to, Dennis' point increase on both.","Operator","Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. ","Julie Johnsson","I just had a quick question on about the ITC decision on Friday and the rather measured response by the commerce secretary. So, where does this leave Boeing? And at this point do you have any regrets for pursuing the anti-dumping case given the outcome?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. Julie, first of all as you noted in our statement we were disappointed with the outcome of the ITC ruling. Frankly, we won\u2019t have the details until the full ruling is released later in February. So, all we know at the moment is the outcome, we await the details of the ruling and that will help us understand some of the rationale behind it and allow us to make decisions on our path forward. ","I will say that we remain firm in our stance on the need for fair global trade, it\u2019s really important for the future that we all play by the same rules. We may consistent on that team for years, we will continue to be consistent on that team. And when we see practices that are not consistent with everybody playing by same rules, we\u2019re going to raise the issue. And you can count on that in the case going forward as well. Regarding the ITC matter, we\u2019ll take a look when we get the outcomes here in the middle of February. ","Operator","Our next question from Gillian Rich with Investor's Business Daily. Please go ahead. ","Gillian Rich","Hi. So, I had a question, I know that you raised your dividend buyback in December. If you have any plans to raise it -- increase the dividend or buyback this year at all and can you give me an update on the timeline for CST-ST 100 Starliner? ","Dennis Muilenburg","Sure, I\u2019ll take the first one. Yeah, like I mentioned we got authorization from our Board to increase to a $18 billion share repurchase program. So obviously that will give us some time period here two to three years of repurchasing opportunity so that will continue throughout this year and in to next year and a little bit into the further. So that kind of step I would think of it that way Gillian. ","And then on the dividend, that\u2019s something honestly, we will review on an annual basis as you\u2019ve heard me mention we\u2019ve made some pretty significant investments in our dividend or increases in our dividend. ","So, we continue to monitor that from a competitive perspective with our peers outside of our peers, talk to our shareholders that\u2019s an annual process. So, as we get closer to the end of the year we\u2019ll do another assessment and then we\u2019ll decide what we want to do with the dividend. But again, we have been very committed to returning cash to shareholders as I indicated 100% of our free cash flow we\u2019ve committed to delivering back to shareholders while at the same time making some significant investments in future growth opportunities for the company. So, it\u2019s a balanced approach that we have in place and you shouldn\u2019t expect that to change going forward. ","Gregory Smith","And then on the commercial crew Starliner effort, we\u2019re continuing to march smartly through the development program. As I noted we just completed the design certification review which is a major milestone in the program, we\u2019re continuing through the test program and we had plans in place for a first launch later this year and we\u2019re continuing to work this very closely with our NASA customers. And more broadly we see human space exploration as a very important marketplace for us for the future and we\u2019ve led in that market since it was created and we intend to be a leader in human space like going forward and the Starliner effort is a key part of that. ","Operator","The next question is from Dominic Gates from Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates","Hi good morning, another question related to Bombardier and that decision with the ITC, it seems that the loss last week was possibly because of the details of the delta order where you didn\u2019t have a plan competing in that particular campaign. So, if Bombardier, there is an expectation that after that results Bombardier will begin to sell in to the US market. We expect orders possibly pretty soon. If they were to sell this CS-300 the bigger airplane would you possibly reignite the ITC case large and longer one? ","And then secondly expecting Bombardier to start selling into the US market where does that leave you with Embraer and your discussions with Embraer? How do you see -- what are your plans if you get Embraer to counter what Bombardier will do which of course will become Airbus?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, Dominic to your first question, its important again to note that we haven\u2019t seen the details of the ruling or the vote that was taken last week. So, we need to see those details before we can make any decisions on plans forward. ","I think it's important to note that the department of commerce did make an earlier ruling regarding dumping behavior and a result identified the tariffs. That ruling still stands. As to the ITC hearing it has to show harm and imminent import and until we see the details of that ruling we simply don\u2019t know the rationale behind it. So more to come when we determine that. ","I think for the longer term, again the important principle here is we stand for fair global trade and. And as always, we're all playing by the same rules we are more than happy to compete. But it's important that we play by the same rules. That will be our standard for any future decisions that we make.","And the opportunity with Embraer, we do think is, it\u2019s an important one, it's a great strategic fit. We continue to have productive discussions on that topic. We know that the government of Brazil has raised some concerns or issues that we fully respect and we're working through the details of potential options going forward and doing that in a very diligent way. So, I'm hopeful that we can bring that feel to conclusion, but more work to go on that front. ","Even if that doesn't happen, we have a very strong plan for the future. We have a solid strategy, we know exactly how we're going to grow for the future, we've got the right investments to identified, we are ready to compete and win in the future regardless of the outcomes of these trade matters and where the potential deal with Embraer and we're going to stay very focused on executing that strategy. It's a winning strategy.","Operator","Our next question is from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alwyn Scott","Hi everyone. I just wanted to follow-up. Boeing has talked a lot about in the past about the competition from Airbus, Bombardier, COMAC, serious threats, which prompted cost cutting including job cutting, but given your strong performance now in your outlook, how do you see over the competitive environment is now? Is it not really so difficult as you thought? Are there any risks that you see and related to that Boeing reduced employment 6% last year, but you just said at the start of the call that the tax cuts give you an opportunity to create more quality jobs? Does Boeing plan to add significantly to its employment this year and if so, where and why? Thanks.","Dennis Muilenburg","Alwyn on the first part of your question, the competitive environment is tougher than ever. And it's not getting any easier. The fact is we operate in a very attractive market space. It's about $7.5 trillion market over the next ten years. It's a growing market. I\u2019d say it's probably the most attractive industrial market in the world. And as a result, it's attracting more competition both at the OEM level and at the supply chain level. So, we expect the competition to only get tougher. And our focus is to make Boeing ever tougher from a completive standpoint as well.","So, it's really important that we continue to drive our competitive efforts, our affordability actions. So that we can compete and win in the marketplace. And really important to note that as we drive our affordability actions that creates our fuel for the future. Our business is based on self-generated R&D and innovation and investment. And that is a cycle that we need to continue to stay in front of them. We\u2019re going to continue to drive affordability so that we can invest in the future.","Now regarding employment levels, you're right, we have come down significantly over the last few years. We've done that in a way that is respectful as possible of our people, managing it through primarily through natural attrition and voluntary layoffs. While we\u2019ve had reductions in that we've also continued to hire on the front end of our talent pipeline, literally thousands of people over the last three years as we continue to refresh our talent pipeline. We're going to continue that balanced approach as well. More of an employment plateau in the near-term, but we still have reductions in some areas, other areas where we'll increase. Those are natural ebbs and flows of our various programs. But while we do that we're going to continue to keep our talent pipeline fresh and continue to invest in our people. So that we can win in the future.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Jon Ostrower with CNN. Please go ahead. ","Jon Ostrower","Question about the discussions with Embraer. How much of the outcome of that strategic plan is coupled with completing the business case for NMA? Is that a large component of your thinking around a new airplane for 2024, 2025. And in terms of bigger and broader question on the tie up, how is this particular strategic arrangement going to position you with China in mind specifically as the future competitors given what Alwyn was asking?","Dennis Muilenburg","Hi, Jon. First of all, the work that we\u2019re doing on middle of the market and the Embraer action are two separate activities, they\u2019re not dependent on each other or influencing each other. And I would expect that to continue to be case. Now that said, our discussions with Embraer, those are discussions that have been going for a relatively long period because we do see complementary combination between our companies with complementary product lines, verticals capabilities, services capabilities and innovation and talent investments. But those are all advantages that would span multiple marketplaces around the globe. Certainly, that combination could make us more competitive globally, but our strategy is not dependent on it. And our primary focus for the future will continue to be organic growth investments as our primary strategic growth path.","Maurita Sutedja","Okay. I think operator that wraps our call.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Stephanie Pope, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Ms. Pope, please go ahead.","Stephanie Pope","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. I am Stephanie Pope and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer.","After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]","As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we may include in our discussions this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking disclaimers at the end of this web presentation.","Now I will turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","W. James McNerney","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everybody. Let me start today by addressing the business environment, followed by some thoughts on our strong performance during the quarter. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook. And then as Stephanie said, we'd be glad to take your questions.","Starting with the business environment on Slide 2. While varying degrees of economic uncertainty continue across global markets, Boeing's growth forecast remains positive. Strong core demand for Commercial Airplanes continues, split roughly equally by worldwide fleet growth on one hand and a healthy replacement cycle, fueled by the compelling economics and rapid return on investment that comes from replacing older, less efficient airplanes with the dramatically more efficient new technology airplanes we are building today.","Our Commercial Airplane backlog grew in the third quarter to $307 billion with conversions of 737 MAX commitments to firm orders fueling that growth. Net new orders for the year exceed 925 airplanes, and we expect a continued flow of order traffic through year end.","With approximately 4,100 airplanes on order, our backlog represents the most diverse customer set we have ever experienced. We have an unparalleled balance by geographic region and product type with about 2\/3 of the order book committed to airlines based outside of the U.S. and Europe, a major shift from just a decade ago.","Also supporting our positive outlook, requests for deferrals and cancellations this year remain at or below historical averages. In fact, we continue to receive customer requests to accelerate deliveries of our fuel-efficient aircraft, giving us the ability to rebalance our delivery skyline when deferrals or cancellations occur.","Overall, the Commercial Airplane market remains very attractive and Boeing is positioned exceptionally well. Our superior lineup of innovative new products and services deliver unmatched fuel efficiency and operational performance, supporting our airline customers as they deal with high oil prices and the pressures of the current environment.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security. Notwithstanding the ongoing threat of U.S. budget sequestration, the overall Defense environment remains mixed, with the declines in U.S. spending that we've been anticipating for several years being mitigated in part by growing demand in international markets. As you know, and as our results have shown, our teams have gone great lengths to maximize operating efficiencies and reduce our infrastructure cost to compete effectively in a more austere U.S. budget environment. We've also engaged our supply chain to further advance our affordability drive given the high levels of supplier content in our products and services. We remain committed to these actions to ensure both our near-term performance and long-term competitiveness, while delivering greater value to budget-constrained customers and continuing to fund investment in next-generation capabilities.","These efforts also are fundamental to our success in international defense markets, where growth is being driven by evolving regional security issues and the modernization of aging inventories. We expect our substantial share gains made with international customers in recent years to continue, generating up to 30% of our Defense revenues in the near future.","With our portfolio of proven, reliable and affordable systems and services, combined with a track record of strong execution and innovation, we believe we are well positioned for continued success in this challenging environment.","Turning to the third quarter highlights on Slide 3. Strong core operational performance in both our major businesses continues to drive strong overall results, including higher revenues, improved cash flow and solid operating earnings. Commercial Airplanes generated healthy third quarter results as deliveries increased and production and services programs continued to make productivity gains. We delivered 149 airplanes for the quarter, for a total of 436 delivered year-to-date. By close of business today, we will have 5 airplanes, 787s, delivered this month and 28 Dreamliners will be delivered this year, including the first 787 assembled at Boeing South Carolina, an historic moment for Boeing and our customers.","We delivered 787s to 4 new customers during the quarter and airline and passenger feedback on the airplane remains extremely positive. Perhaps the best reflection on the airline's successful introduction was the decision by both launch customer ANA and JAL to exercise options for a combined 21 additional airplanes. ANA and JAL are both operating this airplane and know it well, so we are very pleased to see that recognition of the Dreamliner's value so quickly.","Production system performance on the 787 also continues to improve. The transition to a production rate of 5 per month and final assembly is underway and will be reached by year end, a key milestone on our path to reach a rate of 10 per month by the end of 2013. Steady progress also continues on development of the 787-9, with engineering design at 90% complete and the early stages of major assembly beginning as planned in this quarter -- in the quarter. Final assembly of the first 787-9 is scheduled to begin in mid-2013, with the first customer delivery in early 2014.","On the 787 -- 747, I should say, -8 we have delivered 21 airplanes year-to-date, while maintaining our focus on improving production processes and profitability. Both the Freighter and Intercontinental passenger model continue to perform well in service, producing high dispatch reliability rates and bringing a new standard in efficiency to airline operations.","","During the quarter, we booked orders for 5 Intercontinentals from Air China and we expect additional orders and commitments for both models by year end.","While we are closely monitoring softness in the near term market for air freight, our view that air cargo remains a compelling long-term growth market is unchanged and our family of highly efficient and capable freighters will be the market standard. As I mentioned, customer demand for the 737 MAX remains high with 858 orders to date, including 119 orders booked in just the last couple of weeks. Development of the airplane is tracking to plan for firm configuration in 2013 and entry into service in 2017. Our discipline increases in production rates on the 737 and 777 also remain on plan. 737 rate will increase to 38 per month in the second quarter of 2013 and then move up to 42 per month in the first half of 2014.","Production rate on the 777 program will increase to 8.3 per month in the first quarter of '13 and is already moving through our factories as we speak. These 2 programs continue to generate substantial value for our customers and our company.","Defense, Space & Security also generated strong operating results for the quarter, delivering 45 aircraft and 5 satellites for a total of 110 aircraft and 9 satellites year-to-date. We captured several new and follow-on awards, including the third P-8A Low-Rate Initial Production contract for the U.S. Navy, a B-1 follow-on upgrade contract for the U.S. Air Force and a contract to produce and launch the 10th Wideband Global communication satellite for the U.S. Air Force.","Among key development and production program milestones during the quarter, we completed the inaugural flight of the Canada CH-47 helicopter, which is continuing to progress through ground and flight test activities. The second Intelsat 702 medium power satellite was launched and is on orbit, enhancing broadcast and communication services across 4 continents. And we completed the first formal flight test and weapons release on the P-8I aircraft, which is scheduled for first delivery to the Indian Navy in 2013.","The KC-46 Tanker program continues to make solid progress as well with every major program milestone achieved on or ahead of schedule as we prepare for the Critical Design Review planned for the second half of 2013. The program remains on plan to deliver 18 combat-ready tankers by late 2017.","Before I summarize, I'd like to return to something I alluded to earlier, and that is a significant new competitiveness initiative we've launched in collaboration with key partners across our Defense and Commercial supply chains. As we look to the future, we see only growing expectations from all customers for the value we provide in our products and services. They want more capability and greater efficiency for less money, a dynamic common across many industries. For our part, we are facing more aggressive competition from both existing and emerging OEMs. To get out in front of these dynamics now rather than fall victim to them later, we have reached out to key supply chain partners and asked them to join us in driving major improvements in product quality, reliability, cost and overall supply chain efficiency. We are taking a team-oriented approach to examine opportunities, both inside Boeing and in their businesses to further streamline design, manufacturing and production processes, gain economics of scale where possible and share best practices and new ideas for doing things better tomorrow than we are today. We believe the effort will create value and growth opportunities for all of us, benefiting everyone from our suppliers to our customers and our shareholders.","In summary, with another quarter of strong core operating performance under our belt and major milestones being achieved with increasing regularity by our team, my confidence in our strategic position and growth trajectory continues to build. We are producing and delivering the technology our customers need, unlocking the value in our backlog and maintaining our course for growth and sustained business performance.","Now over to Greg, who will discuss the details of our financial results and our outlook. Greg.","Gregory D. Smith","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin with our third quarter financial results on Slide 4. Revenue for the quarter was $20 billion, up 13% from last year driven by higher Commercial Airplane deliveries. Earnings per share was $1.35 a share, up 5% excluding pension expense, reflecting continued strong core operational performance from both of our businesses.","Total operating margin is 7.8% and $2.3 billion of operating cash before pension contributions again reflects strong performance across core businesses.","Let me discuss our Commercial Airplanes business on Slide 5. Boeing Commercial Airplanes third quarter revenue was $12.2 billion, up 28% from the same quarter last year, reflecting the planned and successfully executed increase in airplane deliveries. Commercial Airplanes operating margin was strong at 9.5%, reflecting solid core operating performance across the business, offset by the planned margin dilution of increased 787 and 747-8 deliveries. Gross inventory for the company includes $24.8 billion related to the 787 program, an expected increase in the third quarter of approximately $1.3 billion, driven by the ramp-up of production rates on the program, partially offset by the increased planned deliveries.","Included in the work and process inventory are the deferred production costs. The deferred production balance for the program was $14.3 billion at the end of the third quarter and includes approximately 53 airplanes still in process. As I stated previously, the deferred production balance will continue to grow as we increase production rates and introduce the 787-9 derivative. This will peak at slightly over $20 billion and then decline after the program achieves the planned rate of 10 per month and stabilizes at that level.","As a result of the successful order capture on both the NG and the MAX and following our standard process, we have extended the accounting quantity on the 737 program by 200 units this quarter. While the majority of the incremental units are NGs, we also incorporated an additional MAX aircraft and the associated nonrecurring MAX investments, initial production costs and pricing. Due to the continued productivity on the 737 program, the resulting margin impact was not significant.","Commercial Airplanes captured $17 billion of orders during the quarter and increased their backlog to $307 billion.","Moving now to Slide 6 in our Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported third quarter revenue of $7.8 billion, down 4% from last year on lower volume and delivery mix. Operating margins was 10.5%, again reflecting solid core performance.","Boeing Military Aircraft revenue decreased to $3.8 billion driven by fewer deliveries on AEW&C and C-17. Operating margins increased to 11.7%, again reflecting strong performance across multiple programs. Network and Space programs revenue of $2 billion was down from last year, driven by planned lower volumes associated with the Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. The activity on this program is in the final stages of completion.","Operating margin increased to 8.1% primarily driven by higher earnings from United Launch Alliance and United Space Alliance. Global Services & Support revenue of $2.1 billion increased in the quarter, driven by higher P-8 training volume and A-10 re-winged deliveries. Operating margin at GS&S was strong at 10.7%.","Defense, Space & Security maintained a solid backlog of $71 billion, reflecting more than 2x current revenue. International business remains very strong, with approximately 38% of our current defense backlog representing sales to customers outside the United States.","Now turning to Slide 7 and our Other businesses. Boeing Capital generated $33 million in operating earnings during the quarter and the portfolio balance remained steady at $4.1 billion. During the quarter Other segment expense was $74 million, down from the prior period due to a gain in 2011 from the reduction in allowance for losses related to financing receivables. Unallocated expense was $69 million higher than prior period due to higher pension expense in 2012. This is partially offset by an adjustment for postretirement medical in the third quarter of 2011.","Let's turn to Slide 8 and we'll discuss cash flow. Increased Commercial Airplane deliveries and strong operating performance in both of our businesses generated $2.3 billion of operating cash before pension funding. Operating cash of $1.6 billion includes $750 million of planned discretionary pension contributions, bringing total contributions for the year to $1.5 billion.","Cash flows are expected to build as we continue our disciplined cash management focus and execute our planned increase in Commercial Airplane deliveries. Cash deployment remains a top priority for us and we'll continue to provide more details on this as we firm up our 2013 business plan later this year.","Turning to cash and debt balances on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash position continues to provide strong liquidity and positions us well going forward.","Capital expenditures of $428 million were in line as expected, and we'll turn now to Slide 10 to discuss our outlook.","Our earnings per share guidance for 2012 is now between $4.80 and $4.95 per share, up from between $4.40 and $4.60 per share, reflecting continued strong performance. Revenue guidance for the year has been --increased to be between $80.5 billion and $82 billion. And we continue to expect Commercial Airplanes to deliver between 585 and 600 airplanes during the year, including a combined 70 to 85 787 and 747-8 deliveries, split roughly equal between the 2 programs.","Our forecast for Commercial Airplanes revenue is unchanged at between $47.5 billion and $49.5 billion for the year. Commercial operating margins is reaffirmed at approximately 9%. Commercial operating margin will continue to be strong despite some dilution from increased 787 and 747 deliveries, as well as increased investments and period costs associated with the increased deliveries and production rates.","Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance is increased by $1 billion to be between $32.5 billion and $33 billion, reflecting higher business volume and more favorable program mix across the 3 business segments. Operating margin guidance is increased to be greater than 9.25% as we continue to focus on maximizing efficiencies and reducing infrastructures across BDS.","Due to our strong operating performance, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance for the year to be greater than $5.5 billion, including the $1.5 billion of discretionary pension contributions made earlier this year. Total company non-pension expense remains at $2.5 billion for 2012.","Given the current market conditions and the unprecedented low interest rate environment, we are closely monitoring the potential impacts of our 2013 pension expense. We continue to see benefits from our liability-driven investment strategy. And to date, the return on our pension assets are approximately 10%, which is higher than our assumed 7.75% return for the year. As you know, the discount rate has much more of an impact on our pension expense than the rate of return. And last year at this time, we assumed the discount rate would improve going forward. However, the rate has continued to decline to be about 3.7%. Our pension expense for '13 will be determined at the end of the year based on the interest rates at that time and the market conditions. However if you assume the current rate of 3.75% and our pension on our 2013 noncash pension expense would increase to approximately $3.5 billion, including the amortization of assets and liability performance experienced in prior periods. Approximately $1.7 billion of this amount will be recognized at the business unit level and the remainder in unallocated expense.","Our current ERISA funding status remains strong at over 100%. Required pension funding remains minimal in '13, although we do anticipate to continue to make discretionary contributions above the required levels to proactively manage our liability and expense going forward. We plan to provide detailed 2013 financial guidance with our fourth quarter results.","For 2012, our Other segment expense remains at about $200 million and unallocated expense is expected to be $1.5 billion. R&D expense for 2012 is unchanged at between $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion and capital expenditures is now expected to be $1.8 billion. So overall, third quarter performance continued to deliver strong operating results as we remain focused on production, program execution and profitability, rate ramp-up and ongoing productivity improvements in both our Commercial and Defense businesses.","As we look forward, we expect this strong core operating performance to continue. Now, I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.","W. James McNerney","Thanks, Greg. With 3 strong quarters behind us and a relentless focus on disciplined execution, our team is ready and committed to deliver on our strength and outlook for the remainder of 2012. Our priorities going forward are unchanged, successful production ramp-up and profitability across our Commercial Airplane programs, performance to plan on our development efforts for the 787-9, the 737 MAX and Air Force Tanker and repositioning our Defense business, while extending our core programs and expanding internationally.","We are pleased with our progress in each of these areas and we intend to continue building momentum for significant and sustained growth in 2013 and beyond.","Now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","One of the things you often talk about on this third quarter is about R&D and I was wondering if you can talk a little bit like you did pension going into next year. How are you thinking about R&D specifically within BCA? There's a number of development programs you've been thinking about, whether it's the 787-10, but also as the MAX activity has been picking up, should the trend be down, flat? Should -- when does it start to turn back up again?","Gregory D. Smith","Sam, right now, we're seeing it about in line with this year. Obviously, the 787-9 starts to ramp down, but the MAX ramps up but we're continuing, obviously, to make strategic investments in a lot of those products you discussed but we see it in line with how we'll finish up this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Hate to dedicate my question to pension, but I'm going to do it because I think it's really important for you guys here. Clearly, a big increase is expected in pension expense next year and I think it's weighing on your stock quite a bit. Just wondering if you could give us your latest thinking on pension accounting, mark-to-market accounting. Some other \u2013 of other large companies have switched. What's your thinking there? And you're over 100% funded from an ERISA standpoint. Would you consider, when you think about the trade-off between share repurchase and pension contributions, would you let an accounting issue like this divert potentially, cash into the pension fund from share repurchase, prospectively the next year?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, Joe, as you said, from an ERISA perspective, we're over 100% funded. Understanding the pension expense that we talked about is noncash and we've made discretionary contributions and as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll continue to do that and assess that going forward. We're always looking at our reporting options certainly and to provide you with more visibility on how the core operating performance for the business is doing. And I think also, our liability-driven investment strategy continues to pay off. So we continue -- as I said, we continue to look at our reporting options and we'll do so going forward and we'll engage you guys on that.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Greg, do you plan on giving us more information on capital deployment in January on your earnings call or might you do that before then?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, well later this year, we'll plan to give you some more clarity on that. And your question about buyback versus pension, I mean, that's -- again, when we look at our overall cash deployment strategy, we take that into consideration.","Operator","And next we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a broader strategy question for Jim if that's okay. This is something we talked about a little bit last time I was in Chicago with some folks. When you think about managing risk in the product development portfolio and you think about what you're going to do with 777 and 787-10, I mean, how do you think about that, right? I mean, 787-10 looks like it's a relatively simple derivative of existing new products but 777 is a much older airframe and how do you think about the development of that and how to manage that so it doesn't blow up and end up being a whole new plane instead of a derivative?","W. James McNerney","Well, I think the broad answer is that this company has absorbed a lot of development risk over the last decade but now that we're coming out of it, we have a suite of technologies that we can harvest in a de-risked environment for the next decade or 2. And I think the 2 developments you alluded to, the third version of the 787 and the 777 would both be examples -- and the MAX to a certain extent, would both be examples of spiraling in some of these hard-fought technical maturities and gains that we've bled through over the last decade and we have a huge opportunity over the next decade or 2 in a lower risk environment to spiral in some of this technology and produce airplanes that we don't think our competitors can equal.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But just as a follow-on. I mean, when you think about the 777 in particular, being it's an older airframe, not old, but older, how do you think about spiraling in new technology on it without it -- and managing the risk so it doesn't kind of creep into becoming just a whole new plane?","W. James McNerney","No, I mean, that's a fair question. I mean, I think one of the options, for example, with that airplane, and we're discussing this with our customers as we speak is to put a composite wing and a new engine on the current airframe. The kind of performance improvements that can be generated by the composite wing and new engines are pretty eye watering, okay? And building a composite wing of this size, an air foil of this size would not have been thinkable a decade ago. We could have only imagined the kind of efficiencies that it could provide us. We now know how to do that and I can't think of anyone else who does. So that would be an example of harvesting a 787 technology, applied technology in a second generation form, combining it with a current system that is known, understood, the fuselage and systems within the airplane to come up with something pretty special. So that's an example of one thing that we might do.","Operator","And next we'll go to Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jim, you talked a lot about investments both with your suppliers and obviously, some of this comes internally in order to continue the trajectory that you've shown this year in terms of operating returns. Can you give us a general sense of where you'd like those benefits to show up on the bottom line and how long might they take to get there?","W. James McNerney","Well, I think the -- as you suggested, Howard, we have paid a lot of attention to productivity in both of our businesses but that approach, as in all businesses, needs to be refreshed and built upon all the time because the world is going to get more difficult, not less difficult, from a -- more for less, as I said in my remarks. And this partnering with our supply chain partners, partnering for success is the name of the program, is a way -- and it's an all fronts kind of approach, it's a way share processes to take time and effort out of things we do together. It's also a way to perform our best -- to reward our best performing partners, give them more work if they signed up for this kind of an approach. It also is very mindful of quality but its objective at the end of the day is to improve the operating margins of our business and to offset inflationary and pricing pressures that may come along. It's to control our own destiny and this is not a matter of stealing margin from our suppliers. It's not a zero-sum game. I've led enough Six Sigma efforts over my life to know that there's a lot of money in shared processes and there's a lot of money in analytical approaches if people start with the headset, with some right to left thinking that we got to get things done. So I'm discussing it at the CEO level with a number of our partners and it's down through our entire organization and I think we're going to make good progress over -- you'll start seeing it in the next year or so, and it'll be a multi-year program.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just want to have one quick small follow-up. When we look at the full-year guidance, sorry to do this, Greg, but when you look at the full-year guidance and you look at the number of airplanes you're going to deliver and some of the other things that you have done in terms of performance, it seems as if you've set yourself a low bar for the fourth quarter. Is there something in there that we wouldn't appreciate?","Gregory D. Smith","I don't know if you wouldn't appreciate it or not but it's the same things I have talked about before, Howard. Certainly from a BCA margin perspective, we got 787 and 747 dilution in the fourth quarter that will be higher than in the third. We do have additional investments in productivity tools and that's something we've been focused on. As we get ramping our way up to 10, as Jim talked about, we're looking for efficiencies across, so we're making some additional investments there. We obviously got some additional taxes because of the high deliveries in the back half. And then just some, obviously some risks and uncertainties and some prudence around the business growth that will take place in the fourth quarter. So kind of all the same things I've talked about before.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask briefly about cash and cash deployment. I mean obviously, the numbers continue to come in a bit better and as you think about deployment, I wondered if you can help us think about some of the moving pieces you and the Board will give the most consideration to as you think about this decision. And specifically, how much confidence can you have around the cash drag from the 787 and how do you think about the potential risk to your expectations for cash should that program see some sort of hiccup? And I guess related what are the biggest uncertainties around next year's cash flow? Is it pension or tax or orders? And maybe if you could rank those or tell me if they're significant enough to warrant any conservatism in the decision that kind of lays ahead of you and the Board.","W. James McNerney","Yes, well as you said, Carter, you're starting -- and as we said at the beginning of the year, you'll start to see the cash engine picking up steam and you've seen that this quarter and we do expect that to continue going forward as we continue to grow and focus on productivity. Now, when it comes to cash deployment, first and foremost, priority is returning cash to shareholders. So we're looking at share repurchase and as I said, we will give you more clarity on that at the end of the year. From a dividend perspective, similar to what we've talked before, kind of a 20% to 40% payout of earnings looking at the yield. So that's again, a big focus for us. And then I'll say the pension contributions and others but first and foremost, returning cash to shareholders. And again, we'll give you more clarity on that. But you're seeing the momentum in the business and we expect that to continue.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Greg, at the core of my question though, I guess is, are there more uncertainties for next year around all the moving pieces around cash than normal or less? And does that play a significant role in the decision?","Gregory D. Smith","Well I think as we've retired risk, you've seen us retire risk, as we've kind of gone through this year, certainly set this up well for 2013. And again, kind of gets back to our focus on how we'll deploy that. So again, I think we got rate increases next year that we're watching closely but quarter-over-quarter, we're trying to de-risk that and I think we're doing a good job in that regard.","Operator","And next we'll go to Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm interested in how pricing is going on the 737 at this stage and I thought if you could describe the forces that are driving 37 margins as you extend the block farther out in time, that would be helpful. Specifically over the 737 block, you have costs related to the MAX introduction; there are changes in pricing, volume leverage on the positive side, improvements in operational performance. Can you give a sense how these components balance out as well as any other factors that might play a role in your margin computation?","W. James McNerney","Doug, let me take a swing at the pricing environment. As we\u2019ve said before, obviously, there is some price pressure during an introductory period. We're seeing some of that ease off. In any case, we are getting a margin; we are getting paid for the new technology that we're putting into the airplanes. So there's a margin versus the NG. So customers are recognizing the value to their economics with this airplane. And as we develop the plane pain, quite frankly, we feel very good about the performance we are seeing as we get closer to actually producing it. I think, Greg, if you want to comment on other elements of the program accounting that Doug was asking about?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, well as I mentioned, Doug, this quarter we put in the initial investments for the MAX and some of that pricing. But the productivity on the program has been very good. Jim talked in his remarks and during Howard's question, about some of the other things that we are doing to drive productivity, to either maintain or improve margins on the core programs, but that's certainly a lever as we work through the initial blocks as we introduce the new airplanes. So I think we've got good plans in place to address that and I think this quarter is a good example as you've seen us extend it and have really, a material impact on the margins.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm assuming that the MAX -- I mean, the MAX at this point is only a small portion of the block and so you've taken the block out farther, covering I would say, most of the NG deliveries out until the MAX comes in. And that's what I was wondering. I was assuming that you would see some pricing pressure in that period and I just -- is it offset by the improvements you are making? How does that play out?","Gregory D. Smith","No, that's right. I mean, you're right. The NG kind of feathers off as we extend these blocks and the MAX picks up, but it's back to the productivity and the focus that we have on really driving that margin and offsetting some of those upfront investments.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But you're not going to really see -- there's not much chance to see margin expansion then -- you're not going to be able to more than offset it?","Gregory D. Smith","Well, we're always looking for opportunities, Doug. And this initiative that Jim talked about is one that's a big priority for us and we're going to capture as much as we can out of that. And I think you\u2019ll see that in the performance across the programs.","Operator","And next we'll go to Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You kept your guide for deliveries of the 87 and the 47 intact that they're both about 50%. Based on the pace you looked like you're achieving on the 87, I mean, it would look like you should be able to be at the top end or over it with not much trouble but the 747 looked like kind of a long putt to get to even 50%. So could you comment on those and the potential for being over the top end and the related impact on cash flow versus your guidance?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, so Cai, obviously, we think we're going to be in the range we -- guidance we provided but it is a little bit more weighted, as you said, on the 87s. And again, you're seeing the momentum pick up there in the fourth quarter. About half of the deliveries will come out of the Change Incorps facility and the other half come off the final line. So again, a little bit more heavily weighted towards 87s. And I'm sorry, Cai, your second question?","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Well, the related impact on cash. I mean, because it looks like I mean, with all due respect, but you're going to do at least 9 -- 9 plus kind of out of off the line and you really look like you're catching up on the Change Incorps so I would think 18 would be kind of like a minimum.","Gregory D. Smith","Well, Cai, if we can get more out, we will. But that's our current plan, to execute within that range. The team's obviously extremely focused on it. You're seeing they're making good progress. But as far as cash goes, we're comfortable with the guidance we gave you. And if there's opportunities there, we'll certainly let you know.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And what would the impact on cash be then? You were at 24 8 at the end of the third quarter, I mean, would you still get to 24 or will you do better? How does that look?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, we've taken that into consideration. Obviously, each of these deliveries has a different cash profile depending on how long they've been in the production system and when the order was taken. So it does vary, Cai, tail number by tail number and we've tried to take that into consideration with our cash guidance.","Operator","And next we'll go to Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Greg, in the past, you've talked about -- you've framed cost on the 787s on a cash basis relative to that first unit at $400 million. It looks like you are now down -- you've improved down on the deferred production side to about $100 million an aircraft. Could you give us some sense how that differs between Seattle and Charleston airplanes? And then as we go forward here, as your visibility improves, in which future quarter might we start to see the more meaningful or a change in the slope in the line?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, so I mean, let me just kind of start from an operating perspective when I look at South Carolina and Everett combined because that's the impact that you're seeing in this unit cost progression. But we're seeing quality improvements across the board, about 35% reduction in Everett. Jobs behind schedule have improved as we get our work kind of back in sequence. So we're seeing about a 50% reduction there. And the amount of traveled work, which we talked about before, coming off final line is now down to about 125 jobs. So we're seeing improvements across the board operationally in Charleston and in Everett and you're seeing that in the deferred production growth that you saw 2Q versus 3Q. And that's -- as you know, that's kind of how that translate into what you see financially. On a unit cost or unit versus program basis, again, you're seeing improvement coming down the learning curve there. So overall, we're seeing improvements at both of the operations. They're at different levels of maturity right now, so Rob, so you can't necessarily compare a tail number to a tail number, but when we all get kind of up to full rate, we'll certainly be able to do that. And there's a lot of lessons learned coming back and forth between those 2 operations and we're taking full advantage of that.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you speak to when the slope changes, Greg?","Gregory D. Smith","Well, I mean, the slope really just continues as we ramp-up rate and combined with coming down that learning curve. And as I said, it'll peak in that kind of late '13, early '14. And then as we stabilize that full rate, it'll start to come down. So that's kind of how that would translate.","Operator","Our next question is from Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, a question for you. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the learning curve progress on the 787. I know it's a bit early but you modeled this extensively. I'm curious to hear what you've been seeing in kind of E versus A and where have you been right by and large and what have been the most surprises as you've begun to put more planes through the pipeline.","W. James McNerney","Well, I think we basically have 3 learning curves in our factories right now producing the 787. There is the underlying in-line production that is now ramping up in Everett. There is in-line production in South Carolina and then there is change incorporation in Everett. In the 2 in-line production environments, we're seeing learning curve gains about as we had predicted. In some cases, maybe a little better but as predicted. I think in the refurb center, the EMC, where we're doing some rework on some of the older airplanes, we're also beginning to see a learning curve there. That is somewhat offset, however, by the fact that we did the easier-to-do airplanes first and now we're moving into some airplanes that require a little more work. And so we need that learning curve to hold production in the refurbishment operation. But overall, we're feeling good about the learning curve. And as more and more of our production, as Greg just pointed out, transitions to in-line production, we're fully confident that the learning curve that we projected is going to come true.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And, Greg, just for our modeling purposes, as we look ahead in terms of net margins for the company, is it fair to be looking at sort of the 5% net margin the next couple of years as we mix lower margin 87, the top improvements in the mature and Defense international?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, well obviously, I'll give you more clarity on how we're thinking about that when we give '13 guidance but we're obviously just again, back to kind of what Jim said on the partnering for success with our -- we're focused on expanding margins across the enterprise and we're certainly aspiring to increase our net margin overall. As I talked to you about when we were at the conference, I think that is achievable. We've got some good plans in place but we've got to execute to those and I think up to now, we have done a good job doing that and we got to continue that focus going forward.","Operator","And next we'll go to Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one clarification question and then a quick one for Jim. On the clarification, can you talk a little bit about how you think discretionary pension contributions might create shareholder value and is there anything contractual that's going on there that's driving those contributions? And then the question for Jim on the retirement rate, you've talked about the replacement cycle being the big driver of demand here and clearly, there are going to be a lot of planes turning 25 through the rest of this decade but clearly, high fuel is driving some replacement. Can you talk a little bit about the overall replacement cycle of an aircraft? Are we seeing planes be retired at an earlier age than we've historically seen and do you think that, that is sustainable?","W. James McNerney","I think -- let me take the replacement cycle first. It is partially dependent on the performance of the technology that is being introduced into the marketplace. I think the replacement cycle, in general, generically speaking, tends to be lower with incremental improvements for obvious reasons; tends to be higher with dramatic improvements. We are in the replacement cycle now that is more on the dramatic than on the incremental side. I mean, I think in my remarks I pointed out that roughly half of the demand we're seeing is replacement of old technology with new and the 787 is probably the best example of that huge, huge economic gains for fuel efficiency and maintenance cost that quickly pays back the incremental investment that you have in a new airplane versus a current one. So in today's kind of environment, I think the replacement cycle is more aggressive and is driving more of the underlying demand. And I think that's the big thing that's going on now that I sometimes get the question why is your growth disconnected from overall GDP growth? The answer is technology driving replacement cycle, which in turn, drives quick paybacks for our customers. They almost can't afford not to buy them. So -- and then the pension question?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes. So really, what drives this is ERISA. That's what drives the funding requirements and as I mentioned, we're at 100% funded now. And the pension is really just the cost of doing the business and is managed over a long term to match the liability. And as I discussed earlier, we have been proactive in changing our investment strategy some time ago. Fortunately, we did to really match our investment strategy with our liability and I think it's paying off. And in our -- we made a $1.5 billion discretionary this year and it is truly discretionary. It's not \u2013 we did minimum requirements this year and for next year. And as we think through cash deployment, we'll certainly consider it but as I said, first and foremost is ERISA funding and returning cash to shareholders.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But that doesn't answer the question which is how does that create shareholder value by doing something above and beyond what's legally required?","Gregory D. Smith","Well it brings the funded -- it improves the funded status and over time, improves the expense.","Operator","Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Also just a very quick follow-up on pension and then one other. So if you don't change the current accounting mechanism, have you run the math yet on what the 2014 P&L pension expense change is versus '13? And then the other thing I wanted to ask about, completely separately, is on the Defense side, the business is now going to grow this year. If you were to assume sequestration is avoided, is your Defense business on the top line up again in 2013 versus 2012, and maybe if you could touch on the big movers in terms of specific programs there?","W. James McNerney","I think this was a very strong volume year for our Defense business, driven by international successes. Even without sequestration, it would be hard to beat that next year although I'm not giving guidance, I'm just saying it would be a challenge because of the absolute strength of the this year so unusual strength. So that is the literal answer to your question.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on the pension side.","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, on the pension. If you were to assume kind of the current interest rate environment, it would essentially be flat to 2013. Obviously, that interest rate changes; there will be improvements to that, but that's how you would see it today.","Stephanie Pope","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","And that will be from David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Greg, on 787 and cost there, in line with what Rob asked, can you just help us, give us some color around -- we can obviously calculate what the average cash cost roughly is per unit, but how much below is the cash cost on an airplane coming off -- straight off line from Everett and delivering to a customer? And then in terms of the inventory on 787, I would take it from Cai's question that you guys still are -- you're still forecasting a $4 billion inventory increase on 787 this year even though you're at $5 billion today?","Gregory D. Smith","That's about right. On a unit cost perspective, as I mentioned before, we're down about 50% going from kind of line 8 to line 66. So we're continuing to see improvement there and expect that to continue going forward in both Everett and in Charleston.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Thomas J. Downey","Thank you. We will continue now with questions for Jim and Greg. If you have any questions after the session ends, please call our Media Relations team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we're ready for the first question. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","And first we'll go to the line of Jon Ostrower with Wall Street Journal.","Jon Ostrower","As you guys look at the EMC for 2013, you're talking about kind of getting into the more difficult airframes, how do you see the balance of deliveries in 2013? And is there risk for essentially an air pocket being created on 787 as you head into 787-9 production next year?","W. James McNerney","I think the mix will skew much more heavily toward in-line production next year. That's at the highest level. And obviously, feathering in -9 production as we're increasing rates will take some industrial engineering to get through and we've got a strong plan for it. And there is some -- there are some plans to feather it in and the plan is strong, is strong. We're in good shape there.","Jon Ostrower","And just as you think about 777 and 787-10X possible capital expenditure and really developing infrastructure for that, you talked about earlier, the de-risking of both the technology on 787 you've developed but you don't have a composite infrastructure for a 777 wing today or even any composite wing at the moment. It's obviously in Japan today. How do you see that profile and also Everett's role in that and also, Charleston's role in both design and manufacture of both the 777X and 787-10X.","W. James McNerney","Well, we're a long way from making a decision on where we're going to build anything related to the -- well, the fuselage, obviously, will be built where it is but we're a long way away from making any decision on where we build the 777 wing, a long way.","Operator","Our next question is from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times.","Dominic Gates","I just want to ask you about the cargo market and the 747-8. You said that in the long term, you see the cargo market as compelling, despite the current downturn. But in the near term, next year specifically, is the downturn in the cargo market affecting the 747-8? And I'm thinking of deliveries. Are all your deliveries for next year, have you got customers for them? And Atlas at one stage, was it last year, rejected 3 747-8s. Have you got customers for those?","W. James McNerney","Yes, we're pretty -- we're putting some -- we're crossing some Ts and dotting some Is but we're pretty much filled up for 2013 on the -8. So we're in pretty good shape. We moved the skyline around. I think as Atlas found some challenging business conditions, they did want to defer and cancel in one case, a couple airplanes but we're in good shape through 2013, Dominic.","Operator","And next we'll go to Brendan Kearney with The Post and Courier News.","Brendan Kearney","Jim, a machinist union rep told me last week that he expects an election down here within a year. Is that possible? And what would a unionized North Charleston site mean for Boeing?","W. James McNerney","Well we -- I don't know who you were talking to but everybody is entitled to their opinion, obviously. We're committed to working with our employees down in Charleston. I think the relationship between our team there and the management leadership is good. It's not clear to us they need representation. We like dealing directly with our employees. Having said that, as you know, we -- there are many elements of our employee base that are unionized and we work effectively with them as well. But I don't see the same thing whoever you talked to see. As a matter of fact, I feel great about the relationship between the leadership and the employees down there.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Mike Mecham with Aviation Week.","Michael Mecham","Follow-up on the 777X program and Airbus' advancements on the A350. Is your planning still the same for a potential EIS of that towards the end of the decade? Can you talk through how that planning process is proceeding?","W. James McNerney","Well we are looking at the end of the decade, beginning of the next decade, kind of EIS but that's the assumption we're working with. Our customers would like it then or sooner. That gives us plenty of time to develop it. What we're really trying to do is choose the right configuration for the marketplace and we have a robust dialogue going on with our consumers right now to make sure we get it right. I'm confident that we have the technology in place to deliver a terrific airplane, as I mentioned earlier, and we're sorting it through, making sure we've got the right configuration. Then we'll get onto things like where we produce things, exactly when we'll introduce them.","Thomas J. Downey","Operator, seeing as there are no more questions in the queue, that will conclude our earnings call for today.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Second Quarter of 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions, are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Co. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead.","Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's second quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance & Strategy.","After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation.","In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our second quarter operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook.","With that, let's move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of employees throughout our company, Boeing delivered strong second quarter 2018 financial results that included higher revenue and earnings and strong operating cash flow, driven by solid execution across the company.","During the quarter, we generated $4.7 billion of operating cash and repurchased $3.0 billion of Boeing stock. We also paid $1.0 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year.","We continued to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, while investing in our people, innovation and future growth.","Revenue in the second quarter was $24.3 billion, reflecting higher volume of commercial deliveries and favorable mix, along with services and defense contract volume.","Core earnings per share of $3.33 was driven by strong performance across the businesses, volume and mix and lower tax rate, partially offset by a write off due to the previously announced Spirit litigation outcome and cost growth on the KC-46 Tanker program, which I'll address shortly.","For the full-year, we are raising guidance for revenue to reflect higher volume at BDS and BGS. Additionally, we are adjusting BCA and BDS segment operating margin guidance. Greg will discuss these in more detail in his section.","Before we delve into the second quarter operating performance for our businesses, let me spend a minute on the KC-46 Tanker program. We continue to make steady progress towards final certification for the KC-46 Tanker and recently completed all flight tests required to deliver the first aircraft, which is expected to be in October of this year, as now agreed upon with the U.S. Air Force.","This is a significant milestone for us and our customer, representing the culmination of three years of testing and over 3,300 flight hours. However, the program did see additional costs growth in the quarter of $334 million after-tax, primarily due to higher estimated costs of incorporating changes into six flight tests and two early build aircraft, as well as additional costs as we progress through the late-stage testing and certification process.","Regarding these flight test and early build aircraft, as flight testing to support the first delivery was completed, and final configuration of each aircraft has been defined, the plan to complete manufacturing of these eight aircraft is now clear and firmed up. While there is still a lot of work ahead of us, we now have a very clear line of sight what is needed to deliver these highly, mission-capable aircraft to our customers.","We remain confident in the long-term value of this franchise, a program that is going to have a production run measured in hundreds of airplanes and decades of follow-on support and training.","With that, now let's look at Commercial Airplanes. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $14.5 billion, reflecting 194 deliveries, with operating margins of 11.4%. Continued healthy sales activity contributed to 239 net new airplane orders worth $16 billion during the quarter, including 91 wide-body orders, adding to our robust backlog that stands at nearly 5,900 airplanes and is worth $416 billion. Year-to-date, we have captured over 900 net new orders and commitments.","The 737 MAX program marked its one-year anniversary of entering revenue flight service in the quarter and its production ramp-up continued. To-date, we have delivered 162 MAX's, with 52 of them delivered in the quarter.","As for the 777X program, in the quarter, we moved the first two test airplanes into the low-rate initial production line in the main factory and we also began the systems testing for this exciting development program. We remain on track for first 777X delivery in 2020.","Now, over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported second quarter revenue of $5.6 billion, reflecting the Kuwait F-18 production contract award and higher weapons volume with operating margins of 9.3%. The $7 billion of new orders booked by BDS during the quarter demonstrates the value we bring to our customers across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio.","These orders included finalization of the production contract for 28 F-18 Super Hornets to Kuwait, an additional order for 18 F-18 Super Hornets for the U.S. Navy and three P-8 Poseidon aircraft for the U.S. Navy, as well as a multiyear contract for 58 V-22 Osprey aircraft.","Key milestones for BDS included induction of the first F-18 aircraft into the Service Life Modification program, two successful tests for the U.S. Air Force's Minuteman III, and production of the 100th P-8 aircraft. On the commercial satellites side, we successfully completed the O3b mPOWER preliminary design review with SES.","Turning to Global Services. Our integrated services business completed its first full-year of operation at the end of the quarter. BGS reported second quarter revenue of $4.1 billion with operating margins of 14.7%, reflecting higher volume along with product and services mix.","During the quarter, BGS won new business totaling approximately $4 billion that demonstrates the value that we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers. These included an F-18 depot maintenance contract for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, a Global Fleet Care contract for Primera Air's 737 fleet and performance-based logistics contracts to support the Netherlands' rotorcraft fleet. These orders highlight the strength of our One Boeing offerings. Additionally, BGS delivered its first 737 Boeing Converted Freighter in the quarter.","As part of our growth strategy of complementing organic investments with selected strategic acquisitions; in May, we announced our agreement to acquire KLX, a major provider of aviation parts and services.","By combining the talent and product offerings of our Aviall business and KLX, we'll provide a one-stop shop that will benefit our supply chain and our customers in a meaningful way.","Also, in the quarter, we announced a proposed partnership with Safran to jointly design, build and service auxiliary power units. This move will strengthen Boeing's vertical capabilities as we continue to expand our services portfolio and make strategic investments that accelerate our growth plans.","In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong operating performance, captured noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog, returned significant cash to shareholders and complemented our organic growth with planned, strategic, inorganic investments.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand in our commercial defense, space and services markets. We've recently revised the size of these growing markets upward to $8.1 trillion over the next 10 years.","In the Commercial Airplanes market, airlines continue to report robust profits and strong passenger traffic, outpacing global GDP. Passenger traffic in 2018 grew 6.8% through May. Meanwhile, cargo traffic maintained its strong momentum, growing by 5.3% in 2018 through May, as we see trade and industrial production growing in all regions.","Our global customers continue to recognize the compelling value proposition that our new more fuel-efficient product family brings to the market, as reflected in the healthy new order intake we've seen year-to-date.","We continue to see the trend of diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective, as well as across the spectrum of airline business models. The changing nature of travel, with the expansion of network city pairs and rising middle-class population in emerging markets, have fundamentally expanded traffic patterns and underpinned sustained growth.","There also is more balanced demand between fleet growth and replacement of older aircraft, and we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in key market dynamics, in the aggregate, is driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry.","Over the long-term, we remain highly confident in our commercial market outlook, which now forecast demand for nearly 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, up from our previous outlook of approximately 41,000 airplanes. This is comprised of more than 31,000 aircraft in the narrow-body market and approximately 9,000 aircraft in the wide-body market. These deliveries, of which 44% will be driven by replacement demand, will double the size of the global fleet.","This long-term demand, combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog, provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates.","Turning to our product segments. Starting with the narrow-body, our production rate of 52 per month starting June of this year and planned increase to 57 in 2019 is based on our backlog of nearly 4,700 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. We continue to assess the upward pressure on this 737 production rate.","In the wide-body segment, we have seen steady orders for 787 and 777 airplanes and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide-body replacement demand early next decade.","For the current generation 777, we received 19 net new orders in the quarter, bringing the backlog to 96 aircraft. The renewed strength in the air cargo sector has provided support for the 777 bridge, as highlighted by recent orders, which included incremental freighters for FedEx and DHL. Additionally, earlier this month, we finalized Qatar Airways' order for five 777 Freighters and received a letter of intent for 29, 777 Freighters from Volga-Dnepr and CargoLogicHolding.","As we transition production to the 777X, we expect 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019, as previously announced.","As you can see from the recent activities, we continue to make good progress on the 777 bridge, and while we still have some work to do in filling the remaining 777 production slots, in particular for 2020 and beyond, based on our progress of capturing new orders and commitments, managing the skyline and working new campaigns, we continue to believe the rate plan we've put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current 777 to the 777X.","As we look forward to the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 340 orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft.","We also captured 59 orders for the 787 Dreamliner family in the quarter, a solid platform for long-term production. With more than 650 firm orders in our backlog, our plan to increase Dreamliner production to 14 airplanes a month in 2019 is well-supported.","We continue to see repeat orders for the 787 Dreamliner, including from Qantas, Bank of China Aviation and United. These repeat orders, coupled with continuing attraction from new carriers such as Bamboo Airways' recent commitment for 20 787s, highlight the strong market preference for the 787 and its superior value.","Turning to our 747 and 767 programs. With our unmatched freighter product lines, we are well-positioned to capture the increased cargo demand.","During the quarter, FedEx announced an order for 12 incremental 767 Freighters. This further supports our 767 production rate increase from 2.5 per month to 3 per month in 2020.","We remain focused on the strong long-term aerospace industry fundamentals, as highlighted by the continued strength of traffic. It is important to have this in perspective as we navigate through global trade discussions.","As a global company with operations around the world, supporting commercial and government customers in more than 150 countries, Boeing maintained strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other key stakeholders around the world. We will continue to engage with leaders in these countries to urge a productive dialog to resolve trade differences, highlighting the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. The final appropriation bill for fiscal year 2018 U.S. federal budget funded our key programs across our fixed wing, rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft and our missile, space and satellite products.","Boeing continues to see strong support for our key products in fiscal year 2019 President's budget and in Congress, including increased procurement of 110 F-18 Super Hornets across the future year defense plan and support for a fourth multiyear procurement for the F-18, and increases for various programs in our weapons and rotorcraft portfolios. The BDS portfolio is well-positioned with mature, world-class platforms to address current needs.","International demand for our defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular, for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites.","As I mentioned earlier, we finalized a production contract for 28 F-18 Super Hornets for Kuwait and received a multiyear contract for the V-22 Osprey, which includes four aircraft for the government of Japan.","Recently, New Zealand selected the Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft as its new maritime patrol aircraft. We are making progress towards completing other previously-announced international sales, including additional Chinook helicopters for Spain and Saudi Arabia.","Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems.","Much of that investment supports the priority we have placed on capturing future franchise programs, where we're also leveraging capabilities and technologies from across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, and the unmanned carrier-based MQ-25A along with several other important opportunities.","Turning to the services sector. We see the $2.8 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. BGS provides agile, cost competitive services to our customers worldwide. We aim to grow faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share.","Strong orders of $4 billion in the quarter reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational cost through the lifecycle.","These activities stretch across BGS's four capability areas; including parts, engineering, mods and maintenance, digital aviation and analytics and training and professional services.","Our digital solutions powered by Boeing analytics provide airlines with advanced optimization and analysis, as illustrated by a recent contract from Etihad Airways to implement our crew management solutions to support the planning and operation of their 7,500 crew members. The flexibility and strength of our optimization and the crew management suite will allow Etihad to solve complex issues with ease, and support their decision-making process with detailed quantifications of risks and costs.","Our focus remains on optimizing the businesses and expanding our portfolio offerings through organic growth investments, such as strengthening our vertical capabilities, complemented by strategic acquisitions, to position BGS for long-term sustained growth and profitable growth.","Our expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well-positioned to compete and win in this important sector.","Before I close this business environment section, I would like to spend some time on Embraer. Consistent with our enterprise strategy of pursuing strategic investment opportunities where they demonstrate real value and accelerate our organic growth plans, earlier this month we signed an MOU with Embraer for formation of a joint venture comprising the commercial aircraft and services business of Embraer. This proposed partnership will strategically align with Boeing's commercial development, production, marketing, and lifecycle services operations, strengthen the vertical capabilities of Boeing and enhance value for our customers through industry-leading products and services.","Additionally, we will create another joint venture to promote and develop new markets and applications for defense products and services, especially the KC-390 multi-mission aircraft. This comprehensive enterprise-wide collaboration with Embraer will create the most important strategic partnership in the aerospace industry, strengthening both companies' leadership in the global market and creating more value for both companies' customers, shareholders and employees.","While this agreement is a significant step, a considerable amount of work remains. And in the coming months we'll continue to work with Embraer and its shareholders, the Brazilian government and regulators among others to complete the transaction.","In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvement to fuel our investments in the future.","With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 4 and we'll discuss our second quarter results.","Revenue for the quarter was strong at $24.3 billion, reflecting higher volume of Commercial Airplane deliveries, favorable mix, along with an increased volume at both Defense, Space & Security, as well as Boeing Global Services businesses.","Core earnings per share of $3.33 reflect solid execution across the businesses, higher volume and improved mix, along with a lower tax rate. The results were partially offset by an after-tax charge of $124 million related to a receivable write-off due to the previously announced Spirit litigation outcome and cost growth of $334 million after-tax on the KC-46 Tanker program.","As Dennis mentioned, we're raising our full-year revenue guidance to reflect higher volume at Defense, Space & Security and Global Services; and additionally, we are adjusting Commercial Airplane and Defense, Space & Security segment operating margins. I'll provide more details on our 2018 outlook further in my remarks.","Now let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue increased to $14.5 billion during the quarter reflecting higher deliveries and improved mix.","BCA operating margins increased to 11.4%, driven by strong operating performance on production programs, higher 787 margins and timing of some period expense, partially offset by a $307 million pre-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. Second quarter BCA operating margins excluding the Tanker charge were 13.3%.","BCA captured $16 billion in net orders during the second quarter and the backlog remains very strong at $416 billion and nearly 5,900 aircraft equating to approximately seven years of production.","On the 787 program, we delivered 38 aircraft and booked 59 net orders in the quarter; and additionally, we extended the 787 accounting block by 100 units. This resulted in higher margins on the program and, therefore, moderated the decline of deferred production balance this quarter. The overall cash profile of this program continues to improve through the improved mix, supplier step-down pricing and our team's day-to-day focus on improving 787 profitability and cash generation.","Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. Second quarter revenue increased to $5.6 billion, driven by F\/A-18 production contract award for Kuwait and higher weapons volume.","BDS margins of 9.3% reflected our continued focus on productivity and execution, offset by $111 million pre-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. Second quarter BDS operating margins excluding the Tanker charge were 11.2%.","During the quarter, BDS won key contract awards worth $7 billion and our backlog stands at $52 billion with 35% of that from international customers.","Turning now to Boeing Global Services results on slide 7. In the second quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.1 billion, reflecting higher volume, predominantly driven by increased parts sales.","Year-over-year growth of 15% for the quarter and 11% in the first half of the year more than meets our objective to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%.","BGS operating margins were solid at 14.7%, reflecting ongoing productivity efforts, as well as mix of products and services in the quarter.","During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $4 billion and our backlog now stands at $20 billion. This month marked the one-year anniversary of the launch of Boeing Global Services business and we're proud of the team's accomplishments.","BGS results year-to-date are a testament to the team and the enterprise focus on achieving top-line growth, while maintaining disciplined execution. The key wins this year underscore the strength of the One Boeing offering to our customers.","Let's now turn to cash flow on slide 8. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was strong at $4.7 billion, driven by planned higher Commercial Airplane rates, stronger operating performance across the business and timing of receipts and expenditures.","Year-to-date, cash flow remained strong at $7.8 billion. We remain focused and on track with our balanced cash deployment strategy. In the second quarter, we repurchased $3 billion of Boeing stock and paid $1 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividend per-share from last year.","We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $12 billion repurchase authorization over the next 18 months to 24 months. And since the end of 2012, we returned more than $48 billion to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchase.","At the same time, we've invested more than $30 billion in key strategic areas to ensure long-term sustainable growth for Boeing and our customers. We remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to investors, while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities.","Let's move now to cash and debt balance on slide 9. We ended the quarter with nearly $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, lower debt levels and stable credit ratings. Our cash position continues to provide us with the flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities while again returning value to shareholders.","Turning now to slide 10. And we'll discuss our outlook for 2018. For full-year guidance, we're raising revenue guidance by $1 billion to now be between $97 billion and $99 billion from our prior guidance of between $96 billion and $98 billion. The increase in revenue reflects the growth from key international fighter awards and higher weapons revenue for BDS and higher parts revenue for BGS.","As a result, we're increasing guidance by $500 million to be between $22 billion and $23 billion for BDS and between $15.5 billion and $16 billion for BGS.","We're also updating full-year BCA and BDS segment operating margin guidance to reflect BCA's strong performance and cost growth on the KC-46 Tanker program this quarter.","BCA margin guidance is increased to now be greater than 11.5% from our prior guidance of approximately 11.5%, again reflecting strong performance and offsetting the growth on the Tanker program this quarter.","BDS margin guidance is reduced to now be between 10% and 10.5% from our prior guidance of approximately 11%, again primarily due to reflecting of the impact of the KC-46 Tanker growth.","The rest of the full-year guidance including EPS, cash flow and aircraft deliveries remain unchanged and by holding EPS and cash flow guidance we are absorbing the impact of the Tanker cost growth and Spirit litigation charge, offsetting that with performance.","As we look toward the remainder of the year, we remain focused on strong execution, including development programs and risk mitigation within our company and throughout our supply chain.","So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. We will continue to use our three-business-unit strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments and leverage talent and innovation across the company.","At the same time, we'll set challenging goals and objectives around elements of operation and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency to generate cash and improve working capital, while delivering value to our customers. All of these will help us achieve our goal to grow year-over-year revenue, cash flow and margins.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","All right. Thank you, Greg. With a strong couple of quarters providing solid momentum for the year, our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity.","We wouldn't have been able to achieve these strong results without the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnership we enjoy with our customers and suppliers.","In addition to the strong Commercial Airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we have taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business. This includes remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts, and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical.","We've executed on our long-term strategy of robust and continuing organic growth investment in returning value to shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. The recently-announced planned strategic partnerships with Embraer and Safran and agreement to acquire KLX Aerospace are entirely consistent with this strategy.","As the world's largest aerospace company spanning Commercial, Defense, Space and Services, we are as optimistic about our future and the future of our industry as we have ever been.","Our priorities, going forward, are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts.","Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production; continuing to strengthen our Defense and Space business; growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy; delivering on our development programs; driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth; disciplined, leading-edge investments and balanced value-creating cash deployment; and continuing to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.","With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","As a reminder, in the interest of time, we are asking that you limit yourself to one single-part question. First, we'll go to the line of Peter Arment of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Dennis, Greg.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Hey.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey. Good morning, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Dennis, could you address the kind of the supply chain readiness, I guess, particularly on the narrow-body side? Some of the comments coming out of Farnborough is that the engine OEMs are still studying these higher rates and they don't seem to be ready to committing to them yet. Maybe if you could just give us some color. And do you still need that 18-month to 24-month kind of lead time to make a right decision? Thanks.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet, Peter. Hey, first of all, very important that we continue to work with our supply chain on our overall production ramp-up. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we've just moved to 52 a month on the 737 line, as of June. We're still planning to ramp-up to 57 a month next year, and as I've mentioned in my comments, we continue to see upward pressure from the marketplace. We are selling and filling skyline out in the 2023 and beyond timeframe.","Now in our current production system, while we see challenges and you've heard from our supply chain on some of the pressure points, things like fuselages and engines, which are well acknowledged and those are items we work on a day-to-day basis, we're continuing to ramp-up our supply chain and it's healthy and we're meeting our customer delivery requirements. And I think that's the key as we're continuing to hit on deliveries.","And as we contemplate future rate increases, we're going to continue to look at the supply chain in an integrated manner. And there are no doubt pressure points as we ramp-up, that's why we need to continue to be very deliberate, very disciplined in these decisions. We've done that. We've done more than 20 rate breaks since 2010, so we know how to do this. We're going to continue to apply that same disciplined approach. But I will say that the market pressures indicate upward pressure, and as we approach our decision points with the lead times as you outlined, we'll do that in a very deliberate and disciplined manner.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Can we talk about commercial aircraft profitability? Given margins excluding the Tanker costs were over 13%, so maybe could you talk about the moving pieces as we move through the remainder of the year?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Sheila. Well, I mean, to-date, you've seen improvement kind of across the board on the production programs and obviously with the block extension on the 787, we've seen the results of that this quarter. And going forward, you're going to continue to see a lot of productivity efforts across the programs, but you're going to see some shifts in period expense, in particular, R&D.","So, we'll have some more R&D in the back half and I think of that as just timing, primarily driven by 777X. And then, we've also got some investments that we're making around productivity in the back half that aren't reflected in the first half.","So, I'd say, those are the big moving pieces, but we're seeing obviously great performance across the board. Obviously a lot of focus, in particular, around taking best practices across the enterprise, and bringing them not only to Commercial Airplanes but across all of the portfolio. So there's a lot more, I'd say, One Boeing effort going on leveraging best practices and we're going to continue to do that as we strive to increase margins and cash flow going forward as Dennis and I have articulated.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I wonder. Good morning. If you guys could talk a little bit about the cash flow profile of the Tanker program from here and maybe thinking about a couple of the different elements, including any additional cash that might be needed on other aircraft that are in inventory beyond the ones that you mentioned? Any penalties that the Air Force might be entitled to, along with on the positive side the inventory reduction that comes from the deliveries?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, I'd say, Seth, obviously Tanker is going to continue to improve the cash profile going forward as we make more progress and then reach the milestones that Dennis articulated in the first delivery, there being in October. So, we've got a number obviously of aircraft in work now and as we deplete that inventory and start delivery, you'll see improved cash in the years to come. So, it won't be anything near-term, everything has been contemplated on the near-term for the balance of this year. But even as we talked about cash flow growing going forward, this is a key element of that, but not a significant moving piece when you think about the broader, I'll say cash levers of the company.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","And, Seth, just to add a little more color on Tanker itself, I think a key thing to note, again in the quarter as I mentioned, while we took the charge on those early-build aircraft and flight test aircraft, I think, it's very important to note the milestone we achieved in the quarter of completing all of the flight testing associated with first delivery, getting all of our artifacts submitted for final certification, and getting crystal clarity on what is left to build out these aircraft. So, we have a known configuration, flight testing is completed. Now, we need to finish the work to get to delivery and that'll produce the results that Greg mentioned.","Operator","And next, we have the line of Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Dennis. Hi, Greg.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Good morning, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just given, staying on the Tanker, obviously, you've had some challenges on the program, you've managed them reasonably well; but as we look forward to the 777X and maybe the NMA, what are you doing to just de-risk those programs so that you don't have similar obstacles like you did on the Tanker? Is it more of a digital approach? Or are you trying to manage a timeline a bit? Just some color there to help us get comfortable with any risk going forward?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet. Yeah, Rajeev, on that we've got a very focused effort on enterprise development programs and lessons learned and learning from each of the programs as we execute them. And while Tankers had its challenges, we have learned a lot through that process, especially in our commercial derivative lines and how we do development programs that span our commercial production, and military certification requirements. Tanker was especially complex because of the multiple certifications required both commercial and military. That's not a complexity that we have on a product like 777X or NMA.","That said, several lessons learned. One includes digitizing our engineering at a more detailed level upfront. This is the model based engineering initiatives that we have underway, as an example.","Also, more significant investments in system integration labs upfront to de-risk development and eliminate downstream discoveries, and that's been very effective for us on 777X, and also some of the early prototyping in the production systems, again to de-risk key areas as we move into the production flow. And we're seeing that reflected again on 777X as the first two airplanes have now moved into the low-rate initial production line.","All of these early de-risking steps are showing up in a positive way on 777X and we're going to be keeping a close eye on that as we build-out the flight test aircraft and move into flight test; but given that we're into the heart of 777X right now, we've got a healthy development program on track to deliver on 2020 as scheduled. We're seeing clear signs of improvement in our overall development program process.","So, that's our headset going forward and we'll continue to learn. I think this is one of the benefits of our phased R&D approach. Rather than doing multiple development programs in parallel, we're now doing a much more sequential approach, so that we can learn program-to-program and continue to reduce risk going forward.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Thank you. Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. So, you talked about mix driving some pressure on BGS margins and I think you called out parts sales as a driver of the top line.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","As we learn more about this business, what are some of the moving parts that help and hurt mix there that we should think about going forward and whether that's like by end-market or contract type? And the second part of the question is, as the business fills up, would you may be willing to trade a little bit of margin for some top line opportunities? Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Hunter, you're right. I mean, it's a very different portfolio than the other businesses, so you're dealing with thousands of contracts and a couple million different, I'll say, kind of offerings through parts or other services.","So with that, just the nature of that business, you're going to end up with some ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter depending on how that mix plays out.","So, the portfolio is very different obviously and that's going to drive some of that change; but beneath that, the focus continues to be on core operating performance, the cost structure, the working capital around that business. So that engine is going to continue to run quarter-over-quarter, week-after-week, month-after-month, but you are going to end up seeing these movements quarter-to-quarter.","But end objective, grow the business as we've talked about a lot, at the same time grow the bottom-line and expand margin, and that's the underlying objective of this business and ultimately, we think we can serve our customers much better in doing that.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","We're staying very focused on our overall effort to drive to mid-teen margins across the entire business and so to your last part of your question, Hunter, on margin growth and BGS, we expect margins in BGS to be accretive to our overall enterprise margin, so this is all about profitable growth.","Operator","Next up, we have the line of Carter Copeland of Melius. Your line is open.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Carter, we can't hear you.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Wow. This is leaving mute on two days in a row. I'm losing my skills. Sorry, guys. Just a quick clarification and a question on expanding on what Seth asked.","Greg, can you confirm if the 787 unit versus program was positive or negative in the quarter? And then just on this whole Tanker cash flow, just because the size of the charge and how we should think about impacting the cash, are the terms of payment with the customer on that payment upon delivery of the aircraft or milestone-based ahead of that? Thanks, guys.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, they're milestone-based, performance milestone-based. And with regards to the 787, we did see, obviously, we saw unit improvement this quarter across-the-board.","Operator","And next up, we have the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I know at Farnborough, you got a number of 777 orders and can you help us understand where you stand on filling the bridge to the 777X? And then perhaps give us a sense of what you think that 777X ramp will look like, given the planned entry into service in 2020? And along with that, just when you expect we'll likely see more orders for the 777X rather than just the 777?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet. Hey, Doug. Great question. The key thing on 777 is, we've seen very strong recovery in the Freighter market, in particular, and you see that in the demand and recent orders. We've got 24 new orders year-to-date for 777s through the end of the second quarter. Since the end of the quarter, an additional five from Qatar, 777 Freighters. So, year-to-date, 29 new orders for 777s.","Beyond that, we have the additional announcements that have been recently made, including the letter of intent from Volga-Dnepr for 29 777s. We continue to have a number of other campaigns underway as well. So, you really see the strength of the market there continuing to build our confidence in filling out the bridge.","As I said, we're really now focused on skyline slots 2020 and beyond. We still have work to do, but our confidence continues to grow based on recent sales successes and what we see as sustained growth in the Freighter market.","Now, as we look beyond that and headed towards 777X development, I think a key fact for you is, today, we have 340 orders and commitments in place for the 777X. For the Dash-9 variant of that, we have 273 orders of those 340 orders. And if you want to compare that to where we were at the same time on the 777-300ER back when it was introduced, at that same point in time, relative point in time, we had 70 orders. So 273 orders versus 70 orders. That should give you a sense of the confidence we have in the backlog for 777X.","Now, we still continue to have additional campaigns and high interest in the 777X, but we're in very good shape as we look at our production pipeline and backlog position to ramp up successfully on the 777X. So, the key focus now is move into flight test on the 777X, finish out the current 777 bridge, where we have growing confidence again, and then get to EIS for 777X in 2020.","And I would say all of the dimensions of that puzzle continue to firm up and we're seeing growing confidence, and that's why the production rate plan we've put in place, we see that as a very clear floor for the production program, and we look forward to moving into the 777X.","Operator","Next in queue, we have the line of David Strauss of Barclays. Your line is open.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good morning.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted to ask about cash flow. So, I think, Greg, you talked earlier about earlier in the year that you saw prepayments as relatively neutral for the year. I think year-to-date, we're running at $3 billion. Are you expecting those to reverse as we go through the second half?","And then, second part on inventory, it looks like ex the drawdown in 787 deferred, you've had about $1 billion inventory build this year. Is that 777X? Or is that just related to the 37 ramp? Any color there. Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, the inventory is a little bit of both, David. Obviously, 777X inventory being the biggest driver and will continue to be through the balance of the year and into next year.","With regards to the advances, yeah, you're absolutely right. I mean, they move around quarter-to-quarter depending on the PDP schedule, so we've seen some this year more front-loaded than we will in the back half of the year, and we've taken that into consideration with the guide.","Operator","Next in queue, we have the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hey. Good morning, guys.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, Ron.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I think at Farnborough, Dennis, you mentioned on the 797, I think, the quote is, \"We want to be in the 2025 window with maybe a 2019 launch\". When we think about the 79 or the middle market, whatever it's going to be, maybe, should we start \u2013 in our financial forecast start building in something for that? Because it seems like the drumbeat is really gaining momentum. And then, the second part of the thing would be, when we think about it, is it a wide-body? Is it a narrow-body? I mean, where are you guys on that now?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Ron. First of all, as you know, we haven't made a launch decision, but we continue to look at the middle of the market airplane. And as you heard at Farnborough continue to have very productive customer discussions on that topic. We do see a marketplace where for 4,000 aircraft to 5,000 aircraft and we're very focused now on deliberately going through our business case to make a good launch decision.","We are protecting 2025 as the entry into service date that aligns with our customers' needs and desires. So, we're doing the appropriate long lead work to protect that delivery date and we're looking at making a launch decision in 2019.","And again, we're going to be very deliberate about that and make sure business case that makes good, solid sense and that's our headset going in. So, we're not going to predetermine the answer there. We're talking to our supply chain and we're taking a look at every dimension of the program and we've got to look at this through a lifecycle lens both in airplane and downstream services and make sure we're producing value for customers. So, that's our headset.","And in terms of your question about wide-body or narrow-body, again as we look at configuration options and details and begin firming that up, what we're hearing from customers is we need something that has the comfort and twin-aisle benefit of wide-bodies but has narrow-body economics. And that's frankly the challenge of closing the business case, and it goes back to all the work we're doing on transforming our enterprise to drive efficiency in development production and support.","And if we build the confidence and the data we need to make a business case that closes, we'll launch and if we don't, we'll continue down the path with our current product lines.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Good morning, Rob.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","With your very strong margins at BCA, especially ex that charge, clearly, you've done a lot with costs, you're going to continue to do that, but I wanted to ask about the pricing side of the equation, especially in the context of Airbus comments last week at the show about pricing opportunity, given the scarcity of slots. So, I know, you have to balance that against higher rates, but how should we think about pricing over the next few years?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Well, Rob, when we take a look at that, first of all, I think it's important to note that pricing is holding up. It's driven by a number of different parameters, includes supply versus demand as you're pointing out, but it's also value that we generate for our customers and making sure that that value proposition is clear. So, everything we do on the pricing front is looked through that customer value lens and that's our focus. And the fact that pricing is holding up and you can see that reflected in our performance is a good sign of the unique value that our product lines are delivering for our customers.","I will say as you look across our narrow-body and wide-body product lines, it's very clear that our products deliver operating cost advantage and value advantage for our customers, and that's a key part of our equation going forward.","We're also keeping in mind the fact that we have this enterprise-wide global support and services capability. So, in many cases, we think about pricing, we're looking at it holistically across airplanes and services, which I think is a unique part of the Boeing value proposition.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Between the pricing and the cost element, do you have a sense of when you can hit this 15% type margin at BCA?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Well, as we said we're driving towards that mid-teen margin by the end of the decade. That's been our objective. You can see the progress we're making, and as we mentioned before, we expect it to be continuing incremental progress. There's not going to be a big step function or a hockey stick. It's continuous, focused, incremental performance and I think as you can see in our data, Rob, you see the core BCA margins minus the Tanker charge up over 13%. That ought to give you a good indicator of the progress that we're making.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","We are going to be relentless on this focus and it's really about driving out cost, driving productivity, working with our supply chain, and being diligent about our production rates.","Robert M.

LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Noah.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Greg, was the 787 cash unit margin up or down in 2Q versus 1Q? And then any willingness to even if in a wide range kind of give us an indication of where you've taken that to. And then similarly, on the program accounting margin, on the program even if in a wide range maybe help us out on how big of a change you made on it?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Noah, I mean, I think overall you're seeing 787 improvement like I said across the board. As you look at kind of the big levers and the cost structure there that we've talked about, the mix improving, the overall productivity unit-over-unit in our factories and again really leveraging the best practices, looking at the commonality between a 9 and a 10, and I'll say kind of how that improves productivity in our factory and in our supply chain is pretty significant, combined with the supplier step-downs that we have in place contractually.","And again, our own focus internally and even going out into the supply chain, taking our productivity where we've been successful in areas of productivity and bringing that out to the supply chain to help the overall program improve.","So, I wouldn't say it's one thing, Noah. It's many levers that we're working on and trying to pull and you're seeing that in the unit margin and the overall cash profile of the program.","And as we've said a number of times, I mean, the way the team looks at this, the way we look at it is unit-over-unit, what do we need to do to improve and be even more competitive in the marketplace and how do we leverage the best practices within our factories, combined within services, between defense-based security, and in commercial and also within the supply chain. So that's been I'll say the cadence and the level of effort that's been going on and that's going to continue.","And like I said, you're seeing that in the overall cash profile of the program, improving, combined with going up in rates very smoothly and getting that Dash-10 into the production system smoothly where we're going to deliver approximately 14 aircraft this year, Dash-10s. Very, very smooth introduction, and that really goes to the commonality of that design versus Dash-10 and the team's relentless focus on ensuring that we get that into the hands of the customer on-time, minimized risk. Somebody asked about risk earlier on. It's a great example of de-risking how we bring up a derivative program into the production system. So, point is, a lot of different things, but you're going to see that continued effort going forward on this program and all the other ones.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Appreciate that color. Any ability to give us a sense of where the program accounting margins sits at this point?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Well, it's improved, obviously, with the block extension, that helped and, again, if you go out in that further block you're seeing favorable mix, pricing, and supplier obviously step-down along with our own productivity. So, as we March through time, you're going to see an improvement overall to that margin incrementally as we move forward in those blocks. But like I said, here day-in and day-out, it's about unit performance, meeting our targets, utilizing all our working capital initiatives, and in all of our productivity, but we're focused. Unit-over-unit, ultimately will translate into program margin.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about, you mentioned the joint venture with Safran and APUs and I guess I'm trying to think about how do you balance the spend on a new plane with some of the significant nonrecurring engineering in areas like nacelles, APUs, maybe even avionics that takes place. And that's typically borne by suppliers and how does that factor into your thinking about potentially launching a new plane?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Sam, we figured that into our overall organic investment profile and that phased R&D plan that I mentioned earlier, and as part of our organic investment we're very focused on a few key verticals. We don't need to be vertical everywhere, but there are a few areas where when we look through a customer value lens, it's clear that we can add value.","The work on APUs with Safran is one of those areas. You mentioned avionics. It's another area. Interiors is another area, we've looked at where we've announced a joint venture with Adient. So, those are very targeted areas, well-known investments.","As part of our organic profile, those have been feathered in with our broader R&D investments in new platforms and product lines, including things like the 777X and some of our new defense products and services.","So, that's all part of an integrated R&D plan. And the way we've laid that into the profile is done in a way to ensure synergy between our verticals that we're building and our future platform products, and it's important that we do that in a synergistic way.","So, I would view that as an integrated organic investment plan, not something where we're trading verticals or platforms. It's doing it together with an eye towards creating value for customers, and then where it makes sense, we augment that with inorganic investments.","That cash deployment strategy remains constant. And as we talked about, while we make those organic and inorganic investments, we've also committed to returning 100% free cash flow to our investors, and that commitment remains solid.","Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.","Okay. Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your line is open.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, Dennis and Greg. I just wanted to follow-up, Dennis, on your comments earlier specifically on, as you look at everything now much more with a lifecycle lens, I'm just curious on the NMA, assuming you move forward there, how does that lens impact your analysis of the business case in terms of the market opportunity?","And then second, and maybe more importantly, how that might potentially impact your go-to-market strategy as you obviously have opportunities now to capture economics in a much broader range. I'm just curious, if you can provide any more detail as to your thinking around that and how it might specifically get applied or used around the NMA.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, well, in particular, as we look at the business case for NMA, as I said, we're looking at it both from an airplane and downstream services standpoint, so an integrated lifecycle view, again, where can we create value for customers? And depending on the customer set, there's a different value proposition for different airlines.","In some cases, we can reduce operating costs. In some cases, we can help them reduce capital investment costs. So, we're factoring that entire equation into our business case. It does give us more parameters to look at. It gives us more ways to construct a business case for the future, and taking that holistic lifecycle view, just gives us a more robust business case.","It also, as you pointed out, will affect our potential go-to-market approaches, again, how we can tailor a value proposition for different customers. And it will drive different ways of how you might design such an airplane. Again, from the start, thinking about digital solutions and the architecture of the airplane, so that it can enable optimized services for customers. So, it's not only something that factors into the business case, it also affects how we would design the airplane.","So all of that is being done in our business case analysis. And I'll go back to my earlier point that it's important that we get it right, and we're going to take the time to get it right. We're protecting the EIS date for our customers at 2025, and if we decide to launch this development program, the R&D profile would be on the back side of 777X, so it would feather in nicely and be consistent with our overall cash flow priorities.","Operator","And that does complete the analyst question-and-answer session for this morning. I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Phil Musser, Senior Vice President of Communication. Mr. Musser, please go ahead.","Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.","Thank you very much, operator. We'll continue now with media questions for Dennis and Greg. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please contact our Media Relations team by e-mail or at 312-544-2002.","Operator, we're ready for the first question, and in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Julie Johnsson of Bloomberg. Your line is open.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Hi.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good morning, Julie.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Hey. Just to circle back on narrow-body rate, it seems to me that Boeing is taking sort of a more cautious or measured approach to evaluating rate increases into the 2020s, while your competitor is talking about rate 70 or even rate 75. I'm just wondering if the supply chain can actually support the rates that Airbus has been publicly mulling. And if they move forward, is Boeing going to have to keep pace, especially given the very strong demand environment?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Julie, let me provide some additional perspective on that. Again, we're going to be very focused on being disciplined about our rate decisions and our production ramp up.","We've got important work ahead of us. We've just moved to 52 a month on the 737 line. We're going to move to 57 a month next year. As we said the market pressures do indicate upward pressure on that rate. That's a challenge, but it's a good challenge to have, but at every one of these steps we're going to bring our entire supply chain along and I think you see that reflected in our performance.","We're continuing to meet our delivery commitments to our customers. That's the lens that we put on these production rate decisions. We see pressure points in the supply chain. We work those on a day-to-day basis and we're very focused on maintaining our discipline. And we'll make rate decisions not only informed by market pressures, but informed by our ability to execute them successfully, and I think our track record of doing 20 successful rate breaks over the last several years speaks to our approach.","And while I can't comment on our competitor's approach, what I can comment on is our disciplined approach. We're going to maintain that approach. We're working very closely with our supply chain to bring them along in an integrated fashion. That'll continue to be our focus going forward.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Brian Sozzi of TheStreet. Your line is open.","Brian Sozzi - TheStreet","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Sozzi - TheStreet","Dennis, since the last time we talked we got the Space Force announcement and I'm curious how you're thinking about it and what type of dollar impact could that potentially new program mean to a Boeing? And then on the Services business real quick for you guys, are you planning to get more aggressive on acquisitions there to build that out?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, well, first of all, Brian, on Space Force and more broadly on the Space business, I'm very encouraged by what I see as the administration leaning forward on investing in space, and all dimensions of the Space business, not only Space Force, but more broadly, the work that's going into space exploration and the reinvigoration of that entire ecosystem.","And we've had the opportunity to participate as part of the National Space Council and be on the user Advisory Group there, partnered with the administration. So, we have industry voice at the table as we shape these potential opportunities.","So from that standpoint, I'm very encouraged about the U.S. Government leaning forward and investing in space. It's good for business. It creates growth opportunities for us. It's also a great way to develop STEM talent for the future.","Now, when we look at our growth opportunities going forward, we do see the Space business as an important part of that and that spans from low earth orbit commercial travel and access to the space station. It includes our satellite business and it includes deep space exploration, including the space launch system with a focus on returning to the moon and then stepping to Mars. So, we're going to continue to lean forward in that business. It's an important investment area for us.","Stepping back to your second question on services, we continue to see that as a very attractive growth market for us, and we've set a high bar target of growing that to be a $50 billion a year business over the 5 year to 10 year timeframe. And while we're a year into that effort, I think we have some good signs, especially if you look at the growth year-to-date of 11% versus 3.5% in the market. Good signs that our strategy is working.","A lot of work ahead of us and it's an integrated organic and inorganic investment strategy, primarily driven again by organic investment parts, mods and maintenance, our training business, our digital business, those are all known organic investments. And where it makes sense we'll complement that with inorganic investments, but we clearly see acquisitions as a bolt-on complement to what is primarily an organic investment strategy.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Dominic Gates of Seattle Times. Your line is open.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","Good morning, everyone.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Dominic.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","I want to ask about the maturity of the 777X, the new automated technology that you've introduced there. So you have both the new wing center and you've added the wing assembly automated equipment now for that and you've also got the FAUB fuselage robotics. Both of those initially had some issues, challenges as they were new. Are they now, both the fuselage and the wing automated systems, now operating the way that you want them to? And how will you plan to use any of that for NMA?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Dominic, we continue to make very good progress on those automation systems and while I won't declare them to be in final state, it's very clear that we've made progress both on the fuselage automated systems as well as the wing build system.","And I think the key thing that you see in our focus here is that while those automation systems were designed purpose-built to be used for 777X production, we've de-risked those systems by pulling them forward in the factory and applying them to the current 777 program where it makes sense.","So, we've been able to use that as a way to de-risk and as you pointed out, there have been some challenges as we've ramped up those automation capabilities. That's exactly why we pulled them forward into the 777 line is to experience and de-risk those systems.","We've seen them continue to mature. We're seeing operational efficiency gains in our factory. We're seeing safety benefits for our workforce. We're seeing quality benefits. All of the things we hope to get out of the automation are coming to bear and we're going to continue to mature those as we move into the test program for 777X.","And if we decide to launch NMA, part of that would leverage the next generation of automation technology. Again, as we digitize our airplanes, it becomes even more straightforward to apply these automation techniques and we're going to see costs and schedule benefits. We're going to see safety benefits for our workforce, and this is a key part of how we're transforming the Boeing enterprise for the future.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Operator, we have time for one more question from the media.","Operator","Certainly. Our last question will come from the line of Andrew Tangel of Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Hey. The Chinese carriers and lessors have previously played a significant role in the orders and commitments at the airshows in Paris and Farnborough, but there weren't that many fresh deals from Chinese companies. At the recent airshow in Farnborough, by one estimate, almost half of Boeing's new orders and commitments at last year's Paris airshow came from Chinese companies.","What do you make of the relative absence of a large number of Chinese buyers at this year's airshow, especially in light of how much growing demand you expect from China over the next couple of decades?","And does this potentially signal that Chinese buyers are holding off making orders or commitments because of some of the trade friction including between the U.S. and China right now?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Andrew, look at our total orders book, as we noted, very strong. And in fact, if you look at total orders and commitments year-to-date of more than 900 aircraft, commercial aircraft, that gives you a sense of the overall strength of the market.","I don't find it surprising one way or the other that we may or may not have orders from a particular region or a particular customer at the airshow. We don't design our orders profile around airshows. We have some customers who want to make announcements at airshows and we work with them to do that, but our view is much more of a steady, sustained growth and orders throughput and you see that reflected in our month-to-month orders and sales.","Our Chinese customers are exceptionally important to us. They're a big part of the backlog we have of the 5,900 aircraft we have in backlog. They're a strong portion of that. The future market we talked about, the world needing 43,000 airplanes roughly over the next 20 years, about 7,200 of those are in China, so it's an important customer for us. We're well-positioned in China. We're working closely with our customers there. We're ramping up capability in China, while we ramp-up in the U.S. as well.","And I'll go back to my fundamental point that as we think about China-U.S. trade relationships, aerospace is something that's good for both countries. It's mutually beneficial. It creates growth capacity in China. It's helping them grow their economy, it's growing jobs in China, and as China grows, it's growing jobs in the U.S. and our 737 production line for example, as we ramp-up building on Chinese demand, that's growing U.S. manufacturing jobs.","And it's very clear to us that free and open trade environment and good relations between China and the U.S. is not only beneficial to the aerospace business, but in turn the aerospace business is beneficial to the economies and jobs of both countries.","Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.","Thank you. That concludes our second quarter earnings call. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please contact our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002 or via e-mail. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen still connected, that does conclude the presentation for this morning. Again, we do thank you very much for your participation, and for using our executive teleconference service. You may now disconnect."],"3552":["The Boeing Co.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session, are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions]. ","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead.","Maurita Sutedja","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today are David Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy. Dave will start with some opening comments and hand it over to Greg to address the business environment and our financial results. After management comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections, estimates and goals we have included in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures.","Now I will turn over the call to Dave Calhoun.","David Calhoun","Thank you, Maurita. Good morning to everyone. I'll state the obvious. I've been here 2.5 weeks, and this is my first earnings call as the President and CEO of the company. While I'm new to the CEO role, I am certainly not new to the company and have long admired the business, the products that we build and the people that serve the company.","It's a very challenging moment for Boeing. We got a lot of work to do. But I'm confident that we'll manage this situation in the right way, and I'm optimistic about the company's future, both in terms of the markets that we serve and maybe more importantly, the engineering and technical capabilities we bring.","Before we proceed, let me just say to the families and the loved ones of those who perished in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents, we -- I am truly and deeply sorry for your loss. I will repeat this many, many times in the years ahead. Their memories will drive me personally to do everything I can to make our airplanes and our industry safer, and I know I speak for all of my Boeing associates accordingly.","I've been spending a lot of my first weeks meeting, connecting with, listening to my Boeing teammates across the country. What I'm seeing and hearing is that our employees are incredibly proud to work at Boeing, but they're also hurt and disappointed that we've let our stakeholders down. Together, we're committed to getting back on our front foot, learning with humility and building on the powerful legacy they and their predecessors have created over the last century. This includes engaging with one another and our stakeholders with greater transparency, holding ourselves accountable to the highest standards of safety and quality and incorporating an outside-in perspective on what we do and how we do it.","To that end, I've also been reaching out to important external stakeholders, I know you know that, including our customers of our 3 businesses; our supply base, our supply chain, which is under stress; business partners; and finally, maybe most importantly, regulators.","I look forward to engaging with many others with whom I have not yet had the opportunity to meet with in the weeks and months to come. All of these conversations that I have had and I am certain the ones I will have are laced with support for our company, the important work that we do and the importance of what we do for the country. We will be transparent in everything that we do as we move forward.","I want to express my personal thanks to everyone who has been our partner in this journey. We're mindful that these are challenging times for many, and we remain grateful for your support.","Before going through my initial priorities for 2020, let me share a brief history of my interactions with Boeing. I've known Boeing since the year 2000 when I started with GE's aircraft engine business. And we are engaged in the development of a new centerline engine for the long-range 777, capable of delivering 115,000 pounds of thrust to the airframe. That was the first of its kind. When you're on the wing, you are on the team.","Given this history, the 777X first flight on Saturday not only was a major milestone and a proud moment for the company, but also has a significant meaning for me. I've watched the development of the 777 series from the very first engine to the new wing tip on the 777X and see it as a proof point of Boeing's engineering and technology prowess.","Shortly after leaving GE, I returned to Boeing when Jim McNerney invited me to join the Board in 2009. As a Board member of Boeing with institutional knowledge of the business, I was able to develop my initial priorities right away in my first week.","We can turn to the second slide, please. First and foremost, our primary focus continues to be returning the 737 MAX to service safely. This includes following the lead of our regulators and working with them to ensure they're satisfied completely with the airplane and our work. The FAA and the global regulatory authorities will determine the timeline for certification and return to service, and we remain fully committed to supporting this process. Our job is to ensure that every requirement is fulfilled, every question from the regulators answered. We'll get it done, and we'll get it done the right way.","As you well know, over the last year, the entire Boeing Board has been actively engaged in helping to resolve our current challenges and enhancing our governance and safety oversight. These actions included establishing a Board Safety Committee and realigning and elevating safety management and engineering organizations across the company. These organization design changes will shine bright lights on the safety process and the engineering disciplines that underlie them.","As previously announced, we've also decided to temporarily suspend the 737 production beginning this month. We believe this decision is least disruptive to maintaining long-term production system and supply chain health. We will work closely with our supply chain to ensure we are ready to safely and smartly return to production.","Similarly, public, customer and stakeholder confidence in the 737 MAX is critically important to us. And with that focus, we've decided to recommend simulator training combined with computer-based training for all pilots prior to return to service. Our singular priority is safety, and every decision, every action, every step we take as we move forward will be guided by it.","As we mentioned last week, we're currently estimating that the ungrounding of the 737 MAX will begin mid-2020. This estimate is informed by our experience to date with the certification process. It is subject to our ongoing attempts to address known schedule risks and further developments that may arise in connection with the certification process. It also accounts for the rigorous scrutiny that regulatory authorities are rightly applying at every step of their review of the 737 MAX's flight control system and the Joint Operations Evaluation Board process, which determines pilot training requirements.","It is important to emphasize that this estimate should not be interpreted as an attempt to influence or interfere with the FAA and other regulators' absolute authority to determine the timing and conditions of return to service. Very simply, accurate financial reporting requires that we provide our latest and most informed schedule. Similarly, our supply chain, in the name of transparency, requires a schedule to perform up to its standard.","Moving on to rebuilding trust, which I briefly touched on earlier. We recognize that many of our stakeholders are rightly disappointed in us, and it's our job to repair these vital relationships. We'll do so through a commitment to transparency in everything we do and by meeting or exceeding expectations. We will listen, we will seek feedback and respond appropriately, urgently and respectfully.","Our culture is centered around strong shared value, safety, quality and integrity. Every day, we will recommit to these and foster an inclusive environment that embraces oversight and accountability and puts these 3 core principles above all else. We will listen and resolve real-time any all employee concerns pertaining to safety or other of our shared values.","We will also focus on operating with excellence. We must get back to basics: delivering safe products and services to our customers while continuously improving our quality. We will complete our work in station wherever we are and whatever we do, and we will do it to the highest standards.","We are committed to do it across our Commercial, Defense, Space & Security and Services businesses. This is not relegated to just the MAX or the 737. This requires a focused approach and simplification in everything we do to ensure we deliver on what matters most with accountability.","We will restore production health, both within the Boeing's 4 walls and the industry at large. We'll keep taking steps to manage our supply chain health and maintain workforce expertise across the enterprise so that, in particular, with respect to the 737 MAX, we'll be ready to restart production, increase rate safely, smartly, disciplined and with the highest standards of quality.","While doing all of these, we will not lose sight of the importance of investing in our future. Our markets are growing. Customer demand is evolving. The competition is increasing, and technology is advancing at a pace we've never seen before. Boeing must keep innovating to succeed.","We'll continue to invest in our global workforce and new processes, new technologies that will help us become safer, more efficient as we define the future of aerospace. This work includes preparing for the first Starliner crewed mission, continuing to progress the 777X and the 737 MAX 10 and further growth of our global services business and full implementation of our Embraer partnership.","That said, there are always some investment reprioritizing and streamlining that we can do, and we will. We'll take the time to reassess our product development strategy in a fairly methodical way. I think that's a natural course for any new incoming leader to take.","We'll return to this topic in future discussions. This is not intended to delay, simply to refresh. By focusing on these priorities and unleashing our talent, I'm confident we have the right foundation to keep the business strong, to keep it healthy while navigating this very difficult moment.","Before I turn it over to Greg for an update on the business environment and our performance, I want to pause and thank him for the leadership he has provided throughout this challenging time and for so ably filling the CEO role during the transition. Everybody here knows we've had a number of leadership changes over the past few months, including me. The strong teams we have supporting our leaders have provided the stability we need and paved the way for seamless transitions. But Greg has set in motion some of the changes we need to see, and he has led it with real skill. He will continue to be my partner, and we will lead the company together. I'm excited now to be working alongside him and the rest of our senior leaders.","And now I'll turn it over to Greg.","Gregory Smith","Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everybody. As many of you know, I've had the distinct pleasure of knowing Dave for a long time. And we're extremely lucky to have him in the chair, helping us navigate through these challenging times and the path forward. I have a lot of respect for Dave and look forward to the continued partnership. And I can tell you, we are completely 100% aligned on our priorities and the path forward for our company.","Let's now move to Slide 3, and we'll discuss our overall business environment. We continue to be operating in sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals with a combined market opportunity of $8.7 trillion over the next 10 years. We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in Commercial, Defense, Space and Services. However, we are starting to see some pressure, such as in the cargo market, that we will continue to monitor going forward.","In Commercial Aviation, although we've seen some moderation in passenger traffic this year, we saw growth of a solid 4.2% through November. The fundamentals remain intact. However, the impact of the coronavirus on near-term traffic growth is clearly a watch item this year.","On the air cargo side, volumes have contracted due to challenging trade environment, and improvements in industrial production and global trade will be key to rebound the air traffic cargo market in 2020. We will continue to see steady utilization of global freighters while carriers are placing incremental orders to support their fleet replacement needs, but this is definitely something we're keeping a close eye on.","In the narrowbody segment, although the MAX grounding has presented us with near-term challenges, the depth and breadth of our backlog affords us the time to assess and mitigate the longer-term implications. Our 737 program has a backlog of approximately 4,400 aircraft, and we continue to see these new airplanes creating capacity for growth and provide required replacement for older, less efficient aircraft.","Clearly, our narrowbody delivery market share has been and will continue to be impacted by the MAX. Although we've not seen a direct impact on the value proposition of the 737 MAX in the marketplace, we will continue to monitor the market dynamics this creates.","The limited production slot availability of aircraft from both Boeing and our competitor affords us ample time to double down on improving operating efficiency in order to mitigate some of these challenges the program is facing in the near term.","With regards to the middle of the market aircraft, as Dave noted, we are reprioritizing and streamline some of our investments. We've asked the team to step back and reassess our commercial product development strategy to determine what family of airplanes will be needed in the future. The team will build on the work we have done as part of the NMA design and production system analysis as we move forward.","In the widebody segment, we saw solid order activity in 2019 for the 787 and 777 families. However, as we mentioned before, in the near term, the global trade environment has presented challenges for our widebody production plans, in particular, the 787 program. As part of our process, we're continually assessing the environment to determine if any further rate adjustments are required.","We previously announced that we will transition the 787 production rate from 14 per month to 12 per month in late '20. As we're in the planning window of a rate decision and to reduce risk in the '21 and 2022 skyline, we've decided to further reduce the rate to 10 per month in early '21 before returning to 12 per month in 2023.","We're pleased with the recent announcement of a Phase 1 deal between the U.S. and China, and we're proud that Boeing airplanes will continue to be part of this valued relationship. Progress on the trade deal is obviously very encouraging, and we will continue to work closely with our customer and awaiting details of access to the implementation of our backlog and how this will fit into our skyline given production lead times. In the meantime, we think it's prudent to take a more measured approach to our 787 future production rates.","We will continue to maintain this disciplined rate management process going forward, taking into account a host of risks and opportunities. We will also continue to assess the demand environment and make adjustments as appropriate in the future.","Turning to 777X. We successfully completed the 777X first flight last week. The test fleet, which began ground testing at Everett last year, will continue its rigorous test program over the months -- over the coming months to demonstrate safety and reliability. This is a comprehensive series of tests and conditions on the ground and in the air to evaluate flight controls, aerodynamic performance and cabin environmental controls, among many others. We're currently expecting first delivery of the 777-9 to be in 2021.","We continue to expect the 777 delivery rate to be approximately 3 per month in 2020. Progress on the 777X will be the primary driver of future delivery rate for the combined 777, 777X program. We will take a measured approach to the 777X rate ramp, and we will look to minimize the amount of change in corporation work by managing the number of aircraft produced prior to entry into service.","On the 777, as I discussed earlier, we will continually closely monitor the cargo market and carefully manage our skyline. Finally, as we previously announced, we are in the process of starting to transition the 767 production rate from 2.5 to 3 per month.","At Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid global demand for major platforms and programs. In addition, the FY '20 enacted budget provide support for a broad range of products, including procurement of the F-15EX. Our portfolio remains well positioned with proven world-class platforms to address current needs and innovative, capable and affordable new franchises to build the future.","We are maintaining a sharp focus on our future franchise programs such as the MQ-25, the T-7A Red Hawk and the MH-139A Grey Wolf, while working to ensure strong performance on existing platforms, especially our U.S. Air Force KC-46 program and our space programs, including Commercial Crew and Space Launch Systems.","Last month marked a significant milestone for the Commercial Crew program with an uncrewed orbital flight test of the CTE -- or CST-100 Starliner. However, as reported, this test was abbreviated due to anomalies experienced during the mission for venting the docking with the International Space Station. NASA is in the process of reviewing the data from our December 2019 mission, and the uncrewed mission, including docking to the space station, became part of the company's contract with NASA. And NASA's approval is required to proceed with a flight test with astronauts on board. Given this obligation, we are provisioned for another uncrewed mission, and you'll see this crew impact reflected in BDS financial results.","Turning to the Services sector. The $3.1 trillion services market over the next 10 years is a significant opportunity for our company. We continue to see growth with expanded service offerings of our supply chain portfolio and our global digital solutions. The MAX grounding has had impact on BGS growth in 2019 by pushing back the timing of some service demand from our airline customers who have been impacted by the grounding. We expect much of this to be resolved over time.","Given the backdrop of demand, the healthy supply chain ecosystem is critical to sustain production system stability. Some of the suppliers have had challenges with production rate changes in the past. And therefore, we are extremely engaged and especially as we navigate the current MAX grounding and production rate outlook. Suppliers' health and rate readiness will be critical as we assess production rates going forward.","Let's now turn to Slide 4 for our full year results. Our financial results continue to be impacted by the 737 MAX grounding. Revenue, earnings per share and operating cash were materially reduced. Our revenue of $76.6 billion reflects the 737 MAX impacts, partially offset by higher service volume. Core earnings per share was negative $3.47 for the full year, and operating cash was a negative $2.4 billion, again, primarily due to the 737 MAX impacts.","Let's now move to our quarterly results on Slide 5. During the quarter, we recorded revenue of $17.9 billion, core operating -- core earnings per share of negative $2.33 and negative $2.2 billion of operating cash.","Before we discuss segment performance, let me go over 737 MAX financials in more detail. Turning now to Slide 6. In preparation for our fourth quarter financial statements, we made certain assumptions, including timing of resumption of delivery, production rate and ramp-up profiles. Again, let me reiterate, it is the FAA and the global regulators who will determine the timing and the conditions of return to service.","We've assumed that the regulatory approval for the 737 MAX will enable deliveries to begin in mid-2020. We've also assumed that as a condition of return to service, regulators will require 737 MAX pilots to undergo combination of computer and simulator training.","We've assumed that we will resume 737 MAX aircraft production at low rates in 2020 as timing and conditions of return to service are better understood. And then we expect to gradually increase previously planned production rates over the next few years.","We're also assuming that the 737 MAX airplanes produced and stored during the grounding will be delivered over several quarters, with the majority of them delivered during the first year after resumption of deliveries. Any changes to these assumptions will require us to recognize additional financial impacts.","In the fourth quarter, we added $2.6 billion of program costs to the 737 program. This is primarily to reflect current assumptions regarding timing of return to service and the timing of planned production rates and reflect the additional time required to produce and complete undelivered aircraft in the accounting quantity. These additional costs will be spread across the undelivered aircraft in the accounting block of approximately 3,100 units and, therefore, reduce the 737 program margin. Adding these to the program costs brings the total cumulative program impact to $6.3 billion.","In addition, the suspension of the 737 MAX production means that some costs must be recorded as abnormal production costs under U.S. GAAP. This includes costs related to our decision to maintain the 737 production infrastructure, including labor during the suspension and low rate production. As you may recall, this decision is part of our efforts to sustain the gains in the production system and supply chain quality and health made over the last several months.","We currently estimate these abnormal costs to be approximately $4 billion. These costs will be expensed as incurred, primarily in 2020, and you'll see these flow through earnings as period expense starting in the first quarter. Since the portion of these costs deemed abnormal will be the largest when the production rate is 0 and the rates are low, we expect expense to be front-end loaded.","During the quarter, we also reassessed our estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. This reassessment included updating estimates to reflect our most recent assumptions as well as latest information based on engagement with 737 customers. Based on our assessment, we added $2.6 billion to the recorded liability in the quarter. This brings the total cumulative impacts to $8.3 billion net of insurance.","As we've mentioned, we're addressing the impact individually customer by customer. We expect any concessions or other considerations to be revised over a number of years, and we continue to see the cash impact to be more front-end loaded in the first few years but, of course, will be dependent upon individual conversations with customers. In 2019, we reduced the liability balance by $1.4 billion through cash payments but also other in-kind considerations.","Looking forward, the key drivers of financial impact related to the 737 will continue to be the return to service time line and conditions; the delivery ramp-up, which will be dependent on how fast we can deliver the aircraft once the fleet returns to service and how fast our customers can accept aircraft; and the duration of the 737 production suspension and rate ramp profile; and discussions with customers regarding potential concessions and other considerations.","We expect our financial results to continue to be adversely impacted until we safely return the 737 MAX to service, resume deliveries to customers and ramp up production rates. We continue to perform detailed scenario planning around return to service and production rates, including analyzing the implications on our supply chain, customer fleet and deliveries to fully understand the range of financial outcomes. We're also taking actions to prudently manage our liquidity, increase our balance sheet flexibility, manage our spending and stay laser-focused on productivity. I'll talk more about that a little later.","Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 7. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue decreased to $7.5 billion during the quarter and operating margin declined to negative 38%, both reflecting 737 deliveries and additional $2.6 billion of estimated potential concession -- customer concessions and other considerations. BCA backlog includes 5,400 aircraft valued at $377 billion, equating to more than 6 years of production.","Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue decreased to $6 billion, reflecting lower volume across the portfolio as well as the impact of previously mentioned Commercial Crew charge, which affected revenue recognition on the program. BDS operating margin of 0.5% reflected a $410 million pretax charge to provision for the additional uncrewed mission for the Commercial Crew program as well as several performance items and the mix within the portfolio in the quarter. During the quarter, BDS won key contract awards worth $8 billion, and our backlog now stands at $64 billion with 29% from outside the U.S.","Let's now turn to Boeing Global Services results on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, Global Services revenue decreased to $4.6 billion, reflecting lower commercial service volume. Year-over-year growth of 8% is lower than we expected partially due to the impact of the 737 MAX grounding, which affected the timing of demand of some of our service offerings.","BGS operating margin of 14.7% reflect a noncash charge related to retirement of the Aviall brand as we consolidate our distribution businesses under the Boeing brand as well as mix of products and services in the quarter. We were partially offset by a onetime gain on a divestiture. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $6 billion, which brings its backlog now to $23 billion.","Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 10. As I mentioned, operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a negative $2.2 billion driven by lower 737 deliveries, lower advanced payments, higher inventories and timing of receipts and expenditures. We expect continued cash flow pressure from the MAX impacting until production stabilizes. Strong operating cash flow from other parts of the business and further balance sheet levers will help provide adequate liquidity during this time.","We also continue to look at all aspects of spending to ensure we have the right prioritization and sharpen our focus on operational excellence, including closely assessing the timing of noncritical expenditures. Additionally, we're accelerating key working capital initiatives to help navigate this difficult period.","During the fourth quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividend, and our share repurchase program remains on pause. Near term, managing our liquidity and balance sheet leverage are top priorities and will continue to be until the MAX deliveries resume, we execute the 737 production rate increases and see stability in the production system. But as Dave mentioned, we will also continue to make necessary investments in the business, in our people, new technology and better processes and tools.","Our debt level has been elevated during the grounding, and we are planning to immediately reduce it once our cash flow generation returns to a more normalized level. Again, we will continue to evaluate all available liquidity levers as we navigate the current challenges. Investing in our business and repaying debt will remain our cash deployment priority for the next few years.","Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 11. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities. We raised additional commercial paper in the quarter, increasing the debt balance to $2.6 billion and helping shore up our liquidity position as we work through the current MAX challenges. Our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing us with substantial borrowing capacity through capital markets access of our credit facility of $9.6 billion.","Additionally, we've received commitment from a syndicate of banks sufficient to entry into $12 billion term loan facility. Based on the strong demand, the size of the facility could exceed this amount when the transaction closes in February. We are mindful of the impacts the additional debt has on our credit ratings. Currently at A-, A3, but confident we have the sufficient balance sheet flexibility and operational levers to navigate this challenging time.","Our financials this year will continue to be negatively impacted by the MAX. Cash flow, in particular, will be more significantly impacted in 2020 than 2019. We expect the use of cash flow in 2020 to be greater than '19, primarily due to 737 MAX advanced payments will be lower in 2019 based on our latest 737 delivery assumptions.","As I mentioned previously, we're increasing our customer consideration liability and expect the cash impact to be higher this year. Also, due to the additional 787 production rate reduction, as I discussed, as well as our current 777X entry into service assumptions, widebody receipts will be a headwind in 2020.","Keep in mind, we'll continue to see expenditures on the 737 program despite the production suspension as we invest in the production system health to derisk our future production rate. And these investment decisions, including keeping our workforce in place and continuing to make payments to our supply chain for inventory, are examples of our focus on long-term stability but will require cash in the near term.","Given these headwinds and our current assumptions on 737 MAX return to service as well as future production and delivery rates, cash flow recovery is now expected to start until 2021. We are committed to providing you with additional updates on the MAX return to service progress and production rate plans as we have more information.","Once we have further clarity, we will schedule a follow-up investor and media conference call to discuss the financial implications and provide financial guidance, which will capture the puts and takes, including the impact of the most recent widebody changes.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for some closing comments.","David Calhoun","Greg, thanks. Thanks to everyone on the other end of this line. I want you to know I'm as excited as I can be about taking on this challenge. I wish the moment was different, but we can get through this moment and we will get through this moment. I'm confident in this airplane. The MAX is a sound airplane. We believe we're going to deliver the safest airplane in the sky, and we're committed to do just that and I know our regulator is as well.","So with that, and again, open this line up to questions. And I want to thank Greg for the last time since now we're partners. But at any rate, he has really stood tall in this big transition process, and I appreciate it.","Gregory Smith","Thanks, Dave.","David Calhoun","Thanks.","Gregory Smith","I appreciate it.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Thanks gentlemen. Can you hear me?","Gregory Smith","Yes, we can, Carter.","David Calhoun","We can.","Carter Copeland","Okay. I wondered if you might expand a little bit on the short comment you made about monitoring the market dynamic for the MAX and not having the value proposition change there. I mean, I guess, are you -- are we referring to sold aircraft or unsold aircraft? And I guess, more broadly, what's your level of confidence that longer term, MAX pricing won't be materially impacted by what you've seen? Or just can you expand on that comment for us?","Gregory Smith","Yes. No, Carter, look, I think first go to the backlog. And we've got 4,400 aircraft in backlog, and this has been a very challenging time obviously for our customers, but folks want the airplane. And the value proposition the airplane brings into the market is unchanged. So look, we're in a grounded period, and we realized the strain that's put on the customers. So we're monitoring that closely. But the value proposition of the franchise still remains intact.","And like I said, Dave said, the focus right now, safely get this thing back in the air, and we're going to do it one airplane at a time, as Dave has said, and ensure that we have this production system stable as we move up and delivering on our commitments to our customers.","David Calhoun","Yes. In the first couple of weeks, when I've talked with most of our large customers, they get to tell me whatever they want. They do still believe in the value prop of this airplane. They believe in everything about the airplane, and it means a lot, but I've heard it firsthand.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from UBS.","Myles Walton","Dave, you're coming to the table with a decade of experience seeing the company from the inside. And I just wonder how you've been able to step outside of that familiarity, take an orthogonal view, kind of a different view of what went wrong and reorient everything so that this isn't maybe just changing tone and\/or repairing relationships. But maybe it is, or if there's something more needed, how you've been able to step out of that familiarity role.","David Calhoun","Well, let me maybe answer that question a little differently because I get a lot of media attention around the idea that I'm somehow an insider. What if I change that a little bit? What if I told you I simply had a front row seat to everything you saw? And so all the things I read and see and hear, make no mistake, they all have an impact, they have an effect, and I get a front row seat. And ultimately, our Board took action as a result of it. And now I'm the one sitting in the operating seat.","So I don't want it to be lost on anybody. I know we've got things to work on and changes to make. I treasure my relationship across the industry with customers and with regulators and others. And when they tell me something, I believe them. I always fault to believing them. And so the work we have to do internally to restore all those confidences and, yes, modify our culture, you can bet I'm working on it. I don't think I see it any differently than you probably do. I might put a nuance here and there, but I think I know the job at hand and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I got to restore trust, confidence and faith in The Boeing Company.","Myles Walton","And from that orthogonal view, do you think there is a deficiency in competitive narrowbody offering in the market?","David Calhoun","Say that again?","Myles Walton","Do you think there's a deficiency in your competitive narrowbody offering in the market today?","David Calhoun","Yes. No, I don't. I know that in airplane type by type, sometimes you got to lead, sometimes you don't. But in the family and ultimately the performance of this MAX and the feedback I get from our customers, I'm not actually worried about that. All that said, we're in the airplane development business, and we're going to stay in the airplane development business. So we're going to keep looking at what the next one needs to be.","I want to make sure everyone understands that me not immediately signing up to the NMA is not -- is me not wanting to do new airplanes. We'll do one. And I don't want to even suggest or convey to you that it's anywhere near the narrowbody fleet we have today. I don't see big deficiencies there.","On the other hand, I'm going to -- I'm just simply going to listen to customers and markets. It's been over 2 years since we started that whole discussion. I'm going to refresh it every way I can think of, along with my new commercial airplane leader, and then we'll get out with new news. But honestly, right now, it's all about the MAX, getting it up. And yes, I believe in the product.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.","Ronald Epstein","Maybe a big picture question for you. You've mentioned a couple of times in -- when you talked to the press before that you're focusing on the culture of the company, right? And so my question is how do you change the culture, it's a big organization? And particularly when you've got a workforce in some places, it might be a bit demoralized given some of the texts and things that went around. I mean that's something we can infer. And since you had this front row seat on the Board of what happened, and this is a question I asked your predecessor that he never really answered, how did we get here?","David Calhoun","That's a big question. Yes. So first of all, let's go back to what happened. So the MCAS design failed to deal with a boundary condition in an environment we should have known something about. The regulators made the same mistake. There are engineering disciplines that you can and should apply to that question that I think can get fixed relatively quickly. I don't think culture contributed to that miss. I think simply disciplines did.","The question with respect to training recommendations and the horrible IMs that people would like to think all of Boeing writes, really was relegated to a relatively small group of folks, but it wasn't detected. The system didn't apparently listen or watch for things like that, and it didn't react appropriately. And I have to do everything in my power to make sure going forward that it does.","Listening starts with leadership, and it starts with me. And I think we need to do more of it. And then slowly, steadily, you change culture. People want to believe in that, and they will. They are all good engineers. They are all -- they all follow disciplined processes. And let's not mistake, this plane, this 777X, tested more technology, tested our patience, tested our disciplines in every way you can think of. And we did it successfully on that first flight, and we will move it through a certification process that will be more rigorous than history has ever seen. And we'll get to that finish line, and we'll fly it. And if you looked at that product and sat near or in or flew in it, you'd be impressed with everything about Boeing, I promise you.","So this thing isn't entirely broken. Leaders have a massive role to play in setting culture, setting the stage for how to fix a culture. And I have to demonstrate that one step at a time, every inch of the way. I don't have to convince anybody that safety is in the best interest of every stakeholder and including investors. It is. It's perfectly obvious to everyone. So I have no convincing to do on that front. I will have no competing priorities as we step forward. And so I hate to reduce it to things that's simple, but I think that's what it's all about.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","We talked about clearly a lot of challenges with the MAX grounding, the 787 rate cut and 777 potential delays. I guess how do we think about the longer-term implications of what the Commercial Airplane segment looks like in 2022, whether that's market dynamics, touching on Carter's question, impact of charges and some of that offset by manufacturing processes at Boeing? If you could maybe talk about what 2022 looks like.","Gregory Smith","Yes. Yes. Well, I think on the widebody side, we talked about kind of where we see the rate profiles today. And I think, as we said, we think it's prudent, considering the outlook and some of the global, I'll say, trade dynamics and the timing associated with taking a trade deal to a point of actually a delivery in a skyline, we still got some steps to work our way through. So I think we're being prudent here and looking at the marketplace in that time and moderating those rates.","Now having said all that, there's still great demand for the widebody franchises, and you see that in the backlog and you see that in the market outlook. So I think the potential there going forward continues to be strong.","On the narrowbody, in 2022 under these assumptions we talked about, you're certainly getting back up in rate, but all these investments we've been making during this time of grounding, Sheila, and I think if you saw the line today versus what you saw even a year ago, there's been tremendous activity put in place in tools and processes to have stability for the long term. That ultimately is going to help the overall franchise, our predictability on delivering to our customers on time and a healthier supply chain as a result of it.","So that's been a huge level of effort today. But let's face it, that's a long-term play, but it's a really critical one to get in place during this time. So we have that stability and predictability, again, on our delivery profile and then ultimately on our financials.","And then during this, we mentioned, we're still making investments. And we're making investments in the productivity as well as on the R&D side. So we're being prudent about it, and we're being -- we're sharpening the pencils. But that, again, is really focusing on the long-term franchise that we have and the potential franchises to come.","David Calhoun","I'd like to follow on. I like everything about the portfolio of products that we field, widebody and narrowbody. The trade deal matters a lot. And I believe if it is what I think it is and our Chinese customers come back and we rebuild the relationship we've always had and enjoyed with them, I think that is a major stimulus. Secondly, this industry has been supply chain limited and constrained. And I believe that some of the actions have been taken on Boeing's side of that process. During this pause, some of the readiness questions that we -- I believe, are being fixed. I think that supply chain will begin to alleviate itself, and I don't think we'll be as supply-constrained going forward as we have been to date. And now I'm trying to speak for the industry, not just for us. So I am optimistic from lots of angles, but I think those are the big ones.","Operator","Our next question then will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.","Douglas Harned","The one thing I'm certain, Dave, is that a decade ago, we could not have predicted we'd be having this conversation. The thing I'd like to look at is the challenges you're looking at BCA. And in the short term, as you said, you're spending time with regulators and customers to support MAX certification. And then over the course of the year, you've also got to deliver on the restart operationally of the MAX, improve efficiency on the 787 as rate comes down, progress on the 777X, and then as you talked about, decide on how Boeing is going to look at what it does next. And I would think you wouldn't want to wait too long to see how you want to compete against Airbus in the back half of the decade.","So with all of this on your plate, new leaders across BCA, so how are you prioritizing your time? And when we get to the end of the year, what would you consider a successful outcome on sort of short-, medium- and long-term issues there?","David Calhoun","Well, one, Doug -- so thanks for the question. As you said, I remember looking at this chessboard all the way back in 2000. Didn't turn out actually as different with the exception of the MAX pickup, as you might think. We are on a very long cycle world. Getting decisions right is way more important than getting them fast. So I make no mistake about that.","The MAX itself has to be my priority over the course of this year. It's important from a lot of points of view. One, the economics of our institution rely in a significant way on it. Rebuilding the relationships with our customers and our regulator in the process of getting the MAX back up is also critically important. We will always be dependent on those relationships.","And then finally, with respect to new airplane development, I don't think anybody will enjoy working on that more than I will. I just want to get exactly the right airplane for the market that's out there. And I want to refresh our view as to what it is. The last 2.5 years have been tumultuous. It has tested some of the -- in my view, some of the edges of demand on all types of airplanes. And so we had to learn from that. But I will not hesitate to move forward on it. And I think creating competitive advantage in that next airplane, I think I have more tools to work with than I've ever had in my previous life. So at any rate, I have confidence in all of that.","But I don't want to -- going back to your original question, I don't want to confuse anybody in the process. The fact that I will be focused on the MAX, the fact that I will talk about that almost exclusively across Boeing over the course of this coming year is not an indication that I'm going to start anything going forward. It is simply a necessity for us. We got to get it out there, and we have to get our confidence back and get on the front of our feet. And so, again, that's mostly what you'll hear from me, but don't get confused by it, please.","Douglas Harned","And if I can, when you look at this year, certainly, financially, this will be a rough year. But when you put all this together, do you have goals you're thinking of and how this should translate into financial goals in 2021 or 2022? Or is it too early to think that way? How do you treat that?","David Calhoun","Yes, it's too early to think that way. While I might conjure up a notion here in my head, I'm going to listen to an awful lot of people before I do. And I'm also going to be certain that all the investments that are required to stand up our engineering function, have everybody regain their confidence and, again, simply believe in the safety of every airplane that The Boeing Company puts forward, I don't want to -- I'm not going to jump to that conclusion now. I'm simply going to get through this moment, restore our confidence and then projections will follow.","Operator","Our next question then will come from the line of David Strauss from Barclays.","David Strauss","I wanted to discuss the supply chain and how you're approaching the supply chain during this call. Greg, you mentioned some of this $4 billion, I guess, is to support the supply chain during the halt. How overall are you approaching -- it doesn't sound like you're telling everyone to halt. Who are you not telling to halt? How much financial support are you going to provide to the supply chain or do you think is needed for the supply chain during this?","Gregory Smith","Yes. No, David, I would tell you, it's a one-on-one engagement, and not just them but their suppliers. And so I'll say kind of tiered-down suppliers and understanding the impact that this is having on them and then what levers do we all have in order to help get them through this. And again, with the objective that we're playing a long game, and we want them to come out of this healthier, quite frankly.","So each one of them is a little bit different about how we're working and how we're engaging and what type of assistance is needed. Everybody, as you know, has been at a little bit of a different level of production through this. So there's different levels of inventory. So I would tell you, if you went around supplier by supplier, you're going to get a variation of what their build rate is or where they are in inventory. But the engagement with them, I would say, has been very good by our supply chain folks and keeping them informed and trying to get ahead of this, and again, making smart decisions and assisting where we can assist. So, yes, we've got some provisioning in here to help them, and we'll continue to do that, again, with the long-term objective. We need them to be healthy. We want them to be healthy, and we're playing this for the long term.","So even some of these productivity things that we've we talked about on the 37, the supply chain team has taken those into the supply chain that, again, ultimately will make them healthier, more stable, more predictable, which is going to be key to our production rates going forward.","David Calhoun","I might just add, the -- their rate in return in these early months will be ahead of ours, and that's by design simply because we want the protection in our factories so that we never travel work. That's actually an important discipline that we will reinstall with our MAX line. And they will be the beneficiary to that as they, as I said, accelerated at a faster rate.","David Strauss","Can I ask one clarifying question, Dave? I think you mentioned that you see certification -- or for planning purposes, accounting purposes, certification and deliveries resuming in the middle of the year. Or is it cert and then I assume some sort of lag between cert and then deliveries resuming?","Gregory Smith","Yes. We've got a kind of time in the midyear time frame, Dave. But like we said, it's going to be a very moderated, slow, I'll say, prudent ramp-up. And as we talked about, priority 1, once the grounding is lifted, will be to start getting those airplanes off the tarmac, the inventoried aircraft, and then slowly bringing that line up in a very methodical way and monitoring stability each step of the way. And when we reach our objectives of stability, then we'll make the next move. But that will kind of be the priority and the time frame associated with that.","Now we will -- currently, we're looking at starting the line earlier than the actual lifting of the grounding. But again, think of that as a risk mitigator. We'll look at that during that period of time and our confidence level of getting the grounding lifted, and then we'll start to slowly bring resources back onto the program, keeping in mind that these lines are empty. They're going to be empty. They're empty right now. And so we'll start in position 1, but again, very methodical, start bringing the crews over, get stability and then slowly bring them back into play. But we'll make that decision as we get closer to return to service, but that's the game plan that we see it today.","David Calhoun","And if the question relates to this certificates by airplane, which, of course, is going to be a new and very, I think, tightly run process, of course, that involves us and the FAA. And I think we've provided for plenty of room for that process to unfold methodically and not with too much pressure on it. So that's important in the way we've laid out our time line.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Jon Raviv from Citi.","Jonathan Raviv","In the context of cash being a bigger use in '20 versus '19, certainly understand the moving pieces in BCA, can you talk about perhaps some of the cash generation and the state of the businesses outside of Boeing Commercial, which I think is still a relevant topic here?","Gregory Smith","Yes, yes. On BDS, slightly lower than last year. And I'd say a lot of that is timing. It's just around receipt timing and award timing. But outside of that, from an operating -- core operating performance, pretty much on par. But we'll see a little bit of headwind this year. And on BGS, a little bit of headwind but less than BDS, and again, a lot of that is just timing. It's nothing more than that. The core performance-wise or the conversion to earnings to cash, it remains pretty consistent with 2019. But again, the bulk of the variance in cash will be at BCA.","Operator","We have a question from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak","I wanted to ask about 787 supply and demand and then also the margins given the changes there. Do you have visibility into the order pace stepping up into the kind of mid-100s per year for a while there? Because even at the 12 a month or the 10 a month and you're still building over 100, but the order rate has been below 100. So I know China is an input but not -- I don't know if China is planning to order that many widebodies that would fill that gap sustainably. And then, Greg, on the margin, on the cash margin, you've talked about being able to continue to increase it just at a slower pace at 12 versus 14. Is that still true or not at 10?","Gregory Smith","Yes, yes. Obviously, not at the same, I'll say, slope as it was, but we still continue to see improved cash margin over the profile for all the reasons we've discussed before between supply chain, mix and our own productivity. That story is unchanged. But again, the amount of growth over that period has moderated obviously under these lower rates.","On the supply-demand, China is a big deal. Don't mistake it. It's a big deal, and that's a big play in these production rates. Outside of that, as you've seen, when we've been going head-to-head with the 787, we've been winning the marketplace. The airplane continues to bring great economics into the field. And the long-term market outlook continues. When you look at the 20-year forecast, there's still a lot of widebodies and more replacement in there. And the 787 family, I think, is extremely well suited to address that market. And I'd say the one that is probably underserved at this point is the 787-10. I think as we see that replacement market, I'll say coming more within our skyline, I think we're going to continue to see more demand for the -10. It's just an incredible value proposition and machine for our customers, especially considering what is going to be replacing in the market.","So China, big watch item. Outside of that, do we have work to do on the skyline? Absolutely. And we're going to play that out one campaign at a time. And we'll continue to monitor, again, our lead times and make whatever adjustments are needed. But as we see it today, we think this is a prudent thing to do, and we have good confidence in the 10 to go into 12 a month.","Noah Poponak","Do you expect the China 787 order to come out of Phase 1 specifically? Or do we need to get past Phase 1?","Gregory Smith","I don't know at this point. No. I know -- we know that airplanes are a part of the -- certainly, a big part of the trade deal with China. And we'll get into those details when -- between the government and our customers, but we're actually engaged with them. And when we get more clarity on that, then we'll provide it. But at this point, we're -- we don't have model clarity.","David Calhoun","There's no reason to believe it has to wait for Phase 2.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","So I realize, obviously, FAA is the decider here. You've made that very clear. But would you care to -- in the spirit of transparency, would you care to share your accounting assumptions for the MAX rate ramp 6 and 12 months after recertification? And then the second part of the question is how can you get comfortable potentially resuming production before certification given all the head fakes that we've had over the last few months or so?","Gregory Smith","Yes. Well, maybe on that one, I'll just, again, put a finer point on what the game plan is as we see it. Don't think of that as just turning the line back on. We're going to slowly bring crews back, but we're going to have to have a confidence level -- a higher confidence level in that exact time frame on return to service because, obviously, we don't want to build more airplanes and store them.","So that's the game plan as it sits today. But again, remember, the line is empty. So it's going to be in the first position, and that's going to take some time to slowly bring that up. But obviously, we'll have cert flight behind us, which is a big milestone, and that will give us more confidence in our, I'll say, kind of slow introduction of the production line. So that's the game plan on that.","As far as rate increases going forward, Hunter, I would just say, look, we got to get this thing back. We got to start delivering on the -- off the ramp and think of the rate increases one step at a time, or as Dave has said to many of us, one airplane at a time. We're going to keep work in position, and we're going to ensure we have stability and equally, if maybe not more important, the supply chain has stability. We'll make the next rate increase. So we've certainly made some assumptions in there, but we are going to do this one at a time. And again, really playing the long game here to ensure we've got stability that is, I'll say, institutionalized, not just with us but all suppliers, and then that will ultimately have a much more predictable production, I'll say, cadence to it and predictability and delivering to our customers.","So we'll keep you posted on our rate plans going forward. But at this time, that's kind of the game plan, and we'll give you more clarity once we -- like I said, once we provide guidance and I'll say the moving pieces that will support that guidance.","David Calhoun","I just will reiterate because I think it does matter. That philosophy, one at a time, is reflected in what we have built into this set of financials and our expectations. So I hope we can go one at a time at a rate that exceeds those expectations, but we're not going to think about it that way. We're simply going to get to every next airplane.","Operator","Please go ahead.","Maurita Sutedja","That concludes our question-and-answer session.

In order to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to hear their prepared remarks, Dennis and Greg will be repeating those marks in their entirety on this call, after which we will take your questions.","In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's slide presentation through our website at www.boeing.com, and we will provide a copy of the earlier remarks.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thank you, Troy, and good afternoon. I'm going to begin by discussing our solid 2015 operating performance, then provide an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail.","As most of you know, 2016 is a milestone year for Boeing, marking our 100th year in business. Over the past century successive generations of exceptionally talented and dedicated Boeing employees have passed the torch of ingenuity and innovation to help build the world's largest aerospace company and shape the course of human history along the way. It's our privilege and responsibility in the years ahead to preserve and extend this incredible legacy. And we intend, as we did in 2015, to take Boeing to even greater heights in the second century of aerospace leadership.","In 2015 we continued to deliver on our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the company. We reported record revenue, solid core earnings per share, and strong cash flow. We continue to make strategic investments in our people, products, and services to strengthen and grow our commercial airplanes, and defense, space and security businesses. And throughout the year, we demonstrated our commitment to providing increasing returns and significant cash to our shareholders.","For the full year, we repurchased 47 million shares for $6.75 billion and paid $2.5 billion in dividends. In December, our Board of Directors approved a new $14 billion share repurchase authorization and a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. This disciplined and balanced cash deployment strategy reflects continued confidence in our large and diverse backlog, and our strong product portfolio and an overall healthy outlook in the global aerospace and defense industry.","Now turning to our core operating performance for the year. Boeing Commercial Airplanes recorded revenue of $66 billion, thanks in large part to an industry-record 762 deliveries last year, which extended our market share leadership in airplane deliveries to a fourth consecutive year.","Airplane order activity was healthy as we captured 768 net orders. This further supported our robust backlog of nearly 5,800 airplanes, or about seven years of production at current rates.","Other key milestones included the rollout of the first 737 MAX, achieving 90% engineering design release on the 787-10, and firm configuration of the 777X. We also began initial introduction of new automation technology on the 777 production line. This technology will be matured on the current line before being transitioned over to the 777X.","A noteworthy milestone for our industry and others and for large and small U.S. exporters alike, was the five-year extension of the U.S. Export Import Bank. This reauthorization of the bank restores competitive balance in international trade and enables American exporters to compete on a level playing field in tough global markets. These developments in sum help to further de-risk our business going forward.","We expect the tentative labor agreement reached earlier this month between Boeing and our Puget Sound based engineering union will have the same effect. With a slate of market-leading development programs underway for our customers, this agreement will provide six years of labor stability while recognizing and rewarding our engineering and technical workforce for their important contributions to our ongoing success.","Boeing Defense, Space & Security had a very strong year with solid revenue, healthy margins and progress on critical program milestones. 2015 milestones include the first flight of the KC-46A tanker and its first international sale to Japan, the first EA-18G delivery to the Australian Air Force, the fourth and final AEW&C delivery to Turkey, the selection of the 747-8 to replace the current U.S. Presidential aircraft, and we completed flight software demonstration on the Commercial Crew Program.","2016 is off to a strong start as well with the KC-46 tanker successfully transferring fuel in-flight to an F-16 in just the past few days, a very important accomplishment that is an essential step forward and begins our milestone sea testing that will lead to a low rate initial production decision this spring.","Despite the challenging defense environment of the last several years, our team continues to adapt to the shifting dynamics while maintaining its strong performance and investing to be ready for an eventual upturn in the market. In summary, our Boeing team produced another strong year of operating performance and cash generation and we made further strides in de-risking our business, all of which positions us well and increases our momentum for 2016 and beyond.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide three. We continue to see a generally healthy commercial airplane marketplace driven by improving airline profitability, solid passenger traffic growth, and meaningful replacement. Traffic data for 2015 illustrates the strength of the passenger market with global passenger traffic increasing 7% for the year, which was above the 10-year average.","In contrast, as we highlighted in our rate reduction announcement last week on the 747-8, the global cargo market recovery stalled during 2015 with the air freight traffic growing a modest 2% during the year. We remain confident in the long-term recovery in the cargo market and the upcoming replacement cycle where we see approximately 240 large freighters that will be over 20 years old by 2019.","While overall airplane demand remains healthy, as always, we will continue to keep a watchful eye on evolving market conditions to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. According to IATA, the airline industry is expected to have another record year in 2016 as earnings are projected to rise 10% to $36 billion fueled by lower oil prices, strong passenger demand, and airline efficiencies. Additionally, passenger traffic in 2016 is forecast to grow 7%, and cargo is forecast to increase 3%. In addition, global GDP is forecast to increase 2.7% in 2016, a healthy level for our industry.","We also continued to see strong growth in Chinese airline traffic. In 2015, passenger traffic in China increased 15% compared to GDP growth of 7%, a steady trend we have seen for the past five years. Based on today's Chinese passenger travel, we see the market as currently underserved by approximately 1,000 aircraft. With the middle class population forecast to grow 10% annually through 2025, the market opportunity is significant. Over the next 20 years, we see the Chinese market needing over 6,300 new aircraft.","Specifically related to oil, notwithstanding a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one, and we have seen airlines in the past efficiently adjust to similar market conditions. In a period such as today with higher passenger demand and lower oil prices, airlines buy new aircraft more for growth rather than replace older assets.","Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. This ongoing demand coupled with our sizable backlog of nearly 5,800 aircraft which is balanced geographically and across customer operating models, reinforces our planned production rate increases and we believe positions us for significant revenue, earnings and cash growth in the years ahead.","The rapid return on investment from new, more efficient airplanes remains a compelling factor in purchase decisions in a fuel environment that is well below the 15-year average as evidenced by the purchase decisions announced just last week by Southwest and United Airlines. As a reminder, in addition to far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, our new technologically advanced aircraft also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience, and greater range that grows market opportunities by allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.","We're also seeing further strength in the aircraft financing market as financiers continue to see commercial aircraft as a good investment. As I alluded to earlier, airplane order activity and customer discussions are continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. For 2016, we anticipate a year of healthy order activity and are targeting a book-to-bill of approximately one. Supporting our view is the fact that deferral requests and cancellations also remain well below the historical average. Overall, our commercial airplane outlook remains positive as we expect a combination of growth and replacement to drive the need for 38,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.","Turning to individual BCA programs, given the 737's robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders and continued healthy global demand, we have decided to move ahead with an additional production rate increase in 2019 to 57 aircraft per month. As we announced previously, we plan to raise production from 42 a month now to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 a month in 2018. We have long maintained a disciplined and conservative approach in assessing future production rate increases. And our confidence in the ongoing market demand for the fuel and operating efficiency advantages of the 737 is very high.","Demand also remains strong for the 777X with a backlog of 306 aircraft from six customers. On the 777, we captured 101 orders over the last two years. And earlier this month, we booked orders for another six from Air China, putting us off to a good start in 2016. Our 777 backlog stands at 224 aircraft.","Regarding the transition to the 777X, we indicated last year that we did not anticipate the production rate on the program going below seven per month. In solidifying our production plan over the past few months, we can confirm that view with a timeline for shifting to a 777 production rate of seven per month starting in 2017 to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X. In terms of production slots, we are sold out on the 777 in 2016. At the seven per month rate in 2017, we are approximately 80% sold out and feel good about customer demand to fill the remaining slots given the airplane's unique and recognized value proposition. Furthermore for 2018, we currently are in a healthy position in the balance of firm and sold slots.","On the 787 program, we captured 71 net orders for the year, which further shows the healthy market demand for this compelling wide body airplane. The 787's backlog of nearly 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month later this decade. We have now delivered 366 787s to date, including more than 70 Dash 9s.","The top and bottom line outlook for our commercial airplane business remains strong as we continue to execute on our robust backlog with planned rate increases on the 737, 787 and 767, smoothly transition 737 production to the max, and deliver on our development programs, such as the 777X and the 787-10.","Now turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid support for our major programs. The enacted fiscal year 2016 budget contains increases over 2015 for many of our core programs, including the P-8 Poseidon, the KC-46A tanker, Apache and Chinook helicopters, GMD missile defense, commercial crew and space launch system. The budget also added 12 F-18 variant aircraft. The bipartisan budget agreement provided the framework for these results and will also bring greater stability to the fiscal year 2017 Congressional budget process.","International demand for our offerings remains healthy. In particular related to rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services.","During the fourth quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 33% of our revenue and 40% of our current backlog. The strength of our Defense & Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation, along with our continued focus on affordability and productivity through our ongoing market-based affordability and partnering for success efforts. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for our customers such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and recognizance. Furthermore, we remain focused on investing in BDS future franchise programs which represent critical capabilities for our customers and substantial business opportunities.","While we await the outcome of the long range strike evaluation, we continue to leverage capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, J Star's recapitalization, new class, and other important opportunities where we are driving new levels of capability and affordability for our customers.","In summary, our strategies are aligned to the realities and the opportunities of our markets. And our teams are focused on delivering solid operating performance.","Now over to Greg for our financial results and our 2016 guidance.","Gregory Smith","Thanks, Dennis, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to slide four and we'll discuss our full year results.","Revenue for the year was a record $96 billion, reflecting a 6% increase from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business.","Core earnings per share totaled $7.72 for the full year, reflecting the strong operating performance across the company that was offset by the $1.61 for the second quarter KC-46 tanker charge, and the fourth quarter 747 program charge. Operating cash flow for the year was also strong at $9.4 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries and solid core operating performance.","Moving now to our quarterly results on slide five. Fourth quarter revenue was $23.6 billion, driven largely by solid commercial deliveries and healthy defense revenues. Core operating margins were 5.3%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses, which were offset by the previously-announced $885 million pre-tax charge on the 747 program. The charge reflects the slow recovery in the cargo market that required us to account for the market impact and lower production rates going forward. Fourth quarter core earnings per share was $1.60 on solid core operating performance, but again, offset by the 747 charge.","Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide six. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplane revenue decreased slightly to $16.1 billion, due to timing of airplane deliveries. Commercial Airplane operating margins were largely impacted by the 747 charge, higher planned research and development spending, and the timing of airplane deliveries, all of which was partially offset by continued solid core operating performance and timing of period costs in the quarter.","For the full year, Commercial Airplanes revenue was a record $66 billion, an increase of 10% as we successfully executed on our backlog. Commercial Airplanes captured $21 billion of net orders during the quarter to a backlog now of stands of $432 billion and nearly 5,800 aircraft.","For the full year, we captured $57 billion on 768 net orders. Specifically on 787, the team delivered a record 135 787s and ramped up production on 787-9. We've now delivered 74 787-9 aircraft, and as planned, 787-9 deliveries will notably exceed 787-8 deliveries in 2016.","We also continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we implement additional production efficiencies. On the 787-8 we've seen a decline in unit costs of approximately 40% over the last 240 deliveries. And, furthermore, 787-9 unit costs declined approximately 30% since the first delivery.","Consistent with our expectations, the 787 program also became cash positive in the fourth quarter. 787 deferred production increased $201 million to $28.5 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing unit cost reductions. We expect about the same level of deferred growth in the first quarter. For the full year, the deferred balance \u2013 the deferred production balance is forecasted to be flat year-over-year.","Based on this progress, our production schedule and planned productivity investments, we continue to anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12-per-month production rate in 2016; no change to this fundamental milestone. We remain on track to achieve the 12-per-month 787 delivery rate in mid-2016, with suppliers already operating at that production level. We still have work ahead of us on the 787 as we remain focused on solid day-to-day execution and risk reduction while improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward, and the team remains focused on these priorities.","Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on slide seven, fourth quarter revenue in our Defense business increased 3% to $7.8 billion and operating margins increased to a record 12.4% due to strong performance across the portfolio. Revenue at Boeing Military Aircraft increased 7% to $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter resulting from higher volume and delivery mix. BMA operating margins were 13.7% in the quarter driven by solid operating performance and the benefit of higher volumes and mix.","Network & Space Systems revenues declined to $2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower satellite volume, and NS&S generated operating margins of 8.3%. Global Services & Support reported a 9% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $2.6 billion on an AEW&C delivery and higher aircraft modernization and sustainment volume. GS&S generated strong operating margin of 13.8% driven by favorable contract mix and performance. Defense, Space & Security reported $7 billion of new business in the quarter and the backlog stands at $58 billion, of which 40% represents customers from outside the United States.","Turning now to slide eight, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $3.1 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by solid operating performance across both businesses. Again, operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $9.4 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance, and our continued efforts to drive disciplined cash management.","With regard to capital deployment, we paid $608 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 5 million shares for $750 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2015 repurchase activity to 47 million shares for $6.75 billion.","As Dennis mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization to $14 billion and an increase to our dividend of another 20%. That's up 125% in three years, and over the same period, we have lowered our share count by approximately 10% through the repurchase of nearly 120 million shares. We expect to complete the $14 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next two to three years.","Our capital deployment strategy demonstrates the strength of our backlog and the confidence in our business going forward. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priority for us.","Moving now to cash and debt balances on slide nine, we ended the quarter with $12.1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash position continues to provide strong liquidity and positions us well going forward. This financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key areas of our business, return cash to shareholders, and again, execute on our cash deployment strategies going forward.","Turning now to slide 10, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. Our outlook for 2016 reflects solid core operating performance while reflecting the near-term investments needed to support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity.","Revenue for 2016 is forecast to be between $93 billion and $95 billion reflecting the planned transition to the 737 MAX, lower F\/A-18 and C-17 volume, and reduced 747 production and timing of deliveries. We continue to see revenue growth over the remainder of the decade with seven more commercial production rate increases planned as we deliver on our robust backlog. Core earnings per share guidance for 2016 is set to be between $8.15 and $8.35 per share. Our 2016 Commercial Airplane revenue guidance is set to be between $64 billion and $65 billion.","The 2016 commercial delivery guidance is between 740 and 745 and 745 airplanes. This reflects the decrease in 747 deliveries, driven by the market and resulting production rate decision we talked about earlier. It also reflects the 737 transition to the MAX that we continue to build test airplanes and produce units for 2017 delivery upon certification. And we also see lower 767 deliveries as we ramp up on the tanker program, again in preparation for 2017 certification and delivery. We expect Commercial Airplane deliveries to increase in 2017 as we deliver on our planned production rate increases.","Specifically related to 787 deliveries, as I mentioned earlier, we are currently on plan to increase the production rate to 12 per month by mid-2016. However, 787 deliveries for 2016 will be in line with 2015 levels due to the timing of customer deliveries.","Commercial Airplane operating margin guidance is approximately 9% on improved operating performance, offset by the diluted impact of higher planned research and development spending, lower volume on 737 MAX transition, and higher 787 revenue, combined with further investments that support future business growth.","Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2016 is between $28.5 billion and $29.5 billion, reflecting the continued challenging defense DOD environment. And going forward we expect tanker revenue to increase as we enter into full rate production. We also see long-term growth driven by P-8, services, international rotorcraft and space, along with the potential future franchise programs that Dennis mentioned earlier.","Operating margin guidance for our Defense business is set to be greater than 10%, reflecting continued productivity efforts, offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix.","Supporting our strategic portfolio announcements, we expect research and development spending for 2016 to be approximately $3.6 billion with about 75% related to BCA, primarily driven by the planned increases in 777X development, while BDS will continue to invest in key strategic opportunities.","We expect operating cash flow for 2016 to be approximately $10 billion, reflecting healthy deliveries, strong operating performance and continued 787 productivity. This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax payments and timing of international C-17 receipts that affected 2015 cash flow.","Capital spending guidance for 2016 is set to be approximately $2.8 billion, driven by the new 777X facilities and equipment, expansion of our Boeing South Carolina to support 787 rate increases, and continued investments to support future growth and productivity. Consistent with our prior years and given the seasonality of our business as we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be the lowest of the year. Core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full-year earnings. And Q1 cash flow is forecasted to be at near breakeven, again driven by timing of receipts and expenditures.","The drivers behind our long-term year-over-year cash flow story are unchanged. We continue to expect strong core operating performance, improved 787 productivity, working capital efficiencies, and increasing production over the remainder of the decade. While we remain watchful of the current market conditions, healthy passenger traffic, continued aircraft replacement demand, and the compelling value proposition our aircraft provides confident in our backlog. This is combined with the continued progress in de-risking our business and accelerating productivity efforts. We will continue long-term cash flow growth and increase value to all of our stakeholders.","Now I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some final thoughts.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thank you, Greg. Let me close by saying I remain humbled and privileged to be leading this team and company as we celebrate our centennial year and began our second century. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team, 2015 was another year of solid core operating performance where we delivered on our critical strategic initiatives and further de-risked our business.","We also continued to convert our robust backlog into cash, and we met our promises by returning more than $9 billion to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Furthermore, we invested in our people and innovation to maintain and grow our competitive advantage while also continuing to build out capacity to support future production rate increases.","Collectively, our actions strengthen our position as the world's leading aerospace company and provide tremendous momentum for 2016 and beyond. Our priorities going forward can be framed by two overarching objectives. First, to continue building strength on strength to deliver on our existing plans and commitments and improve them where needed, and second, to stretch ourselves beyond those plans and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts to achieve our full potential.","Achieving both objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production, delivering on our development programs, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, driving to world-class levels of productivity and performance through the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth and to maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which is aimed to position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and create ever-increasing value for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.","Now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first on the line is Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. I don't know whether we should talk a little bit about gallows humor for a moment, but I won't go there, gentlemen. I was hoping maybe we'd get a different outcome on the second time we heard the call. But maybe we could talk about cash flow. And I want to put it in context for half a second. You've stuck to the plan on deferred on the 78. And that should be a fairly impressive improvement year-over-year, call it $2 billion in rough numbers. Yet, and then you also raised the dividend fairly significantly in the fourth quarter. And you have a plan, typically, I think it is to buy back about or distribute to shareholders about 80% of your cash flow. So there seems to be a little bit of a disconnect there. And I hate to ask you to be a little bit granular on this, Greg, but could you walk through some of the moving pieces, please?","Gregory Smith","On operating cash, Howard?","Howard Rubel","Yes, please.","Gregory Smith","Yeah, I mean if you look at kind of walking from 2015 to 2016, obviously, improved performance as you indicated, improved performance, specifically on 787 cash. Some of the things that I'll say, kind of a headwind going into 2016 offsetting some of that, is certainly higher cash tax payments as we improve our unit cost and performance on the 787. So we'll have some of that headwind in this year. And remember last year, we had a lot of C-17 receipts as we sold the bulk of the final aircraft. And, obviously, we've got one left that we won't get those receipts this year. And then just continuing to build inventory on the tanker as we get ready to deliver that in 2017. And as Dennis indicated, we've had a very successful milestone there recently. So that's going well.","And then, of course, you've got the MAX transition going on. So those are some of the big moving pieces. And at the same time, the long term kind of view on cash flow remains unchanged, Howard. We expect that to continue to grow. That's driven by, again, the improved productivity but also the production rates that we've committed to. As Dennis indicated, we're going up on 37 beyond what we described earlier, up to 57 a month in 2019. But we also have a number of other rate increases in there on the 37 building to that, as well as 787, as I said, tracking well to 12 a month, with a plan to go to 14. So as we look at it over the long term, we don't see a different view.","As far as committing to return cash to shareholders, as you indicated, we have $14 billion of authorization, and we plan to use it as we have the prior authorization. And we're committed to returning cash to shareholders in the fashion that you've seen over the last couple of years going forward.","Howard Rubel","Okay. Thank you.","Gregory Smith","You're welcome.","Operator","And next go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good afternoon. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the production rate moves you've done, and in particular, the effects that they've had or will have on the booking rates in terms of margins.","Dennis Muile","Yeah.","Myles Walton","With particular on the 777 given your current program effectively extends only for the current generation. So if you can walk through the 47 cut, the 777 cut, what it means to the margins, and then maybe the 37 and wrap it all into if there were any moves on the 87. Thanks.","Dennis Muile","Yeah, the production rates that we talked about, the 47 coming down and the 777 going to seven a month in 2017, that's all in this quarter's booking rate.","Myles Walton","Okay.","Dennis Muile","So that's all been accounted for in there. Combined with the investment for the 37, some of that to go up to 57 out in the 2019 timeframe. So that's all been taken into account in this quarter's booking rates.","Myles Walton","And the only clarification on that seven a month on the 777, that's going to be equal to deliveries that production is equal to deliveries of no, in terms of 777Xs or anything like that [indiscernible]?","Dennis Muile","In 2017, it's seven a month. As we get into 2018, obviously we'll start to build some test aircraft and get ready for the flight test program. And then very similar to what you've seen on the 787-8 transitioning to the 9. We'll see some longer flow times and learning associated with those early units. And those will obviously have some impact in the 2018 timeframe. But again, taking all that into consideration as you look at the top line and then look at the cash flow going forward, we expect to continue to grow. That's what's assumed.","Myles Walton","Okay. Thanks again.","Dennis Muile","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you so much. So you said that the 787 deferred would be about 200 in the first quarter and then down as you go through the year. And yet it looks like the last two quarters were little bit better than expected.","Dennis Muile","Yeah.","Cai von Rumohr","What are the chances that it could be better than that? And what sort of a profile of decline should we look for as we look ahead? And similarly on R&D, it, on the other hand, looks a little higher than maybe some of us thought this year. What sort of profile should we look for R&D as we think out to 2017 and 2018?","Dennis Muile","Yeah, Cai, on R&D as you saw, we came in a little light on 2015 to what we had guided some of that. It was just timing moving into 2016. And obviously, the bulk of that is 777X which is actually performing very well to schedule and to cost as we get ready for that entry into service further out in 2020 timeframe. So that spending is going to start to ramp up here. But I think for the next couple years, Cai, you're going to see kind of flattish R&D. And again, that's just some movement between 777X and then 10X winding down. So that's how we see it going forward.","On deferred, you're right. We have had some good performance there in the last couple of quarters, and we've assumed some of that going into the balance of this year. So we see similar growth, as I indicated in the first quarter. And then that will start to moderate. And again, we see that declining shortly after we hit that 12 a month further out into this year. So obviously, it continues to be a big focus area. But the team has done a very good job. And we're assuming additional productivity again through the balance of, from 2015 into the balance of 2016.","Gregory Smith","Cai, I think it's reiterating the fact that, that profile that Greg just described is completely consistent with what we shared with you previously. And part of our theme here is meeting the commitments and promises that we talked about. So 787 getting to be 4Q cash positive, out-performing on deferred production inventory, meeting the profile that we talked about, delivering $9.4 billion of cash in the year. As you see, our guide $10 billion of cash in this year conveys to you our strong cash growth story, and we remain confident in that.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Herbert with Cannacord. Please go ahead.","Ken Herbert","Hi. Good afternoon.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good afternoon.","Gregory Smith","Good afternoon.","Ken Herbert","I just wanted to dig a little deeper into the 737 and the rate increase announcement up to 57. Can you provide some more color on the assumptions under that in terms of retirements or any change in your expectations for mix replacement versus capacity underneath the assumptions in the rate increase?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, we continue to see a fundamental strength in the marketplace. So as you just pointed out, stepping up to 57 a month in 2019 just continues the trend of confidence that we see in the narrow-body marketplace. In particular, we continue to see strong long-term passenger growth at 6% to 7% a year that is global in nature. We're seeing that in all of our different market sectors and across all of our different 737 model lines. All of that is telling us that continuing to ramp up production to keep supply and demand imbalance is the right thing to do.","And as you know, we're very diligent about these rate ramp ups. We make these decisions with a long-term perspective, and this conveys our confidence in the long-term market and what we're seeing in narrow-body growth. So our plans right now as we transition to the MAX during this coming year, we step up to our 47 a month as planned in 2017, 52 a month in 2018, and now stepping to 57 a month in 2019, all of that being buttressed with our long-term view of the \u2013 of passenger growth.","Ken Herbert","Do you assume, Dennis \u2013 I appreciate it \u2013 do you assume the retirements maybe pick up again after being down so much here in 2015 and 2014 relative to what we saw in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, we continue to see about 40% of overall aircraft are in the replacement category, so it's a combination of growth and replacement. About 60% growth, about 40% replacement on balance. It varies a bit year-to-year, region-by-region, but that gives you a sense for it. And the value proposition of our airplanes is compelling whether you're looking at replacement of old assets or the need to satisfy passenger growth. You see that reflected in some of the just very recent customer decisions. The Southwest Airlines announcement that was made just a week ago refers to both passenger growth as well as the compelling value proposition of fleet modernization. And \u2013 but both of those continue to play over the long run.","Ken Herbert","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we'll go to Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good afternoon.","Jason Gursky","Hey, Greg or Dennis, I was just hoping you could walk us through the disconnect this year between your announced build rates and the delivery schedule or the delivery guidance that you've offered up to us. I know we've got some inventory that's getting built on the 67. It looks like a little bit the 37 backs. Just wondering if that disconnect reverses next year and we actually see deliveries outstrip the build rates or the announced build rates in 2017 because you're undershooting it this year?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, let me add just a little color to that, Jason, and I'll ask Greg to add on as well. If you take a look at this year, again, compared to 2015, as you well noted, our delivery guidance is down about 20 aircraft. The majority of that is in the 737 principally because of the MAX transition, as we've always planned. So we'll be building another two test aircraft this year, and then we're also building ahead on MAX's that will be ultimately delivered in 2017. But there's about a dozen aircraft in there that are 737 and related to the MAX transition as planned. That's why you see deliveries down a bit this year.","There's also a bit of a pullback because of our announced reduction in 747 rate. So those are the principle drivers in terms of numbers of aircraft. Now to your point, it's really important that we look at this from a long-term view. So while we'll go through a transition in 2016, if you look at the seven rate ramp ups ahead of us and look out over the next several years, you'll see that revenue will grow, you'll see that deliveries will grow as we execute on the backlog, and so just stepping back from a year of transition and looking out to 2017, 2018, you'll see revenue growth, you'll see earnings growth, you'll see cash growth. We remain very confident in that story, and that's backed up by the committed rate ramp ups that we have in the plan and we're continuing to consistently execute.","So it's very important to note that this year, you'll see a bit of a transition because the MAX, a temporary reduction in revenue top line, if you will, as a result, but we can tell you very clearly that our long-term view here is increasing top and bottom line performance and cash growth year-over-year.","Greg, anything you want to add to that?","Gregory Smith","The only thing I would add, Jason, is that when you're looking into next year, deliveries will outpace just slightly production rates because of everything Dennis just articulated. So this really is a point of transition, and particularly on the 37. And then obviously we talked about the 747 market. But I think when you're thinking about the MAX coming in the production system, if you think about how smoothly the Dash 9 has come into the 787-8 line. That methodology and the process that were applied there are the exact same ones being applied here to ensure that we have smooth transition, and we meet those rate increases and the commitments we made to our customers.","So it's a near term transition, but absolutely the right thing to do for the long term. And as Dennis indicated, 57 a month is very healthy for us as we look at that order book and percentage sold out. So we feel very comfortable about going up in that rate over the long term, but we want to do it as we have, very smoothly and very productively through each one of those increases.","Dennis Muilenburg","And further to Greg's point, that approach we've used on the Dash 8 to Dash 9 transition on the 87, using that same approach now on the MAX, we'll apply that same approach as we get to 777, 777X transition. And the comments I made just a few minutes ago on our growth prospects and expectations going forward include that 777 transition and the seven per month rate during that transition that I referenced earlier. So we take a composite view of all of the lines, transitioning in the new models and the strength of the rate ups that are in the plan. The composite of all of that leads us to top and bottom line growth and growing cash.","Ken Herbert","The 67 line, will it see fewer deliveries this year than the build rate, and then more next year?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, it will. It will. I think we had about 16 last year, and we'll probably have about 10 this year. It was a couple of commercial just timing on a couple deliveries. And then we have tankers that obviously we're ramping up here, and we'll complete them. And they will deliver in 2017. So we got that transition going on from 2015.","Ken Herbert","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Dennis Muilenburg","You're welcome.","Operator","And next we'll go to Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much. And good afternoon. I wonder if we could talk a little bit more about the margins at BCA. And you guys have talked kind of longer term about it at an aspirational level of those being much higher than kind of the 10% we were running. But this year in the guidance is to go down to 9%. So as we think about the moving pieces here going forward, how do margins expand off this 9% level at BCA? And I know you mentioned that the 777 cut was incorporated into the program margin this quarter, but do you anticipate any pressure on overall BCA profitability as that rate cut takes effect and we move into 2017?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, to the first part of your question, our goal and aspiration for where we're headed on margins is not changed. As we've mentioned before, we are driving fundamental productivity with a target of increasing our operating margins to get into that mid-teen range. And that remains our aspirational target. I think it's a challenging but reasonable expectation. And we have a number of affordability and productivity initiatives underway to achieve that. And those are market-based. They include our partnering for success effort with our supply chain as well as our lien and capturing the value of quality efforts within our factory spaces and our office spaces. So that long-term target remains consistent, and we'll continue to drive in that direction.","There are a few puts and takes for this year as you noted. As Greg mentioned earlier, we do have slightly higher R&D this year driven primarily by 777X. We do have lower volume on the 37 line because of the MAX transition as we mentioned earlier. And there is some dilution of margins due to higher 87 revenue. So all of those are factored into the guidance that we've given you for the current year. But again, our longer-term expectation is to drive productivity and head towards that mid-teen range in terms of margins. Greg, anything you want to add on?","Gregory Smith","No, I don't. I know you covered it unless you have anything else, Seth.","Seth Seifman","And so you would say that a double digit \u2013 when the 737 begins delivering in line with the production rate in 2017, a 777 rate of seven a month is consistent with a double digit margin at BCA?","Gregory Smith","That's what we're focused on, Seth.","Dennis Muilenburg","The big factor as well as we continue to ramp up 787 and drive productivity and 787 increasing margins in that program represents a syndicate opportunity for us.","Seth Seifman","Okay. Thank you very much.","Dennis Muilenburg","You're welcome.","Operator","Next, David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thanks. Following up, you talked about in be billed on the 37 and the 67 in 2016. Can you maybe, Greg, could you maybe quantify what's baked into your free cash flow forecast? So if we look at BCA inventory less 787, what you're assuming in terms of an inventory build. And then won't 737 MAX inventory also build in 2017 as you start to deliver the airplanes? I know you're going to be going up in rate behind that. Thanks.","Gregory Smith","Well, yeah, certainly on these aircraft that we're building this year and won't deliver until next, that is going to go into inventory. But that's taken into account with the approximate $10 billion of cash flow in 2016. So we've taken that into account. And as we look forward in the year-over-year growth in cash flow, all those kind of moving pieces on these rate transitions have also been taken into account.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Thank you.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hey, Doug.","Doug Harned","When I look at deliveries, Commercial Aircraft deliveries in 2016, guidance versus 2015, and you look at revenues, they're both coming down about 2% or so. So I wanted to understand if you were to think about the fact that you're going to actually have more attractive variance from a pricing standpoint with 787-9 and some larger 737 variance. And then you think if you've got a little bit from escalation that you might actually see revenue do a little better than that. When you think about it and you look at escalation, pricing, mix, how do you see each of those moving into 2016 and then perhaps into 2017?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, certainly 87 with the more favorable mix on the 9s, you're right. We're going to have more revenue on a per unit basis there. But at the same time, as we said, you've got the 37 transition to 67. And then on 47, we're projecting to have lower deliveries in there. A, the production rate, but we've also got some customer requests to move some of those airplanes. So, but we're taking that into account as well, Doug. So it is, there's a lot of moving pieces in there, obviously. As far as escalation goes, certainly that's a watch item for us as we see lower oil prices and how that will affect the booking rates going forward. Obviously we've tried everything up for Q4 results. But it's something we're watching. There is, obviously, that escalation that's already assumed in the pricing has been taken into account in our guidance. So again, a number of moving pieces in there, but it's really a lot of those transitional points on some of those programs that's offsetting some the additional 787 revenue expected.","Doug Harned","Given that you're also, your pricing is pretty much set for most everything in 2016 and 2017. And if you put escalation aside for a moment, are you looking at any pressure on pricing in those next two years?","Dennis Muilenburg","No, nothing material.","Doug Harned","Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Dennis Muilenburg","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question's from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Hey, guys. Just looking ahead to 2017, are we to assume that 737 deliveries are up only modestly, given you'll have even more MAXs in the production system? I'm just looking maybe for some comfort that this transition into 2017 and 2018 is going to be kind of smoother and less of a headwind than it looks like it will be in 2016.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, listen, this is, there's nothing more to read into this other than smooth transition into the MAX at the 42 a month rate and building those test aircraft. So that introduction as we going into this year and then as we go further, as we increase rate and bring in more MAX airplanes, again, I don't see that as a significant issue at this point. I think the plans are very solid, but it is some near-term transition that we'll work our way through. But again, as Dennis indicated, it's the same approach that we took on the 787 and the same approach we'll take on the 777 and the 777X. So...","Gregory Smith","And on the 37 line, you'll see is getting to the backside of the MAX transition as we get into 2017.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes.","Gregory Smith","And you'll see us ramping up to the 47 a month planned production rate increase. But both of those factors will play in an advantageous way to the 37 deliveries in 2017.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. It's just hard to understand the comparison with the 787, given that you've doubled deliveries there over a couple years as a new model came in. And now you're talking about 737 being down in 2016.","Gregory Smith","Well, again, you've got a couple of test aircraft, right, for the flight test program that you're not going to deliver this year. So you're going to produce some and you're going to deliver them. And then we have additional MAX airplanes that we're actually building this year that will be delivered next year. So that's the difference.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Dennis Muilenburg","And the key here is again, we're doing the right thing to make sure this is a profitable smooth transition. We remain very confident in that. And as I think hopefully you saw the news recently, we are on track to fly the MAX very soon. So that development has gone well. The airplane is looking solid, and as soon as the weather is right, we will fly the airplane. So we're very confident in the MAX and our planned ramp up.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey. Good afternoon, gentlemen.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hey, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Just a clarification, and then a question, if I can. On the question relating to the program margin changes you said that are already incorporated in your guidance for BCA, presumably the 777 cut had a negative program margin move associated with it and the 737 rate increase had the opposite. Obviously, we had a negative impact with the forward loss on the 47, but are those correct?","Gregory Smith","Well, yes, they're actually in the Q4 booking rate as well.","Carter Copeland","Oh, of course.","Gregory Smith","Right? So \u2013 and then into 2016. But yeah, there was a modest impact on the 777 with the rate cut, and the 37 was, at least from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, was about flat. There wasn't a significant change there. And again, that did incorporate some of the investment to go up to 57.","Carter Copeland","Okay. And just to clarify here, the parallel \u2013 the comparison to the 787 that you're talking about on the MAX, does that refer to building the 787-9 on the surge line alongside the 787-8 and you're going to build the MAX in a third line at Renton alongside the NG? Is that what you mean by the same plan, the same model?","Gregory Smith","Yeah, I mean, I think that is the same. And at the same time, and as you know, when you get further back in the supply chain is where you see the longer flow in learning because sometimes they're utilizing the same tooling and same fixtures. But that methodology about ensuring we have enough flow time for the derivative aircraft implementation and taking into account the learning associated with that, that's all taken into account. Now the uniqueness to this is that we will be building these airplanes this year and delivering them next year. But again, that's all taken into consideration as a smooth introduction into the production system.","Carter Copeland","Okay. Thanks, Greg.","Gregory Smith","Okay. You're welcome.","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","And that will be from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Hey. Good afternoon, Dennis, Greg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hey. Good afternoon.","Gregory Smith","Good afternoon.","Peter Arment","Hey, Greg or Dennis, on the CapEx investments, whether we're talking all the automation stuff that you're doing on the wing build or the fuselage on the 777, how does that profile look over, you know, I assume it's, again, relatively stable this year, but do we start to see \u2013 when do we start to see all this investment trend down? Obviously, now you're talking about a higher rate on the 737, and does that require an additional step up? Yeah, just a question on the CapEx profile. Thanks.","Gregory Smith","Sure. Yeah, this year is our peak year, Peter. So it'll start to taper off going forward. And again, it just, as you described it, some of that's on the productivity initiatives and then on the rate increases. So this will be our year which obviously as we've said is really tied to the growth in the production rate. So we'll start to taper off going into 2017 and beyond.","Peter Arment","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Gregory Smith","Good. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. For members of the media [Operator Instructions] I'll now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Thomas Downey","Thank you. We will continue with the questions for Dennis and Greg at this time. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please contact our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002.","Operator, we're ready for the first question. And in the interest of time this afternoon, we ask that you limit everyone to one question only, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And first in line is Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Jon Ostrower","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hi, Jon.","Jon Ostrower","Glad we can do this a second time. A pair of questions, actually. One first for Greg. Greg, I'm curious in terms of returning cash positive on 787 overall. I'm curious your level of confidence right now in avoiding a forward loss on the 787 program as a whole, and whether or not you see the ramping up ahead as a critical event on getting out of the woods as you kind of are able to really measure your level of productivity improvement. And for Dennis, more of a strategic question. Coming out of 2015, you ended the market share balance with Airbus on single-aisle aircraft for MAX versus 4,400 to 3,100, roughly. And they just should have number.","I think you guys need to beat Airbus by a 100 orders annually for the next decade and a half, roughly, to get back to 50%. I'm just curious what steps you're thinking right now are necessary to redeem that market share parity. And what are you thinking about from a strategic perspective that's going to be necessary to do that?","Dennis Muilenburg","Okay. Greg, do you want to take the first one there?","Gregory Smith","Yeah, Jon, as I indicated earlier, 787 unit performance is improving. And obviously we expect that to improve as we come down learning curves as we have on other programs historically. At the same time, implement productivity initiatives, whether it's in our supply chain or in our own factories. And we have plans in place to continue to implement those going forward. And then obviously we have favorable mix as we look forward as well, where we'll have more Dash 9s and Dash 10s as we look to the years to come versus the past. So no question. I mean we've got work to do here as we have, but I think we've got good plans in place and, again, solid projects that we've got to go implement and get them matured and get them into the factory.","Dennis Muilenburg","And, Jon, to your second question regarding market share and our perspectives on narrow body, we remain very confident in the investments we've made in the MAX and its performance in the marketplace. And I recognize the numbers you pointed out there. But I think it's important to note that since we launched the MAX, it's actually been about 50\/50 in terms of orders. And we also like to make sure we're looking at deliveries of airplanes. And as noted, again, we were the market leader in total deliveries again this year. So when we think about market share, it's important to think about both deliveries and future orders. And as we've had the MAX in the marketplace and competing, based on feedback from our customers, we see that the MAX is providing a value proposition beyond our competitor's aircraft. So we feel confident about the MAX and its future prospects. You see that reflected in our rate ramp up expectations going from the current 42 to 47, 52, and as we've announced today, going to 57 a month.","We also are mindful that we're going to run a disciplined profitable business. And so as we think about rate ramp ups, we don't simply make decisions based on market share desires. We make decisions from a long-term perspective, what's going to be valuable to our shareholders. We're going to provide profitable ramp-up and continue to deliver value for our customers. So I think the performance in the marketplace is speaking for itself, and we remain confident in our strategy.","Operator","Our next question is from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alwyn Scott","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Switching gears just a little bit here, the agreement with the engineers was quite a contrast with the machinists and the prior engineers' contract. The union said they saw a really different approach across the table. And Dennis, I wanted to ask you do you have a different kind of outlook on this? Is this a conscious decision? And if so, what's your strategy there?","Dennis Muilenburg","Well, thank you for your question. I think it's important again to go back to some comments I made on our last call. And that is, for the long term, we place a very high value on our employees and their talent. We think it's important to have a mutually respectful relationship and one that recognizes the value that our team brings to the table every day, arguably from my viewpoint the best team in the world. At the same time, we all know the competitive realities that we face. So we have continued to set a tone and a conversation with our work force that as a company, as a team, we need to recognize the market realities. We need to be competitive.","And at the same time, we want to recognize this great team and treat them with the respect they deserve. So that's been the tone of our discussions. That's been reinforced by Ray and his team in Puget Sound. And together, I think we've engaged in what's been a very productive conversation. We are very supportive of the tentative agreement that's on the table. And we're hopeful that that'll be ratified by the membership over the next few weeks. And if so, it will provide labor stability and competitiveness for the company for the long-term, which will allow us to continue to invest in the future. And it will recognize the contribution and talent of our employees. And so we do think it's a good balanced solution. So we're hopeful that it will be ratified. And we want to continue to set that tone of mutual respect and the tone of competitiveness and be the market leader for the long run. And that's part of the commitment that I've made for my end as well.","Operator","Our next question's from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates","Hi. Good afternoon. Actually, let me ask first for a clarification, because I may have misheard something. And talking about deliveries in 2016, did you say that the 787 would be flat in deliveries compared to last year despite the rate increase that you planned for midyear?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Just the timing with regards to some of the customer deliveries. But we expect to be about flat, Dominic.","Gregory Smith","We had a bit of advantageous timing to 2015. In 2016, that's offset by the ramp up to the 12 a month as planned. And so those two factors together make it roughly level through the year.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Right.","Dominic Gates","Okay. And to my question, first of all, my apologies for getting a detail wrong in my story last night and making the false assumption that you have a charge related to this 777 rate decrease. But can you help me explain why does the 747 rate decrease of six planes a year result in an $800 million charge and a 777 decrease of 16 a year, no charge? Can you just help me explain that?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, I mean, Dominic, the 747 just is not as profitable. I mean it's that simple where the 777 is a pretty significant contributor to us and operates at a higher margin and is not at risk to being in a reach forward, where the 47 was not. And so that's really the difference between the two programs.","Dominic Gates","Did you change the accounting block on the 47?","Dennis Muilenburg","No.","Dominic Gates","Okay. Thank you.","Dennis Muilenburg","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson","Hi, Greg. Just a quick question. I wanted to circle back on Q1 free cash flow guidance.","Gregory Smith","Yeah.","Julie Johnsson","Can you just walk us through what's weighing on cash flow in the first period. Obviously you see it improving as the year goes on. And I'm just wondering if it might have been effected by cash advances sliding into Q4 2015.","Gregory Smith","Yeah, no, it was not. If you go back over time, you'll see just because of the seasonality of the business, whether it's on the commercial side or defense, the timing of receipts and expenditures tends to be heavily weighted into the first quarter. So again, if you look back over time, you'll see that's either a cash use in the first quarter or breakeven or maybe slightly positive. So the trend we see into 2016 is no different than that. And advances aren't really a material driver in that whatsoever. It's just purely, again, seasonality and timing around each one of those receipts and then, frankly, just payments we have to our suppliers.","Operator","And our next question is from Glenn Farley with KING TV. Please go ahead.","Glenn Farley","How are you guys doing this morning? I am trying to get a better sense for how you, or this is \u2013 you're looking at a fairly bullish time going ahead, even though we're probably dropping back to a book-to-bill ratio of one to one. But it's fairly optimistic regarding the rest of the global economy considering that the Fed just minutes ago said they were going to keep interest rates unchanged and were going to watch it. So can you give me a better sense of your confidence level despite the global economic issues that seem to be building?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, we will. And I think your read in that is correct in that we're bullish about our prospects, but we're also paying attention to what's happening in the macro environment around us. If you take a look at GDP projections of about 2.7% growth over the near-term and midterm, again, that's a balanced view. That's different in different parts of the world as you well know. But on balance, that's a respectable level for our industry.","The key differentiator is we continue to see passenger growth globally increasing at about 6% to 7% a year. It is outpacing GDP. And even in places like China where, obviously, it's been getting a lot of attention on economic growth prospects, even during the fourth quarter of 2015, just as a reference point, as GDP in China fell back to a little under 7%, airplane and passenger traffic growth increased 15%. So passenger growth continues to outpace GDP. That is a strong trend. It's a long-term trend. And then that's part of what paints a bit more of a bullish view in terms of our growth prospects. You see that reflected in our planned production rate increases.","And again, we try to be very disciplined about that. We take a long-term view on these rate increase decisions. And those are not made lightly. And we take that balanced view and the fact that we are ramping up should convey our general confidence in the marketplace. And we'll continue to keep a watchful eye on the macroeconomics.","Gregory Smith","Operator, we have time for one last question from the media this morning.","Operator","And that will be from the line of Stephen Trimble with Flightglobal. Please go ahead.","Stephen Trimble","Yeah, I have a question about the 747 rate cut last week and the move to six per year and how long that is sustainable before you have to review that, depending on how orders come in. Especially given this aspiration you've talked about of mid-teens margins. And I think you talked about how in 2019 you see the 20-year replacement cycle coming into effect. How long is the six per year sustainable?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, Steve, that's the decision that we made. That is a sustainable rate position for that line to bridge us to the 2019 replacement cycle. And you're right. When we take a long-term view at the market, although cargo has been flattish during this past year at about 2% growth, and if we look at near-term projections of about 2% to 3% growth, we think that's modest and reasonable. The production rate announcement we've made factors that in. As we get to the 2019 timeframe, we take a look at the peer replacement market that's out there, about 45% of the current fleet will need to be replaced. I said earlier we'll have 240 large freighters that will be over 20 years old at that point. So the replacement need is real. And while the 747 is a niche market, it's an important niche market and one that we think is sustainable. So all of the decisions we've made factor in both the near-term economics as well as this longer-term replacement cycle.","Gregory Smith","And I think as you said, Steve, obviously we're watching it closely. And between this timeframe and the 2019 that Dennis articulated, obviously, we've got to continue to get orders through that period. And we have a robust pipeline that the team is working on. But it's something that, obviously, we're staying very close to. It's a great airplane and a tough cargo market. And we're expecting that to recover, and we've got the perfect asset to align to that recovery.","Troy Lahr","That concludes our earnings call.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy J. Lahr - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. I'm Troy Lahr and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer. After management comments, we'll take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question.","We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussions today are likely to involve risk which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Troy, and good morning. I'll start with some comments on the quarter and our business environment. After that Greg will walk you through details of our financial results and outlook.","With that, let's move to slide two. Boeing delivered strong third quarter operating performance with 9% revenue growth, 10.2% core operating margins, 18% growth in core earnings per share and operating cash flow of $2.9 billion. Given our operating performance in the quarter, we're raising 2015 guidance for revenue, core EPS and operating cash flow. This performance and confidence in our long-term outlook continues to support our commitment to return cash to shareholders while also making strategic investments to grow our business.","Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. This remains a priority under our balanced cash deployment strategy. Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 10% on record deliveries of our industry-leading product family. During the quarter, we delivered our 325th 787. We began final assembly and achieved power on for the 737 MAX, completed firm configuration on the 777X and successfully concluded final testing and began implementing the advanced automated fuselage production technology on the 777 line, which will improve safety, quality and flow time, and ensure a smooth transition to the 777X.","Boeing Defense, Space & Security grew its top line by 6% on higher revenue at Boeing Military Aircraft and Network & Space Systems. Key contract awards during the quarter included an order from India for 22 Apache attack helicopters and 15 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters and a contract from Japan for five V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. We also received a contract from the U.S. Navy for 13 additional P-8A Poseidon aircraft.","Significant defense program milestones included delivery of the first two of 12 EA-18 Growlers to the Royal Australian Air Force and the start of flight testing of the first full-up KC-46A aerial refueling tanker. During the last few weeks, we have successfully deployed the tanker's refueling boom and its centerline and wing refueling drogue systems multiple times over a broad range of flight conditions. While more work remains ahead, these early accomplishments represent significant risk reduction and real progress on the flight test program.","In summary, we had another strong quarter of operating performance and cash generation. With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide three.","The commercial airplane business environment generally remains healthy, driven by improving airline profitability, solid air passenger traffic and meaningful replacement demand. Air cargo traffic remains a watch item for us as the gradual market recovery continues amid modest overall global economic growth rates. Airplane order activity and customer discussions are continuing at a moderated but historically healthy pace. Deferral requests and cancellations remain well below the historical average.","In the Single Aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains high with cumulative orders totaling nearly 2,900 airplanes from 58 customers. Given the strong market demand, we continue to see upward pressure on narrow body production rates beyond the announced 52 per month in 2018. However, we remain steadfast in our financial discipline as we assess the market demand for further production rate changes.","During the third quarter, we made the decision to increase the 767 production rate to 2.5 per month, starting in 2017, driven by ongoing strong demand for the 767 freighter on top of the existing planned tanker production base. This is a testament to the compelling value proposition that airplane brings to the market. Demand also remains strong for the 777X with a backlog of 306 aircraft from six customers. On the 777, we have 44 orders and commitments year-to-date, including the two 777-300ERs announced last week for EVA Airways.","Our 777 backlog stands at 235 aircraft with production for 2016 essentially sold out and 2017 production more than half sold. With firm configuration of the 777X complete and our manufacturing advancements taking hold, we are now working to finalize the production plan to phase in this new technology. We will also continue to assess 777 supply and demand to maximize airplane profitability over the transition period.","On the 787 program, EVA's decision last week to also purchase up to 24 787-10s is evidence of continued strong market demand for the Dreamliner. The 787's backlog of nearly 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month later this decade. We have now delivered more than 330 787s, including more than 50 Dash-9s.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid support for our major programs. Congress has been supportive of the President's fiscal year 2016 DoD and NASA budget request increases to core Boeing programs, including the P8-A Poseidon, the F-18 Super Hornet, Apache and Chinook helicopters and the NASA's Space Launch System. International demand for our offerings remains strong, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region.","During the third quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 35% of revenue and 40% of our current backlog. The strength of our Defense and Space business stems from our investments in technology and innovation that have established a portfolio of reliable, proven and affordable products and services.","We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for our customers such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and the critical few future franchise programs like Long Range Strike and the T-X trainer. Teams throughout our company also continue to ensure our long-term competitiveness by driving further safety, quality and productivity gains to improve program profitability and fund investment in future growth. In summary, our team is executing on our business strategy by growing revenues, generating solid operating performance and capturing strategic new business.","Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everybody. Let's turn to slide four and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue increased 9% to $25.8 billion driven by record commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margins of 10.2% reflect solid execution across both businesses. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $2.52 reflecting again continued strong core operating performance on production programs and within our services businesses.","Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide five. For the third quarter, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' revenue increased 10% to $17.7 billion on a record 199 airplane deliveries. BCA operating margin of 10% reflects strong execution offset by the impact of higher planned R&D spending and increased 787 deliveries. Commercial Airplanes captured $13 billion of net orders during the third quarter and backlog remains very strong at $426 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft equating to more than seven years of production.","Specifically on the 787, we continue to expect the program to be cash positive in the fourth quarter and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12 per month production rate later in 2016. No change to these fundamental milestones. We continue to see progress in the key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we implement additional production efficiencies while meaningfully increasing 787-9 production.","As planned, the 787-9 production rate and deliveries are now outpacing 787-8. This is a testament to the team's detailed advanced planning and day-to-day execution to ensure smooth transition and ramp-up of the 787-9. On the 787-8 we have continued to make progress on unit cost reduction where we've now seen a decline of approximately 40% over the last 230 deliveries.","We've also made further progress on the 787-9 where we now have had more than 30% cost reduction over the first 50 deliveries. Driven by continued cost reductions, a healthy mix of Dash-9s and a benefit of favorable timing on quarterly spending, 787 deferred production increased $577 million to now a balance of $28.3 billion in the third quarter.","We continue to anticipate 787 deferred production growth to further decline in the fourth quarter. We still have work ahead of us on the 787 as we remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution and risk mitigation while improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We will continue to manage the smooth ramp-up of the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 per month introduction and introduce the Dash-10 while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.","Let's now turn to slide six to discuss Defense, Space & Security results. BDS reported strong results in the quarter with revenue increasing 6% to $8.4 billion and operating margins of 12.2% on strong performance and a favorable delivery mix.","Boeing Military Aircraft third quarter revenue increased 15% to $4.1 billion largely driven by F-15 contract negotiations. Operating margins were 12.2% in the quarter reflecting higher volumes and strong performance.","Network and Space revenue increased 5% to $2.1 billion driven by commercial crew volume. The segment also generated strong operating margins of 11.5% on favorable mix and productivity improvements.","Global Services and Support revenue declined to $2.2 billion, largely driven by timing of deliveries while operating margins were strong at 12.9%.","Defense, Space & Security captured $9 billion of orders during the quarter and reported a solid backlog of $59 billion.","Let's move to cash flow now on slide seven. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at $2.9 billion driven by higher volumes and solid operating performance. With regards to capital deployment, we paid $618 million in dividend and repurchased 11 million shares for $1.5 billion in the third quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders. Year-to-date we've returned $8 billion to shareholders through dividend and repurchased 41 million shares. Again, this reflects our commitment and confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investments to support future growth remain high priority for us.","Let's now move to cash and debt balances on slide eight. We ended the quarter with $9.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.","Let's now turn to slide nine and I'll discuss our outlook for the balance of 2015. Based on the strong operating performance year-to-date, we've increased our 2015 guidance for revenue, operating margins, core earnings per share and operating cash flow. Core earnings per share guidance for 2015 is increased $0.25 to now be between $7.95 and $8.15 a share on continued solid execution across the business.","The company revenue guidance has increased $500 million, now be between $95 billion and $97 billion on higher commercial airplane deliveries. BCA delivery guidance has increased now five airplanes to be from 755 to 760. Defense, Space & Security operating margin guidance is increased to approximately 10%, again reflecting strong operating efficiencies across the business.","Operating cash flow is increased to approximately $9.5 billion on improved performance across the company, as well as favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. And furthermore we're lowering our R&D guidance $100 million to now be $3.4 billion for the year to reflect timing of spending. In the fourth quarter, we expect BCA margins to be impacted by the strong operating performance, somewhat offset by delivery mix, and higher planned R&D spending on 777X as well as additional investments in productivity initiatives.","So in summary, we generated solid revenue growth and healthy operating margins while generating significant cash flow. We meaningfully returned cash to shareholders and invested in our future.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dennis for closing comments.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Greg. With three solid quarters behind us, we remain focused on disciplined execution, quality and productivity improvements, and meeting customer commitments. Our priorities going forward are clear and consistent. The profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, delivering on our development programs, continuing to strengthen our Defense and Space business, driving productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments innovation, talent and technology, and importantly, providing increasing value to our customers and our shareholders.","Now with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Doug.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm going to probably violate this a little bit because I wanted to get some clarity on the deferred production ramp as part of this question. So when you look forward, you're talking about being cash positive in Q4 on the 787. And my understanding was that would be followed by a plateau in 2016 and then that would ramp down as you took rate out toward the back part of 2016. I just want to make sure that that is still how you're thinking about this.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That is how you are thinking about it?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Exactly. Yep.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Doug, That's exactly right, and that remains consistent. And we're confident in that profile.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But \u2013 okay. Great. Then the second part is when you look out toward the end of the block when we look at this, the deferred production level suggests to us that when you get in the later portion of the block, you're going to have to have unit cash margins move above 25% for the program. Now that's a pretty good number, and what I'd like to know first, is that correct? And then second, how do you see the path to getting there?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Doug, I won't get into the specific program by program margin but I will give you a sense of kind of \u2013 I'll say the few areas are focused on that have been the path and will be the path forward to continue to drive 787 profitability. Certainly productivity, continuing to come down the learning curve internally. You heard us talk about the progress to date on the 787-9 and the 787-8. So that's got to continue and we got a lot of projects in work. We got to get those matured and we got to get them cut in on line numbers. So there is not a lack of, I'll say, focus and ideas in that area but we got to get them matured and get them in but continuing to execute as we have on the productivity.","Mix plays a big factor in here and so our ability, with a richer mix of Dash-9s and 10s and quite frankly, as you've seen the Dash-9 get entered into the production system as smooth as it is, is another, I think, indicator of that mix coming together and keeping in mind this is all in our backlog. So this is delivering on the backlog but getting that smooth introduction and having that richer mix of Dash-9s and 10s will obviously grow as you get further out into that cost space and deliver on that backlog.","The supply chain, obviously we've got planned step down and contractual step down but we also got initiatives that we're working together across in the company and across the supply chain looking for additional productivity ideas. And keeping in mind, there's only been 300 units built here roughly. And a very steep ramp up and a lot of change in rate break. Having being stable at 10 and now making that transition up to 12, this is when you look historically, this is where you've really been able to capture additional productivity gains. So we're working with the supply chain on that.","And then rate. As you know we're going up in rate and it'll total about 40% going up to 12 a month and 16 and then 14 a month later in 2019 timeframe. So making good progress on getting up to rate within the supply chain as well as getting the factories ready internally. Again this is delivering on the backlog and you know the market, and so that supports these rate increases very much. But again, that'll continue to drive productivity.","And then I guess the only comment I'd make on the margins, I'd say they are similar to what we see today on our wide body programs and what we're achieving. So I'd say good progress to date, lot of work ahead of us to do, team's got good plans in place but we need to keep executing as we have and that'll be the path going forward.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Doug, just to add a little more color to that as Greg said, in each of those dimensions we have real and firm actions underway. I can tell you for myself, Greg, Ray and the whole team, this is a very important, high priority focus area for us and in each of these productivity dimensions that Greg talked about, the advantage we have here goes to the fact that we've got 800 of these aircraft roughly in backlog. So this gives us the opportunity to do that long-term planning and engagement and to drive profitability with that long-term view. And that is what's going to drive us down the learning curve to get to those objectives that Greg mentioned.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","As part of that trajectory, then presumably you still have a number of contractual step downs in the supply chain that you're looking forward to and that you know that you have a pretty good handle on I guess.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We do, Doug, and that includes the overarching Partnering for Success umbrella that we've talked about before that includes committed step downs that are in the plan and a continuing effort to drive value generation. So our value engineering effort that we've talked about before with our supply chain network more than 1,000 ideas in the pipeline right now that we're moving from design stage to implementation stage. So both planned and committed step downs as well as additional value generation beyond that.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. Dennis, you recently extended the 787-10 with a new customer and you've done a number of things with the 777 to enhance it as a value proposition. Could you address a little bit the market dynamics you see because of the capabilities these new airplanes offer and how you see the environment for both the 777 demand and also the 9 and the 10?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet. Yeah, thanks, Howard. So yeah, just stepping back and I know there's been a lot of discussion out there about the wide body marketplace and the prospects going forward. And let me paint for you a market outlook there and then hone in on those two specific airplanes in particular. But if you take a look at the overall market, we continue to see a growing healthy marketplace. As we said before, a current market outlook for 38,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years in total. We continue to see strong passenger growth, independent assessments again of 6% year-over-year growth throughout the time period. Cargo growth has been more moderated and has been a bit slow to recover as you know but we are seeing some recovery signs there.","If you take a look at overall market characteristics, we continue to see a strong healthy marketplace, both narrow bodies and wide bodies. If you take a look at replacement demand, it continues to be strong. We expect about 40% of those aircraft in that market outlook to be driven by replacement demand. And as I said, cancellations and deferrals remain below historic levels as well. So the market fundamentals remain strong.","Now when we get to the two products you mentioned, on 787 as noted, with 800 aircraft in backlog and a continuing strong market demand and I think EVA's decision here just in the last couple of weeks to acquire 24 787-10s is just another good sign of the value that that product is bringing to the marketplace. The 787 is delivering value for our customers. The value proposition is clearly a competitive advantage both in terms of operating cost reduction as well as the advantage on revenue and cargo volume and residual value that it brings to the customers. And with the production efficiencies that we're generating, we remain very bullish on 787 and as Greg talked about our plan is to ramp up to 12 a month and then to 14 a month before the end of the decade, all supported by strong market demand and unique value proposition of that airplane.","On the 777 we've been very focused on building out the 777 bridge as we've talked about. We needed to generate about 40 to 60 orders per year on the current 777 to build that bridge year-to-date. We've got 44 orders and commitments so we're continuing to fill out that bridge. In essence the 777 line is sold out through 2016, more than half sold in 2017 and we continued with a number of serious campaigns there all bridging to the 777X.","And as you pointed out, the 777X is bringing, again, a unique value proposition to the market. Both today's 777 and the 777X have really no peer competitor and bring unique value to our customers. And 777X, having just completed firm configuration, good solid signs on development program, being executed on plan and we plan to have EIS on that airplane 2020 as scheduled. So in all cases, a strong fundamental market, the right differentiated product line, both 787s and 777, and very mindful right now about building a bridge from the 777 to the 777X.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","If I just may on the 7-8, you initially had teething pains introducing it into the market. Could you just for a second, and then I'll end here, address sort of both dispatch reliability and how you've improved that and how that's also helped lower both airline costs and your costs?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet. And we continue to see strong progress. And you're right. We had some challenges as we introduced that airplane into our customer fleets and we've been very focused on reliability improvements both in the field and in the production line.","We've seen steadily improving dispatch reliability across our customer set so we're pleased with the progress there. That said, more work to go so we're not done and we're going to continue to drive dispatch reliability there for our customers until we achieve the objectives that we have. So more work to go.","I will say that reliability improvements that we've delivered to date in the field and then it back driven into production line are really taking hold. And the best sign of that is with the roughly 50 Dash-9s that we delivered. As they're hitting the fleets, they're coming in at a much higher dispatch reliability than the original Dash-8s. So just further proof that the investments we're making are delivering value for our customers. And we're going to stay very focused on getting to the finish line there.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Greg, maybe one for you. I know timing around advances is something that's generally hard to predict. You put out there kind of a placeholder of $3 billion for 2015.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And year-to-date that hasn't really contributed much.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And if you look at the fourth quarter, obviously if that came through, it's hard for me to not think you'd be running $1 billion plus ahead of your revised guidance. So can you help give either the offset or if that is more or less just conservatism around not knowing when that $3 billion is going to tick?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, no, I mean, you said it, Myles. They certainly, they do move around. I still expect it to be a positive contributor to 2015. But timing does factor in. So we should have more in the fourth quarter. But I think stepping back from that, you can see, it's about the strength of the cash engine here. And not the reliance on the advances. Obviously advances are important, but when you look into the core of the company, you're seeing strong cash flow generation, and that's the big focus area for us. And as you said, advances, they're going to move around quarter to quarter, and we'll have a few more here in the fourth quarter than we have in the third quarter.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And even with the tick up in the revised cash guidance for this year, the outlook is still for growth into 2016 from the new level?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, as you step back and you look at kind of a long-term profile of the company, we still see the same opportunity to have strong cash flow growth going forward. It really plays into certainly the production rates, increases that we've talked about on the 37, the 67 and as well on the 87 over the long term, and obviously 787 improving through that period. So over the long term, we're confident in the long-term cash flow growth, I'll say, story that we have in place. And I think it's a unique one when I compare us to other industrials.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Dennis, you've talked about in the past being able to get mid-teens margins within the BCA business. And I guess I'm wondering how comfortable you are still with that? And how do things like the 777 transition and volume and actually lower commodity prices, which should be lower escalation, how does that play into it? What does it take to get those kind of margins in BCA?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, hey, Sam. Good morning. Yeah, we remain focused on that aspirational target as we've talked about before. We see margin growth in BCA as an important priority for us. You're seeing it in the data and the results that we're producing. The productivity actions that Greg described earlier are all part of doing that. Part of it is productivity efficiency inside our own factories. Another key portion of that is within our supply chain through our Partnering for Success effort. But if we take the longer term view of what our company can and should be, getting to that mid-teens margin range is an expectation and aspiration that we set for ourselves. And I think that's a smart and aggressive target for the long-term. We're going to stay very focused on it.","As Greg had said, with the backlog that we have and the product line that we have, our opportunity to generate long-term cash growth and long-term margin accretion is very strong. And we are taking the right productivity actions both internally and externally to do that. And that will result in increased return to our shareholders, and it will allow us to fund and invest in our future innovation and talent. So we are very focused on doing that and remain steadfast on that longer term target.","Now regarding your question around 777 as we think about that transition, obviously a key topic for us here as the 777X will begin coming into the production system in the 2018 timeframe leading to EIS in 2020.","As I mentioned earlier, we're building the 777 bridge with today's current product line, leveraging the fact that that airplane does provide a unique value proposition in the marketplace. We're thinking carefully through exactly how we do that transition and the timing of it.","As we've talked about before, it's important that we do that efficiently. We're trying to pull ahead some of the technology investment in the line, like automation in the fuselage line, to de-risk that transition. And as I mentioned earlier, we've already implemented that automation here in the 777 line on the Fuselage Upright Build, and that's going well. So that's another way to de-risk that transition and ensure profitability through it.","There's been a lot of conversations out there about exactly what the shape of that transition might be. And we're factoring in market demand; as I said, some uncertainty around cargo recovery; frankly, some uncertainty around Ex-Im Bank reauthorization. Those are factors that could cause some customers to delay decisions around wide bodies, so we're being mindful of that. We want to make sure we maintain a highly profitable line through the transition. All of those factors are going into our planning right now. Frankly, with that, we don't see any scenarios where we'd come down below a seven a month production rate during the transition.","Important again to remind ourselves that 2016 is essentially sold out; 2017 is more than half sold out. So this transition that we're talking about is a 2017 and beyond transition. And through all of that, we're going to drive this in a way that maximizes profitability at the line, through the transition, allows us to continue to invest in the future and my broader comments about continued cash growth and margin accretion over the long-term all account for that 777 transition. So that's all factored into our bigger game plan.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. And, Greg, I don't know if you can mention anything about commodity costs and how that affects the escalation and your assumptions in the program accounting. Did it have any effect this quarter?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, no. It didn't. It didn't, Sam. It didn't have much impact at all.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So could you comment whether there were any adjustments to commercial blocks or accrual rates? And then kind of relatedly, Dennis, you talked about moderated kind of quarter strength. Are you still looking for book-to-bill to get to 1.0 for the year because it looks like you're going to have to move pretty quickly to get there? And if so, how does the Chinese order play into that and what are the implications of kind of getting there or not getting there in terms of potential profitability looking forward? Thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Cai, let me take the second part and then I'll flip it to Greg for your first question.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yep, okay.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So regarding book-to-bill for the year, again, we continue to see book-to-bill of approximately 1 for the end of the year. As I mentioned, we have some hesitancy right now in the wide body marketplace around cargo recovery and uncertainty with the Ex-Im Bank. That's causing some customers to pause a bit on decision-making so it's more of a timing issue rather than a volume issue. So we still anticipate book-to-bill to be roughly 1 by the end of the year. Some decisions could slide into the early part of the new year. Frankly, with about 5,700 aircraft in backlog, annual book-to-bill ratios are not that important to us. We're continuing to generate orders pipeline, but timing quarter-to-quarter, if it happens to shift a bit, with the kind of backlog we have, we remain very confident in the long-term plan.","Now as you mentioned the recent announcement by our customers in China was very positive for us. We were honored to host President Xi at our factory in Everett a couple of weeks ago, amongst a number of agreements that included an announcement around 300 aircraft, 250 narrow bodies and 50 wide bodies. Some of those are airplanes that were already in backlog but unidentified. Others are incremental new commitments. And we'll be working through the specific deals on those airplanes with our customers over the next many months. And we'll announce those as they come to fruition. But that will generally create upside to our book-to-bill posture for the end of the year. Greg, you want to take the first part of the question?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Yeah, Cai, on block extensions we extended the 737 by 200 aircraft, so one block extension there. And then with the increased demand and outlook on the 767, we increased that as well by 34 units. As far as changing in booking rates by program, no significant changes I'd say, Cai, across the board.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, one quick clarification question and then the meat of one. Dennis, you mentioned a rate of 7 a month on the 777. Would you be firing blanks in that environment? That's the clarification question. And then the meat of the question one for Greg on CapEx out into the future. Can you talk about the puts and takes that you're likely to see over the next couple of years on CapEx?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep. Yeah. Hey, Jason, on the first question there, yeah, that will be factored into the overall transition plan. And as you're well aware, that's a very common practice for us as we transition model mixes in our high volume lines. As we go from 777 to 777X where we can pull technology and implementation ahead as we're doing with automation we will. That'll make the transition even smoother. In some cases we will fire selected blanks down the production line. That again will help us smooth out implementation and ensure lean implementation.","Note that we'll also have some 777 flight test \u2013 excuse me, 777X flight test aircraft that will flow through the production system in that same timeframe. So all of that will be factored into the production profile and the transition plan. But again as I said, we look through all the options and variables here both from a market demand standpoint, from a production efficiency standpoint, we don't see any scenarios that would take us below a 7 a month production rate. And we're very confident that we can achieve that implementation, remain very profitable on that line while we do it, and successfully bring the 777X to the marketplace.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Jason, on CapEx, we'll expect to go up slightly next year from our levels this year. And again that's supporting the growth in the production rates we talked about and further investments in the Defense business, as well as some of the productivity initiatives. So further implementation of the automation activity on the 37 and the 87 will also be put into play there. And again supporting 777X, as well as the planned production rates. And then I would say past 2016, then we start to come down and moderate from there as really, again, linked to our growth and linked to our investment profile.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. You're welcome.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep. Thanks, Jason.","Operator","And we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hey. Good morning, guys.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Ron.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Quick question for you, for Greg. When you think about balancing near term capital returns to shareholders versus long-term value, and kind of in the context of this is I'm thinking about the share buybacks, year-to-date you guys bought back, if I did the math right, 41.5 million shares for about $6 billion. Right?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That implies an average cost of maybe $144 to $145 per share.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's within about 10% of the historical highs of the stock. How do you think about that?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we think the stock is still undervalued. And again, I think it goes to the marketplace that Dennis talked about. It goes to the strength of the backlog which then links rate to the production rates that we have announced that are again delivering on that backlog. So it's that profile along with the productivity expectations year-over-year. So we obviously see a lot of value still left in this stock. That's why we bought back $20 billion in the last three years and remain committed to that. At the same time, remain committed to the dividend to ensure that we're competitive from the dividend perspective as well as investing in the business.","Then that's been first and foremost for us, investing in things like 777X, like the MAX, like 787-9 and 10 and these rate increases along with, again, efficiencies, automation that we're putting in on 777, we're putting in on 37 and then additional investments we're making down in Charleston to support, again, productivity and rate increases. So that's the kind of profile we see that gives us the confidence to continue to buy back these shares, but have a balanced deployment plan to meet all our objectives.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Super. And if I may just a follow-on, be it that everybody else asked about five questions. How do you guys think about the middle of the market airplane? That's something we've been thinking about a lot, and there's been a lot of chatter about that in the industry. How do you think about it as a potential market opportunity and what investment would be required?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we still see that as a niche market, but an important one, and we're having conversations with our customers. We see today that that market space is largely served by our 737 MAX 8 and 9 family and on the upper end, by the 787, and we think that in large part serves that market space. It's important that a lot of our customers, their buying behavior and their needs are related to families of aircraft. And we still see, in that narrow body marketplace, the MAX 8 as being right at the heart of the market, augmented with the MAX 9 to serve some of those needs that are in that, more the middle of the market segment. So for the near term, we see our current product line as being the right answer for that segment.","That said, we're continuing to have conversations with our customers, and if we need to respond with a new airplane in that marketplace, that would be something that would be more towards the middle of the next decade. It's not something that would dramatically affect our R&D profiles over the next four to five years. We think those profiles are very solid with our current development programs, but it is something we're keeping an eye on, continuing to talk with our customers. Understand their needs. And if the market demands a response, we'll be ready.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question's from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks very much, and good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. Digging in on the 787 a little bit more and what to expect in Q4, not to nitpick too much, but you've talked in the past about a healthy decline in the deferred growth in Q4. But now we're starting from a lower level, so just maybe a little more color on how to think about that? And then if you could explain a little bit about the dynamics as we head into 2016 and kind of why it plateaus for a little while before coming down at that (44:35)?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Yeah, no. We'll see a decline in deferred in the fourth quarter, I'd say similar to the rate of decline you've seen in this quarter, and Q3 certainly was helped by strong performance, but we did have some timing of expenditures as well. So we had a little bit of, I'll say, favorable pick-up in the third quarter. But again, I think when you step back and look at the overall profile or deferred to-date, it's better than what we originally projected.","And then as you move into 2016, Seth, as I said, you'll start to see that turn once you hit the 12 a month. So the growth will moderate obviously into the fourth quarter and then through into 2016 until you hit that rate, and then that's when we would expect it to turn. And that turn down, again, is driven by the rate as well as the step-down on the supply chain, the contracted step-down pricing, and the continued productivity, but also that mix. I mean, ensuring that we've got that Dash-9 continues to come into the production system as it has. So those are kind of, I'd say, the key indicators or key levers as we move into 2016.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","And next we'll go to Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, Dennis and Greg.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, I wondered if we could go back to the margins for a second. Just I noted you extended the block 200 units on the 37, but no material margin increase there. I wondered why that was. I assume that would be all MAXs. And then on the 777, Dennis, your comments about trying to maintain that margin rate to the extent possible. You obviously have some pretty significant extra cost there when you transition over the surge line from the 87 to the 777. Is it that that cost is in the 777X block, or it's called R&D? How should we think about how you manage the two different programs going down the same line? Because there's obviously significant cost there. So any color would be much appreciated.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, let me \u2013 If you're all right, I'll answer the MAX question.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go ahead, Greg. Yep.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It was a slight pickup, Carter, but again, 200 units on a large block. So there's a lot of moving pieces in there. There's some investment in there for additional rate increases and productivity. So when you net that all out, again, not a significant change on overall booking rates for the quarter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But positive? Okay.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep. Yep.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And on 777?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And to your second question on 777, so as you noted, the R&D investments, the CapEx investments we're making to bring 777X online are all part of the profile that we've shared with you in terms of our total R&D and CapEx investment. Where we can pull those forward and pre-implement on the 777 line to reduce risk, like the Fuselage Upright Build, we are doing that, but all of that is included in our total investment profile for 777X.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Levenson with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Could you please expand your comments on the upward pressure on single isle rates and can you let us know if there's push back from supply chain particularly on engines?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we take a look at the market there, Steve. It continues to show signs of strength and growth. What we're seeing from customers in terms of market demand, especially from 737 MAX continues to be a positive sign for us.","As we've told you, we're at 42 a month now, we're ramping to 47 a month and 52 a month by 2018. Those are committed plans that we have in place. We continue to do studies on possibilities of ramping up beyond that.","As I said earlier, we're going to maintain very strict financial discipline as we do those studies being very mindful about it. We are still in a slightly over booked position in terms of our order profile for the 737 and all of that just creates general upward pressure to production rates. We're going to be very fiscally responsible as we consider those options. Again our committed plan takes us out through 2018 so we have time to consider these alternatives beyond that.","The other thing that I'd like to factor in is the 737 MAX development; the fact that we've achieved power-on on the first airplane, that final assembly is on or ahead of schedule also gives us confidence in terms of the airplane coming together and being ready for EIS with our customer. So both the development program progress as well as the market demand signals show us that narrow bodies are a very robust market for us both short and long-term.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And again, any pushback from suppliers?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we continue to talk to our supply chain. Certainly it's ramping up to the degree we're ramping up is something that we have to pay attention to. And our supply chain is letting us know where they see pressure points and where we need to work together. Nothing that I would say is out of the ordinary. These are normal ramp-up pressures and we know how to do these rate ramp ups. We've done more than a dozen over the last few years. We've got a few more important ones ahead of us during the next five years.","But working across the integrated supply chain and making sure they have the capacity and the capability to deliver on our needs is an important part of the equation. That's one of the things we factor into our committed plans.","We remain very confident that our supply chain can meet our ramp up to 52 a month on the MAX. If we were to go beyond that, factoring in supply chain capability is a key component of that decision. Again, we have plenty of time to make that decision with the committed plans we already have in place.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Troy J.

Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Dennis, I wanted to ask you on the buyback, but before I get to that, just a quick question for Greg on the F-15 and then I think there were some C-17s that were pre-built but delivered in the quarter. So, Greg, the question there is how much cash did the F-15 deal, I think it's about $700 million contribution to revenue, but those two items, how much unusual cash did those provide in the quarter?","And then, Dennis, for you, given that you have pretty good visibility into what your program investment looks like over let's say the next half decade with the MAX, the 777X, and it sounds like 757 replacements in the plan but doesn't really ramp until after that. Given that, can we expect that your buyback at the current levels should continue unabated going forward at roughly those levels?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Greg, why don't you take the first one?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean no impact on cash on the F-15, Rob and then I'd say very insignificant on the C-17.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And to your go-forward question, Rob, again as we look at priorities for cash deployment over the next several years, top priority remains organic investment and this is delivering on our development programs like the 777X, the MAX, and the 787-10. We're confident in that and as we said before with the phasing of those programs, our R&D profile year to year we expect to remain consistent. And so that should give you confidence that our R&D foundation is not going to vary significantly year to year. That'll be a foundational investment that's built into the plan over the next five years.","Second priority, as we said, is returning strong value to our shareholders both in the form of dividends and share repurchase. We expect that to continue to be a strong component of our overall cash deployment over the next many years. And then thirdly, any targeted actions we might take in the M&A arena, acquisition arena. That would be a third priority in that list.","So we're going to remain very focused on those priorities and the fact that we expect long-term cash growth will allow us to fuel both those future investments and things like share repurchase.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, Dennis, to just close the kind of loop on that, barring big M&A, forward years should really not look any different than now from a buyback perspective, or perhaps higher, given that you're ramping?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'm not going to give you guidance to specific numbers, Rob, but share repurchase and dividend strength over the long term will continue to be a high priority for us on cash deployment.","Robert M.

Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg News","Oh hi, all. I just wanted to circle back on 777 rate and follow up with a 747 rate question. I just want to make sure I understand this. Are you studying taking the rate to seven a month or planning to? And would this be effective in 2017? Or are we looking more at like at 2018 for the triple? And on 74, obviously, the cargo market is not helping order activity with that plane. Are we potentially looking at taking the rate below one a month?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me field the first one there, and then, Greg, I'll ask you to touch on the second one.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Julie, regarding 777, as I said, we're doing our scenario planning right now that includes market demand and feedback we're hearing from our customers. It includes the value proposition of the 777 and the 777X, and I want to stress again that that airplane is providing an absolutely unique value proposition in the marketplace. It's differentiated and our customers see it, and then also doing an efficient and profitable transition from 777 to 777X. So those are all things that we're factoring into our plan. We haven't finalized that plan yet. We're working through a variety of options.","But as we look through all of those options, we don't see any scenarios that would take us below a seven a month production rate. So we wanted to make sure that was clear, as there's been speculation about what option range we might look at. We see that as a floor for our planning given all the scenarios we're looking at. Specific timing, implementation is yet to be finalized. We're working our way through those details. Those will be decisions we'll have to make in the first part of next year. But I'll stress again that we are sold out essentially through 2016; more than half sold out through 2017. So what we're talking about here is a transition that's out 2017 and beyond. And we would get into the meat of that in the 2018 timeframe. So more details to be worked through, but we remain confident that, considering all the factors I talked about, that we'll be able to profitably go through that transition and bring the 777X to the marketplace.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Julie, on 747, as you know, this has been a challenging marketplace recently, and we took the \u2013 we announced taking the rate down from 1.3 to 1 a month early in 2016. So we continue to monitor that marketplace. It is challenging right now. It is driven by the market. It's a great airplane. It's an airplane that sits in a class within itself, whether it's an I or a freighter. So this is certainly market dynamics. We've got a pipeline of customers we're looking at. But again, having said that, it's a challenging marketplace for the airplane. So we continue to watch it and at the same time, focus on productivity within the factories and the supply chain. And we'll likely take another look at the rate here early next year and see where we are on orders and backlog and move forward from there, but right now, the plan is to hold at one a month.","Operator","Our next question's from Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I know you must be pretty exhausted after that defense question at the end of the analyst call, but hopefully you'll indulge me. Given the amount of portfolio shaping that's going on amongst the primes now, Dennis, how comfortable are you with the shape of the BDS right now, particularly on military aircraft and space? And are you comfortable with that regardless of what happens with some big upcoming contests?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Doug, we are. And as I said before, we have a strong, robust healthy Defense business. Now it's a tough marketplace, and we've acknowledged that. We're dealing with realities of sequestration in the U.S. defense budget, somewhat offset by what we've seen as international defense growth, especially in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions. But our Defense business overall is a healthy portfolio. We like the program structures we have. We're growing internationally and we're investing for the long run. That marketplace is somewhat muted so we expect that business to be relatively flat to slight growth top line.","In parallel with that, we're continuing to drive bottom line performance, and you saw it in the results here with a 12.2% margin quarter in our defense business. So that's a robust, important part of our portfolio. We have differentiated product lines on things like commercial derivatives, the P-8 and the tanker which present us for opportunities for longer term growth and leverage the one Boeing value, if you will, across commercial and defense sectors. We're continuing to invest in future product lines around human space exploration, satellites. We're investing in unmanned systems and ISR capabilities. And importantly we are investing for some critical franchise programs for the future.","You alluded to that. But programs like long range strike, the new T-X trainer are important and one of the reasons we continue to drive productivity is so we can invest in those future product lines. And we don't see a need to significantly change the structure of our Defense business. We're going to stay very focused on executing the business, investing organically, and where we can make targeted acquisitions to round out our portfolio, we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Our next question's from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","Good morning, Dennis, and Greg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Dominic.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","I just wanted to clarify a couple of things about the 777 rate question. The EIS for 777X is 2020. But presumably that's going to ramp up over several years. So the first question about the bridge is, how far beyond 2020 are you still having to fill a bridge for the current 777 model? And then secondly, you gave us some reassurance that the floor for the production rate in the bridge is seven a month, but you've also mentioned firing blanks in that. Can you give us some idea, like how many blanks are we talking about? If it was one a month, that's very different from one or two a year. So give us some guidance there?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, hey Dominic, to the first part of your question. When you look at the duration of the bridge, you're right 777X EIS is in 2020. As we said the bridge we're trying to build with the current 777 is roughly a five-year bridge, so it takes us to that same timeframe. The depth of that bridge is most significant in the 2018, 2019 timeframe. So we're very focused on filling that out. And we need about 40 to 60 aircraft per year over that five years to fill that bridge. So that effort continues to press ahead.","Now when you think about the transition production rate, the fact that we'll fire some selective blanks through the line, that is not a high volume decision, to your point. This is something that we'll do selectively as we bring lean implementation online in the new production rate. We haven't finalized exactly how many that will be, but those are incrementals, not a sustained activity. And then also mindful that we will have some 777X flight test aircraft, typical numbers of flight test aircraft, principally in the 2018, 2019 timeframe that'll be within that production line as well. So both of those are being factored into the profile.","Operator","And our next question's from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alwyn Scott - Thomson Reuters","Hi. Can you hear me?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Alwyn Scott - Thomson Reuters","Okay. So I wanted to come back to the 787, Dennis, and ask, and also Greg, how far do you think you can keep increasing the deferred production costs? Are we nearing the upper limit of what you can reasonably defer without taking a charge? And if we're nearing that, how do you think about whether you need to increase the accounting block? Or at what point you may need to take a reach forward loss?","Gregory D. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, on the deferred I would say, Alwyn, that the profile hasn't changed. The key milestones haven't changed. The growth will start to moderate again in the fourth quarter and as I've indicated, once we hit 12 a month that's when the deferred will start to turn, I'd say, all the key contributors to that unit cost mix. And again, getting to the 12 a month which, again, we're making good progress in that area. So those are all the key items I'll say the contributors to that, but the fundamental milestones in the profile, that has not changed from what we discussed probably a year and a half ago.","Thomas J. Downey - Senior Vice President-Communications","Operator, we have time for one final media question.","Operator","And that'll be from Micah Maidenberg with Crain's Chicago Business. Please go ahead.","Micah Maidenberg - Crain's Chicago Business","Hi. Good morning. Dennis or Greg, Delta Air Lines has continued to push this idea that there's a bubble in the wide body aircraft market. They compared that segment to the pre-recession real estate market. Any comment on this take from Delta?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Micah, I'll go back to my earlier comments about our broader look at the wide body market. We continue to see a very healthy overall marketplace both narrow bodies and wide bodies. As I said, traffic growth is sustained. Replacement demand is sustained. Deferrals, cancellations below historic levels. We recognize some of the comments that have come out recently and believe you're referencing the note around $10 million 777s that might be available.","I'll say just based on our understanding of the marketplace and what we understand from our customers, that number is the wrong order of magnitude. And, frankly, the value of the 777 is holding up very well in the marketplace. It is a unique airplane. In that 365-seat category, there is no competing aircraft out there. It's a unique value proposition for our customers. So values are holding up well in the marketplace.","We are mindful that the cargo market has been a bit slow to return. We're mindful of the fact that lack of Ex-Im Bank reauthorization is creating some uncertainty and some delays in customer decisions. And so we're considering that. But if you step back from it, the overall health of the marketplace and the unique value proposition of our airplanes is very clear and we remain confident in that.","Thomas J. Downey - Senior Vice President-Communications","That concludes our earnings call.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and the slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions, are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Stephanie Pope, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Pope, please go ahead.","Stephanie Pope","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's first quarter 2012 earnings call. I am Stephanie Pope, and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer.","After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. As a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we may include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking disclaimers at the end of this webcast presentation.","Now I will turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","W. James McNerney","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everybody. Let me start today by addressing the evolving business environment, followed by some thoughts on our performance during the quarter. After that, Greg will walk through our financial results and outlook and then we'll take your questions.","Starting with the business environment on Slide 2. As the global economy continues to recover, albeit at a slow and somewhat choppy pace, airline industry fundamentals remain intact. Global demand for commercial airplanes is strong and growing. Emerging markets are driving the expansion of airline fleets worldwide, growth that is complemented by the ongoing retirement and replacement cycles for airplanes in developed markets. ","Passenger air traffic remains resilient, with airline load factors and utilization rates continuing at or above peak levels. Although cargo traffic remains below long-term trends, it appears that this market is stabilizing and is projected to improve in the second half of the year.","Despite the ebbs and flows of the Eurozone debt crisis, we foresee aircraft financing as broadly adequate throughout 2012. Boeing airplanes are attractive, value-creating assets and sources of financing for them remain broad and diverse.","The high cost of jet fuel remains a key concern for our customers and has them focused more than ever on ensuring that they have the most fuel-efficient airplanes with which to compete, a dynamic reflected in our solid first quarter order total. The combination of strong market demand and our customer preferred portfolio of products and services that delivers superior fuel and operational performance, positions us exceptionally well for the future. Delivering our record backlog faster to speed the flow of new airplanes to customers and open additional positions for sale remains a priority. Production rate increases planned over the next 3 years will increase our output by more than 40% in support of these objectives. ","While damage from the recent severe weather in Wichita has not had a significant impact on our operations at our facility there, we are working closely with our major supplier partner, Spirit, as they continue to manage the challenges of their stressed infrastructure. We will continue to assess this evolving situation. However, we believe the impacts to be manageable.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security. Defining U.S. defense -- declining U.S. defense budget and shifting program priorities continue to pressure domestic markets. We were generally pleased with how Boeing programs fared in the President's fiscal year 2013 budget request, which contained strong support for the majority of our programs, including the F\/A 18, P-8A, Chinook, Apache and Osprey. We also see clear alignment in the proposed budget and the Defense Department's new strategic guidance with several of our targeted growth areas, including space, unmanned, ISR and cyber security.","We have been anticipating and preparing for a declining defense environment for several years. While the potential for sequestration has created additional uncertainty, we believe we are well positioned for continued success with our portfolio of proven, affordable and reliable systems and services, our focus on innovation and strong execution across our programs and our relentless effort to maximize efficiencies and reduce infrastructure costs.","Furthermore, we continue to foresee significant upside potential in growing international markets where we have made substantial share gains in recent years and expect to generate up to 30% of our revenues just a few years from now. In the first quarter, we went under contract for 84 new F-15s for Saudi Arabia, which will keep the F-15 viable for new sales for many years, and we secured several important C-17 foreign sales. These and other international orders led to a 20% increase in backlog for our Defense, Space & Security business.","Overall, despite pockets of economic uncertainty and U.S. defense budget pressures, the size and strength of our markets remain attractive and growing in the aggregate. Our total company backlog increased $24 billion in the first quarter and is broadly diverse by region, product type and customer. We anticipate this orders trend will continue, and we expect a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1 in both of our main businesses this year.","Turning to the first quarter highlights on Slide 3. We delivered strong operating performance across our core production and services programs in the first quarter, while achieving some key milestones in both Commercial and Defense. Commercial Airplanes generated healthy margins of 9.9%. We delivered 137 airplanes, including five 787s and six 747-8s, and we recorded net orders for 412 airplanes, including 301 firm orders for the 737 MAX. Customer response for the 737 MAX remains very positive. We continue to convert existing commitments to firm orders as planned, with a total of 451 recorded to date. ","Key deliveries for the first quarter included the 1,000th 777, the first 747-8 Intercontinental VIP airplane, and I should say Lufthansa will be receiving their first Intercontinental airplane today, if everything goes as planned, and the first two 787 -- 787s powered by GE engines. In addition, the first 747-Intercontinental airplane, as I mentioned, it will be delivered to Lufthansa hopefully today.","The 787s in service with launch customer, ANA, and now Japan Airlines, are performing well, with high dispatch reliability rates and a very favorable passenger response to the features and capabilities of the airplane. We recently transitioned the 787 production line to a build rate of 3.5 per month in final assembly in Everett, marking the second successful rate increase in the past 6 months. Condition of assembly and out-of-sequence work continues to significantly improve as we work closely with our supplier partners. These gains are driving productivity and demonstrating the ability of this production system, which is increasing our confidence as we systematically ramp up to higher rates and reduce the amount of post-assembly change incorporation required on each airplane.","We continue to estimate that the first 787 to go straight from final assembly to the flight line without a stop in our modification center will be a unit in the mid-60s rolling out of the factory this summer. Later this week, we will roll out the first 787 assembled in Charleston, South Carolina. Delivery of that airplane from our new Charleston customer delivery center is expected in midyear. ","We continue to increase the rate of 787 production. We expect to increase it, I should say, to 5 per month by the end of this year, which tracks to our plan to reach a rate of 10 per month in final assembly by late 2013.","Progress also continues at the Everett mod center to complete work on the airplanes that have come off the line but require further change incorporation work. With dedicated resources in place, we are using proven, repeatable processes to track the scope of work required on each airplane, maximize learning and reduce cycle time. As a result, we are seeing performance improvements with each airplane delivery.","Steady progress has also been made on development of the 787-9, with engineering design tracking to plan in support of first delivery scheduled for the second half of 2013 and first delivery -- first flight, I should say, scheduled second half of '13 and first delivery in early 2014. ","I'd be remiss at this point if I'd didn't mention a very proud moment for all Boeing employees that came in March, when the National Aeronautics Association recognized the 787 with the most prestigious award for aerospace excellence, the Collier Trophy. We are extremely proud of the game-changing technology embodied in the 787 and the associated value it provides to our customers. And I'm equally proud of the team that got the job done. ","Shifting to the 747-8, the 14 freighters now in service with 5 customers are performing extremely well. Progress on the production side is steady, too, as we continued to transition to reach a production rate of 2 airplanes per month this summer.","In addition to its sales momentum, the 737 MAX achieved a major development milestone in February when we began the final phase of wind tunnel testing. Design details are maturing to plan, and we are on schedule to reach firm configuration in 2013. We are working closely with our supplier partners to ensure successful production rate increases, not only on the 787 and the 747-8, but also on the 737 and the 777. Production rate on the 737 is planned to increase to 38 per month in the second quarter of 2013, and then up to 42 per month in the first half of 2014. Production on the 777 program will increase to 8.3 per month in the first quarter of 2013. These 2 franchise programs continue to generate substantial value for all of our stakeholders.","In Defense, Space & Security, this quarter, we delivered 30 aircraft and 3 satellites, generating solid operating results and margins of 9% across our well-balanced defense portfolio. In February, we marked a 1-year anniversary of receiving the U.S. Air Force contract to build the KC-46A. This program continues to be a successful team effort between the U.S. Air Force and Boeing. Over the past year, the program completed all milestones on or ahead of schedule. In March, we began the Preliminary Design Review with the U.S. Air Force, which is expected to complete later this week.","Additional key highlights in this sector included delivering the first P-8, low-rate initial production aircraft, completing Preliminary Design Review for the Commercial Crew Space Transportation system and the launch of our new 702 small satellite product line with an initial contract for 4 units. ","Our total company backlog of $380 billion is close to 5x our current annual revenue estimate. This record backlog positions us for significant growth potential in the years to come, and we continue to improve productivity and competitiveness throughout the business.","Now over to Greg, who will discuss the first quarter financial results and our outlook. Greg?","Gregory D. Smith","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with the first quarter financial results on Slide 4. ","Revenue for the quarter was $19.4 billion, up from last year, driven by higher Commercial Airplane delivery volume. Net earnings were $1.22 per share, including $0.11-per-share impact for a reduction in a litigation-related reserve. Operating margins at 8.1% and operating cash flow of $837 million reflect strong performance across our core businesses. ","Let me discuss our Commercial business on Slide 5.","Boeing Commercial Airplanes' first quarter revenue was $10.9 billion, up from last year, reflecting a planned and successfully executed increase in airplane deliveries. Commercial operating margins were 9.9%, up from a year ago, reflecting the increased deliveries, strong core operating performance across the business and lower R&D expenses. This was partially offset by higher period costs, which do include 787 fleet support and the dilutive effect of 787 and 747 deliveries.","During the quarter, we extended the accounting quantities on the 777 by 50 units and the 767 by 6 units. The financial impact of these extensions in the quarter was not significant as volume benefits are balanced with anticipated competitive pricing environment.","Gross inventory for the company included approximately $22 billion related to the 787 program, an expected increase of approximately $1.8 billion during the quarter. As we've mentioned previously, we expect gross inventory for the 787 to increase to $24 billion by year-end 2012 as we continue ramping up production rates. But this growth will moderate as deliveries increase.","Included in the work-in-process inventory are the deferred production costs. The deferred balance for the program was $11.9 billion at the end of the first quarter and includes approximately 53 airplanes still in-process. As I stated on the fourth quarter, the deferred production balance will continue to grow as we increase production rates and introduce the 787-9 derivative, peaking at slightly over $20 billion and then declining after the program achieves the planned rate of 10 per month and stabilizes at that level.","Improving profitability on both the 787 and the 747-8 programs continue to be a top priority for us as we proactively work opportunities to offset risks and improve margin. Commercial Airplanes won 412 net orders during the quarter, valued at $21 billion. The Commercial backlog remains strong with over 4,000 airplanes valued at a record $308 billion.","Moving now to Slide 6, and we'll discuss the Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported first quarter revenue of $8.2 billion with operating margins of 9%. Boeing Military Aircraft quarterly revenues increased 27% for the quarter to $4.3 billion, driven by the successfully completed key development milestones on the F-15 Saudi program. Operating margins remained strong at 10.1%.","Network & Space Systems revenue of $1.8 billion decreased last year, driven by the expected lower volume associated with the Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. As anticipated, operating margins decreased to 4.1% primarily due to lower volume and program mix in our satellite business.","Global Services & Support revenue increased 13% to $2.1 billion for the quarter, primarily driven by higher revenue on integrated logistics support. Operating margins were very strong at 10.9%, reflecting performance improvements on multiple integrated logistics programs.","Defense, Space & Security backlog significantly increased in the quarter to $72 billion, driven by F-15 and C-17 international orders. Over 35% of our current defense backlog represents international business. ","Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our other businesses. Boeing Capital generated $38 million in segment earnings in the quarter. The portfolio balance declined to $4.2 billion on normal portfolio runoff and asset sales with no new aircraft volume in the quarter. During the quarter, other segment expense was $79 million, while unallocated expense were essentially flat year-over-year, reflecting the $131 million reduction in the litigation-related reserve, which was offset by higher pension expense this year. ","Let's turn to Slide 8 and we'll discuss cash flow.","During the quarter, we generated $837 million of operating cash, reflecting increased commercial deliveries and advanced payments as well as progress payments on the Saudi F-15s. We expect cash flow to build over the course of the year as commercial deliveries increase, and we will continue to execute our disciplined cash management actions. ","Turning to cash and debt balances on Slide 9.","We ended the quarter with $10.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash and debt balances reflect the first quarter repayment of $774 million of BCC debt. Our cash position continues to provide strong liquidity and positions us well going forward. Capital expenditures of approximately $424 million were as expected. ","Turning now to Slide 10 to discuss our outlook for 2012. Our financial outlook continues to be balanced, reflecting strong operating performance on our production and services programs and is -- and has consideration for uncertainty and risks associated with ongoing business growth. We are increasing our earnings per share guidance to be between $4.15 and $4.35 per share to incorporate the reduction in a litigation-related reserve. All other financial guidance remains unchanged. Commercial deliveries forecast remains at about 585 to 600 airplanes. Our forecast continues to include a combined 70 to 85 787s and 747-8 deliveries split roughly equally between the 2 programs.","Overall, we're pleased with the first quarter performance as the core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. We expect that performance to continue as we remain focused on production program profitability, rate ramp-up and ongoing productivity improvements.","Now I'll turn it back to Jim for some final thoughts.","W. James McNerney","Thanks, Greg. With a strong first quarter, we've built on our momentum from 2011 and increased our confidence in meeting our goals for 2012. Our priorities and focus for the year remain the same: production ramp-up and profitability across all our Commercial Airplane programs; successful execution of ongoing development efforts on the 787-9, the 737 MAX and the Air Force Tanker; and repositioning our Defense business while extending our core programs and expanding internationally.","Now we'd be happy to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Jim, when we look at the 787, cost still look very high to us and -- based on deferred production numbers. And presumably, you'll be able to take a step function down in those costs at some point. And perhaps that point is when you get out in the line mid -- line numbers in the mid-60s in order to get the program on a track that's clearly profitable and ensure that your suppliers can uniformly deliver. Well, first, do you expect by midsummer when you get into those line numbers that you'll have high confidence that you're on that track? And what operational and financial goals are you following so that you'll know you're there when you've made it?","W. James McNerney","I -- well, it's a timely question. I just got back from Everett and Charleston, taking a look at the lines. Doug, I think our confidence grows every day, quite frankly, in our ability to deliver the learning curve that underlies our plans. I think we do have a high degree of confidence that the mid-60s line number will be -- will have the production lines flowing exactly the way we want it. And the change incorporation side of Everett is also performing well on those planes that -- where we did have a significant amount of rework. And that is going well, too. I mean, as we modify more planes, there's a learning curve involved there, too. And we are on track with both the regular production and the modification. I would also add that Charleston looks very good, and we -- you're going to see the rollout of the first airplane later this week and delivery this summer. And I think the learning curve progress in both places are giving me more and more confidence every day that the costs that underlie our plans are going to be met.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But are you expecting, though, that there's a point in time when we should see something that moves significantly lower? What I'm getting at is a lot of times in the early stages in a program, you may not come down on the learning curve smoothly but might have break points that -- you see a drop down and then you reset. I mean, are you looking for something like that?","W. James McNerney","Yes, I think, the -- I'm sorry, go ahead, Greg. You...","Gregory D. Smith","Yes. Just let me just try to take a shot at this, Doug, and give you some perspective. But certainly, when you look at a unit cost -- from a unit cost perspective, from the first airplane that was delivered, say, to like line 60, we're seeing about a 40% to 50% reduction in unit costs. And that's truly coming down that learning curve. Now there's no question it's bumpy when you look at it per unit because some of those airplanes have been in flow longer than others. But when you just generally look at the trajectory, it is coming down the curve that we would expect. When you asked that -- what do we look at specifically, obviously, we're tracking airplane by airplane versus what we would consider our target and budget. We're looking at out-of-position items on every airplane, shortages, condition of assembly, quality, flow time, how many hours we're burning per job versus what we budgeted. And all of that, obviously, given us the confidence to make either the next rate break or overall indicators the production health of the system.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So by midsummer, you're expecting -- so right now, things are lining up as you would like them to for midsummer when you get to this presumably smoother flow?","W. James McNerney","Yes. Yes.","Gregory D. Smith","Yes.","W. James McNerney","And we'll still have planes in change incorporation at that time, Doug, okay?","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Sure, sure.","W. James McNerney","But we'll be working that down, which is the second element of the equation. As that gets worked down on plan, and by the second half of the year, you should notice a significant decline in the number of those planes hanging around and delivered to customers. And so it's a combination of both the production line smoothing out beyond line mid-60s and change incorporation planes being delivered, I think, is going to give you the same confidence we have today.","Operator","And next we go to Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a clarification and then a question. Greg, on the accounting differences in the quarter. It looks like you have just about just over $1.2 billion. I wondered if you could comment on what the gross amount would have been for the development programs and whether that was materially higher than the net that you reported for the quarter.","Gregory D. Smith","Yes. So on that difference, about -- roughly about 80%, 85% of it was 787 related, if that helps you.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Yes. And so the remainder would have been 7 4. But what -- on a gross basis, was that in excess of $1.2 billion? And we had negative spending in other programs?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, yes. So for -- yes. Well, no, there was positive on -- particularly on 777 and 737. That was about $150 million to $200 million.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And you stated briefly that improving profitability on the 87 and the 47 were -- was a focus.","Gregory D. Smith","Yes.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Would you think it's possible? I mean, I'm not thinking short term here. But per that comment, would you think it's possible to increase the reported margins on these programs without seeing block extensions? Is that something that's was in the realm of...","Gregory D. Smith","Yes. Yes, that is. I mean, certainly, block extensions would help. But putting that aside, just to give you some -- I talked about -- on the last call, but we're looking, obviously, within the factory, and some of the stuff we just talked to Doug about. But also within the supply chain, we've got about 300 to 400 different projects in-work right now that are all around profitability. So as those mature -- and some of those, obviously, won't all come to fruition, but the ones that do mature, then we'll put them in the booking rate.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","What's the sort of general timeline on those sorts of projects?","Gregory D. Smith","They really range, but we've got a good process in place for identifying them and then bringing them to maturity. But just depending on how complex they are, Carter, depends on how we can get comfortable that we can really capture the productivity that maybe was initially identified as we went through the process. And as I said, we're doing that with our supply chain as well and utilizing our experience with this and some of our lean experts, and bringing them out to the supply chain. And we're going to be doing a lot more of that going forward as we continue to focus on profitability on this program.","Operator","And we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about your guidance? And you basically said nothing really changed other than this reserve reversal, and yet there was significant upside in the quarter. And I'm trying to think about go -- what's not sustainable? We know the 87 is going to drag down the BCA margin. But the flip side is -- certainly, NSS margin was well below what you're saying it's going to be for the year. So can you just talk about the remainder of the year?","Gregory D. Smith","Sure. Well, as you said, we had a great first quarter and off to a great start, but it's early. When you look at the balance of the year, I think we've got great plans in place to execute. But we do have the, as you said, the dilutive impact on the margins on the 87 and the 47. We've got some plans for investment in some productivity tools. As we get these programs at a higher rate, we're again looking for further opportunity to streamline the production system and lower flow times. Obviously, we got some taxes with those higher deliveries in the back half of the year. And then we do have some provisioning for just risks and uncertainties that are just tied to -- in fact, we got to make another rate break, which, again, I -- we got good plans in place to do on the 87. And we got a 47 rate break coming up. And so we're just kind of provisioning for that as we execute. Now if we execute through that, that'll certainly give us more confidence, and we'll come back to you.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And anything about NSS? Why margins were so low this quarter and why they should recover to kind of 7.5% over the course of the year?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, yes. I mean, so some of it is volume. It's just BCTM coming down, as we expected. We had fewer launches in the quarter. And then we had a mix between -- on the satellites between government and commercial. And then some adjustments, some small adjustments to EAC. So that's basically it. And we see good plans in place to recover, to be within our guidance for the balance of the year.","Operator","And we'll go to Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'd like to come back to the 87 with just a couple more numbers, probably the only ones you haven't provided. And that's -- could you give us the WIP at the end of the quarter, the total WIP on the 787? And also, I'm wondering, Greg, if you could break out, this might be helpful, the $1.2 billion increase in deferred production costs? Is there any way of breaking that out between units, excess over average and change incorporation? Does that -- I think that might give us a better sense as to how things are tracking. Finally, on the same point, and sorry for the 3-part question, but it's all kind of the same thing, you already gave a nice number of 40% to 50% reduction in unit costs on the 87 over -- thus far. I'm wondering if that somehow you could quantify the improvement you're seeing in change incorporation. Because certainly, it didn't -- it looked like you had some setbacks during the quarter.","Gregory D. Smith","Yes. Okay, let me start there. I mean -- yes. I mean, when you look at those units, as I said, 40%, 50% on average is what we're seeing. On the change incorp airplanes, certainly a lot -- they're all different depending on what condition of assembly and what changes need to put in place. So what we have there is kind of traditional metrics in place about cost per job and how many open jobs are left, et cetera, by airplane, by section of the airplane. And that's where we look at the productivity there of are we achieving the plans that we have in place there or not? I would tell you as of now, we're within our plans. So what we had originally thought that it would take to complete those airplanes, we're coming down that trajectory. So certainly, still a lot of work to do there, but we're making good progress. I would tell you we're trying to take advantage of learning in a nontraditional assembly environment, where we've got the airplanes broken out depending on the number and the complexity of the jobs open, and we've got mechanics assigned to the same job. So an example. If you're assigned to take this wire harness out on this airplane, you're taking it out on future airplanes. And we hopefully capture a learning within, and we've experienced that up to now. So I think we've got that well understood. But certainly, a lot of work in front of us. But I think it's operating very well. Your other question on 787, it's about $22 billion gross inventory.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What was the WIP portion of that, though, if you have that? I got the other number off the call. But...","Gregory D. Smith","About $17 billion.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","$17 billion. And then of the $1.2 billion in deferred production costs during the quarter, can you break that out between the 2 components? What is unit 50, whatever? And what is fixing up unit #15?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, most of it is in the factory, not in change incorp.","Operator","And we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Greg, if we could stay on that topic and maybe throw a few more numbers out now that we have the WIP. I -- if I go back to Q3, it looks like unit cost was a little over $300 million, and deferred production by unit was about 2\/3 of that. So let's call it $216 million. And then using the numbers you just gave us, the $216 million has dropped about $10 million a quarter. I calculate $196 million for Q1 in deferred production per unit. And the total unit cost is about $279 million. So down 13%. That $279 million, based on the comment that you made earlier, about a 40% to 50% drop, am I to understand that, that gets down to the $200 million level or $190 million by the time we get to that line number you talk about?","Gregory D. Smith","I mean, it's 40% to 50% from the first delivery to about line 60.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Oh, that's where I'm getting...","Gregory D. Smith","And that's on average. But I can tell you -- and hopefully, this answers your question, but we're seeing unit cost improvement on the airplane quarter-over-quarter.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is -- from a deferred production basis, maybe this is the best way to talk about it, you've done a little over -- about $10 million per quarter. How do you see that curve continuing over the rest of the year by quarter?","Gregory D. Smith","Ask that again, I'm sorry.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, so we've gone down about $10 million per quarter in deferred production on a unit basis. So let's call $216 million in Q3. We're at $196 million in Q1. Does that $10 million start to expand and accelerate each quarter from here on out? How do we think about that $10 million evolving?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, it does. But as I said earlier, on a -- when you look at it on a unit basis, it's not linear because of the different airplanes that you're delivering. So you're delivering some out of change incorp, you're delivering some out of final line. So it's not -- you're not going to see the linear effect quarter-over-quarter here. But overall, it's -- we're seeing improvement on a unit cost basis.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is it fair then, Greg, to ask the question what should the number be on that 60? On that first airplane that avoids the mod?","Gregory D. Smith","What number?","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On line 60. Since that aircraft is now a modless airplane, according to what Jim said, it's -- it doesn't have that stop, that interim stop. What should the deferred production be at that point? You will have gotten the out-of-sequence stuff out of the way.","Gregory D. Smith","Well, I mean, all I can tell you is that on a unit basis, it's a 50% improvement. When you -- that's what we look at as, obviously, we look at the deferred production. But we're looking at improvements and coming down learning curves, we look at it on a unit by unit basis, and that's essentially what we're seeing right now.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just to finish up on the topic, you said $24 billion at the end of the year in terms of 78 inventory, I think you said?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What is that number when deferred production stops growing, out a couple of years from now? Which I think is what James guided to maybe a few quarters back.","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, I don't think we've talked about that specifically. What we did talk about is that deferred production will hit about $20 billion at about -- in 2013. And then as we continue at 10 per month, that'll start to burn off.","Operator","And we'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to go back to the -- a few questions ago on the full year outlook. I believe last quarter you said that you expected 20% of the full year earnings to land in the first quarter. And you now have 29% of the full year earnings having occurred in the quarter, 27% if we take that 11 out of the numerator and the denominator. So that would either mean that, one, your full year number is just too low; or two, you had a decent amount for earnings occur earlier in the year than you anticipated. Can you say which of those it is? And if it's the latter, what happened?","Gregory D. Smith","Well, we had -- obviously, we had the onetime on the legal reserve and then we had Saudi. So as you know, we started that contract early, and we reached an agreement. And we were able to meet those milestones and capture that revenue in the first quarter, all in the first quarter. So that was pretty significant, not something that would continue through the balance of the year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just on the balance of the year, the -- to get into the BCA margin guidance, you have to have significantly lower BCA margins than you did in the first quarter. And you've talked about what some of those inputs are. The one I struggled the most with is just the new program period expense. Can you quantify as of now how you expect that to play out through the rest of the year?","Gregory D. Smith","It is purely on fleet support or just in general?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Well, both if you can.","Gregory D. Smith","Yes. I mean, we expect fleet support to kind of moderate now that we've reached the level from -- going from Q4, Q4 last year to Q1 this year. So that -- we expect that to moderate. But there is some increases in period expense like I talked about earlier that we're expecting in the kind of third, fourth quarter timeframe. That, combined with the dilution, is really what -- what's driving that. And like we said, we're provisioning for some uncertainties as we get through these rate breaks, which we certainly plan to, and we got good plans in place, we'll readdress it.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you quantify what the fleet support is and what the other period expense is?","Gregory D. Smith","No. Not yet. I mean, I just -- they're essentially in line with what we had this quarter. And primarily all driven by 87.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, I'm going to change the subject entirely, and we're going to talk something called orders and opportunity, okay?","Gregory D. Smith","I think that was our...","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","We beat the rest of that to death. The -- you've signed an agreement with Embraer. You've been able to extend the C-17 line. The F-15 capability on the Saudi airplane is better than the U.S. Air Force has today. Could you talk about what you're doing to make that military portfolio more attractive?","W. James McNerney","Well, you've named a couple of things right there. I mean, I think the C-17 affordability and acceptance on a global basis is progressing. The F-18, which you didn't mention, is a highly affordable aircraft. The last multiyear took significant cost out of the aircraft and shared it with our customer. I think our Satellite business, if you look at the market share associated over the last 12 months and also going forward, looks very promising. You've seen an expansion of our product line in the Satellite business to the medium power and the smaller satellites, both of which have good launch orders. I think the Helicopter business remains very committed, too, even in a very difficult budgetary environment, and our position in the Helicopter business is about as strong as you can get. And it's -- and I -- and that's clearly because any conflicts that can be envisioned out there are -- in many ways are buttressed by a strong position to be able to move troops around regionally quickly. There's a -- and then, of course, we've invested significantly over the last few years either through prototyping or external growth and acquisition in cyber, unmanned and ISR. So we're trying to position ourselves well for that world that's coming at us. And when you add it all up, both on market share on the international side is increasing, and our -- the -- and our position within the U.S. budget is strong. And I didn't even mention P-8 and Tanker, which are the 2 growth programs that are on top of all of that. So we feel like it's a down environment in defense. We feel about as well positioned as we could be. And as you know, we're addressing the cost issue very aggressively on top of all of that.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Well, maybe what I'm -- I don't want to take too much -- but is there anything more immediate? I mean, for example, with Embraer in Brazil. I mean, is there -- I mean, clearly, the Pentagon recognizes a need to improve relationships there, and you've signed some agreements. Is this a foreshadowing of an improvement in your competitive position? Or is this still a long putt?","W. James McNerney","When you talk about -- I see. So...","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","F-18 sales to Brazil.","W. James McNerney","Yes, yes. Okay, I...","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Sorry, Jim.","W. James McNerney","So when you say Embraer, you're talking about some localization efforts we've got in Brazil. I see. Yes, I mean, the F-18 Brazil competition is along with similar competition in the UAE and other places. I mean, we have some significant international opportunities. I think we have a good shot in Brazil.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just one quick numbers follow-up. If I look at your pre-R&D numbers on Commercial, Greg, versus a year ago, they're about 300-basis-point difference. Is that most of the period cost and other items you have addressed? Because it sort of masks what would appear to be productivity improvements in the core business.","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, I think you got it, Howard.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on the 37 and the 777. Can you talk about both the pricing environment as well as the productivity environment on those 2 programs and what your view is on margin rates for those 2 programs as we move out over the next couple of years?","W. James McNerney","I think the summary on pricing is 777 steady, steady as she goes, capturing value, in many ways a uniquely positioned airplane today and significant productivity associated both with better conversion and with taking up rate. So the margin environment there, I would say, is good and favorable going forward. 37, all of the comments I just made on productivity apply. Significant productivity, both absorption kind of productivity due to increased rate as well as conversion productivity per unit. Slightly more aggressive pricing environment due to the introduction of the MAX and the NEO. So there's launch customer kinds of pricing that have happened in a few cases. But I think at the end of the day, the -- we anticipate about half of that market, which is a big number. And we see a pricing environment that's not too different than the pricing environment we've had historically after we get through some of the launch customer -- loss -- launch customer pricing, which is part and parcel with our business.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. So does the -- did the productivity gain offset the pricing pressure so that margins can remain resilient? Or do we see some pressure on margins?","W. James McNerney","Yes. Well, our philosophy is that we don't let pricing get in the way of margins. And the answer to that is productivity. So that's the plan.","Operator","And we'll go to Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, a question for you. I've been thinking about your product lineup versus what your airline customers seem to want and the sort of growing trend towards up-gauging. Can you talk to us a little bit about what your strategy is to address the airline needs to -- that currently operate 757s on the North Atlantic and the 57 users where they can't replace their planes with A321s or 900ERs? Or if they have to choose, they appear to be leaning towards the A321 versus the 900ERs. What's your strategy to fill that hole?","W. James McNerney","Well, I think job 1 is to get the MAX in the marketplace. And as you point out, the MAX-9 and the A321 do fill a lot of that mission. Now admittedly, I think there -- when you compare it only to a 757, there is a -- you've either got to stress this -- the -- A3 stretch in the sense of stretch economically or mission-wise the -9 or the A321 into some of the thicker routes that the 75 is involved with. And I think we're trying to think through exactly how to fill that market. But the largest part of that segment is going to be filled by the larger versions of the narrow-body. But there's some product planning we have yet to do to do it, and we'll announce that in due course.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right, great. And a follow-up to Jason's question. The -- some of us are hearing anecdotally that the A320 NEO pricing is either at current A320 prices or, in some cases, seems to be below. So did I hear you correctly in terms of what you've intimated on pricing on the MAX that you offset efficiency with possibly deleterious pricing? Is this also -- but is there also embedded escalation help offset that?","W. James McNerney","Yes, it -- I mean, you know the equation. I mean, there are some competitive environments where the price, like it often does in these introductory environments, where the price was pretty aggressive, even more aggressive than an immediate productivity plan to offset the margin we have today. But our judgment is that over the long term, as you look at history and how these kind of pricing environments sort out, even when you're conservative, we feel comfortable that productivity in the long run, on a program basis, can offset the pricing, any pricing environment we see.","Operator","And next we go to Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","This is the first quarter I can remember in history when you didn't have some kind of slip or screwup on the 787. So you've reiterated your guidance for 35 to 42 deliveries this year. Could you give us some color in terms of how that rolls out by quarter? And are there any opportunities, now that you've seen to have it under somewhat better control, to exceed those numbers or be at the upper end as opposed to just getting in at the low end?","W. James McNerney","Lee -- Cai, I would just say overall, as we've said, as we get beyond the engineering change and we stabilize the production base, this business will become more and more predictable in terms of its projected execution. And I'm -- it's -- I don't know whether to laugh or cry at the award you just gave us. First quarter ever. But having said that, we have increasing confidence that as the issue becomes more and more centered on production execution, which this company does pretty well, and we reduce the risk significantly on change incorporation and supply chain, we have growing confidence. Now the guidance we've given you has some back-end loadedness to it, and that's just because that's the way the production ramp is happening and that's the way the learning improvement in change incorporation is happening that Greg talked about. And so I would say while there may be an opportunity to do better than the low end of that guidance, and I think there is, but we're -- the guidance is what it is, I think the ramp nature of it leads us to be conservative and to call it that way as we sit here today.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And could you give us some update in terms of your headcount in BCA? Is that -- has that peaked? And what should we look for going forward and the implications for productivity?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, Cai...","W. James McNerney","Yes, go ahead, Greg.","Gregory D. Smith","It does peak this year. And then as we kind of ramp off down on the development programs and come up more on the production programs and then with productivity, it comes down in 2013. That's the projection right now.","Operator","And we'll go to David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You guys had this delamination issue pop up during the first quarter on 87. Can you give us an update how things are progressing there, how many airplanes have had the issue did you fix? Is it taking the 10 to 14 days that Pat talked about, I think, back in February?","W. James McNerney","Yes. I mean, I think the -- as I think we told you then and as we feel today, the fix was understood quickly. It had to do with workmanship. The workaround was quickly identified. I think it is now -- has dovetailed both into change incorporation and the line. I think roughly 14, 15 airplanes have already been reworked. I think in our world, it did have a schedule impact within our month-to-month schedules, which we don't share with you, that doesn't impact our guidance for the year at all. But I would say, understood, fixed, moving forward and we're in good shape.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And Greg, you talked about Saudi being a positive in the quarter. Can you quantify how much that was?","Gregory D. Smith","I'm sorry?","W. James McNerney","Saudi.","Gregory D. Smith","Oh, Saudi. About $800 million.","Stephanie Pope","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","And that will be with Rob Stallard with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, you mentioned in your prepared comments the production rate increases that have planned for the next 3 years at BCA. There has been some industry commentary that perhaps you and Airbus could be oversupplying the market. How do you get yourself comfortable that your customers are not over-ordering and there's not double booked slots [indiscernible]?","W. James McNerney","Well, I mean, obviously, we manage a process that tries to separate the wheat from the chaff implied in that question. I mean, we work very closely with our customers, understand the financeability of what they want to do, understand their fleet plans. In many cases, as you know, Rob, the demand for these airplanes is driven as much by fuel efficiency as it is by supporting growth. So -- and the price of oil, where it is and where most people think it's going to go, a lot of the demand is driven by replacing older aircraft or aircraft that may not have -- and that this may happen -- this may happen to a greater degree today than it has happened before because financial markets remain open to finance these things and this is all about improving the bottom line of the airlines. So it's some growth, particularly in Asia and Middle East, it's replacement in the developed markets supported by financing that's there. Then I would ask all the questions you'd be asking about: Is this a bubble? Is this -- can you support the growth? Are you going to be in business? And if we get to the point of seeing it differently, we'll adjust our plans.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. For members of the media, if you have a question [Operator Instructions] I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communication. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Tom Downey","Thank you. We will continue with the questions for Jim and Greg. If you have any questions after the session ends, please call our Media Relations team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we're ready for the first question. And in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question, please.","Operator","And we'll go to Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal.","Jon Ostrower","A question about the prospective takeover of  American Airlines or merger between U.S. Airways and American Airlines there. Can you give some thoughts on what that order -- how would that merger, rather -- may mean for your order backlog? Obviously, there's -- U.S. Airways, which has been heavily leaning towards Airbus for the last, more than a decade. And can you just kind of share your thoughts on what it may mean for actually reaching 42 a month and really holding there for a while on narrow-bodies?","W. James McNerney","Well, obviously, we'll confront whatever environment we find. But I think the -- American is working through the process now, and they -- and we support them emerging from this thing as a stronger airline. If at that point, a merger makes sense to the 2 managements of the company, we'll support that as well. Obviously, U.S. Air does have more Airbus airplanes than Boeing airplanes right now, and American has got more Boeing airplanes than Airbus airplanes. And that's because of the missions they fly. So we've seen mergers before. If it happens -- it's not clear that this one's going to happen, by the way, in our view. But if it does, we'll confront the environment that we've confronted before and we tend to do pretty well.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Drew with The New York Times.","Christopher Drew","Can -- if we can go back to Tanker for a minute. As you look back now over the past year, do you have a -- any better sense of why Airbus didn't bid lower as a first -- EADS didn't bid lower, first question. And then the second, there's been various stories about whether it was costing you, how much more it might be costing you or the government than you expected. And if you could sort of address where all that stands now.","W. James McNerney","Well, it's hard for me to know exactly why Airbus bid what they did or didn't. I think -- or EADS in this case. The -- I will say we were aggressive, as I have said, and we worked our supply chain very, very hard and got the same kind of commitments from them that we, in turn, were making to the Air Force, which is a fixed-price development environment. So a lot of elbow grease, a lot of working with partners in advance to get to a number that we thought was aggressive but responsible. We have known all along that the tightest part of the program for us will be the development phase, which is what we're in right now. But we're hitting every milestone. I believe, based on what they've said publicly, our customer is happy with the progress. We're focused on it every day. And there's no doubt that this is an aggressively bid program, but the war fighter and our customer is benefiting from our efficiencies. And the last thing I'd say is that we brought together the Defense side and the Commercial side of our company together more aggressively than we've been able to do historically, and we took a lot of inefficiency out of teaming together as One Boeing to get this pricing capability where it should be, as well as working with our supply base. So elbow grease is the answer to your question.","Operator","And next we go to Mike Mecham with Aviation Week.","Michael Mecham","I'd like to follow up a little bit on the situation with where you are in 737 MAX. Also, where you have been hit and how, from the situation in Wichita. Which programs, if there is any particular program, stands out as perhaps taking the most problem with this, if you can?","W. James McNerney","Sure. I mean, just an update on the 737 MAX program. We're on schedule. We have got the statement of work that we're going to do and not do. We'll have firm configuration next year. We think we struck the right balance between containing the work statement to reduce risk and providing the new engines and some other tweaks that bear only on the efficiency of this airplane for our customers. So we're feeling good. I think Wichita, the -- as you know, the Spirit operation supports a number of our programs. The -- where they have the most content is the 737. And they've been back to work full-time starting this Monday after roughly a week's delay. And we are cautiously optimistic that there will be no material impact to our programs, any of our programs, this year. And we'll update you if any of that changes.","Michael Mecham","Is there any part of this natural disaster situation in Japan and elsewhere that has caused the company to rethink? Or have you launched any rethink of your various facilities around the world? And just exactly what threats they're under and how they and you need to respond?","W. James McNerney","Well, I think you've seen us take some moves to diversify our manufacturing base somewhat. Charleston is an example. And that's -- that is an element of the thinking.","Operator","Our next question is from Brendan Kearney with Post and Courier.","Brendan Kearney","Jim, 2 quick questions. First, you said that the first delivery from South Carolina will be midyear in summer. Is that different from the June and second quarter estimates that other company officials have offered? And second, you noted you were here in Charleston yesterday. Are you making a return trip to Charleston this week for Friday's rollout? And which musician do you hope to hear perform at that event?","W. James McNerney","No, no, I didn't -- as to the first part of your question, the -- no, no change. I mean, it's -- those are one and the same comments. I'm just using slightly different wording. The -- and Jim Albaugh will be leading the entourage on Friday.","Tom Downey","Operator, we have time for one last question this morning.","Operator","That will be from Steve Wilhelm with Puget Sound Business Journal.","Steve Wilhelm","I just had 2 quick questions. One is, could you characterize the production lines in Everett and Charleston and just how they're different? What ways that they're approaching things differently or the learning curves are different because of their experience? And is -- that's one question. And then secondly, there's been a lot of rumors about your turbo fan option for the MAX. I just wondered if you could address that.","W. James McNerney","Yes, I mean, I think the point of the 2 production lines in Everett and Charleston is more that we're trying to make them the same than we're trying to make different. We're trying to leverage the same processes, the same learning across our company. So leaving the change incorporation side of Everett aside for a second, the 2 production lines, as we envision them and as we're managing them, are -- we're trying to duplicate and learn rather than separate and be different. The -- what was the second part of your question?","Gregory D. Smith","The gear turbo fan.","W. James McNerney","The gear turbo fan, the -- yes. The -- right now, as I think we've announced many, many times, we are working exclusively with CFM on the MAX, and we're very happy with the development there. We're confident that we can meet the targets that our customers need and that we've promised them. So that's our plan going forward.","Tom Downey","That concludes our earnings call.

Welcome to the Boeing Company's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions, are being broadcast live over the Internet. ","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead.","Maurita Sutedja","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's First Quarter 2019 Earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy. ","After management comments, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation to our website at boeing.com. ","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we include in our discussions this morning are likely to involve risks, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web representation. ","In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. ","Now I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me start by saying that all of us at Boeing have been deeply affected by the accidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia beyond anything I can recall in my 34 years with this great company. We all feel the loss and the gravity of these events personally, and we continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crews on-board the flights. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the flight crews and passengers who fly on our airplanes. We know every person who steps aboard one of our airplanes places their trust in us, and we are committed to earning and re-earning that trust and confidence. ","Recent events have been a deep reminder of the importance of our enduring values at Boeing: safety, quality, and integrity, even more so in the difficult times we face now. Our work demands the utmost excellence. These recent accidents have intensified our commitment to continuous improvement as we design, build, and support the safest airplanes in the sky. That's our responsibility to our customers and their passengers. We own it. ","I know from personal experience that when there's something that we can do to make any of our products better and safer, we will do it. If there's something that we can do to help our customers improve the training and education of their pilots or mechanics, we will bring that forward. If there's something that we can do to make airplane development programs or the certification process better and safer, we will pursue it. Our culture is to go above and beyond, to deliver safe airplanes and live by a commitment to continuous improvement. ","Ever since the Lion Air accident, our top technical experts, engineers, and test pilots have been working with regulators from all over the world on a software update that will make the 737 MAX one of the safest airplanes ever to fly. Our test pilots now completed over 135 flights, totaling more than 230 hours of airtime with the software update. We are taking a disciplined approach, completed our technical flight-testing last week, and look forward to completing near-term milestones leading to final certification. ","As part of our continued collaboration with hundreds of stakeholders, nearly 90% of our 50-plus MAX operators around the world have participated in simulator sessions that include the software update. We're committed to ensuring all who operate the MAX are fully prepared when the grounding is lifted and the fleet returns to service. This includes a comprehensive package of training and educational resources that we're developing and deploying. ","In light of our commitment to continually improve safety, as we have always done, I've asked the Boeing Board of Directors to establish a committee to review our company-wide policies and processes for the design and development of the airplanes we build and to assure the highest level of safety on the 737 MAX program as well as our other airplane programs and to recommend improvements to our policies and procedures. ","As we continue to work through these steps, and as previously announced, we adjusted the 737 production system temporarily from 52 aircraft per month to 42 per month to accommodate the pause in MAX deliveries, allowing us to prioritize additional resources to focus on safely returning the MAX to service. This decision will also enable us to invest in the broader health and quality of our production system and supply chain. We will continue to assess our production plans, and we'll make decisions at various waypoints as to whether further rate adjustments are needed based on information we have at that time. ","The timing of return to service for the MAX will continue to be paced by ongoing work with global regulators and our customers. Our previously issued 2019 financial guidance does not reflect the MAX impacts. Due to the uncertainty of the timing and conditions surrounding the return to service of the 737 MAX fleet, new guidance will be issued at a future date. ","I want to personally thank the various government agencies, our industry partners, and my Boeing teammates for their tireless efforts over the past few weeks and months. This includes the more than 600 737 suppliers, many of whom are small to midsized businesses, who have stepped up to work with us as we navigate the 737 production plan changes. We could not build our airplanes without them. ","On behalf of the entire Boeing team, I also want to thank our customers and their passengers for enduring the disruption caused by this issue. We deeply regret the impact this has created. ","Our company's 100-year-plus legacy is built on the foundation of developing, producing, and supporting safe products. We are committed to ensuring the 737 MAX achieves the highest standards for safety, performance and reliability. ","Now let me turn to an overview of our first quarter operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and how we are maintaining financial discipline and prudently managing liquidity as we work through the safe return-to-service of the MAX. ","With that, let's move to Slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our teams across the company during the quarter, we recorded revenue of $22.9 billion and core earnings per share of $3.16, reflecting lower volume of 737 deliveries, partially offset by higher defense and services volume. We generated $2.8 billion of operating cash and paid $1.2 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year. ","Now let's look at the first quarter operating performance for our businesses. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $11.8 billion reflecting 149 deliveries. Fewer 737s were delivered in the quarter due to the grounding of the 737 MAX. We saw healthy widebody orders in the quarter, and our backlog remains robust at more than 5,600 airplanes worth $399 billion. Key commercial milestones in the quarter included the 787 program's smooth transition to rate 14 per month while maintaining the highest quality standards, and the first 777X flight test airplane rolled out after passing the factory gauntlet test. 777X flight testing will begin this year with first delivery and entry into service as scheduled for 2020. ","Now over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported first quarter revenue of $6.6 billion and booked $12 billion of new orders, demonstrating the value we bring to our customers across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio. These orders included a multiyear contract for 78 F-18 Super Hornets; contract for five Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles for the U.S. Navy; 5 E-7 AEW&C aircraft for the U.K. Royal Air Force; and 19 P-8 Poseidon aircraft for the U.S. Navy, Royal Norwegian Navy, and the U.K. Royal Navy. Key milestones for BDS included completion of the first Ground-Based Midcourse Defense test with two interceptors, demonstrating the robustness of the system, successful environmental testing of the Commercial Crew spacecraft and the first flight of the SB>1 DEFIANT helicopter. We delivered the first 7 KC-46 Tankers to the U.S. Air Force in the quarter, with the eighth delivered just this past Friday. We are committed to continuous improvement in delivering the highest quality products to our customers. We look forward to working with the Air Force and the Navy during their initial operational test and evaluation of the KC-46 as we further demonstrate the operational capabilities of this next-generation aircraft across refueling, mobility, and combat weapon systems missions.","Turning to Global Services. BGS reported revenue of $4.6 billion, representing 17% growth year-on-year. Since its operations began in July of 2017, BGS' growth has consistently outpaced the average for the services market. BGS continues to win new business, highlighting the value we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers and the strength of our One Boeing offerings. During the quarter, BGS won new business totaling approximately $4 billion, which included contracts for V-22 Performance-Based Logistics for the U.S. Navy and P-8A training for the U.K. Royal Air Force, an order for GECAS for 10 737-800 converted freighters and an agreement to optimize crew operations for Royal Air Maroc. Additionally, BGS expanded its global distribution of hardware and chemical products through a long-term agreement with Dubai-based Joramco. ","Also in the quarter, to expand its rapidly growing unparalleled digital services portfolio, BGS completed the acquisition of ForeFlight, a leading provider of innovative mobile- and web-based aviation applications. We also achieved a major milestone in our proposed strategic partnership with Embraer. On February 26, Embraer received its shareholder approval to proceed with the deal with over 97% support. Over the coming months, we'll continue to work with Embraer, global regulators and other stakeholders to complete the transaction and create the most important strategic partnership in the aerospace industry. ","In summary, our current first order of business is to -- is the safe return to service of the 737 MAX, and we've made the adjustments necessary to allow our teams to prioritize additional resources and focus on this effort. At the same time, we are maintaining our focus on keeping the business strong and healthy. As they demonstrated in the first quarter, our team continues to execute on operating performance and capture noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog. ","With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in commercial; defense, space; and services. These are sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals, with a combined market opportunity of $8.1 trillion over the next 10 years. As a global company with more than 100 years of history and customers in 150 countries, we value and maintain strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world, reinforcing the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. Recent events underscore the value and importance of those relationships. ","In commercial aviation, global passenger traffic continues to grow faster than GDP and long-term trends. In 2018, we saw the ninth straight year of above trend growth passenger traffic. So far in 2019, passenger traffic has grown at 5.9% through February. ","On the air cargo market, we saw a contraction in the year-to-date traffic. While we expect the cargo traffic headwinds to linger in the near term, we anticipate recovery in the latter part of the year. Our view of the demand fundamentals remains unchanged. We remain highly confident in our industry outlook, which forecasts the demand for nearly 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, which will help double the size of the global fleet. We believe the changing nature of travel has fundamentally expanded traffic patterns and supports sustained growth. At the same time, airlines are maintaining capacity discipline and keeping supply and demand in balance as industry profitability remains near historic highs. ","I will also note as an aside that there's a demand for nearly 800,000 qualified pilots over the next 20 years and around 750,000 maintenance technicians. And we, at Boeing, are committed to doing more to ensure that, that demand is met. You'll hear more from us on this as we work with global partners to develop the way forward. ","It is clear that long-term demand fundamentals provide a solid foundation for our commercial business. There also is more balance between airplanes purchased for fleet growth and replacement, leading to more stable purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in these key market dynamics in aggregate continues to drive less cyclicality for our industry. ","The narrowbody segment will command the largest share of new deliveries. We expect airlines to need more than 31,000 single-aisle airplanes in the next 20 years. These new airplanes will continue to stimulate growth and provide required replacements for older, less efficient airplanes. Our 737 program has a backlog of more than 4,400 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. ","In the widebody segment, we have seen steady orders for the 787 and the 777, and we have high confidence in a meaningful increase in widebody replacement demand early next decade. The current generation 777 continues its steady sales momentum with two new orders from DHL. These additional orders brought the backlog to 92 aircraft and provide further support for the 777 bridge. ","Turning to 777X. We added a new customer in the quarter with 18 new orders, plus 24 options from IAG Group, the parent or British Airways. We are honored that British Airways has selected the 777X as part of its fleet for its next century. These orders bring total 777X orders and commitments to 364, a strong foundation that supports our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We continue to focus on further bolstering the 777X skyline. We continue to expect the delivery rate to be approximately 3.5 aircraft per month in 2019 as we transition to the 777X with a slight increase in 2020 as we continue to assess 777 demand as well as 777X timing. ","The 787 Dreamliner extended its status as the fastest-selling, twin-aisle jet in history with 38 net orders in the quarter, adding to more than 1,400 since the program launched. With approximately 600 aircraft in our 787 backlog, our current production rate of 14 airplanes per month is well supported. In the quarter, we captured 38 new orders for 787, including 20 from Lufthansa and 10 from Bamboo Airways. Also earlier this month, we delivered the first 787-10 to All Nippon Airways. With this milestone delivery, ANA becomes the first airline in Asia to operate the entire Dreamliner family. The market-leading fuel efficiency of the 787 has enabled ANA and more than 50 other airlines to open more than 230 new nonstop routes around the world. ","On our 767 program, we added four new 767 freighter orders in the quarter. And as previously announced, we plan to increase the 767 production rate from 2.5 per month to three per month in 2020. ","At Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. The BDS portfolio is well positioned with mature, world-class platforms to address current needs and innovative, capable and affordable new franchise programs to build the future. We continue to see broad support for our products from the Pentagon, NASA and Congress. The President's fiscal year 2020 budget proposal includes the purchase of Boeing F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, Apache and V-22 Osprey rotorcraft, JDAM weapons, satellite programs and key commercial derivative programs like the KC-46 Tanker and the P-8, among other platforms. ","Our fighter line is in one of the healthiest positions since the start of the decade. We continue see support for the F-18 through the recent multiyear award, which will take deliveries through 2023. We expect to continue delivering Super Hornets off our production and service like modification lines to the U.S. Navy into the 2030s, where they will be at the forefront of naval aviation for decades to come. ","At the same time, the President's budget leverages billions of dollars on technology upgrades made by Allied Nations to pursue and purchase the next-generation Eagle, the F-15X, allowing U.S. Air Force to replace its fleet of F-15Cs with a more capable, survivable and affordable air superiority fighter. ","We are also maintaining a clear focus on future franchises, including the ongoing MQ-25 and T-X development programs with flight test scheduled for this year, our NASA Commercial Crew and Space Launch System programs at the leading edge of space exploration and the GBSD competition. Demand from outside the U.S. for our defense and space offerings also remains high, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. ","Turning to the Services sector. We see the $2.8 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. BGS provides agile, cost-competitive services to our customers worldwide. We aim to continue growing faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services' offerings and continue to gain market share. Strong orders of $4 billion in the quarter reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational costs through the life cycle. Our expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well positioned to compete and win in this sector. ","In summary, the growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains committed to growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future. Our One Boeing strategy and offerings across our three businesses are key differentiators that strengthen our position as the world's leading aerospace company. As we work to safely return the 737 MAX to service, our team is determined to keep improving on safety in partnership with the global aerospace industry and the broader community to ensure air travel remains the safest form of transportation the world has ever known. ","With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results.","Gregory Smith","Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss the first quarter results, let me also touch on the 737 MAX and explain how the grounding has impacted our financials to date and what we're focused on today and going forward. Let's move to Slide 4, please. ","As a result of the 737 MAX grounding, we delivered over 50 fewer 737 aircraft in the quarter than originally planned. This resulted in lower BCA revenue, operating earnings and cash. In addition, BCA earnings were also reduced by period costs associated with the MCAS software update and development of related training materials. We also booked approximately $1 billion of additional costs due to the adjustment to the production rate to 42 a month. The additional costs are due to the lower production rate causing fixed costs for the 3,100 aircraft in the block to be amortized over a longer period of time. Costs also included additional labor, escalation and support. This, therefore, reduced the 737 program and overall BCA margins. As you know, when the program margin is adjusted, it will affect current quarter and booking margin for subsequent periods. ","With regards to cash, lower delivery payments due to fewer 737 deliveries, combined with building and storing 737 aircraft, adversely impacted operating cash in the quarter. Now looking forward, the key drivers of financial impact related to the 737 are return to service time line and conditions; the delivery ramp-up, which will depend then on how fast we can deliver the aircraft once the fleet returns to service and how fast our customers can accept the aircraft; and finally, the 737 production rate profile going forward. These factors will impact the future delivery rate profile and, therefore, impact revenue and earnings. It will also influence the cash receipt profile, including both delivery and prepayments -- predelivery payments. This, in conjunction with corresponding supply chain arrangements, will determine our cash expenditure profile and associated working capital going forward. We expect our financial results to continue to be adversely impacted until we safely return the 737 MAX to service, ramp up production rates and resume deliveries to customers. We will continue to assess our production plans going forward and have established waypoint milestones along our plan. This will allow us to make decisions based on information we have at that point on whether to further adjust production rates as required. ","From Day 1 of the grounding, we've been doing detailed scenario planning around return to service and production rates, including analyzing the implications on our supply chain, customer fleet and deliveries to fully understand the range of financial outcomes. At the same time, we've been proactively and prudently managing our operations and liquidity position and working on actions to minimize the impact on our customers and our financials. As Dennis noted, we're taking steps amid current challenges to preserve the future value and growth of this important franchise for our company and for our customers. Some of these proactive steps include the production rate adjustment to 42 a month, and we've initiated comprehensive daily oversight into factory health such as reduction in jobs behind schedule and also suppliers' progress to getting back to master schedule, customer delivery profile and path to seamless return to service. We've also taken actions to prudently manage liquidity and increase our balance sheet flexibility. These include an even sharper focus on productivity and strategic prioritization of spending. We're diligently reviewing all levers available to minimize the financial impact. Our multiyear-focused efforts on disciplined cash management, productivity efforts and growing healthy margin businesses help position us on better footing to navigate the current challenges. ","As Dennis mentioned, given the dynamic of 737 MAX return-to-service time line in activities, we are not in a position today to provide a forecast of the impacts of the 737 MAX grounding on our full year 2019 financials. We will provide you with an update of full year 2019 financial forecast when we have clarity on return to service of the MAX fleet, our production plans, delivery ramp-up profile and corresponding financial impacts. Returning the MAX safely to flight has been priority one and a team effort that leverages the best talent from across Boeing. Since Day 1, we've established a cross-functional team following a disciplined process to organize and manage a broad range of activities involved. We've assigned a leader of our enterprise program management function to manage this critical effort with senior leaders, established a situation room to facilitate the discussions and track upcoming activities and deliverables. The team meets daily with our executive council fully engaged. We have dedicated senior management leads for key elements, such as investigation and return-to-service activities, regulatory process, customer support and training, customer engagement, 737 production supply chain, government relations, finance, communications and branding. We've also brought in outside technical and strategic experts to assist in areas such as engineering reviews and strategic communications as we work to restore the confidence across all our stakeholders. We will continue to apply whatever resources are required to return the 737 MAX safely into the fleet and take the time necessary to do so, working hand-in-hand with our customers. At the same time, we will also remain focused on our priorities in delivering results with excellence. ","So with that, let me move to Slide 5, and I'll discuss our first quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was $22.9 billion, reflecting lower Commercial Airplane deliveries partially offset by higher Defense and Services volume. Core earnings per share of $3.16 reflects these, along with a lower tax rate and a customer financing impairment. ","Now let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue decreased to $11.8 billion during the quarter, reflecting the more than 50 fewer 737 deliveries I mentioned earlier. That was partially offset by favorable mix in the quarter. BCA operating margins decreased to 9.9% driven by lower 737 deliveries, partially offset by higher 787 margins. The margins include the 737 MAX impacts I outlined earlier. In the quarter, BCA captured 91 net new orders but also removed 210 aircraft in backlog related to Jet Airways due to liquidity issues experienced by the airline. The net impact was a $3 billion net order increase. BCA's backlog continues to remain strong at $399 billion and more than 5,600 aircraft equating to more than six years of production. ","Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 7. First quarter revenue increased to $6.6 billion, reflecting higher volume across satellites, weapons and surveillance aircraft, which is partially offset by lower C-17 volume. Our continued focus on productivity and execution result in margins growing to 12.8%. The margins include solid program performance, a gain on sale of the property partially offset by unfavorable mix. The sale of this excess property is the result of the team's continued market-based affordability efforts to optimize our footprint. During the quarter, BDS won key contracts worth $12 billion, and our backlog stands $67 billion with 31% from outside the United States. ","Let's turn now to Boeing Global Services results on Slide 8. In the first quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.6 billion, reflecting higher volume across the portfolio and the acquisition of KLX completed in the fourth quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth of 17% for the quarter outpaces the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%. BGS operating margins of 14.1% reflect ongoing productivity efforts offset by mix of products and services in the quarter and the unfavorable adjustment on the defense training contract. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $4 billion, and our backlog now stands at $21 billion. ","Let's turn now to cash flow on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $2.8 billion driven by lower 737 deliveries, offset by solid underlying performance and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. As mentioned earlier, we expect continued working capital pressure to adversely affect cash flow until MAX deliveries resume. Strong operating cash flow from other parts of the business, a strong balance sheet and further balance sheet levers will help provide appropriate liquidity during this period. In the first quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends, and we repurchased $2.3 billion of Boeing stock in the quarter. And until we have clarity on the 737 MAX return-to-service, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase program. However, our long-term balance cash deployment strategy and commitment remains unchanged. ","Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, slightly increased debt levels and stable credit ratings. Our credit rating of A and A2 were recently affirmed. Our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet provides us with substantial borrowing capacity through capital markets access and unused credit facility of $5.1 billion. ","We have ample access to long-term debt in the bond markets and short-term debt in the commercial paper markets. Our long-term goals and strategic objectives remain unchanged. We will continue to use our three business units strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments and leverage talent innovation from across the company. ","So in summary, while focusing on the very important priority of safe 737 MAX return-to-service and minimizing the significant impact on our customers and the flying public, our team continues to keep the core operating engine strong, delivering results and meeting customer commitments. We recognize that we have a lot of work and not insignificant challenges in front of us in the weeks and months to come, but we're confident we have the right focus, team and resources to navigate through them. We are committed to providing you with additional updates on the MAX return-to-service progress and production plans as we have more information. We will strive to continue to keep all of our stakeholders informed through our public statements and information posted on our website. Once we have further clarity, we will schedule a follow-up investor and media conference call to discuss the financial impacts and revised 2019 guidance. ","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis Muilenburg","All right. Thank you, Greg. When I started at this company more than three decades ago, our amazing people inspired me. I see how they dedicate their lives in extraordinary talents to connect, protect, explore and inspire the world safely. And that purpose and mission has only grown stronger over the years. Our team is determined to keep improving on safety in partnership with the global aerospace industry and broader community. It is the shared sense of responsibility for the safety of flight that spans and binds all of us together. Our leadership role is clear. Our commitment is resolute, and our pursuit of excellence is never ending. We own it. In these challenging times, I'm even more confident in our team and our customers. We'll stay true to our values, and we will come through this even stronger. ","While we continue to be focused on the very important priority of engaging with our global regulators and customers on the safe return to service of the 737 MAX, I'd also like to thank the Boeing team for remaining focused on further driving both growth and productivity. We wouldn't have been able to achieve these first quarter results without the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnerships we have with our customers and suppliers. The long-term fundamentals for our business remains strong, and our key priorities are unchanged. We will continue to execute on our long-term strategy of robust organic growth investment and returning value to shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. We will leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments to our customers and partners around the world. ","With that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And first in line, we have Myles Walton with UBS.","Myles Walton","Dennis or Greg, how is the 737 return-to-service effort disrupting or influencing both the 777X certification effort ongoing and then your decision on the NMA? Given that this is all hands on deck for the MAX, I imagine there's some cannibalization of resources on the 777X. And then on the NMA, how is your view on that changing given the less clear picture maybe of where the certification is or will be in the future?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Myles, good question. First of all, again, I want to stress and reiterate the point that we are very, very focused on the safe return to service of the MAX, and that remains our top priority. Clear focus, clear resources being applied, and daily engagement, hourly engagement by me, Greg, and the leadership team. And we're going to continue to focus there and get that airplane back up and flying for our customers. ","As part of that process, we are taking a look at our certification processes. We remain confident in the fundamental processes. But as part of our continuous improvement mindset, we always take a look at opportunities to improve. So we're welcoming the government joint authorities' technical review that's been announced, and we'll be supporting that as appropriate. As you've heard earlier, I've also asked Boeing Board to stand up a committee to take a look at our certification processes and identify any potential improvements. And if we find any opportunities to improve, we will certainly adopt those on a go-forward basis. ","As far as the ripple impact or potential impact of the 777X, we haven't seen any direct impact. Again, our team has been very strong about continuing to drive 777X development and performance in parallel with our return-to-flight -- or return-to-service efforts on the MAX. We've deployed our teams accordingly and make sure that we've resourced high-priority efforts on 777X. As noted earlier, we have rolled two flight test birds out of the factory, number three and number four are in the final assembly, and we look forward to getting into flight testing here this year and delivering that airplane on schedule in 2020. We do not see any changes to the underlying certification process. But again, as I said, if we find areas to improve, we will certainly adopt those. ","As to your NMA question, we're continuing our work on that in parallel. Certainly, the higher priority -- highest priority for us is the 737 MAX\u2019s safe return to service. So, we have prioritized our resources accordingly while we continue to work on our NMA effort in parallel. We're still looking at that as a potential opportunity for a 2025 entry into service date. We still have work to do before we get to an authority to offer a decision. We're still working on a pace to try to do that this year, as we previously announced, but I want to be very clear that when it comes to resource questions and application of resources, our top priority is the safe return to service of the 737 MAX.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein.","Douglas Harned","As you've talked about, you have a technical fix that you're testing now for the 737 MAX, and it sounds as though you have some pretty good confidence in that. If we assume that the technical solution, that, that is what is needed, that works, then I sort of look at this as three important processes here. One, you've got to work with the authorities, the airlines, the flying public to give them the confidence that the solution works. Second, you've got an operational process where you've already taken rate down but you want to be able to take that rate up very quickly as soon as the airplane can return to service safely. And then third, you have a commercial process where customers are awaiting delivery, they've been making progress payments. ","And so what I'm interested in understanding is as you think of that first task, that first process, which the time line on it seems somewhat uncertain, how does that drive the way you look at different rates scenarios going forward operationally and the way your work with your customers who put money in and they've -- they're expecting to get delivery of this airplane?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, Doug, our plan integrates across all of those dimensions as it should, because they're all interrelated. I will say on that first path, returning the airplane to service and doing so safely, just to give you a sense of the key steps to go there. As we know from the accident, investigations today have been publicly announced through the preliminary reports. Both accidents were a chain of events. We know there was one common link in that chain of events, and that was the activation of the MCAS system with erroneous angle of attack data. That's been well published. And as we said, we understand how to address that link. That's our responsibility. We own that, and that's what that software update does. We have great confidence in that software update with the more than 200 flights that occurred -- or excuse me, 135 flights that have occurred. I personally had the chance to fly on two of those flights, test and demonstration flights, and have seen the confidence in that software solution. We have tested it out and completed our engineering flight test last week. ","The next step in that process will be the certification flight under the FAA's authority, and we are working with the FAA right now to prepare for that in the near term. Subsequent steps will include again bringing all of the global regulators together with the FAA's leadership to approve the return to service. So that path is a well-understood set of steps, things that are being actively worked on a daily and hourly basis, and we're going to continue to pursue that and make sure we take the time to do it right. That's the most important thing here, is to make sure we have a safe return to flight. ","Once we accomplish that, then we'll have the opportunity to look at our production profiles, our delivery sequencing for our customers. As you might guess, we are in daily multiple-times-a-day conversations with our customers as well, and we regret the impact this has had to their operations. We know our customers are eager to get the MAX back into service. And we are eager, when we're ready, to get production ramp back up and provide those airplanes. So we'll be working that in a coordinated, integrated fashion. We have teams that are ready, positioned by tail number with the 737 MAXs that are already out in the fleet to get those airplanes ready and back up and flying for our customers, and we also have an integrated introduction plan including our supply chain that will allow us to pivot and move forward. So these are actions that we are taking daily, again hourly, all in a coordinated fashion. And across those three areas that you mentioned, Doug, I'm very confident that we have an integrated plan. All of this will be paced by the safe return to service of the MAX. That is our first focus.","Operator","And our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald Epstein","To the extent that you can answer this, how does this happen right? I mean, this sort of seemingly sort of came out of nowhere. I mean, is there any way you can kind of give us a feeling for how did this slip through the engineering organization? How did it slip through the FAA? Can you give us a feel for that? Like I guess, that's the part that befuddles me most about all this because it doesn't seem like there was a lot of new science going on here, right? I mean 787 had been a lot of new science. This seem to be applications of existing technology to an existing platform.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, Ron, there is no technical slip or gap here, right? Again as I mentioned, we know that both accidents were a series of events, and that is very common to all accidents that we've seen in history. And in -- what we know is that in this case, there was erroneous angle of attack information that came into the airplane from multiple causes. We know that at some point during the flight, that activated the MCAS control loss. And we know that ultimately, there were actions or actions not taken that contributed to the final outcome. ","I can't really get into the details of that deep accident investigation because this is all governed by the ICAO Annex 13 process, which I know you know well, and that is a disciplined, rigorous process that examines these accidents from every dimension to ensure that we understand them, and it's ultimately that disciplined process that has made this industry so safe. So we have been very purposeful about supporting that process, very purposeful about supporting the investigation, staying focused on safety and not speculation. ","But I can tell you with confidence that we understand our airplane. We understand how the design was accomplished, how the certification was accomplished and remain fully confident in the product that we put in the field. But we also know there are areas where we can improve, and that is the source of the software update here. But there was no surprise or gap or unknown here or something that somehow slipped through a certification process. Quite the opposite. We know exactly how the airplane was designed. We know exactly how it was certified. We have taken the time to understand that. That has led to the software update that we've been implementing and testing, and we're very confident that when the fleet comes back up, the MAX will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter Arment","Dennis, just maybe circling back to a few of Doug's question. When you're thinking about the best way you could describe kind of the regulatory discussions, are they running all at the same pace or should investors expect kind of a different path with each regulatory body? And we're thinking about the FAA or EASA or [indiscernible] in Asia?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, Peter, we are working with the FAA and regulatory authorities around the world. And as you might guess, there are different paces and different processes in each country, but these are all running in parallel. We're working with those authorities to try to align schedules, both from a regulatory government standpoint as well as the customers that are operating in these countries around the world. As we said, we have more than 50 MAX operators today around the world, and they're all very interested in getting the airplane back up and flying. So we are coordinating across that entire network of global regulators and customers. And we're seeing the schedules, I'll say, beginning to align. There is still clearly a lot of work to go as we get through the certification. Another pacing item for us will be training and training deployment worldwide, and then alignment of all the regulatory agencies on approval to get the airplane back up and service and back to flying. So we have a support role across all of that. ","I want to complement the FAA, in particular, for their leadership and the work that they're doing across the global enterprise. As you might have seen, the FAA leader, Dan Elwell, hosted an international session with the counterparts from other regulatory agencies a couple of weeks ago. We were supportive to that meeting as well. So the FAA has been working hard to coordinate across all of the international regulators, drive alignment, answer questions and ensure that we're all in the same page going forward. It is fundamentally important here that we have an integrated plan and that we understand any questions or concerns that might be out around the world that we address those. And that, again, we focus on a safe return to service of the MAX, and I'm confident that, that coordination is happening. And I think it's fair to say we still have some work to do, but we're making progress.","Operator","Next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Can you talk about the $1 billion of cost that you added to the 737 block? I'm kind of curious to -- for you, Greg, to maybe elaborate a little more what's included in that. But maybe more importantly, what was not included in that?","Gregory Smith","Yes, yes. So the cost to develop and test the software, its period expense was not in there as well as the related training materials associated with that. They're booked in the quarter but not in program margin. As I said, the period expense. Within the $1 billion, really, what's taken into account there is the lower production rate. That's ultimately what's driving it, and now we'll take a little bit longer than what we originally had in the cost base, so you've got fixed cost that will be associated with that lower production rate. ","But we also are holding on to headcount. Remember, we were at 52, going down to 42. We've held that headcount in factory, and what we've been doing with that is really working the jobs behind schedule and any jobs that are out of position in getting things back into position in the factory. At the same time, been working with the supply chain. So those that weren't on master schedule at 52, we are -- even though we came down, we have some of those suppliers staying at 52 in order to get healthy, get back on schedule. So when we do come back up and ramp, we're going to do it in a very steady fashion with stability in each step along the way to ensure that we have a predictable, I'll say, production system, a healthier production system and one that we can support our customers as we go up in rate. ","The other things that are within that fixed cost escalation, obviously, again, facilities, tooling and also support -- additional support for deliveries as well as pulling the airplanes out of storage that we currently have within our facility. So those are, I'd say, the bigger buckets of costs that are within there. But like Dennis said, this is day-to-day management on all aspects. So all with -- what we've been talking about is feeding into our production scenarios. And key in all of this obviously is keep all the stakeholders informed, realizing we don't have answers to some of the questions. But we've got scenarios, and we're trying to be proactive in how we address those so -- and be strategic. So again, going into the supply chain, rather than pulling everybody down to 42, let's go through and understand liquidity within each of those suppliers, where -- who needs help, who doesn't, who is on schedule, who can we use to get this opportunity to get back on schedule. ","So again, being very, I'll say, specific, but it's day-to-day management. And we talked about our operating rhythm being daily. Our head of the program reports on -- daily on production health to all of us, and we've got the full enterprise support in this. I know there's a question earlier on 777X. People that are part of this process are from the company. So we're bringing people in that are experts in anywhere area that we need to support, we're bringing them in from across the whole enterprise, and we'll continue to do that until we get the airplane safely back up in the air and get our production rates back to where they were.","Operator","Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","I guess how do we think about the broader customer reaction to the MAX? There's been a lot of back and forth in the media. And then how do you think about a potential risk to the backlog and maybe production scenarios and risks you're thinking about there?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, Sheila, to that point, let me take a long-term view here. We don't see any change. As you well know, we are continuously engaged with our customers. We have a ton of respect for them and how they operate. We have deep regret for the impact that this has had on their operations to date, and we're very, very sensitive to that. And we're doing everything we can to get the airplane back up and flying and do that safely. Our customers are eager to do that as well. ","I can tell you, I've personally talked to many, many of our customers. Our team, Commercial Airplanes team, Kevin McAllister, Ihssane, their teams are deployed daily, hourly, talking to customers. Our support teams are working around the world, helping them with the fleet that is currently grounded to maintain that fleet in good condition so that when we're ready, we can quickly bring the fleet back up to operating status. So we're deeply engaged with our customers. We understand their operational model. We're having discussions with them on how to best get them ramped back up and to help them during this intermediate period. And I think the collaboration, the communication, it's just been very strong. And I'm thankful to our customers. They've been working with us through this period. It's been difficult. It's been challenging for all of us, but we have a mutual respect based on the health of this industry and the important work that we do around the world. And we want to make sure we can get back up and flying safely, and we know we have some work to do to earn and reearn the trust of our customers and the flying public in particular. And so we're working with our customers in the airlines on how we can best rebuild that public trust, working with them. And engaging their pilots, for example, as they're involved in the process and our airline pilot customers who can express their views to the flying public. I think that's a big source of confidence for the future. So we're working together on that standpoint. ","And then as we think about production re-ramp going forward, when we're ready, the skyline management, the delivery sequencing, how we can support our customers, get them airplanes as rapidly as we can and in the right order and sequence, that's all part of our daily integrated planning as well. And longer term, we're also deploying training packages and additional educational materials. I would call those above-and-beyond educational materials that are tailored for our various customers around the world. So that'll be a longer-term effort where we work with them on training, education as well as areas where we can help with the brand repair, if you will, in rebuilding the public confidence. ","So we're working together across all of those fronts, and I'd say the relationship with our customers, the collaboration here is as strong as it's ever been. And perhaps, that's what we see in difficult times like this. We see those fundamental relationships coming to the surface, and the strength of those relationships is clear.","Operator","Next, we go to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Greg, a question for you. Can you just talk about the tools you're using to manage the tightness on cash flow over the coming quarters in regard to paying suppliers and the inventory build? And then also, what's the status of advances coming from customers? Have they stopped? Or is there any sort of requirement to return them given what's happening?","Gregory Smith","Yes. No, I'd say the advances, for the most part, are coming in per schedule. And I think the thing to keep in mind there, Rajeev, is that the advances that are coming in today are really for delivery slots out in 1.5 years, 2 years from now. But it's obviously something that we're monitoring daily and working with each of our customers on. Like I said, there's daily engagement going on here on multiple fronts. ","As far as what tools, again, leveraging the enterprise. So this is a One Boeing effort in what levers we have and in front of us, in what different parts of the business and recognize in short-term and long-term trade-offs here. But obviously, the company is in a very different position than it was 10 years ago. Obviously, we're a lot larger but a lot healthier in generating in the other parts of the business, outside of 737, a lot more cash. And that certainly helps us navigate this very challenging situation that we're faced with, but it's a very big difference. And remember, too, back then, we didn't have a share repurchase program. And so that is a lever for us today that we can utilize to help navigate through this, but again, not losing sight in our long-term commitment around repo. ","So my point here, we've got a lot of levers. I think as we're managing this, clearly, the operating rhythm of the rest of the company remains intact. So this is -- as Dennis said, this is the priority. But the fact is meeting our commitments to all of our stakeholders and the rest of the business is also -- continue to be a big focus, and I think you've seen it in the first quarter. So we've got -- we're making decisions on a day-to-day basis, and we're running scenarios, as we talked about. We're running scenarios. So we're clear-eyed about what we know and what we don't know and the range of possibilities or outcomes and how would we manage it and how do we get ahead of it. And we're very much in a mindset of getting ahead of it and frankly playing on the side of being conservative at this point, and we will continue to do that. But again, it's a One Boeing effort and multiple points of input here but critical to making the right decisions around cash and liquidity.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Just a couple of just quick cleanups, Greg, on the commentary you already had on the 37. Does the $1 billion include any contractual remedies for delivery movements in there? And I guess just broader understanding of what you're talking about. It sounds like when you say fixed cost, you mean you've got the total internal cost to the company of keeping the 737 program resources, at least what they were, if not a little bit higher. Despite the fact that there are lower delivery, then that excess cost is really the biggest driver of the $1 billion? Is that correct?","Gregory Smith","Yes, you've got it. You've got it. And like I said, too, we are holding that headcount, which is obviously a big factor in that. And you heard me earlier talk about how we're utilizing those skills near term but also obviously thinking long term that when we go up in rate, those resources are resources that are skilled and trained in those positions within the line, so they'll go back into position and allow for a smoother rate increase with more stability. And so that's that, I'll say, investment that we're making today to ensure that we have that smooth rate increase going forward and doing that at each point of stability. So that is obviously is also a part of the additional costs that are in the block.","Carter Copeland","And contractual remedies, is there anything -- any assumption for that of significance?","Gregory Smith","No.","Carter Copeland","Okay. And then just one quick one if I may. The -- you mentioned you had a sort of series of waypoints to evaluate. Can you give us some -- a sense of where the nearest one of those is? You start evaluating any other changes to production or anything else? Is this a sort of two, three month kind of time line? Or is it shorter, longer? Any color would be helpful.","Gregory Smith","Well, look, I'd say there's waypoints daily so -- but there's some more significant ones around what Dennis talked about as return to service. That's fundamentally the biggest waypoint we have there and how that could play out, as Dennis articulated, and whether it happens at once or staggered. All of that is being considered and brought into our model and then looking at production rates, looking at the amount of aircraft that we would be parking. And we obviously want to minimize that and keep that to a minimum and obviously fully within our control. At the same time, factor the supply chain, making strategic decisions within the supply chain and not a one-size-fits-all with, again, the whole idea to keep them healthy and help support them through this period but get back on schedule for those that weren't. And we're again -- we're working hand-in-hand with each one of them, again, on a daily basis. So lots of, I'll say, small waypoints within there, but the most significant one being the return-to-service.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. And Carter, as you look for progress points there, near term will be the certification flight. Next in line will be the actual final certification of the software and the FAA's approval and then bringing the regulatory authorities together to gain approval of return to service. So there's some interim milestones here that'll be visible that we are aiming to complete in the near term, and then that will subsequently cause the next set of activities to occur, which Greg outlined, in terms of production system and supply chain ramp-up. So this is an integrated sequence of events.","Operator","And we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr","So 787, you had a pretty spectacular $1 billion-plus decline in deferred costs and tooling costs. How did you achieve it? And you mentioned higher 787 margins, was that a function of an increase in the block size?","Dennis Muilenburg","Let me comment first and, Greg, jump in on the second part there. Cai, what you're seeing here is the investment that we've made in the 787 product and manufacturing system and our team performing successfully. So while not a lot of fan here over the last quarter, we did seamlessly transition from 12 per month to 14 per month, and I want to compliment our team and our supply chain for doing that effectively. And you see that continuing to be reflected in the program's performance -- financial performance as well as the high-quality deliveries to our customers. And I think what you also see is the effectiveness of that product in the field with the orders volume continuing to come in from our customers. So that program is performing well in the factories, and it's performing well for our customers in the field. Greg, do you want to...","Gregory Smith","Yes. I mean outside of that, which frankly very much complements what Dennis said, the mix, right? I mean we're -- we've got more favorable mix. But that smooth introduction of that mix, combined with the rate increases, the supplier step-down as we move through the blocks, sky, as I talked about before, continue to play into that as well. But we didn't have any block extension in the quarter, so it's really a combination of all the efforts that Dennis and I had mentioned.","Dennis Muilenburg","Performance, yes.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Senior Vice President of Communications. Ms. Toulouse, please go ahead.","Anne Toulouse","Thank you, and good morning. Now we will continue with the media portion of today's call. For the members of the press, if you have questions after the session ends, please call our team at 312-544-2002. John, we're ready for that first question. [Operator Instructions].","Operator","And first in line, we have Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg.","Julie Johnsson","Dennis, can you just dig in a little deeper into what you're expecting the Board -- or the mission of the Board Committee and when you expect them to report on the certification process? And just to play devil's advocate, I am just wondering how meaningful this will all be if it comes -- deepen as a recertification effort for the 737. And the Board members involved are really respected leaders, but they don't have a deep aerospace background.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Well, Julie, let me just take a half step back first and remind everyone again of the incredible importance of safety to us in our culture of driving safety and continuous improvement. That is -- that culture is what has made this industry the safest form of transportation, and that is a fundamental that we are committed to. And any time an accident like this happens, it's a very difficult situation. We have great sorrow for the families that are affected. This weighs heavily on us. This gets right to the core of who we are as a company and our focus on safety. And so what we're doing here is looking at every dimension of what we've learned and making sure that we, as part of that effort, focus on any potential process improvements that we can make. That is our duty and responsibility. So not only do we look at product and service improvements, but also, are there any process improvements that we can make? ","And there's really a twofold effort here. One, the U.S. government is bringing together a joint authority review with international regulators around the world. That's been previously announced. That will take a look at certification processes. We'll support that with technical expertise, and any learnings from that, we'll incorporate. And then internally, I've also asked our Board to set up a committee that you referenced. And let me give you a little more context on that. That committee will be focused on looking at our design, development, certification processes not only for the MAX but, more broadly, for our airplane programs. It will be headed up by Edmund Giambastiani, and he does have a great deal of expertise in the aerospace sector and the defense sector, as you well know. So we're bringing sector knowledge to the table. He will be joined by Board Members who also bring expertise from other sectors who are very safety-focused and have significant government regulatory dimensions. And I think that will actually make us better because we can do cross-sector learnings, so I would argue that that's bringing in an external view that's even more helpful. ","In addition, that committee has authorized to bring in outside technical support, deep support in the areas where it's required, and they will also leverage the depth of our technical resources across Boeing. So they will have a depth of capacity to do their work. And based on the outcome of their analysis and assessment, we'll determine how we roll these results into our processes. That could be a report. It could be set of actions. Rather than stating upfront what that will be, what we want to do is see what the committee learns and see the outcome of their work and then we'll decide how to implement that. But we are committed to doing a deep and rigorous evaluation and making improvements where we can. That is part of how we operate as a company. We are always looking for opportunities to improve.","Operator","Next question from Phil LeBeau with CNBC.","Phil Lebeau","Dennis, my question is this. What is your plan or what plans are in place to reassure airlines and the traveling public that the 737 MAX will be safe to fly again once it is cleared to get back in the air? And what's your reaction when you see these reports, and you've seen them over the last couple months, where -- whether it's airline passengers or airline executives who are saying, \"I'm just not sure people are going to want to fly this plane again.\"?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Phil, I think that's a great question and certainly an area where we're very focused on. And this is an area where collaboration with our airline customers is extremely important, and we're working this on a daily basis. And we certainly have deep regret for the impact that this has had on our airline customers and their operations and the impact it's had on the flying public. We've got 100-plus years of history as a company on providing safe transportation, and that is a commitment that we treasure, something that we place high value on. And the respect of the flying public, the confidence of the flying public is very, very important to us. So we regret the impact that's happened here, and we're very focused on addressing that going forward. ","The game plan that we've laid out with our airline customers is tailored by customer. We're talking with each of them in terms of what they're hearing from their passengers. We think a key voice in all of this will be the pilots for our airlines, and their voice is very important. That bond between the passenger and the pilot is one that's critical, and so we're working with our airline customers and those pilot voices to ensure that we can build on that going forward. To that end, we hosted multiple sessions around the world. More than 90% of our 50-plus MAX operators to-date have had pilots in our simulator sessions with the new software, experiencing that, building confidence. I can tell you with those series of sessions that we've had around the world, the pilot feedback from the simulator sessions has been excellent, and I think it's been a big part of building confidence and how we talk about this going forward. So we're planning to leverage that pilot voice. We'll be working closely on branding and talking about training and education activities going forward. This is a place where Boeing is going to make an investment. We know it's important to earn and reearn the trust, and this will be done jointly with our airline customers, the pilots, the flight crews, the flight attendants, everybody that supports these airplanes. And we know it'll take time. We have to earn and reearn the trust of the flying public, and that's work ahead of us, and we take that very seriously.","Operator","That will be from Eric Johnson with Reuters.","Eric Johnson","Dennis, there's been some calls for you to divide up your role as Chairman and CEO. As the grounding continues, would you say that your future in both roles or either role is tied specifically to the duration and outcome of the crisis and your ability to restore public trust in Boeing?","Dennis Muilenburg","Eric, I think it's important to look at this, again, from a long-term standpoint. As we've said in the past, as we continue to say, it's important that our company has the flexibility to have the leadership structure that works best for our company. That's been our position for years and continues to be our position, and we remain consistent on that front. And we have a great, engaged Board on this topic. The working relationships are strong. Our Lead Director, Dave Calhoun, is very engaged in the work that we're doing. The Board Committee that I talked about is just another example of a very engaged Board. I have daily communications with the Board both in my Chairman role and in my CEO role. We think that is the right, most effective structure for our company. And I think that's, again, showing it to be the case even in the midst of this challenging situation. And I also want to reiterate the fact that our Board does have a very strong, independent Lead Director and that we respect and understand those rules, and the structure that we have in place today is one that I think is healthy for our company and healthy for all of our stakeholders.","Anne Toulouse","Okay. That concludes our call today. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please call our team at 312-544-2002.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Boeing Company\u2019s First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. The management\u2019s discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019m turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy Lahr","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's first quarter 2013 earnings call. I\u2019m Troy Lahr and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer.","After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release, issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any discussions and goals this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation.","In addition, we refer you to the earnings release and presentations for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everybody. Let me begin today with an update on the 787s return to flight, followed by an overview of our business environment and some thoughts on yet another strong quarter of operating performance. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook.","As you may recall in January, I described returning the 787 to service as our first order of business. Nothing is more important than the safety of the crews and passengers who fly our airplanes and nothing rallies our team more than the challenge of resolving issues that affect our customer\u2019s ability to operate those airplanes as intended.","Over these many weeks, hundreds of experts from across Boeing, our supplier partners and other outside organizations work day and night along side U.S. and Japanese authorities to identify the factors that could have caused the 787 batteries to fail and then to design, develop and test a comprehensive permanent fix.","Last Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration formally approved our proposed solution after carefully examining results of a rigorous month-long certification test program. In short, our battery system improvements include multiple layers of protection to prevent and isolate potential faults along with the new enclosure designed to keep any battery event from affecting the airplane or even being noticed by passengers.","After more than 200,000 hours of engineering work, validation by a non-advocate team of more than a dozen leading battery experts and now with a certification by the FAA, the 787 will return to flight with our continued high confidence in its safety, reliability and overall integrity.","Immediately upon receiving the FAA\u2019s approval last week, we began the process of installing the improved battery system on the in service fleet while also implementing the changes on new airplanes being readied for delivery in Everett and Charleston. Thus far we have started installation on 10 fleet aircraft and 9 production airplanes.","We expect to complete the bulk of fleet retrofits by mid-May. Production test flights began last week and deliveries are expected to resume in early May. And despite the three-month delivery suspension, our forecast remains to deliver greater than 60 787s during 2013.","On behalf of everyone at Boeing, I would like to thank our supplier partners, our outside battery experts, the FAA, NTSB, JTSB, and JCAB for their determined professionalism throughout this journey. We would also like to thank our customers and their passengers for enduring this disruption and inconvenience caused by this issue. While disappointing and frustrating from the outset, the silver lining in this experience has been seeing all parties in this process working to ensure that air travel remains the safest form of transportation the world has ever known.","Furthermore, the value proposition of the 787 and its game changing economics, fuel efficiency, lower noise and emissions and unmatched passenger comfort has emerged fully intact, and we look forward to reconnecting airlines and their passengers to the 787\u2019s remarkable benefits in the coming days and weeks.","As many of you know, in the 15 months of service prior to the major issue with the battery, initial dispatch reliability on the 787 was at par or better than the benchmark 777. We fully expect that trend to continue as we return the airplane to service.","Our nearly 97 years of experience introducing new airplanes also conditions us to expect additional more normal, shall we say, start up issues as more airplanes enter the fleet with more carriers in the months ahead. Our approach will be to find them, address them and ultimately ensure the 787 like every Boeing airplane before it achieves the very high level standard for performance and reliability we promise customers at the outset of the program.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide two. Global customer demand for our fuel efficient and value creating commercial airplane family remain strong. A factory reinforced by a healthy first quarter net new orders total of 209 airplanes, which increased our record commercial airplane backlog to more than 4,400 airplanes worth $324 billion.","Our customers continue to replace older airplanes in favor of new ones that offer compelling economics and increased fuel efficiency. Request to accelerate deliveries also continue at a healthy pace. Passenger traffic trends remain healthy. However, we continue to see near-term pressure in the cargo market. Softness in this segment contributed to the decision announced last week to adjust the 747 program build rate down to 1.75 airplanes a month from two a month beginning in early 2014.","While we booked three 747 airplane orders in the quarter and received commitments for two more, the rate decision was made to more closely aligned production to near-term demand overall.","As the only provider of very large freighters, we believe our fuel efficient 747-8 is well positioned to benefit our customers once cargo market conditions improve. Airline interest in our fuel efficient 737 MAX remains significant as we now have booked almost 12,000 cumulative orders to-date. 787 backlog was further extended by 42 orders during the quarter in addition to a commitment by British Airways to exercise 18 options. We also received a commitment from Ryanair to order 175 737NGs. As a result, we now effectively have bridge production from the NG to the MAX, allowing us to smoothly transition our production system later this decade. Overall, aircraft demand remains relatively balanced geographically and our backlog remains evenly split between airplanes used to support traffic growth and fleet replacement.","We remain focused on balancing production schedules with this strong demand in order to minimize long-term volatility and build rates and maximize productivity and profitability.","Turning to defense space and security, during the quarter, we saw Congress and the administration act to avoid indiscriminate, across the board budget sequestration cuts in fiscal year \u201913 by passing a continuing resolution that permits the defense department to more selectively allocate spending and approve multi-year contracts for programs such as, in Boeing\u2019s case, the Chinook and V-22.","We believe this flexibility advantages our portfolio of reliable, proven and affordable systems that are on budget and on schedule. However, we remain cautious regarding the potential for further U.S. defense budget reductions and the mid to long-term impact of continued sequestration.","In the President\u2019s fiscal year \u201914 budget submission, we noted strong support for the majority of our core programs. Despite budget reductions at the top line level, growth is still expected in areas we have been targeting with investment and attention such as space, unmanned systems, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and cyber security.","With our expanded product offering and commercial satellites, we expect to pursue and capture growth in this market due to the compelling value our smaller satellites provide to global customers.","Last week\u2019s major win for the AH-64 Apache in the Republic of Korea is the latest in the series of key international competition results that reflect the alignment between our portfolio of products and services and international customer requirements in the current business environment.","International defense space and security business represented 28% of revenue during the quarter and grew to 42% of our current backlog as we continue to expand our share in addressable international markets. To enhance our competitive position in the defense market, achieving our market based affordability targets that maximize efficiencies and reduce infrastructure costs is a daily focus of defense space and security business and its multi-year effort to further strengthen its competitive position in U.S. and international defense markets.","That effort is also benefiting from productivity gains and cost savings achieved through our enterprise partnering for success initiative that we launched last fall with our major supply chain partners. Partnering for success, as you may recall, takes a team oriented approach to examine opportunities across the supply chain and design production and support to drive significant improvements in quality, flow and efficiency that will increase productivity and lower cost for customers. It\u2019s a win-win for us and our suppliers in step up for the challenge and secure future growth in so doing by increasing customer value today.","During the quarter we also succeeded in averting a work stoppages through successful negotiations of a new four-year contract with our engineering and technical worker\u2019s union in Puget Sound who support our commercial airplanes and defense programs in the region. This agreement also helps mitigate our future pension liabilities by including a define contribution plan for all new hires.","Moving on to slide three. Our business and core functions performed extremely well during the quarter as we reported strong revenue, expanded operating margins, and solid operating cash flow. Revenue at commercial airplanes was $10.7 billion and operating margin grew to 11.4%, resulting from solid program execution and lower margin dilution from fewer 787 deliveries than originally planned.","As an example of our continued efforts to improve productivity and efficiencies, we announced the consolidation of our North American flight training operation into our existing Miami facility. We are also reducing our infrastructure primarily on the 787 as we capture efficiencies and production stabilizes.","We delivered 137 commercial airplanes and successfully executed multiple plan production increases including increasing the 777 rate to a record 8.3 airplanes per month and raising the 737 to a record 38 airplanes per month, the next increase to 42 per month coming in the second quarter of 2014.","We also initiated the rate break to 7 per month as planned in 787 final assembly. Production health on the 787 continues to improve and we remain on track to increase the rate to 10 per month by year end. On our commercial airplane development programs, we have effectively completed engineering work on the 787-9.","The first airplane is expected to enter final assembly in Everett at mid-year followed by first flight in the second half of this year and first delivery in the early part of next year. The 737 MAX development also remains on track with firm configuration expected mid-year and entry into service as planned in 2017.","On our twin-aisle line-up with the 787-10X and 777X, we continue to progress through our disciplined gated development process focusing on affordability and discussing with customers their requirements and the technology they value. These are very attractive investments that leverage prior lessons learned and previous technology development efforts, all of which will increase shareholder value.","The business case continues to strengthen for the 787-10 and the customer interest in the airplane is high due to its compelling price and value equation for both us and our customers. We continued to anticipate the potential launch of the 787-10 this year. Likewise, the business case for the 777X also continues to mature as we further evaluate options including design and production locations.","During the quarter, we selected GE as the soul source engine manufacturer for the 777X program, new engines and an all new composite wing that leverages the design and technologies of the 787 wing along with other meaningful improvements will make this airplane immensely competitive, and ensure our 777 franchise remains the standard bearer in its class for years to come. We continue to target entry into service for the 777X around the end of the decade.","Turning to the defense business, defense, space and security generated revenue of $8.1 billion in the first quarter delivering 44 aircraft and 1 satellite. Higher deliveries on Apache C-17 and P-8 along with growth in satellite volume contributed the healthy revenue in the quarter. Numerous important awards were captured during the quarter, including contract at our small satellite business, as well as a contract for the integrated C4ISR targeting system that provides the Air Force, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities and targeting in one easy to use light weight handheld device.","Noteworthy milestones achieved during the quarter included the second successful test flight of the unmanned Phantom Eye, delivery of the first Indian Air Force C-17 to flight test, and completion of flight testing for the India P-8I airplane. We also delivered six P-8A to the U.S. Navy, which completes the first run of low rate initial production.","In summary, notwithstanding 787 deliveries deferred while we work through the battery issue, operationally we are off to a very strong start across the board for 2013 with solid revenues, earnings and cash generation. Our teams remain laser focused on continuing successful execution of the ongoing production and development programs that are important to our customers and are delivering value to our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg to discuss our financial results and our guidance. Greg?","Gregory D. Smith","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let\u2019s turn to slide four and we\u2019ll discuss the results for the quarter. First quarter revenue was $18.9 billion driven by strong deliveries at both commercial airplanes and our defense business. Strong core operating margins of 9.9% in the quarter were primarily driven by solid productivity gains at both businesses and improved mix.","Core earnings per share increased 24% to $1.73 a share in the quarter on continued strong operating performance in both commercial airplane and the defense business. As anticipated, first quarter EPS include $0.19 from the 2012 research and development tax credit that was passed into law earlier this year.","First quarter EPS last year including $0.11 from a favorable court adjust on a satellite litigation.","Now, let\u2019s discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the first quarter, our Commercial Airplanes business reported revenue of $10.7 billion on a 137 airplane deliveries and strong operating margins of 11.4%. Commercial Airplanes operating margin benefitted from delivery mix in the quarter, lower R&D, and improved performance that was partially offset by higher period costs primarily associated with the engineering and retrofit activities on the 787 battery. The strong core operating performance in the quarter was a testament for our continued focus on efficiently executing our rate increases and driving productivity.","Gross inventory for the company included $28.8 billion related to the 787 program, an increase in the first quarter of approximately $3.3 billion driven by the planned increase in production rate on the program and fewer 787 deliveries in the quarter. Included in the work in process inventory are deferred production costs. The deferred balance for the program was $17.1 billion at the end of the first quarter and includes approximately 61 airplanes still in process.","The deferred production balance is still expected to peak at slightly over $20 billion and then decline after the program achieves the planned rate of 10 per month and stabilizes at that level. Commercial airplanes captured $15 billion of orders during the quarter and increased backlog to a record 324 billion for over 4,445 airplanes. Customer demand for a game changing fuel-efficient airplanes remain strong as illustrated by an additional 121 737 MAX orders and 42 787 orders in the quarter.","Let\u2019s turn now to our Defense, Space and Security results on Slide 6. First quarter revenue for our Defense business was $8.1 billion and operating margins grew to a strong 10.3% driven by improved mix and performance. International customers accounted for 28% of our defense revenue in the first quarter and we continue to drive towards our goal of 30% of revenue going forward.","Focus on affordability continues as we remain committed to driving our market-based affordability efforts and are on track to further lowering our cost structure in an efforts to increase our productivity and strengthen our competitive position in this challenging environment.","Revenue at Boeing Military Aircraft was $4.1 billion in the first quarter, as higher deliveries on Apache C-17 and P-8A was offset by lower F-15 volume. Operating margin of 10.5% was primarily driven by improved performance and delivery mix. Network and Space Systems revenue of $2 billion increased 5% primarily driven by improved commercial satellites volume.","Operating margin was 8% in the quarter on favorable delivery mix. Global Services & Support had first quarter revenue of $2 billion resulting from lower volume on various logistics contracts. GS&S had healthy operating margins of 12.1% primarily driven by improved performance at our maintenance, modification, and upgrades business.","Defense, Space and Security had solid backlog of $68 billion. International business remains very strong with 42% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.","Turning now to Slide 7, the BCC net financing portfolio declined to $4.2 billion on normal run-off and that exceeded new aircraft volume. Unallocated expense from core operations was $170 million and was higher due to a favorable court judgment on a satellite litigation recorded in the same period last year.","Now, turning to cash flow on Slide 8, both our Commercial and Defense business did an outstanding job on focusing on cash in the quarter. Despite fewer 787 deliveries, first quarter operating cash flow was a solid $524 million.","Moving now to cash and debt balances on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with nearly $12 billion to cash and marketable security and timing of the 787 events limited our ability to repurchase shares in the first quarter, however, we expect to begin our repurchase plan in the second quarter and remain committed to our $1.5 billion to $2 billion of share repurchase planned for 2013.","Turning now to Slide 10 to discuss our outlook for 2013; we are reaffirming our guidance for 2013. We still expect 787 deliveries to be greater than 60 this year with second quarter deliveries for approximately 15% to 20% of our full-year deliveries.","Total Commercial Airplanes deliveries are still expected to be between 635 and 645 for the year. Revenue guidance for 2013 remains at between $82 billion and $85 billion, larger reflecting higher Commercial Airplane deliveries and continued challenging defense environment.","Core earnings per share guidance has unchanged at between $6.10 and $6.30 a share representing approximately 5% growth driven by continued strong execution across both businesses. Operating cash flow guidance before pension contributions remains at greater than $8 billion reflecting higher delivery volume and again continued strong performance.","So overall, performance was strong for the quarter as we further improve productivity of both businesses, successfully increased our plan production rates, and efficiently and effectively manage cash. We expect this strong operational performance to continue throughout the balance of 2013.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","","Thanks, Greg. With a strong first quarter behind us and implementation of the 787 battery solution well underway, we remain committed for the goals we initially set for 2013. That includes continued conversion of our record backlog into deliveries while generating strong core operating performance that allows us to return cash to shareholders while investing wisely in our products, technologies, and people to sustain our growth and competitiveness.","Our priorities going forward remain clear. The profitable ramp up of production on our commercial airplane programs, executing on our commercial and defense development programs, driving productivity and affordability throughout the enterprise, continuing to strengthen and reposition our defense business with investments in growth areas amid further international expansion and importantly returning increasing value to both our customers and shareholders.","Now, with that thought, we\u2019d be glad and happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard A. Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Good morning gentlemen, thank you.","Gregory D. Smith","Good morning, Howard.","Howard A. Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Your operating margins were helped to some degree by the absence of 78. On the other hand, pre-RND margins on commercial were up year-on-year. And Defense business was also very strong. could you address, Jim, maybe a little bit further from your commentary, what sort of goals you\u2019re setting for your operating units so that you can see this ongoing improvement?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Well, Howard, first of all, productivity and affordability is fundamental to everything we do, whether it\u2019s running a factory, whether it\u2019s running a back room or whether it\u2019s designing and building airplanes. So that is a \u2013 that has been a main theme that is beginning to pay off, has paid off, and we will not led upon even though we\u2019re beginning to grow significantly led by our commercial business. So productivity is foundational.","now, growth is also a piece of the margin expansion equation. We\u2019ve taken up rates on 777 and 73, you\u2019re going to begin to see the rate, which is on schedule and we have confidence in that schedule and 87 begin to increase, a couple of multiyears have been nailed down in our defense business, which also gives us opportunity to use volume to help drive margin expansion.","I also think, the other comment I\u2019d make is that, we\u2019re entering in a year now where our R&D is being used more efficiently. And I think that will not stop this quarter. And so notwithstanding some development programs out ahead of us, I think you may see more efficient use of research and development costs over the next period of time. So that would be my answer there.","Howard A. Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Thank you very much.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","You\u2019re welcome, Howard.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Samuel J. Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","I was wondering if I could follow-up on what you just mentioned, which was R&D, because you did come in relatively low in spending in R&D and given that year-over-year decline in commercial R&D, how do you get to the $3.4 billion this year, is it driven by the potential launch of 777X and\/or 787-10 to drive that pickup over the course of the year? How should we think about it?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Yeah, I would think, the thought here would be and I would include the MAX in what you\u2019ve just said there in terms of some ongoing development efforts. I think, look, I mean, if you step back for a second and look at this decade compared to the last one, we have the opportunity to harvest some hard-fought games in our Commercial Airplanes business. And we all remember the times of fighting through the 87 development where the technologies weren\u2019t quite as matures we hope they\u2019d be at certain point in time, we had to spend a lot of money. The 47-8 cost us a little bit more than we assumed it would. And we spend a lot of money in research and development.","Now, this decade, this team is committed to harvesting some of the learning from that decade and also harvesting some of the technology maturation that was hard-fought and we now have in hand. So I think when you look at 777X, you look at a 10X or you look at a MAX, these are derivative programs that tend to leverage more efficiently what we know, there is not a lot of invention going on. There is a lot of creative application and use of a technological lead that we have and that leads to and I know this is a broader answer that maybe you are looking for, but that leads to confidence that more restrained levels of R&D can continue for longer periods of time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Good morning.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Good morning","Gregory D. Smith","Good morning.","Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Jim, you\u2019ve highlighted that the demand environment remains very strong and then customers are looking to accelerate delivery. But given how many planes you now have in the backlog? What real capacity or flexibility do you have to further raise rates beyond what you currently committed to?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Well, I think that there is \u2013 demand is strong. And in fact, to be honest, the first piece of 2012 surprised us a little bit, it is sort of above trend, I think it\u2019s between 5% and 6% on an industry level.","So demand on the passenger side looks strong. We do have confidence in the ongoing trend line sort of between 4% and 5%. But I think we have been ramping up production. There is more to go on the 737, I think we\u2019ve given you visibility on that beyond the 38 that we just broke two. Could there be more beyond the 42? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but there is strong demand for narrow-body airplanes in the world today. I think the \u2013 getting to 10 a month, as all of you have mentioned to me is not a free throw on the 87. We have strong confidence levels that we are going to get there on the timing that we\u2019ve suggested to you. Is there demand beyond that? There are many I think there is, but we\u2019ll go through the disciplined process. So I think the middle of the wide-body, which would expand the 87 up to the 777, there\u2019s more room to run there, and we\u2019ll adjust our rates as we see it and narrow-body. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over yet.","Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Great. Thanks very much.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys, and good quarter.","Gregory D. Smith","Good morning, Carter.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Thank you, Carter.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, I wondered if I could ask you to expand on a couple of accounting points since you know I can\u2019t help myself.","Gregory D. Smith","","I understand.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","On the program versus unit, you guys were about $900 million in the quarter, but there was only one 787 delivery. So I wondered if\u2026","Gregory D. Smith","","Yeah.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","First you could expand on that? And then secondly, on the deferred production per unit, it looks like you tick down pretty nicely there to around $70 million a unit. I know you went through the 100 unit in the quarter, and you had said that there was a good step down in cost there. So I\u2019m not sure if you can comment within those units if you saw even further progress from the beginning to the end, but any color you can provide, that would helpful.","Gregory D. Smith","Yeah, sure. Well, on the unit versus program most of that is driven by 47, and then that one airplane on the 87 is our second delivery out of Charleston, which as you know, we had as planned longer flow and learning applied to that airplane. But as I\u2019ve said in the past, looking at it from a unit versus program it\u2019s going to become more challenging because of the mix of differentiation in the line-up of airplanes that were manufactured earlier coming out of BMC and airplanes coming off the line, now to add into that, you\u2019ve got the -9.","So you\u2019re right, I would focus more now on the deferred production growth. And we are seeing improvements there on a unit basis, and I think that\u2019s a good representation of what you\u2019re seeing in the factories. Right now, we\u2019re looking at about a 60% on a unit basis from kind of the first airplane line 8 to about line 100. So we\u2019re just continuing to see good progress there. We\u2019re seeing that both at Charleston and in Everett, and when you kind of step back and look at kind of the key operational metrics that essentially are going to drive the financials we\u2019re seeing on the 87 right now, shortages are at record low, travel work coming in is essentially at zero. So it\u2019s really giving us the opportunity to stabilize the final production line and have it running as it was planned and I think we\u2019re starting to see the benefits of that.","We are also focused on product \u2013 on the overall productivity and support ratios, and you\u2019re seeing declines in employment around there as planned as we kind of increase our production. So overall, operationally, you\u2019re seeing improved results and that\u2019s translating into the growth in deferred production. But again, I would tell you from outside in, I\u2019ll tell you to continue to focus on the deferred production growth and our production rates around that.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","So the 60% was the total cost or the deferred production per plane?","Gregory D. Smith","Total cost.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Gregory D. Smith","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","","Thanks, good morning.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","","You had a pretty strong result, I thought, in cash flow considering that you couldn\u2019t ship for most of the quarter on the 787, and you\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve got some benefits in the advances category and I guess mitigated the inventory build a little more than I thought.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","","Yeah.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","","I just was wondering if you look forward, Greg, to the rest of the year, how you\u2019re feeling about that guidance? Is there upside there and whether items here, big items that are going to reverse or help us out with the profile there a little bit the rest of the year?","Gregory D. Smith","Yeah, I mean, look I\u2019ll tell you, first quarter was a combination of timing and improved performance. We certainly were very active in managing our cash in the first quarter and we\u2019re able to pull in some advances that were frankly timed in the early second quarter. But day-to-day very disciplined approach to cash management. I am feeling comfortable and feeling good about full year guidance and obviously the profile on cash from now going forward will really be hinged on the ramp up primarily around commercial airplane deliveries, in particular, on the 87.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","And you didn\u2019t dig into the share repurchase plan in the first quarter?","Gregory D. Smith","Right.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Why exactly in the 787?","Gregory D. Smith","Well, just because of everything that was going on around the 787 and the battery, we refrained from doing any repurchase and as I mentioned we\u2019re going to get back in here on the second quarter, and we\u2019re still committed to the $1.5 billion to $2 billion for the full year.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Gregory D. Smith","","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas S. Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Thanks, good morning.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Hey, Doug","Gregory D. Smith","Good morning Doug","Douglas S. Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","I wanted to follow-up on the 787 discussion from before and based on the deferred production numbers, it does look like your costs are coming down substantially. Could you comment on the trajectory going forward both in terms of, roughly, when you might expect to reach break even on a unit basis and then also what do you expect to happen when the -9 comes in? Should we expect, may perhaps a bump back up for a little while?","Gregory D. Smith","Yeah, I mean, we\u2019re certainly \u2013 we\u2019re planning on continuing to reduce the unit cost on the airplane going forward and we\u2019ve got good productivity plans in place for ourselves within the supply chain and we\u2019re assuming that we execute to those. I think as the -9 certainly, if you look at it, as Carter was indicating on a unit versus program, you\u2019re going to see disruption there. But again, I think the deferred production growth is the best way to look at it. As far as the break even goes, as I said, we\u2019re going to peak at just over $20 billion, once we hit $10 billion and stabilize and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll turn the corner on a unit basis, but Doug, very focused on this. Obviously, every element of cost, whether it\u2019s in our factories or within the supply chain remains a big priority for us to continue to drive productivity on this airplane.","Douglas S. Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","And if I can, when you say stabilizing at 10, when you look farther, given the uniqueness of this airplane, is there a timeframe when you\u2019re considering, and what timeframe would it be when you might consider even going higher in rate?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Well, I think once we get to 10 and stabilize and feel good about where we are and all the operational metrics are in the \u2013 all within the right bandwidth, that\u2019s the timeframe when we\u2019d be making a decision to, and obviously the capital, and whatever investments are required in the continued demand, will all be taken into consideration, when we \u2013 and if we decide to take the rate up.","Douglas S. Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Gregory D. Smith","Good morning.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just wanted to follow-up on 787 as well, can you maybe sort of, I don\u2019t know walk us through what your process was to get comfort that the implementation of the battery fix won\u2019t be disruptive to all of the positive comments you\u2019re making here on your metrics on cost and on deferred production. It seems like you have your arms around it, but it\u2019s obviously fairly unique. You\u2019ve never done it before. you have to retrofit the active fleet, retrofit aircraft on the tarmac, put it into the manufacturing process, maybe a little bit more color on how you\u2019re comfortable with that not really changing things significantly?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","No, I think as [MoDs go] in the end with the fixed defined and the implementation in hand, this is not a big one, okay. This is two batteries and two locations on the airplane that the locations don\u2019t have to change much. There is some different interface to the electrical system, which is not rocket science, I guess, I would say, and there is the enclosure around the battery which fits into the spacing that already exists and then there is the exhaust system, which is designed, again, to easily retrofit. So this is days not weeks, it\u2019s a standardized fix that we\u2019ve already implemented on a couple of our airplanes and a couple of our customers\u2019 airplanes already.","And so we have a pretty high confidence level that we can be through the majority of this in a few weeks, mid-May out in the field and into our production line and it\u2019s not a long pole in any tent, it\u2019s not a gating item on any [perk chart]. So the straight-forwardness of the fix itself, the fact that it doesn\u2019t represent a gating item in any other production or design gives us confidence that this won\u2019t disrupt anything other than the schedule that we\u2019ve laid out.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks a lot.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","You are very welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Yes, thank you very much. So Jim, you mentioned you\u2019re expecting to launch the -10 this year. What would it take to launch, because it doesn\u2019t look like you have a whole lot of delivery slot open at a rate of 10 a month. What do you need to see in terms of customers and do you also have to make a decision to go to 12 a month to be able to deliver it in a reasonable timeframe?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","","Well, as usual, Cai, you are asking the right question. I mean, I think the \u2013 obviously the stability of 10, the supply chains\u2019 capacity to do the 10 with possible higher rates if that\u2019s what the marketplace supports are the key questions. The cost of doing this airplane and the technical risk of doing it is not high. There would be some capital involved probably, but I think we are feeling very good about all of those issues, okay.","And so, we just want to get through what we\u2019re getting through right now. We want to feel good about the production environment that we feel increasingly confident in and when that all comes together and I would anticipate sooner rather than later, we\u2019re going to be making a call here.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Okay. And so I mean I assume, what\u2019s the earliest you could deliver it?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Well, we\u2019d have to source through that, because if it did require taking up right, that would add a little more time into it. But it\u2019s again we\u2019d have to define that. And we\u2019re working through that right now. I would say the one thing that we don\u2019t lack for with the -10 is demand. Customers want this airplane. And so we\u2019re being pushed to get this airplane out. This is more us being disciplined about feeling comfortable with the business case and about the stability as a manufacturing environment overall before we add something else to it; sooner rather than later.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Thank you very much.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Good morning.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith","Good morning.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Greg, I would like to stick with the 787 learning curve since it\u2019s just such a key component to your cash flow story, and I wanted to ask for clarification and then just a couple of more points on this. But when you\u2019re answering Carter\u2019s question, you mentioned 60%, I wanted to be clear on what you were talking about there? Are you talking about a 60% reduction from the first \u2013 from line number 8 in terms of cash cost?","Gregory D. Smith","","Yeah, that\u2019s unit cost of line number 8 versus unit cost of line number 100.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. So would that then imply something like $160 million cost on 100 down from $400 million on 8?","Gregory D. Smith","I haven\u2019t gotten into specific costs on the airplane for obvious reasons. But I would tell you from a unit cost perspective, we\u2019re continuing to come down the learning curve, and we expect to do that going forward. And again, as I mentioned, it\u2019s not just within our own factories, it\u2019s within our supply chain. I mean, just to give an example, I was out last week lead airplane, they\u2019ve got metrics in place, hours per job, what it is today, what it is on the next airplane, what it needs to be next week, what it needs to be by the end of the year. So they are very aware of what they need to do to come down the learning curve. And again, I think as the production system stabilizes, you\u2019re starting to flush out the efficiencies and we\u2019re assuming they\u2019d be able to do that as we continue to deliver more airplanes.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","On that note, could I ask you if the future step downs or the future improvements in the learning curve because this was a very significant one of course in Q1, are these tied to step downs that are negotiated as the rates bump up, in other words, do we see another big move with 7 and then another big move with 10?","Gregory D. Smith","No.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","And it\u2019s not tied to that?","Gregory D. Smith","No, I mean, I mean, internally I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a pretty traditional learning curve with objectives to meet that curve and then within the supply chain, I think, as I\u2019ve talked before, it\u2019s differed by supplier by supplier depending on what was negotiated. So in some cases, we do have step down pricing at a specific unit. On other cases, you have more of a, I\u2019ll say, kind of a traditional curve. But it differs supplier by supplier as we kind of work through discussion with them. So you won\u2019t see what I would say a traditional learning when you look at an overall basis you have on other programs. But, again, it\u2019s obviously a very big focus item for us, and the teams are very committed to continuing to look at efficiencies and again whether it\u2019s just a supply chain once any airplane program gets to rate and stabilizes, we\u2019ve been able to prove that we\u2019ve been able to flush out inefficiencies and come down the curve even further.","And frankly, I think the 737 is a great example of that where that airplane has been production a long time and there is still opportunities that we\u2019ve been able to capture and efficiencies and we\u2019re going to continue that discipline on the 87. So a lot of work to do, good plans I think in place, but a very committed focus and team to continue down that curve on a unit-by-unit basis.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Right, just on 737 since you brought it up.","Gregory D. Smith","Yeah.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Jim talked about bridging the two models with Ryanair order.","Gregory D. Smith","Yeah.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","How should we think about pricing during that period of time and margins on the aircraft and then the mix of production, will you overlap or make something of a clean break between the two in that timeframe?","Gregory D. Smith","No, it will be gradual, it will \u2013 part of the production plan there is to, as you phase out NG, ramping up MAX at the same time so there is some capital that we\u2019ve invested there to really do that seamlessly and have the MAX running down and we improved out on one line as the NG line continues to be at peak rate and then we\u2019ll make the full transition. So I think they\u2019ve got a very good discipline, well thought out manufacturing plan, well in advance of going into final assembly obviously. as far as pricing is, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s pretty much in line and it\u2019s playing out within our expectations. As I said before, certainly, when you have end of line or you have airplanes that are first launch customers and so on, there you see some more attractive pricing in that regard. but overall, I think it\u2019s coming in within our expectations.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith","And the team is doing a great job, executing rates, I mean record rate there with record low shortages, single-digit over time, and a very good plan in place to get the 42.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Thanks very much.","Gregory D. Smith","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gursky \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Gregory D. Smith","Good morning.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Good morning, Jason.","Jason M. Gursky \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Congratulations on dealing with the battery issue, it\u2019s a very nice way I thought.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Thank you.","Jason M. Gursky \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","A quick clarification for Greg on the 787, you suggested that when it stabilizes, things will get a lot better, can you just clarify exactly how long it takes to stabilize the rate. And then Jim, can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on in services. Generally speaking, what your approach is to services going forward for as far as growth is concerned, and obviously, it seems some really nice margin performance in services, particularly on the military side here recently. Can you just offer a little bit of color as to generally what\u2019s going on in services, why the good perform and what the outlook looks like there?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Yeah. I think on the \u2013 make sure I answer your question on the unit costs. But as we peak and then that\u2019s when we\u2019ll start to become positive on a unit cost basis, again, it stabilized, and that\u2019s usually about a year, year and a half once we hit 10. and that\u2019s the plan right now. But based on everything else, you\u2019ve heard me say today, we\u2019re continuing to try to pull that to the left the best we can. But essentially, that\u2019s kind of a time frame that you\u2019d be looking at on a unit basis.","Gregory D. Smith","And on your question on services, I mean I think overall, in both sides of our business we see it as a growth opportunity. I think if there was a theme \u2013 since we\u2019re leveraging the largest installed base in aerospace in both our Defense and Commercial business, there is an asset that many other don\u2019t have. And but on top of that footprint, I think there is a theme of injecting more technology and more IT into the services we\u2019re adding.","And so I would say those two themes plus the theme of sort of packaged multiyear commitments, where we\u2019re guaranteeing some performance with technology and the reason we can do that, again some known income stream does. And the reason we think we can do that more effectively than others is again, because we know the technology involved better than anyone else.","And so I think these multiyear deals, more IT, particularly on the logistics side and more technology for mods and modifications, I think that all spells a major growth opportunities. We just keep our feet underneath ourselves and make the right combo of acquisitions and internal investments. And it seems to be going well as you noted.","Jason M. Gursky \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Yeah.","Gregory D. Smith","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you.

James McNerney, Jr.","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith","Good morning.","Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee","Nice quarter. Jim, I guess talking about 787 going back to when days of Global Aeronautica used to be the long pole in the tent, it sounds like in South Carolina, things are progressing quite well. And you\u2019re also announcing a big investment there. I think earlier this month, you made an announcement about $1 billion investment. Can you give us just some more color about what you\u2019re seeing down there in the opportunity and what kind of flexibility that\u2019s going to build in for you given all these projects you have got planned?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Peter, we see South Carolina as exceeding expectations in terms of its performance to date. Greenfield operations in this industry are not easy and I give credit to the entire Boeing team plus the team in Everett that went out of their way to help make South Carolina a success story early on. So, all the metrics there are good in terms of production rates and efficiencies and cost and productivity. And as you pointed out, we are going to deepen our engagements down there.","I mean, we have \u2013 South Carolina has, and we have put together a deal that offers incentives to us, but asks us to perform against those incentives in terms of investments and new jobs over, I believe it\u2019s an 8-year period and we\u2019re excited about that because I think Boeing overall is stronger and can handle the growth that we see in front of us. We see tremendous growth in front of us for the next couple of decades and we\u2019re going to need a number of places from which we can draw talent and use capital, and so we\u2019re very pleased that South Carolina is moving along as well as it is.","Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay.

But I know we\u2019re all interested and wondered if you could talk more about the cost of the 787 fix and how that will be handled in accounting. I understand it\u2019s amortized over an accounting block of 1100 planes, just a little more detail about that and what you think it cost Boeing overall, even though it\u2019s not hitting the income statement, that would be great.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","I\u2019ll ask Greg to answer that question for you, Al.","Al Scott \u2013 Reuters","Thanks","","Gregory D. Smith","It was in \u2013 the majority of it wasn\u2019t reflected in our Q1 results and that was cost, period cost and particularly around R&D and around our route cause investigation, redesign and the testing of that and then also our estimated cost of incurring the repair for a customers\u2019 fleet going forward. So that\u2019s what was primarily reflected there. And as far as the cost basis you referred to in the 1100 units, there was a slight increase there for the additional retrofit on the undelivered airplanes throughout the balance of the cost base.","Al Scott \u2013 Reuters","Can you give numbers and R&D went down. So\u2026","Gregory D. Smith","Well, we managed to absorb this. So it was \u2013 it was really a matter of priorities. I mean re-shifted our priorities and our people on to this effort from other efforts. And this is a one Boeing effort, so it was people from NVCA and BDS and our engineering and technology areas and so on, so\u2026.","Al Scott \u2013 Reuters","And the additional retrofit, how does that affect your accounting block?","Gregory D. Smith","","Yeah, it\u2019s minimal within the accounting block.","Al Scott \u2013 Reuters","","1,100 up to \u2026","Gregory D.

Our next question in queue will come from Jon Ostrower with the Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Jon Ostrower \u2013 Wall Street Journal","","Good morning, gentlemen.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Good morning, Jon.","Jon Ostrower \u2013 Wall Street Journal","","Question about the decision to the production profile for 777-X. You talked about different competing production locations. Can you kind of talk about the considerations there as you see it, and also the 787 learning curve looking at a 60% reduction from airplane 8 to airplane 100 with 92 airplanes of learning in that process. Can you talk about how that compares to 777, and just doing a rough calculations with numbers seems to indicate that it\u2019s actually higher than 85% learning curve there that would seem to indicate that it\u2019s actually cost is coming up as fast as it wasn\u2019t like 777. Can you kind of talk about those two factors?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Jon, I\u2019ll give you the answer on 777, and then I\u2019ll let Greg handle the learning curve question. I think we have figured out by and large what airplane to build. We think we know and as you know as well because you know us well, the composite length modified fuselage new engines, okay. And so, the question there is, the question then becomes and we\u2019re sort of in the middle of assessment now, where to assemble it and where to build the major components and we\u2019re in the middle of that process. I mean, obviously, Everett is doing one heck of a job right now, building the current 777 model.","And so Everett obviously be an attractive place to consider for the assembly, for the next 777 model, the composite way. We have to think through as in the case of assembly where we do that, but we are sort of in the middle of that, and I think over the next few months we\u2019ll be in a position to talk more in a more granular way about what makes the more sense for our customers and for the company. Greg?","Gregory D. Smith","Yeah, with regards to the learning curve, yeah, you\u2019ve seen a 60 per slope there from unit 8 to 100 if you compare that to 777, some of that obviously is just the upfront disruption. But over time, the learning curve assumptions will be very similar to what we\u2019ve seen on the 777. So it\u2019s really just kind of the upfront units that really differentiate that curve.","Jon Ostrower \u2013 Wall Street Journal","How are you seeing the 787 curve now, is it \u2013 how is it kind of working with the first 100 airplanes, I mean obviously, there was a lot of disruption in terms of the reworking of all that.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Right.","Jon Ostrower \u2013 Wall Street Journal","Are you seeing, as you kind of got stabilized from airplane 66 to 92, how is that curve looking as far as cost reduction goes?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Yeah, I mean, I would say, we\u2019re coming down the curve as we had planned to whether it\u2019s in final assembly or within Charleston. So I think the teams are tracking well to the plan we put in place there. And certainly as we\u2019ve eliminated any disruption and we are seeing components coming in with no open work. Again, it really allows the production system to operate as it was designed and stabilize and therefore be able to come down the curve further and we expected going forward throughout the block. So again, I think we are making good progress, lot of work in front of us, but the teams are focused and dedicated to it and we got to stay on it.","Jon Ostrower \u2013 Wall Street Journal","Thanks, guys.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question in queue will come from Christopher Drew with The New York Times. Please go ahead.","Christopher Drew \u2013 The New York Times","Jim, could you step back a second and perhaps reflect a bit on why it\u2019s so hard to make a new plane these days, when I think more broadly of not just the 87, but the F-35, some of the Airbus planes, and whether at all those difficulties are now going to lead to this narrow, a little bit more caution here with the harvesting of the technologies rather than big new planes for quite a while.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Well, I think, one thing I\u2019ve learned in this industry is not to comment on another guy\u2019s airplane.","Christopher Drew \u2013 The New York Times","Okay.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","So, if you don\u2019t mind, I'll resist any Lockheed Martin or Airbus, I\u2019m impressed enough with how hard it is to manage what I\u2019ve got to manage. I would say though there\u2019s a theme here. The \u2013 if you look back in the 100 years that we\u2019ve been in business, we go through areas where we get excited by new technologies, because of the performance it can bring to our customers, whether it\u2019s cloth to aluminum, whether it\u2019s sort of quilted aluminum to smooth aluminum. And then, there\u2019s \u2013 there are just technological shifts that have gone on and as you make the first bite of that apple, you tend to be on the bleeding edge for a while as you\u2019ve heard me characterize, and I think that was the case with the 787. We should have been, that\u2019s not an excuse, we should have been more disciplined about the way we went about that.","And it has given us, and I think to your point, it now has given us a suite of technologies that we now can deploy now that they were matured in a bleeding edge fashion over the last 8 years. I think the next decade or two that allows us to mature these matured technologies into a number of applications. And each and everyone of the commercial applications that I talked about today whether it\u2019s the 737, 787 or the 777, new derivatives are all going to be step function improvements, much more than a normal derivative even though the cost and work will be roughly the same as new derivative, but the reason they\u2019ll provide, more benefit is because of all the investments and all the bleeding edge work we did over the last decade.","So I think we may be in an era where we can absorb somewhat less risk and still deliver a lot of performance. 30 years from now will there be some new technology that we\u2019ll all wrestle with, probably. Hopefully will there be enough people in Boeing that are here today that will remember the lessons learned from the 87, I hope so. I\u2019m old. I\u2019ll be on a beach somewhere then. But anyway that\u2019s kind of the answer.","Christopher Drew \u2013 The New York Times","Okay, thank you.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","","Yeah, of course.","Operator","","Thank you.

James McNerney, Jr.","","Yes, yes, loud and clear. Good, can I just take you back to the 787 and the cost of the (inaudible)? Can you just spell out please, what you estimate the cost, the fix that you\u2019ve got to prove along from the FAA, what that is going to cost? And also can you speak to airlines have been talking about compensation, can you give, for the disruption of those schedules et cetera, can you give any sort of sense on the quantum you expect in terms of compensation that you may have to pay?","Gregory D. Smith","Yeah, I\u2019ll start with the cost. As I mentioned earlier, the costs that were incurred in the first quarter were around the root cause investigation, the redesign and the testing of the components. and then an estimate of what we think it\u2019s going to cause to repair the balance of the customer\u2019s fleet. That was predominantly what was reflected in the first quarter. I\u2019ll let Jim talk about.","Andrew Parker \u2013 Financial Times","Forgive me for interrupting. Can you spell out what that cost is then that\u2019s gone through your Q1 earnings statement?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","We haven\u2019t talked specific on the numbers. but it\u2019s minor in comparison to the overall results. And again, we were able to absorb that by reallocating resources and expertise on to this. So again, what you saw in the results for Q1, we\u2019re able to absorb that and that\u2019s in those margins and at the same time, able to hold our full-year guidance based on that.","Andrew Parker \u2013 Financial Times","All right. And does \u2013 to your point of that as well as the testing of the fix, and so you said that it also reflects some of the cost of actually doing the work on the 50 planes that you\u2019ve so far delivered.","Gregory D. Smith","Correct.","Andrew Parker \u2013 Financial Times","Does it include the cost of fixing all of those 50\u2026","Gregory D. Smith","Yeah.","Andrew Parker \u2013 Financial Times","\u2026or just some of them?","Gregory D. Smith","No, that includes our estimated cost of what we think it\u2019s going to take to do all 50 airplanes.","Andrew Parker \u2013 Financial Times","Right. and forgive me, can you give us a specific number then on this cost?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","","No.","Andrew Parker \u2013 Financial Times","Right, it\u2019s okay. And to the point about compensation please?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Yeah. I\u2019ll take that one Andrew. I mean I think, as you know, there are no contractual obligations there. But having said that, there are a few places where we\u2019ll work with our customers to ensure and there\u2019s a variety of ways we can work with them to ensure that the disruption doesn\u2019t hurt their results in there and their operation more than it needs to. And that\u2019ll be at a different way with every, every customer.","Andrew Parker \u2013 Financial Times","","Right, and could I just follow-up with one final thing. Forgive me, because you may have addressed this earlier, but when do you expect the 787 program to reach break-even on a unit basis at least?","Gregory D. Smith","Yeah. it\u2019s when we reach, when we peak on our deferred production and basically, peak at rate in about a year, a year and a half from that time period is when on a unit basis, we will break the curve versus program accounting.","Andrew Parker \u2013 Financial Times","","Sorry.

James McNerney, Jr.","Well, I think this will be a derivative airplane, a significant derivative airplane. The two new key technologies will be a composite wing, which will be a fourth generation composite wing for us. So this is an example of a game changing technology that we now have good experience with and now have matured and the second will be new engines on the airplane. And our discussions with customers have said that the range and efficiency that this engine wing combination will produce is significant in their minds. And that there\u2019ll be a splitting of value between us and our customers that works for both of us, that\u2019s those are the discussions we\u2019re having right now. We have a lot of confidence that about the executability of this plane and the pricing we think, we can get that will benefit both us and our customers. So we\u2019re pretty far down that evaluation and we\u2019re excited about what we see.","Thomas Black \u2013 Bloomberg News","You talked about some step function improvements that came from the learning on the 787?","W.

James McNerney, Jr.","Yes, I mean\u2026","Thomas Black \u2013 Bloomberg News","For example, you had more electrical components on there versus some of the bleed of the engines that you use them?","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Yes. I mean I think that the biggest of those things would be the wing, okay.","Thomas Black \u2013 Bloomberg News","Okay.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Composite wings are incredibly efficient as compared to aluminum wings, not only in the way, not only in the aero dynamics, but in the weight on them. And that plus the engines are producing over 90% of the value of this airplane. let me just leave it that way.","Thomas Black \u2013 Bloomberg News","Okay.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","And the composite wing, the bigger of composite wing gets the more efficient it becomes and this is a big composite wing.","Thomas Black \u2013 Bloomberg News","Okay. And if I could just on the economic versus range some airlines want more range, others want more\u2026","W. James McNerney, Jr.","Well, I think the market segment that this is going into in general, launches much range as they can get.","Thomas Black \u2013 Bloomberg News","Okay.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","And so we will have two models that have different capacities, so thick roots versus thinner roots. But range is something that within reason, they\u2019re going to pay for.

And our final question will come from Josh Freed with the Associated Press. Please go ahead.","Josh Freed \u2013 Associated Press","","Hi, there.","W. James McNerney, Jr.","","Hi, Josh.","Josh Freed \u2013 Associated Press","","One last question on the 787 cost; can you give any kind of ballpark parameter around the per unit cost of the fix for the ones that are out in the fleet, and obviously that number then won\u2019t include all of the work that went into developing the fix. But can you help us think about what it costs to actually install the thing on planes that are out there now?","Gregory D. Smith","Yeah, again I would say it was not significant. You saw it in the first quarter results. So the margins, just softer BCA absorb that and again, not significant. When you look at the overall program over a 1100 unit; very, very small because if you think about it, you had to put a battery on those airplanes, you\u2019re putting a different configuration here. So it\u2019s rather minimal on a unit-by-unit basis, if you look over the 1,100 units.","Josh Freed \u2013 Associated Press","All right and what\u2019s the current 787 inventory and what\u2019s it going to be in May when the deliveries restart?","Gregory D. Smith","Well, the 787 inventory is going to continue to grow as we build up for ramping up production. And then that will be offset by the increase in deliveries. So we expect it to grow. It\u2019s planned to grow as we increase again, as we increase rates. And some of that will be offset by the increase in deliveries. But this quarter, I think, total program was about $28.8 billion.","Josh Freed \u2013 Associated Press","So I\u2019m sorry. What I mean was how many airplanes do you have that have been built, but not delivered now and how many will you have in May when those deliveries then resume?","Gregory D. Smith","Well, we\u2019ve got 25 airplanes that are on the ramp today that are completed out of final, five in Charleston, 20 in Everett that are essentially waiting for the battery to be swapped out. So those airplanes obviously, once we get through the retrofit, we\u2019ll get them in to our normal test flight schedule and customer delivery and they\u2019re all assumed in our delivery profile through the balance of the year.","Operator, that concludes our earnings call. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions while we didn\u2019t get to your question, please give our media relations team a call at 312-544-2002. Thank you.

Good day, everyone. And welcome to The Boeing Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analysts and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy Lahr","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. I am Troy Lahr and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in today\u2019s press release and you can follow this broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals included in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings, and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation.","In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures, and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","Jim McNerney","Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin today with a brief review of some recent strategic achievements, followed by comments on our strong 2014 operating performance, then an overview of the business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail.","Now, let\u2019s move to slide two please. Boeing is entering 2015 stronger, healthier and better positioned in its markets than any time in recent memory. Our strategic accomplishments over the past 24 months alone provide a compelling picture of the progress we have made to enable sustain growth and improving profitability as we near the start of our second century in business.","During that timeframe, we captured more than 2,700 net new Commercial Airplane orders, grew our market share and deliveries with six successful production rate increases, including reaching our target 10 per month on the 787 with more than three per month following steadily from our capacity expansion in South Carolina.","We completed a comprehensive refresh of our Commercial Airplane product line with the highly successful launches of the twin-aisle 787-10 and the 777X on a combined 400 orders and commitments, and the launch of the single-aisle 737 MAX 200 with a 100 airplane order from Lion Air.","Starting with the hard-fought technology gains of 787, we have built a substantial technological lead in commercial aviation, particularly in the high-value twin-aisle market.","And by listening to our customers and applying our proven technologies and lessons learned, in summary, we have derisk a decade of new product development, while expanding our edge in the performance and efficiency of our airplanes.","Turning to Boeing defense, space and security, despite a top domestic budget environment, BDS continued to strengthen its relative market position and competitiveness.","We have accomplished this by driving significant new efficiencies in response to the environment in order to meet government customer needs and fund investments in technology and innovation, including in space programs, where we have restored our technological lead and market position in satellites, autonomous spacecraft, missile defense and human space flight.","To the benefit of both businesses, we also secured unprecedented production continuity and improved economics with long-term labor agreements at our major production sites in Puget Sound, St. Louis and Philadelphia, and we retired significant and long-standing legal and financial risks from billions in potential liability on matters such as the A-12 program to the short-term threat to our balance sheet from Defined Benefit Pensions.","As you know by the end of next year, approximately 90% of our workforce will participate in Defined Contribution Plan, which provide attractive and competitive benefits to employees without the risks to our balance sheet. Going forward, we remain ever focused on driving productivity and executing on our growth initiatives, which are fundamental to our success.","To meet customer demand for our market leading Commercial Airplanes, we have five more rate increases ahead of us over the remainder of the decade. These higher production volumes will provide additional opportunities for driving step function gains in productivity for us and our suppliers through lean plus, capturing the value of quality and our partnering for success efforts.","We are equally committed to breaking the cost curve on our new development programs and delivering them on time with performance as advertised. To that end, we have focused our engineering teams on designs that are more producible, common systems and parts across airplane families and our disciplined gated development process.","We have also increased our investment in manufacturing and production innovations, including automation to increase quality and safety in the workplace and reduce load times.","Overall for 2015 and throughout the remainder of the decade, these recent achievements in the marketplace, in our operations and in our financial performance set the stage for expected significant cash generation, the flexibility to invest for growth in support of our customers and the increasing return of cash to shareholders.","With that as perspective, let\u2019s discuss our 2014 results on slide three please. Strong fourth quarter results driven by higher commercial deliveries and solid operating performance capped an outstanding year. We continue to develop -- to deliver on our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the company.","For the full year we reported record revenue and core earnings per share, solid operating margins and strong cash flow, much of which was returned to shareholders. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $60 billion for the year, on higher production rates and an industry record 723 delivers, which expanded our global market share leadership in deliveries for the third consecutive year.","2014 was also an exceptional year for new bookings, as we captured commercial gross orders of 1,550 airplanes and record net orders of 1,432 airplanes, which increased our backlog to nearly 5,800 airplanes. When combined with strong orders from our Defense business, total company backlog grew to a record $502 billion.","Other Commercial Airplanes key milestones in 2014 included successfully reaching the 42 per month production rate on the 737 and announcing plans to increase the 52 in 2018. Model certification and delivery of the first 10 787-9, completing preliminary design review on the 787-10 and breaking ground on the new 777X composite centers in Puget Sound and St. Louis.","Boeing defense, space and security also had a very strong year, with solid revenue, healthy margins and significant new business wins and program milestones. Key contract awards captured during the fourth quarter, included an order for two 702 high-power satellites, multiple long-term international service contracts, including a 25-year order from the Australian Government to train rotary wing aircrews valued at approximately $500 million, and finalization of the NASA Commercial Crew Award announced in the third quarter.","Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included the first flight of the 767-2C test aircraft for the KC-46 tanker program, the selection of the V-22 by Japan to fulfill their tilt-rotor aircraft requirements and U.S. Government funding for EA-18G Growler production.","Finally, our strong operational performance trend, significant cash flow and confidence in the future, all supported by our December announcement of the new share repurchase authorization totaling $12 billion and a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 4. Our view of the business environment remains positive, given favorable global air traffic trends, improving airline profitability and the continuing need for efficient and value-creating products we provide.","Strong growth in the commercial airplane market continues to drive demand that supports our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade. Net new orders for 2014 that I mentioned earlier were essentially twice our 2014 output, and our record backlog of 5,800 airplanes represents approximately eight years of production at current rates.","Replacement demand remains an important market driver, with airlines continuing to introduce newer more efficient airplanes with superior economics and a rapid return on investment in place of older less efficient models and service. Notwithstanding, a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one.","Historically, we have seen aircraft orders more correlated to airline profits. And as many of you may recall, we closed the business case for and launched the 787, when oil was at $40 a barrel. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, more oil prices have not substantially changed their views on fleet planning, for their commitment to existing delivery schedules.","Our new technologically advanced airplanes, not only have far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, but also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range, allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.","Overall, we see low fuel prices and positive traffic trends as beneficial to our industry and growth prospects. Our long-term outlook also remain strong, as we expect the combination of growth and replacement to drive the need for nearly 37,000 aircrafts over the next 20 years.","In the twin-aisle segment, we continued to see healthy demand for both the 777 and the 777X, which are outselling the competition by a wide margin, giving us confidence in our ability to efficiently transition production between the two airplanes. In 2014, we captured 63 new orders for current 777 models, giving us 217 firm orders in backlog.","We expect demand for the 777 to remain healthy through the end of this decade, with an anticipated average order capture of around 40 to 60 airplanes per year to support the transition to the 777X. With the new airplanes -- with the new airplanes scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 timeframe, this transition will leverage new manufacturing processes and technologies being proven on the current 777 to optimize the 777X production system.","On the 787 program, which delivered a twin-aisle industry record, 114 airplanes in 2014, we remain focused on continued production efficiencies and support our future planned rate increases to match the strong market demand for the airplane. Since the first customer flight, 787 fleet has now flown -- has now safely flown approximately 30 million passengers more than 400 million miles, while saving 1 billion pounds of fuel, providing game-changing efficiencies and capabilities to 29 customers worldwide.","In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX, also remains high with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,660 airplanes from 57 customers. The Development of the MAX remains on track for the first delivery in 2017.","Turning to defense, space and security, we continued to see solid support among U.S. customers and Congress for our major programs. In addition to the Growler funding I mentioned earlier, the FY \u201815 budget signed into law in December fully funds other core Boeing production programs, such as the Apache helicopter and the P-8A Poseidon. Key development programs like tanker and Long-Range Strike also were fully funded and additional funds were added for the Space Launch System.","We continue to see strong international demand for our offerings as well, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2014, international customers for our defense, space and security represented 28% of revenue and 36% of our current backlog. While notable alone for its size, the strength of our international defense backlog also comes from its diversity across our product and services portfolio and the geographic mix of its customer base.","Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas, such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and the critical few large-scale future programs that are priorities for our customers like Long-Range Strike, UCLASS and the T-X Trainer.","The relative strength of our defense, space and security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative, which is focused on reducing operating costs by another $2 billion to ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending.","In summary, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and our teams are executing them well to deliver topline and bottom-line performance and capture new business to sustain our growth and profitability for the decades to come.","Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?","Greg Smith","Thanks, Jim and good morning. Let's turn to slide 5 to discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $91 billion, reflecting 5% growth from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business.","Core earnings per share totaled $8.60 for the year, representing a 22% increase. The increase in core EPS was driven by strong operational performance across the company. Adjusting for the tax items in the A-12 litigation settlement 2013, core earnings per share increased 14%.","Operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $8.9 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and expenditures, and capturing the early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives.","Let\u2019s now move to our quarterly results on slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 3% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong Commercial Airplane deliveries. Core operating margins increased to 9.6%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses.","Fourth quarter core earnings per share increased 23% to $2.31 on higher volume and continued strong operating performance. Fourth quarter 2013 included again $0.34 for the A-12 litigation settlement.","Let\u2019s now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 7. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplane business increased revenue 15% to $16.8 billion on a record 195 airplane deliveries and solid operating margins of 9.3%.","The margin benefit from the higher volume mature program was offset by the impact of higher 787 deliveries and the anticipated increase in period costs, primarily for investments to support future growth and productivity.","Commercial Airplanes revenue for the year was a record $16 billion, an increase of 13% as we successfully executed on our planned production rate increases, resulting again a record deliveries totaling 723 aircrafts. Commercial Airplanes captured $27 billion of net orders during the quarter and backlog grew to a new record of $440 billion and nearly 5800 aircraft.","Specifically on the 787, we exceeded our delivery guidance for the full year as the team worked hard to deliver 114 787s and in total, we've now delivered 228 787s to 29 customers, 14 of which were new customers in 2014. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we further implement production efficiencies and stabilized the overall 787 production system.","On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 30% over the last 175 deliveries and on 787-9, we\u2019ve seen declines of 20% since the first delivery. Based on this progress, our production schedule and planned productivity investments, we continue to expect the 787 to be cash positive during 2015 and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we\u2019ve achieved the 12 per month production rate in 2016. No change to these fundamental milestones.","In the fourth quarter, the 787 deferred production increased $960 million to $26.1 billion and we now anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at moderate levels for the next several quarters as productivity improvements on both models offset timing of supplier negotiations, further investments to optimize the production system and our decision to maintain higher employment levels to ensure the continued smooth introduction of the 787-9 and further incorporate additional productivity and reliability investments.","These focused decisions and efforts are expected to continue to drive long-term efficiencies, margin improvement and cash generation on the 787 program. Overall, our focus and priorities remain unchanged for the 787 program. Solid day-to-day execution, risk reduction and improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward while continuing to have smooth ramp up on the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 per month rate introducing the -10 while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.","Let\u2019s turn now to Defense, Space and Security results on slide eight. Fourth quarter revenue for our defense business was $7.6 billion and operating margin increased to 12.1% due to strong business across the portfolio. Revenue for Boeing Military Aircraft declined to $3 billion in the fourth quarter resulting from lower planned C-17 and F-15 deliveries. Operating margins increased to 12.3% in the quarter, driven by solid operating performance.","Network and Space Systems revenue declined to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower government satellite volume. Operating margin at N&SS was 8.8% in the quarter. Global Services & Support reported 2% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $2.4 billion on higher MM&U volume and generate strong operating margin of 14.9%, driven by higher operating performance. Defense, Space and Security reported a solid backlog of $62 billion with 36% of our current backlog now representing some customers outside the United States.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide nine. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by higher volume, strong operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and expenditures and again early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives. With regard to capital deployment, we paid $519 million in dividend to shareholders and repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our total 2014 repurchase activity to 47 million shares for $6 billion.","And as Jim mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase optimization to $12 billion and increased the dividend 25%, up 88% in the last two years. We expect to complete the repurchase authorization over approximately the next two to three years.","Our capital deployment to date continues to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and backlog and our commitment and confidence in the business performing well going forward. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains priority for us.","Let\u2019s now move to cash and debt balances on slide 10. We ended the quarter with $13.1 billion of cash and marketable securities and our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. Again our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key growth areas of the business, returning cash to shareholders and execute our cash deployment strategies going forward.","Turning now to slide 11, we\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2015. Our guidance for 2015 reflects solid core operating performance, higher deliveries at Commercial Airplanes business while reflecting the near-term investments needed to support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity. Core earnings per share guidance for 2015 is set to be between $8.20 and $8.40 per share and excluding the 2014 tax settlements totaling $0.71 per share. 2015 earnings per share is expected to grow between 4% and 6%.","Revenue for 2015 is forecast to increase to be between $94.5 billion and $96.5 billion, representing growth of between 4% and 6%. Our 2015 Commercial Airplane revenue guidance is between $64.5 billion and $65.5 billion reflecting 8% to 9% growth as we execute on our record backlog.","The 2015 commercial delivery forecast is now between 750 and 755 airplanes and 787 deliveries for 2015 are expected to be essentially in line with the 10 per rate -- 10 per month production rate plus a few early build deliveries. Commercial Airplanes operating margin guidance is set to be between 9.5% and 10% on improved operating performance offset by greater dilution impact of higher planned research and development spending, higher 787 deliveries and further investments to support future growth.","Defense, Space and Security revenue guidance for 2015 is between $29.5 billion and $30.5 billion reflecting the continued challenging defense environment, particularly offset -- partially offset, excuse me -- by the ongoing international growth. Operating margin guidance of the defense business is now between 9.75% and 10% reflecting continued productivity efforts offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix.","Supporting our long-term growth plans, we expect research and development spending for 2015 to be approximately $3.5 billion, with about 70% related to 787, particularly driven by the planned increase in 777X and 787-10 development while at BDS, we continue to invest in key strategic growth opportunities going forward. We expect operating cash flow for 2015 to be greater than $9 billion, reflecting higher deliveries, strong operating performance, continued 787 productivity and capturing the final C-17 orders.","This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax payments and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures benefited 2014 results. As we look forward, we expect further growth in operating cash flow in 2016 as we continue to execute on our backlog, capture additional productivity gains and improve 787 cash performance.","Capital spend guidance for 2015 is approximately $2.8 billion driven by the new 777X facilities and equipment, Charleston expansion to support the 787 rate increase, and other investments to support continued growth and productivity. Our required pension contributions in 2015 will be minimal as a result of legislative pension changes. We are now foregoing discretionary pension funding in 2015.","As we look into the next quarter we expect first quarter revenue, core EPS, and cash flow could be the lowest during the year based on timing of deliveries, phasing the expenditures and advances. First quarter EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full earnings.","So in summary, Boeing\u2019s 2014 financial performance and the 2015 financial guidance reflects the strong demand for our products and services, the strength of our backlog, and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the entire enterprise.","With that, I will now turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.","Jim McNerney","Thank you, Greg. 2014 was another year of strong operating performance and significant cash generation, as we successfully executed on our record backlog that allowed us to return cash to our shareholders, while still prudently investing to sustain our growth and competitive advantage. Built upon an underlying foundation, 2014 was a very strong year for Boeing as we continue to deliver on the significant and sustained growth and increasing profitability and cash flow that our strategies were designed to produce.","Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our employees, our partners, and customers around the world. We achieved critical strategic milestones in both businesses. Continued focus and execution on production and development programs that are important to our customers and maintain our relentless focus on productivity to enable continued investment in our future, all of which sets the stage for further growth and sustained business performance for customers and shareholders in the years ahead.","Now we would be delighted to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Just some quick clarifications about your comments on deferred production Greg, and a question. Did that change result and any negative margin impact on the program and how far rightward did it shift the cash breakeven point you had talked about in the past?","And then just from a high level, does it change -- does the differencing in the profile, a deferred production here represent a change in how you\u2019re managing the program or thinking about the long-term risk profile or return profile on the program? Is it reactive in anyway? Just from a high level, is there something more we should read into that and how you\u2019re approaching risk and return now?","Greg Smith","Yes -- no, I think that there you shouldn\u2019t look at any differently, Carter. I think when you step back and you look at how this program has performed, it\u2019s performed very well, 114 deliveries last year, and obviously we\u2019ve reached the record production rate higher than any wide-body in aviation history and we are planning to go up.","The fundamental milestones that you talked about with regard to cash positive, we still expect that in '15 and we still expect deferred to decline shortly after we hit that 12 a month that we are planning for in '16. So those things have not changed.","We obviously -- as I discussed, we see next two to three quarters similar growth than what we\u2019ve seen and then later in '15 the decline at a healthier rate. But all of that is anticipated in the guidance we gave in cash flow. And at the end of the day, that\u2019s what matters. You\u2019ve seen our results in '14, you see our guidance for '15, our cash, all that is again taking into consideration.","Carter Copeland","And the program margin?","Greg Smith","Program margin was just down slightly in the quarter but not significant.","Carter Copeland","Okay. Thanks.","Greg Smith","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And next, we will take Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Good morning.","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Doug Harned","I am interested, you\u2019ve got -- I mean, you\u2019ve had very strong cash in Q4, so we are looking at more than $9 billion in operating cash in '15. And then, I was surprised to see deferred continuing to rise. Could you walk through, really two things here, the puts and takes of getting of your cash -- operating cash flow in '14 to '15?","And then, when you look at how much you\u2019ve got in the balance sheet, you\u2019ve got now cash in STI of over $13 billion and you\u2019re going to generate more than $6 billion in free cash flow. How do you expect to deploy that? You should have declining risk here. This is a lot of cash. And it seems like it\u2019s a lot more than you would really need to manage the company on the balance sheet today.","Greg Smith","Well, as you know, Doug, one of the strategies we had in place was to derisk the decade and we\u2019ve certainly done. The risk profile going forward is a very different than it was in the past. And so continuing to execute on delivering on the backlog, focusing on the core operating performance, again improving the 787 cash profile, and of course capturing those final C-17, that\u2019s the biggest driver from '14 to '15. We are going to have higher cash taxes because we are improving unit costs on 787. And we have again slightly higher R&D, all planned out, 777X and 10X. So those are kind of the moving pieces from '14 to '15.","With regards to deployment, you\u2019ve seen what we did last year. You see the authorization we have in place, it\u2019s in place to utilize it and we plan to do that.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much.","Jim McNerney","Good morning, Howard.","Howard Rubel","Good morning. Nice numbers.","Jim McNerney","Thank you.","Howard Rubel","One question related to 787 and sort of orders related. As I look at it, this year is more of a year to fill in some holes and demonstrate that the products you have, have extended legs. Could you address some of the opportunities with some specificity on 777? And then also on what you\u2019re finding from customer feedback on the 787? And what kind of movement there is to Dash 9s?","Jim McNerney","Let me take a swing at that one Howard. On the 777, the good issue there obviously is the bridge, transition to the bridge because I think the market is focused on the launch of the 777X, a very robust launch. As to the bridge, there is 63 orders this year that Ray and his team secured bodes well for the 40 to 60 we need over the next few years to get to the bridge. So I am feeling increasingly comfortable there. Long-term demand for the airplane, there is no competition for the airplane. So I feel very good about the long-term demand for the airplane.","I think on the 787, I think what you\u2019re going to see is a mix from Dash 8s to Dash 9s to Dash 10s and that we saw moving around this skyline as that\u2019s accommodated. That\u2019s all good news for The Boeing Company in the sense that we\u2019re usually selling more capability for higher price and that dynamic, I don\u2019t see changing. I think we are still -- we are little bit hampered by the number of orders we have, I mean, that\u2019s without the 20, 21ish.","I would anticipate toward the end of this year and in the next year a rekindling of orders on the 87 as we get a little closer to the end of the decade. People begin to pick up options. The moving around of the Skyline was subsided a little bit. And the airplanes performance, quite frankly, I cited it in my remarks, the airplanes performance to be candid is better I think, by and large, than we sold it at.","And we are very pleased with the operating costs, the fuel savings obviously, and the thing that is often left unnoticed here is that this grows the market. This airplane enables wide-body or any kind of body, quite frankly, city pairs that have never been enabled before. And so I\u2019m sort of making up the number, but it's 20% of the demand for this thing is opening up capacity between city pairs that was not available before because of the performance of the airplane. So it\u2019s a little bit longer answer than you wanted, but that\u2019s my dump on the subject.","Howard Rubel","Thank you much.","Jim McNerney","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Nadol","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Jim McNerney","Hey, Joe.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Joe Nadol","Greg, I had a couple for you on just deferred. So wondering if you could as you\u2019ve done the last couple quarters quantify, if there is any pull-forward from building Dash 9 inventory, if you could give us a sense sequentially if Dash 8 and Dash 9 unit costs declined, and if this was just mix related that you didn't see any deferred reduction sequentially?","Greg Smith","Yeah, there was no pull-forward in the quarter, Joe. There was more Dash 9. It was about 30% more Dash 9 mix in third quarter versus fourth quarter. So that obviously had an impact. And then we had more reliability enhancements in the fourth quarter than we did in the third. And again that\u2019s something that we are really trying to be proactive and get those embedded into the production system, so they are there when we deliver the airplane. But those are really the big moving pieces between 3Q and 4Q.","Joe Nadol","So the unit costs on both models did decline sequentially or they were flat?","Greg Smith","They did come down in the quarter.","Joe Nadol","Okay. And then just one final clarification, when you say you expect the program to be cash flow positive in 2015, that\u2019s deferred building, but you deliver a few of the early production aircraft and you\u2019re also including advances in advance of that production rate increase to help to get you to cash flow positive. Is that right?","Greg Smith","Yeah, that\u2019s right, Joe. No change.","Joe Nadol","Okay. Thank you.","Greg Smith","You are welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes. Thanks so much. So you are talking about the deferred going up another, it sounds like $2.5 billion over the next three quarters, that's a pretty big change. Could you give us a little bit more granularity in terms of how much of that is inventory pull-forward, how much of that is buffer stock and how much of that is other items?","Jim McNerney","Yeah. I guess, Cai, I\u2019d put it into three categories. First of all, let me just back up. The things we are doing on this program every day are all about driving cash and profitability over the long-term. So there is going to be decision we make quarter-over-quarter or frankly between last year and this year and forward, that are enhancements to the production system over the long-term that are proven, we've done them on other programs, and now it's about implementing them on the 787. So there\u2019s some of that in there that\u2019s really again focused on investments over the long-term of the program.","On as far as labor, we are coming down on unit cost, but we are coming down in a lower rate than what we expected or anticipated. And again, we are doing that at these higher labor levels to really achieve the stability, incorporate those reliability enhancements I talked about. And then these productivity initiatives, again they are going to take folks to work through each one of those at every sequence of the bill and we are working that. And we are working at an enterprise level. We are leveraging across Boeing.","So we know where the bottlenecks are or some of the challenges are. So now it's about reaching -- when we reach the 10 a month, capturing that and improving upon that. On the supply chain side, we\u2019ve talked about the timing of some of our discussions and negotiations and some of those have moved out to the right and I think I\u2019ve mentioned before that we're seeing a benefit in doing that. These guys are still coming down the learning curve.","We are helping them in encapsulate productivity enhancements that we are seeing or able to achieve in Charleston and Everett, we want to get that back into the supply chain. And then from there, we\u2019ll mature our negotiations. So again a near-term sacrifice, but much long-term benefit frankly for us and our supplier. But those are really the three main categories that we are faced with over the next kind of year and to the end of '15. But very focused again on the long-term and very focused on improving cash in the program and none of those fundamental have changed.","Cai Von Rumohr","Can you quantify any of those three items?","Jim McNerney","No, I can\u2019t Cai. I mean, those are the main three categories, like those are ones we are working on. There is no I see significant split between the three of them.","Cai Von Rumohr","Thank very much.","Jim McNerney","You are welcome.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Jim McNerney","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","I just wanted to see if you could help me out on two things. One is on the C-17, can you talk about how many are on the balance sheet at the end of the year of 2014 and how many you are assuming will be there at the end of 2015?","And then just looking at the share count assumption you have embedded in your guidance? That would seem to imply a pretty sizable buyback in order to get 40 million shares down on average over the course of the year? Can you try and size at all you are thinking around that?","Jim McNerney","Well, on C-17, we\u2019ve got seven that remain unsold, Sam. We delivered seven last year. We\u2019ll deliver four in 2015 and then four in \u201916 and then probably about two in \u201917. So we are in active discussions with customers for the balance of those aircraft remaining and we are highly confident that we\u2019ll sell those and be able deliver them over that timeframe.","On the share count, like I said earlier, you saw what we did in \u201914, we up the reauthorization. So we are very focused on that, and we\u2019ll continue to execute and utilize that authorization.","Sam Pearlstein","Thank you.","Jim McNerney","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning.","Jim McNerney","Morning.","Myles Walton","Hey. Greg, if I kind of look at the last three years, you\u2019ve been running, if you correct for the 787 after-tax, 14 bucks a share, pretty consistently over that period of time or about $10 billion? As you level off on the 787, any reason we shouldn't think about that as a starting point of discussion?","Greg Smith","I'm sorry, Myles, I wasn\u2019t tracking exactly what you are focused on.","Myles Walton","It\u2019s over the last three years you correct for all the 787 inventory build\u2026","Greg Smith","Yeah.","Myles Walton","You\u2019ve been doing a consistent level of $10 billion or about $14 a share in free cash flow.","Greg Smith","Yeah.","Myles Walton","Any reason that shouldn\u2019t be the starting point of a discussion once you do level out on this 787 inventory?","Greg Smith","No. I think that\u2019s fair.","Myles Walton","Okay.","Greg Smith","That\u2019s fair. I mean, obviously, you've seen it, it\u2019s a significant focus area for us and any -- all elements around working capital and we are going to continue that effort going forward.","Myles Walton","Just one clarification, were there any adjustments on the accounting blocks in the quarter?","Greg Smith","Yes. 737, an increase of 200 of -- all of which were MAX airplanes.","Myles Walton","Okay. Thanks.","Greg Smith","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","Jason Gursky","Greg, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the trajectory of CapEx and R&D as we move out into \u201916, \u201917, maybe even into\u201918, just kind of relative to where we are going to be in \u201915, we are going up, down, sideways on those items?","Greg Smith","All I mean, CapEx, this year, obviously, is just tied to the growth, right, it\u2019s on the successful launch of this 777X, the -10 and then, of course, 787 rate combined with 737. So those are the real of a -- fundamental drivers of the growth in CapEx. This year will be increased because of preparing for the entry into service of those aircraft and we will probably have a similar year next year and then it will start to decline from there.","And again, all tied to growth, all tied to the successful launches of those programs, combined with productivity, we\u2019ve got additional productivity initiatives in here, including the automation that, Jim, talked about and so, that\u2019s kind of the profile on CapEx.","For R&D, again, 777X and 10X as 787-9 certainly winds down and 37, I\u2019ll say, MAX continues at a similar spend rate. If you look at the entry into service on 777X, you\u2019re going to see a profile from here, but again you\u2019re going to see 10X declining.","So we\u2019re continuing to manage it and look at further ways to optimize the R&D spend, as Jim has talked about a lot. But for this year, we\u2019re seeing that about $3.5 billion and I think managing it very efficiently and taking advantage of a lot of things, again that Jim highlighted, in doing it in a more efficient and effective manner.","Jason Gursky","Just one quick follow-up on the 777, can you talk a little bit about what the impact is going to be on your ability to deliver aircraft late in the decade, as you said, they\u2019re in the 777X, will that be coming in at the slower flow time and will your ability to deliver come under some pressure as throughout late in the second\u2026","Greg Smith","Well, I don't think our ability to delivery will come under pressure, but you'll have a very similar to what you\u2019ve seen on the 787. You\u2019ll have some additional flow time associated with those early introductory units and that will get feathered into the current 777 as we deliver those. So, yeah, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s well planned out phasing in strategy that was really leveraged off the success of the 787 and that\u2019s the plan going forward.","Jason Gursky","Okay. Thank you.","Greg Smith","Welcome.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Hi. Yes. Good morning, Jim and Greg.","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Peter Arment","Hey. Jim, I appraise you on the work here, let me give you one. Jim, this book-to-bill ever go down again, it\u2019s another strong year? How are you thinking about \u201915 and your comment on the 777 bridge, you\u2019re getting increasingly comfortable there?","Jim McNerney","Yeah.","Peter Arment","The 63 new, is it was characterize that as just replacement of the -200 or could you give a little more color there? Thanks.","Jim McNerney","No. I mean, I think the -- I mean, two examples with the ANA and Cutter where there was a blended order of both, the new airplane, the X, as well as one of the current models. I think in both cases the 300ERs and I\u2019d maybe for getting exactly the model type in one of those cases. But I think it is a sign that the capability is an enduring capability and the competition is -- I hate to say it this way but there is not much competition to this capability.","So versus any alternative, both the old and the new make sense and it\u2019s more a matter of satisfying demand and running a competitive airline that drives them to buy both types. And so we\u2019re in a fortunate position here. And it's one that we will shamelessly take advantage of.","Peter Arment","And on book-to-bill for \u201815.","Jim McNerney","Book-to-bill, its early in the year, I think, it will at least be one to one would be is the way it looks now and we\u2019ll see as the year goes forward.","Peter Arment","Okay. Thank you.","Jim McNerney","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Ron Epstein","You\u2019ve obviously done a fantastic job getting airplanes out the door. Just wanted a follow-up on profitability however, one would think unless I\u2019m thinking about it wrong that given the volume of airplanes that the company has delivered that profitability in the quarter would've been better at Boeing Commercial, Defense seemed to do wonderful. And then as we go into next year, without the volume of airplanes going out the door and given the overhead absorption that again, margins would be higher than what you guys are projecting them to be?","Greg Smith","Yeah. I mean, in the quarter Ron, 37 and 777 unchanged from quarter-over-quarter, so no change in margins there. And as I mentioned, we did have a block extension on the 37. This is really associated with period costs. As you know, we\u2019re seasonably high in fourth quarter around taxes and fleet support and just the amount of deliveries we have. And then some investments we've made across the business whether it takes several reliability or in some of the fleet management efforts. So I\u2019d say, high in the quarter but not something that it would take forward from here.","Ron Epstein","Okay. Okay. And then one follow-on, if I may, in the defense business, we haven\u2019t talked heck a lot about that. Whether any contract close out one time types of things in the quarter that boosted margins there?","Greg Smith","Nothing significant.","Jim McNerney","No.","Ron Epstein","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jim McNerney","Yeah. Okay.","Troy Lahr","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Spingarn","Good morning.","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","Rob Spingarn","Greg, just on the improvement cost on 87, I think you said that you took cost down about 30% over the last 170 odd airplanes something like that?","Greg Smith","Yeah. 175.","Rob Spingarn","Right. So now I'm guessing with the unit deferred as it stands a little over $30 million. And I know there is some puts and takes and some things in that number that probably on aircraft specific. But I\u2019m guessing airplanes are costing these days somewhere around $130 million. To get down to a breakeven level, I would imagine you need about another 20% cost reduction from here, give or take back to the envelope, can that be done inside of a year with the volume of airplanes we\u2019re talking about?","Greg Smith","Well, we continue to have plans to reduce the unit cost on the program run whether it's through our only internal efforts or working with the supply chain. So those initiatives are all laid out and now we got to go execute those and we have plans in place to do them. Again, this is stuff we know how to do. We've done it on other programs and we\u2019re putting obviously, additional focus on that and this again remains a priority for us.","So at the same time, we\u2019re continuing to invest in productivity as I talked about. As we get more mature with the production system, we see more opportunities to do things better and more efficiently but they taken in investment. So short-term investment -- short-term challenge but long-term significant gains for the program. And that\u2019s really where we got everybody focused.","Rob Spingarn","Okay. And then just a clarification from earlier, your guidance embeds the buyback that you\u2019ve talked about?","Greg Smith","Yes. It embeds some point of buyback. Yeah.","Rob Spingarn","Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.","Greg Smith","You welcome.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Tom Downey","Thank you. We will continue with the questions for Jim and Greg. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question and in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question please.","Operator","And first go to Jon Ostrower with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Jon Ostrower","Good morning, guys.","Jim McNerney","Good morning, Jon.","Greg Smith","Good morning, Jon.","Jon Ostrower","Just a bit of clarity on the math that you guys presented on the 77 deferred production. Obviously, you\u2019re passing $26 billion on deferred cost with 1,100 airplanes to go in your accounting block. So you're booking a positive margin on 787. Just really flat out mean to zero those deferred costs, just really simple back on the envelope, you need to be generating $25 million in profit per plane starting today.","And obviously, there\u2019s a curve in there and you guys haven't hit the unit breakeven yet, so the $25 million figures, even higher than that. So I mean, at what point of the assumption that you\u2019re putting to your accounting efforts that are generating your record earnings. Ultimately, do they reflect the reality of the 787 programs cost reductions ultimately keeping the program stable?","Greg Smith","Well, Jon. I guess, I\u2019d start with, as I said the fundamental milestone around the 787 being the cash positive than the deferred planning after we reach 12 a month, 2016 haven\u2019t changed. And the focus on the program hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s all around, again, being more efficient on each unit in capturing additional unit cost.","There are initiatives within the supply chain. Obviously, there is initiative within our factory and we\u2019re working to capture those, and continue the journey on the successful productivity we have in the program today. That\u2019s what everybody is focused on, ultimately leading to again cash positive in 2015.","Operator","Our next questions from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson","Oh, hi all.","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","Julie Johnsson","Congrats on a great quarter.","Jim McNerney","Thank you.","Julie Johnsson","Just wanted to follow up on something that we saw late in 2014, Zodiac had some issues with C deliveries and certification and I know it affected some 787 deliveries. And they had cautioned that it's taking longer than they had anticipated to straighten some of those issues out. Just wondering, if you see any trickle over into Q1 and if this is potential, a warning sign or red flag as you prepare to ramp up 737 and 787 production.","Jim McNerney","I think there is no question that seat supply did impact some deliveries and some fall in our production system. We are working through it now. We see it being resolved this year. We regret any impact it has had on our customers but it\u2019s all been within our plans and within our guidance as we work through it. I think the supply base is adjusting to these higher volumes, both 787 and anticipated higher volumes and another programs and I think they'll be ready.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Doug Cameron with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Jim McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Doug Cameron","The quarterly defense question, Jim, you got some -- you got funding for some old Growlers in the 2015 budget. What are your thoughts of the timing for the future of this impious line and does it depend at all on what happens with the Long Range Strike contest, which is upcoming?","Jim McNerney","Yeah. I mean, I think the statuses where true costs to the end of the decade on F-15s which is a big pieces of St. Louis. We\u2019ve regained momentum on F-18s. I think in the minds of many, there remains a need beyond that order. So there is a good chance that that line could continue at least to the end of the decade. Although, we do not yet have firm orders that's an assessment. And there is no question that when we win Long-Range Strike and I'm sounding as confident as I can, because I do believe we will, that it will solidify the future of St. Louis for many, many years to come.","Operator","Our next question from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates","Hello, gentleman. Question for Greg. You mentioned delivering some early 787s this year, early build 787s. There is something like 11 airplanes. Mostly the Terrible Teens as they are called that have been sitting there for four years and more. And about a year ago, a couple of customers seemed that those were earmarked for a pulled out Transaero was one of them.","So two questions about -- two parts to a question about that. First of all, is there any chance those have to be written off or sold so cheaply that it's almost the same thing and we get some accounting charges for those plans? And then secondly, it looks like you want to deliver maybe three this year, maybe three next year, very slow output. Is that a deliberate strategy because of the hefty unit costs, every time one of them enters the delivery stream?","Jim McNerney","Not at all. The timing of the deliveries is really solely tied to when we finish the work on the aircraft. And frankly it's a matter of prioritizing the teams that have taken them off the production line and moving them over on the early build. So that is the only thing tied into that. It\u2019s really just about finishing up the aircraft for the customers.","With regards the aircraft themselves, we continued to see a viable market and we are in active discussions with many customers related to those airplanes. So that is fundamentally how we're handling the EMC airplanes and you are right. I mean, we are work through them in a prudent fashion and we do expect to deliver three or four this year.","Operator, we have time for one last question from the media.","Operator","And that will be from Christopher Drew with the New York Times. Please go ahead.","Christopher Drew","All right. Good morning. Jim, you mentioned space and I was just wondering if you could talk us a minute about what it's like to compete with SpaceX with their lower cost and aggressive lobbying and political clout in Washington? In various ways that you, Boeing and the United Launch Alliance compete with them and what you see happening in the long run in some of these areas?","Jim McNerney","I have respect for SpaceX. I think they offer more limited mission types than we do at this stage. But their combination of focus on gaining capability at improved cost is going to benefit the market. It will make us a better competitor in some segments where cost has become more important. I suspect that we will retain the lead in those segments where often manned type missions that go a long way into many places we\u2019ve never been before. I see the advantage, we have there will sustain itself for a long period of time.","Operator","That concludes our earnings call.

Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions, are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Co. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead.","Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's third quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance & Strategy.","After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation.","In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our third quarter operating performance, followed by an update of the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook.","Now let's move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our teams across the company, Boeing delivered third quarter 2018 financial results that include higher revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow, driven by solid execution across the company.","During the quarter we generated $4.6 billion of operating cash and repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock. We also paid $1 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year. We continued to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders while investing in our people, innovation, and future growth.","Revenue in the third quarter was $25.1 billion, reflecting higher services and defense contract volume. Core earnings per share of $3.58 was driven by strong Commercial Airplane performance and a lower tax rate, primarily related to federal income tax audit settlements, partially offset by charges related to planned investments in the newly-awarded T-X Trainer and MQ-25 unmanned aircraft and cost growth on the KC-46 Tanker.","For the full year, we are raising guidance for revenue and earnings per share and reaffirming operating cash flow. We're also raising BCA segment operating margin while reducing BDS margin guidance. Greg will discuss these in more detail in his section.","With that, let's take a look at Commercial Airplanes. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $15.3 billion, reflecting 190 deliveries, with operating margins of 13.2%. Continued healthy sales activities contributed to 171 net new airplane orders worth $13 billion during the quarter, adding to our robust backlog that stands at more than 5,800 airplanes and is worth $413 billion.","Year-to-date we have captured more than 630 net new orders. The 737 program continues to make good progress on its recovery plans to overcome supply chain challenges with 61 aircraft delivered in September, an improvement from July and August. In the third quarter we delivered 138 737s. We expect to recover the 737 line by the end of the year with fourth quarter deliveries expected to be above the production rate. The MAX production ramp-up continues. To-date we have delivered 219 MAXs, 57 of them in the quarter. We continue to expect MAX to account for between 40% and 45% of total 737 deliveries in 2018.","The 787 program further matured its rate readiness for 14-per-month next year. The program's ongoing quality and productivity strides helped to position us for a successful ramp-up. We continued to see improvements in first-pass quality and champion times being set across-the-board.","As for the 777X program, in the quarter we completed the static test airplane and moved it into test set up. We have also started building flight test airplanes on the low-rate initial production line in the main factory. We plan to start flight testing in 2019 and remain on track for the first 777X delivery in 2020.","Now, over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported third quarter revenue of $5.7 billion reflecting higher volume across its business, including government satellites, Tanker, F-18, and weapons. Operating margins were negative 4.3% primarily due to charges related to planned investments in the T-X and the MQ-25 programs which I will touch on shortly.","BDS booked $12 billion of new orders during the quarter, demonstrating the value we bring to our customers across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio. Those orders include wins on important future franchise opportunities. The T-X Trainer, the MQ-25 unmanned aircraft and the MH-139 helicopter. We also received the fourth KC-46 Tanker production lot for 18 additional Tankers in the quarter.","T-X is the Next Generation trainer providing the U.S. Air Force with advanced training capabilities to replace the T-38C Talon. We anticipate the T-X to be a franchise program for much of this century. Beyond the current U.S. Air Force contract, with potential global market opportunities for both trainer and light attack platforms of up to 2,600 aircraft plus ground-based trainers and advanced simulation technologies, representing a $40 billion multi-decade platform and services opportunity.","The MQ-25 is the U.S. Navy's first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft. Unmanned aircraft systems are proving critical in every aspect of air combat with MQ-25 autonomy and artificial intelligence technologies, applicable to a market opportunity of greater than $20 billion, for more than 200 production and derivative aircraft. The MQ-25 and T-X wins are the culmination of years of unwavering focus improving our technology and de-risking the programs. We have developed and flight tested two all-new production-ready T-X jets with 71 flight tests having been completed to-date. We've demonstrated deck handling and engine trials on MQ-25 and we currently have an MQ-25 prototype aircraft in ground testing that is being prepared for first flight.","Our planned investments in these two programs will further mature technologies to address the sizable market potential as well as meet current customer commitments. Boeing will recognize the investments through an after-tax charge of $541 million in the quarter. This strategy reflects a commercial investment mindset, a deliberate and purposeful decision to position ourselves to capture significant future market opportunity in services, support, training and platforms in the autonomous systems, trainer and light attack markets.","To give you a sense of the multi-decade return on investment, the initial T-X contract represents less than 20% of the full production run opportunity and less than 10% of the total lifecycle services, support and upgrades opportunities. These investments are in-line with our balanced cash deployment strategy and leverage the strength of Boeing's business portfolio and financial performance to create sustained, leading-edge capability for our customers in the U.S. and globally, and the foundation of growth and valuable long-term franchises for all of our stakeholders.","Key operational milestones for BDS in the quarter included achieving first flights for Apache and Chinook for the Indian Air Force, and on the commercial satellite side, we successfully completed the acquisition of Millennium Space Systems, a provider of agile, flight proven small-satellite solutions complementing our existing satellite portfolio.","We continue to make steady progress towards final certification of the KC-46 Tanker and in September, we received the supplemental type certificate verifying that the refueling and mission avionics systems meet all FAA requirements. The milestone marked completion of KC-46 FAA certification. We are working with our U.S. Air Force customer towards completing all the steps required to deliver the first Tanker aircraft this quarter.","In the third quarter the program booked cost growth of $140 million after-tax due to higher-than-expected effort to meet customer requirements to support delivery of the initial aircraft as well as incremental delays in certification and testing. And while there's still work ahead of us, we are moving closer to delivering these highly-mission capable aircraft to our customer. Currently four aircraft have completed the FAA ticketing process and have moved to the Boeing Military Delivery Center. We remain very confident in the long-term value of this franchise, a program that is going to have a production run measured in hundreds of airplanes and decades of follow-on support and training.","Now, turning to Global Services. BGS reported third quarter revenue of $4.1 billion, representing a 12% growth year-to-date. Operating margins of 13.3% reflected higher parts and supply chain solutions volume, product and services mix, and higher period costs driven by investments to grow our portfolio offerings.","During the quarter, BGS won new business totaling approximately $4 billion. This included an order from GECAS for 20 737-800 Converted Freighters, an F-18 spares contract for the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, service contract for KC-46 Tanker for lots 3 and 4, P-8A training contracts for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force and a service support contract for the newly-awarded MH-139 helicopter for the U.S. Air Force. These orders highlight the strength of our One Boeing offerings.","Additionally, BGS completed the first heavy maintenance check on P-8 for the U.S. Navy. Earlier this month we completed the acquisition of KLX, a major global provider of aviation parts and services, part of our growth strategy of complementing organic investments with targeted strategic acquisitions. This transaction brings together the talent and product offerings of Boeing and KLX to provide a one-stop shop that will allow us to create significant value for our customers. The resulting boost in supply chain capability enables us to better serve our customers while profitably and purposefully growing our business. Our integration activities are well underway and progressing smoothly.","Separately, we are finalizing the definitive agreements for our proposed partnership with Embraer. In the coming months we'll continue to work with Embraer and its shareholders, the Brazilian government and regulators, among others, to complete the transaction and create the most important strategic partnership in the aerospace industry.","In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong operating performance, captured noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog, including key future defense franchises, returned significant cash to our shareholders, and complemented our organic growth with planned strategic inorganic investments.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continued to see healthy global demand in our commercial, defense, space and services markets, markets that are growing and sizable at $8.1 trillion over the next 10 years.","In the commercial airplane market, airline profitability remains strong and passenger traffic continues to outpace global GDP. Passenger traffic in 2018 grew 6.8% through August. Meanwhile, cargo traffic maintained its upward momentum, growing by 4% in 2018 through August. Our global customers continue to recognize the compelling value proposition that our new, more fuel-efficient product family brings to the market as reflected in the healthy new order intake we've seen year-to-date.","We continue to see the trend of diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective, as well as across the spectrum of airline business models. The changing nature of travel with the expansion of network city pairs and rising middle-class population in emerging markets has fundamentally expanded traffic patterns and underpinned sustained growth. There also is more balanced demand between fleet growth and replacement of older aircraft and we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in key market dynamics in the aggregate continues to drive greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry.","Over the long-term, we remain highly confident in our commercial market outlook which forecasts demand for nearly 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. These deliveries, of which 44% will be driven by replacement demand, will double the size of the global fleet. This long-term demand, combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates.","Turning to our product segments, starting with the narrow-body. Our current production rate of 52 per month and planned increase to 57 in 2019 is based on our backlog of nearly 4,700 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. We continue to assess the upward market pressure on the 737 production rate.","In the wide-body segment, we've seen steady orders for the 787 and the 777 and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide-body replacement demand early next decade. For the current generation 777, the renewed strength in the air cargo sector has provided support for the 777 bridge as highlighted by recent orders, bringing the backlog to 87 aircraft. As we transition production to the 777X, we expect 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month through 2019 as previously announced. While we still have some work to do in filling the remaining 777 production slots, in particular for 2020 and beyond, we feel confident about the 777 bridge progress. As we look forward to the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 340 orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We are focused on further bolstering the 777X skyline.","We also captured 21 orders for the 787 Dreamliner family in the quarter, bringing the total year-to-date orders to more than 100. With nearly 1,400 firm order since its launch and more than 600 in the backlog, our plan to increase Dreamliner production to 14 airplanes a month in 2019 is well supported. We continue to see repeat orders for the 787 Dreamliner, including the recent order from United for 9 additional 787-9s highlighting the strong market preference for the 787 and its superior value.","Turning to our 747 and 767 programs, with our unmatched freighter product lines, we are well positioned to capture the increased cargo demand. This supports our 767 production rate increase from 2.5 per month to 3 per month in 2020. We remain focused on the strong, long-term aerospace industry fundamentals. It's important to have this in perspective as we navigate through global trade discussions.","Boeing maintains strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world. We continue to engage with leaders in these countries to urge a productive dialogue to resolve trade differences, highlighting the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demands for our major platforms and programs. The BDS portfolio is well positioned with mature world class platforms to address current needs and new franchise programs to build the future.","Boeing continues to see strong support for our key products from the Pentagon and in Congress. The fiscal year 2019 Defense Policy Bill authorized a fourth multi-year procurement for the F-18 and supported increases in munitions production in the Pentagon's aviation readiness efforts. The final appropriations bill for fiscal year 2019 U.S. Defense budget added funding for additional rotorcraft, funded the requested quantities of our key programs across our fixed-wing and commercial derivative aircraft portfolios, and funded our missile, space and satellite products.","Demand from outside of the U.S. for our defense and space offerings also remains high, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers. We will continue to leverage capabilities and technologies from across our enterprise to win important opportunities such as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent.","Turning to the services sector. We see the $2.8 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. BGS provides agile, cost competitive services to our customers worldwide. We aim to grow faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share.","Strong orders of $4 billion in the quarter reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational costs through the lifecycle. These activities stretch across BGS's four capability areas, including supply chain, engineering modifications and maintenance, digital aviation and analytics, and training and professional services.","Our focus for BGS remains on optimizing the businesses and expanding our portfolio offerings through organic growth investments such as strengthening our vertical capabilities, complemented by strategic acquisitions position BGS for sustained long-term and profitable growth. Our expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well positioned to compete and win in this important sector.","On the digital analytics front, we will begin integrating a new data analytics tool into all Boeing Defense Australia support contracts, enhancing its position as a leading fleet services provider in the region. The Boeing AnalytX systems, featuring new technologies developed by Boeing in Australia, will give the Australian defense force access to more platform data than ever before, enabling Boeing to increase fleet readiness, safety and reliability while reducing maintenance costs.","In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvement to fuel our investments in the future.","With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Thanks, Dennis and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 4 and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Revenue for the quarter increased to $25.1 billion reflecting solid BCA deliveries, and higher volume at Defense, Space & Security as well as Global Services.","Core earnings per share of $3.58 reflect strong Commercial Airplane performance, higher Global Services earnings, and a $412 million tax benefit related to the settlement of federal income tax audits for the years 2013 and 2014. These were partially offset by after-tax charges of $541 million related to the planned investment on T-X and MQ-25 programs and $140 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker.","Now, let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue of $15.3 billion during the quarter reflected lower deliveries, largely offset by favorable mix. BCA operating margins increased to 13.2% driven by strong operating performance on production programs, higher 787 margins, and timing of period cost. This was partially offset by a $112 million pre-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. BCA captured $13 billion of net orders during the quarter and backlog remains strong at $413 billion and more than 5,800 aircraft equating to approximately seven years of production.","On the 787 program, we delivered 34 aircraft and booked 21 net orders in the quarter, and the overall cash profile of this program continues to improve through favorable mix, supplier step-down pricing, and our team's day-to-day focus on improving 787 unit costs and overall cash generation.","Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. Third quarter revenue increased to $5.7 billion, driven by higher volume across the BDS business, including government satellites, Tanker, F\/A-18 and weapons. BDS margins of negative 4.3% reflected the $691 million pre-tax charge on the planned investments related to T-X and MQ-25 programs and cost growth on KC-46 Tanker program of $64 million pre-tax.","As Dennis mentioned, our T-X and MQ-25 investments are based on deliberate and intentional decisions to create long-term valuable products and services franchises. In selective key market opportunities such as these, we are taking into account the considerable market potential in our business cases and not just the initial order quantity with the current contracts.","For accounting purposes, we have to assess the anticipated costs and expected revenue over the life of the initial contract without taking into account the potential additional future market opportunities. Our planned long-term investments translate into earnings charges against these programs in the quarter. The charges do not impact cash flow in the quarter and our cash flow guidance for the year.","These investments leverage the strength of Boeing's business portfolio and financial performance and provide a foundation of growth and valuable long-term franchises for all of our stakeholders. These investments are consistent with our strategy of capital deployment priorities of investing in organic growth.","And finally, along with the T-X and MQ-25, BDS won a number of additional key contract awards bringing its total orders in the quarter to $12 billion. BDS backlog increased to $58 billion with now 31% from outside the United States.","Turning now to Boeing Global Services results on slide 7. In the third quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.1 billion reflecting higher volume predominantly driven by increased sales of parts and supply chain solutions. Year-over-year growth of 14% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date more than meet our objective to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%.","BGS operating margins were solid at 13.3% reflecting ongoing productivity efforts as well as mix of products and services in the quarter, offset by higher period costs for investments focused on expanding our portfolio of offerings going forward.","During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $4 billion bringing our backlog to $20 billion. The key wins this year underscore the strength of our One Boeing offerings to our customers.","Let's now turn to cash flow on slide 8. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at $4.6 billion primarily driven by timing of receipt and expenditures, planned higher commercial production rates, and strong core operating performance across the business. We remain focused and on track with our balanced cash deployment strategy. In the third quarter we repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock and paid $1 billion in dividends reflecting a 20% increase in dividend per share from last year, and we continued to anticipate completing the remaining $9.6 billion of repurchase authorization over the next 12 months to 18 months.","Since the end of 2012 we've repurchased approximately 230 million shares and increased our dividend more than 250%. At the same time, we've invested more than $30 billion in key strategic areas to support long-term sustainable growth for Boeing, our customers, and our shareholders, and we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities.","Let's now move to cash and debt balances on slide 9. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, stable debt levels, and credit ratings. Our cash position continues to provide us with flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities while again returning value to shareholders.","Let's now turn to slide 10 to discuss our outlook for 2018. For full year, we're raising our revenue guidance by $1 billion to now be between $98 billion and $100 billion. This increase in revenue primarily reflects the higher BDS and BGS volume inclusive of the KLX acquisition. As a result, we're increasing revenue guidance to now be between $16 billion and $16.5 billion for BGS and between $22 billion and $23 billion for BDS.","We're also updating our full year BCA and BDS segment operating margin guidance to reflect BCA's strong performance and investments in T-X and MQ-25 this quarter. BCA margin guidance is increased to now be between 12% and 12.5% from our prior guidance of greater than 11.5%, again reflecting strong performance and timing of some period expenses.","BDS margin guidance is reduced to be greater than 6.5% from our prior guidance of between 10% and 10.5%, again primarily reflecting the investments in the T-X and MQ-25 programs.","We are increasing our full year core earnings per share guidance by $0.60 to be between $14.90 and $15.10 on net improvements after accounting for lower than expected tax rate, performance and charges.","We're reducing our full year guidance for capital expenditures to now be approximately $2 billion, a $200 million decrease from our prior guidance of $2.2 billion, again reflecting timing of spending as well as performance.","As we look towards the remainder of the year our key focus areas include, continuing to manage the 737 recovery progress within our factories and throughout our supply chain, starting the delivery of KC-46 Tanker and continued healthy order momentum as well as continued strong execution across the portfolio.","So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. We will continue to use our three business unit strategy as a key differentiator to win in the marketplace, make prudent strategic investments, and leverage the talent and innovation across the company. At the same time, we will set challenging goals and objectives around elements of operations and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency to generate cash and improve working capital while delivering value to our customers.","All these will help us achieve our goal to grow year-over-year revenue, cash flow, and margins, so with that, I'll turn it back to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","All right. Thank you, Greg. With a strong three quarters behind us our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. These results were achieved through the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnership we have with our customers and our suppliers.","In addition to the strong Commercial Airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we have taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business. This includes remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts, and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical. We have executed on our long-term strategy of robust and continuing organic growth investment and returning value to our shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. The planned strategic partnerships with Embraer, Safran, and the recent KLX acquisition and Adient joint venture are entirely consistent with this strategy.","Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts.","Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, continuing to strengthen our Defense, Space & Security business, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, disciplined leading-edge investments, and balanced value-creating cash deployment and continuing to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry.","All of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And first to the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, good morning, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","This will probably \u2013 this will exceed the one part. I'd like to just discuss the approach you're taking on defense. You'll be working on fixed price development contracts for MQ-25 and T-X and there's no question those will be big programs but the history of fixed price development as you know has not been good, and Boeing has been part of that history. And you took this approach on the Tanker, it's been continually more difficult than expectations. So can you describe how long it will be before you expect these new programs to generate returns and what the cash profile should be over time? And then, how do we get comfortable that you're accurately measuring the risk on these? And I'm just curious, do you see these kinds of competitions as the future here? I mean these are aggressive bids and bring back a history to all of us.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Doug, let me take a shot at your macro question, and then Greg, I'll ask you to add in on the cash flow profile as well. Now first of all, Doug, this is a targeted and very deliberate strategy focused on some key defense franchises that we believe have lifecycles that are measured in decades and between T-X and MQ-25, those two programs combined have roughly a $60 billion opportunity space connected with them, so one, big targeted franchises.","We have taken a look at these in a very careful, diligent way, and have invested up front with a business case that is very strong and the return to our shareholders as a result is going to be very strong. So think of applying a commercial mindset to franchises that are measured in decades.","These capabilities are also going to bring immediate leading edge benefit to our customers and our men and women in uniform. So there's customer benefit and shareholder benefit. So, first point is that key strategic focus.","And to give you a sense of it on T-X, the initial contract here represents less than 20% of the total production run and less than 10% of the total services volume available in that contract space, so we have a tremendous investment capability here.","Secondly, to your point on risk. We have purposely, with these investments, significantly de-risked these programs, and they are fundamentally different than Tanker. On T-X, for example, we have two production-ready jets flying today. We've done 71 test flights already. We are highly confident in this program. These are small development programs leading to rapid production. So as you recall when we started Tanker, we still had a Tanker design on the drawing board. In contrast, today we have two flying production units for T-X.","Same thing on MQ-25. We made purposeful investments over the last few years to build a prototype aircraft that'll be going into flight test in the coming year. So again, the idea here is to accelerate capability for our customers and move swiftly to production. As a result, the risk profile of these programs are dramatically different than Tanker. So a solid business case, a significantly de-risked program, all looked at through the lens of making a good business case investment that is going to be good for our customers and our shareholders, and frankly, with the strong cash performance of our company, our strong financial performance overall, we have the fuel to do this. This is an excellent use of cash in organic investment.","So I'll just provide those overarching comments, so Greg, if you want to add-on in terms of cash profiles and expectations.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, I guess, I'd start kind of at the highest level, that our view of growing cash flow going forward doesn't change as a result of these wins. We've taken all that into consideration. If you kind of look at from a timeframe perspective on each of the programs, the MQ-25 through that EMD phase ends in about 2024 and then on T-X, the options start to begin in 2022. So it kind of gives you a sense of the \u2013 I'll say the breadth and timeframe along that development phase and then entering into production. So again, I think at the highest level, the cash flow profile that we are expecting for us to generate isn't going to change at all as a result of these. And I think as Dennis said, we made investments that are behind us as well that really try to de-risk both of these programs moving through the EMD phase and then ultimately moving into production.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay.","Operator","Next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good morning.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It seemed like the quarter went actually pretty well in terms of getting the 737 supply chain back on track. I was wondering if you could just kind of talk about that a little bit more and then, when you think about what happened with the supply chain in this quarter, how do you think about like the next rate up and then potentially getting working towards 70 and how the supply chain can handle that?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah. Hey, Ron, great question and we have been and continue to be very focused on 737 production program execution and recovery. We are seeing our supply chain return to a healthy condition but we're continuing to monitor that on a daily basis. As you've seen, we've had to work through some risk issues in particular on fuselages and engines with Spirit and CFM and we now have fuselages being delivered to our purchase order plans and we're also seeing engine recovery and while we still have some work to do there, we're anticipating engine recovery towards the end of the year.","You can see that reflected in deliveries, as well. The strong September deliveries give us building confidence on the recovery and as you've noticed, we have not changed our year-end guidance for deliveries, so we remain confident that we'll hit our total delivery target for the year. As a result, in the fourth quarter, as a composite, you should expect to see deliveries exceeding the 52 a month production rate. Again, those deliveries will be more back-loaded in the quarter as always but we're seeing good signs on our recovery across the board. And we're going to continue to stay very, very focused on executing that.","Now, as we look to next year, as you know, we're planning to step-up to 57 a month. We are taking some lessons learned from the recent 52 a month step and applying those. That includes ramping up staffing earlier. So some of the additional staffing we brought onboard for 52 a month is staying in place to help us with the 57 a month step. Supply chain health and in-depth monitoring of that has also been turned up and I think what you'll also see is that the nature of the next step is a little different.","This year was especially challenging as we stepped to 52 a month and we also had major model mix changes. Roughly half of the airplanes this year are NGs and half are MAXs. As we get to next year and towards the 57 a month rate break, we'll be almost entirely MAXs by that point. So the model mix challenge will not be as difficult as we step to 57 a month next year. So we're also factoring that into our planning. But I'll say bottom line here is we're staying very, very focused on this. It's very important that we continue to hit deliveries for our customers, and in general, we're seeing positive signs in our supply chain recovery and remain confident on the overall 737 production profile and ramp-up plans.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to follow up with another 737 question, this time on the demand side. You've talked about the upward pressure on demand and the potential to move higher than 57 a month. Is it possible to make a decision on that while there are still a lot of outstanding trade questions with regard to China or does that stuff have to kind of get settled before you can move forward with thinking about that investment?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Seth, when we take a look at the trade environment, we maintain a long-term view on that. Certainly, something that's very important to us, we're very engaged in the dialogue and conversations with the U.S. government and with other governments around the world. In particular on the U.S. China relationship, we're very engaged with our Chinese airline customers and leadership in China, along with the U.S. government and both countries are interested a healthy aerospace industry.","In China, from a macro standpoint one of the fastest growing commercial aviation markets in the world. Over the next 20 years we said a world that needs 43,000 new airplanes; about 7,700 of those are in China. Traffic growth patterns are very strong in China and the rising middle-class population is a tremendous driver there, well beyond normal, I'll say GDP metrics, so about 150 million new passengers every year in Asia are fueling that growth. So China is very interested in a healthy growing aerospace industry.","Same thing in the U.S.; when you take a look at trade and trade surplus, the greatest trade surplus generator in the U.S. is aerospace, and within that sector, Boeing and our supply chain are by far the biggest component and that all leads to American manufacturing jobs. So there's strong reasons in both U.S. and China to have a healthy, prosperous aerospace industry. You combine that with backlogs and as we said earlier, with more than 5,700 aircraft, 5,800 aircraft in backlog today, and in particular, for narrow-bodies, 737s, strong backlog, we're filling skyline in the 2023 timeframe, right? So this is a long-term view.","So while we pay attention to trade, and we're very engaged in it, it's very important to us, it's not something that changes our near-term modeling and analysis. Our decisions around stepping up to 57 a month are strongly supported by the backlog that we have in position and the commitments we have with customers and really our decision drivers around stepping to 57 a month will be health of the production system, the supply chain, our ability to execute that in a way that's smooth for our customers and profitable for our company. And so it's very much focused on that internal operational productivity and a healthy production line. And we're going to step to 57 a month when we're ready to step, and we remain confident that that step we'll take next year and we're going to continue to do our diligent work to make sure that's done in a smooth manner.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, good morning, Dennis, Greg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","A question on BDS, just looking at the growth profile and going forward you've had a tremendous amount of wins with T-X, MQ-25, you've got the Tanker with the KC-46, obviously the helicopter franchises, P-8. How do we think about the growth just in the budget backdrop when we think over the next couple years? Thanks.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Peter I think there are a couple of factors there. One, as you said, the macro environment, the budget is healthy and strong. We've seen good, positive signs on strengthening U.S. defense budget, not without risk, as we look to future defense budgets and Budget Control Act profiles and it's a year-to-year battle as you know. But we've seen more and more signs of sustained, long-term stable defense budget in the U.S. International defense budgets continue to strengthen as well. As Greg said earlier, about a third of our backlog is in international defense, so the macro budget environment for defense is strong right now.","Within that, funding for our programs has been very good and as you noted with our recent T-X and MQ-25 wins, our MH-139 win, all of those will fuel growth. As we step the Tanker program into production, that will fuel growth as well. And if you look at that in a composite, we still see our defense business as a modest growth business. It's healthy and the recent wins are going to make it even more healthy.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","I just want to go back to the BDS charges and the investments as you've characterized them, just two elements. As you think about bidding this way, what do you target? Are you thinking about risk-adjusted ROIs? How do you square that with your current incentives on near-term earnings per share?","And then secondly, was there something different about your offerings in each case? I mean, a competitor \u2013 you took a $700 million charge, you had a competitor say they would have lost $5 billion on it. Do you think there are differences in cost or product capabilities versus the KPPs or assessments of the overall risk? If you could help me with those two things I'd appreciate it.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Carter, I'll take the first cut and then, Greg, feel free to add in here. First of all, again, our mindset around this is to focus on those key defense franchises that create long-term value, sustained decades of opportunity, so these are a few very select very targeted areas, and as we've mentioned over several years now, T-X and MQ-25 are in that category. We've made purposeful investments to de-risk the programs to build flying hardware, to provide capability for our customers and our men and women in uniform to accelerate capabilities for them and to invest in a smart way that creates value for our customers in the long-term.","To your point on incentive targets for our team, our incentive targets are a balanced set of targets, both annual and long-term, and what you see here is an exact reflection of that philosophy. It's making the right short-term investments to produce long-term value, and the fact that we were able to make these investments and in a single quarter in essence, pay for those investments, because of the great performance of the company, shows our ability to fuel smart investments through the future. That is the balance and I think unique capability that this company brings to our customers.","That's really our mindset around these kind of investments and we remain very confident that the investments we make here have great business cases, will create great value for our shareholders as well as value for our servicemen and women. So that's an important parameter for us.","Now, in terms of your comment about the competitive environment, I can't really comment on our competitors' bid positions but what I can comment on is the fact that we're able to bring very affordable solutions to our customers because of the investments we've been making in productivity. I think as you're well aware as we've had \u2013 as we've shown many of our investor partners, the fact that we're investing in things like our second-century design and manufacturing capabilities, advanced digital designs, all of these Next Generation design production and support capabilities are being reflected in these new products that we're bringing to our defense customers. So they are affordable, they are extremely capable, they provide great capability for our customers, and they create value for our shareholders. Greg? Anything you want to add on that?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, I guess just your question specifically on the business case. NPV, return on invested capital, I'd say very traditional way to look at a business case, but as Dennis said, not just looking at the contract quantity, but looking at the broader market opportunities and what it would take to win, and obviously, stressing that, and looking at that through various lenses to ensure that we have what we would \u2013 what we expect from a net present value perspective and a return on invested capital. So I'd say kind of multi-dimensional about how we're looking at it and then how we look at the risks associated with it but look, as far as the two platforms go, it's obvious that we have been spending a lot of time and energy and expertise from across the company to have something such as T-X that's flying that made its first flight in 2016 and as Dennis said, 71 flights under its belt, and then MQ-25 at the same time, things like doing an engine run in 2017. So we've really tried to work hard to leverage the enterprise, the model-based engineering that Dennis talked about and the productivity and try to de-risk these the best we can and bring purpose-built and purpose-designed platforms to the war fighter that I think are clearly game-changing and are going to add value to our customer and to our war fighter and to our shareholders.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Further to Greg's point, you see our unique ability across our commercial and defense businesses to share and replicate and build these technologies, so these advanced design and manufacturing capabilities that we're maturing on programs like the 777X, are able to apply to new defense programs, those lessons learned applied back to our commercial business so there's tremendous synergy there that I think is unique to our company.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Thanks for the color, guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Next question we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","At the risk of staying on the topic, I want to just ask for clarification. So Dennis, you said you've already made these investments in the quarter and you have the two prototype T-X aircraft but I took from Greg's comments that most of these investments are planned and I'm taking that as from a cash perspective and so I wanted to ask you if they are truly ring-fenced or is there potential for investment creep, kind of like with Tanker? And then the last part of this question is since you clearly saw these opportunities differently than your competitor, can you elaborate more specifically a bit about the commercial market or foreign military market opportunity? Who's going to take up the other 80% of the targeted production for example and 90% of the sustainment?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","I'll answer the second part of that, Rob, but Greg, why don't you take a cut at the first part and in particular how we've ring-fenced this and how the investments play out.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And you had it right, Rob, obviously from an accounting perspective we've recognized the costs associated with this effort, but from a cash flow perspective as I was talking a little earlier, you'll see a profile that'll go out over that between the two of them, the kind of 2022 to 2024 timeframe so all of that kind of modeled through that period and obviously, I'll let Dennis talk a little more on the de-risking but we've really tried to get out in front of that and that's the investments we have made to get these products to the state that they're in today.","And there's a big differentiator there obviously when you got two airplanes flying that have been flying since 2016 and have 71 test flights, it's not coming off a piece of paper to move into development and into production so it certainly minimizes the risk profile going forward. And MQ, again, we've done a lot of \u2013 between engine runs and ground taxi tests and deck handling trials, things like that, and invested in some labs and tried again to de-risk it.","So it's a different risk profile than you've seen in some of the other development programs and I try not to repeat too much of what Dennis said, but we're leveraging the best of Boeing and bring it in a selective way to these campaigns, so this is the approach we took on these, because we saw the long-term value proposition here and it strategically fit into what we had laid out as far as where we want to play today and going forward, and we selectively lean forward into these two and we think they're going to be very valuable franchises for all our stakeholders.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","And then, Rob, further to that value point so that the broader marketplace here certainly initially with the U.S. Air Force and training capabilities and take a look at today's T-38 Talon fleet that will be replaced by this airplane. So the opportunity for growth in the U.S. training fleet is substantial and as you know, our Air Force's training needs are significant and so T-X Trainer is well placed to meet that capability.","We've also purpose-built, purpose-designed the airplane so that it can also be applied to other international customers who also have training needs and as you well know, the U.S. Air Force tends to lead the globe in terms of training capabilities and so international customers and allies will very typically align to the same product lines, and we've already had a number of inquiries from other customers around the globe on the back side of the T-X award.","Further to that, we purpose-designed this airplane to also be able to be modified to be a light attack fighter aircraft, again to support global markets and if you look at the cumulative market space in the U.S. and around the globe, we see T-X as a market for about 2,600 aircraft, in addition to ground-based trainers and other support services. And if you look at all of that as a composite across T-X and MQ-25, very realistically, this is a $60 billion-sized marketplace so that gives you a sense of why this is a good investment.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. That's very helpful market size, thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, good morning.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Wanted to follow-up on the 737, looking for some additional color there. Dennis, can you give any sort of quantification on the number of unfinished jobs today versus a month or so ago, or the progress you're making there and are the airplanes rolling off the line today, do they have any unfinished jobs or are they rolling off the line clean at this point?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, we're continuing to ramp-up on our recovery plan. If I look at every element of the recovery factors, flow-through the factories, jobs that are completed in position, if I take a look at jobs that travel between stations, jobs behind schedule, airplanes on the ramp, supply chain health, we're watching things like part shortages in the factory. Across that entire set of metrics they're all trending in right direction and while we're not complete with the recovery yet, we have made substantial progress over the last couple of months and the best indicator of that frankly is airplane deliveries, and you saw the 61 aircraft delivered in September and as I said, we expect for the fourth quarter deliveries, in total will be above the 52 a month production rate that we're at, so we're continuing to work off the inventory of aircraft that have been on the ramp outside of the factory. More and more, we're seeing airplanes being completed in place in the factory and while we're not done, all of the trends are headed in the right direction, just to give you a sense of how it's going. And we're going to stay very, very focused on it and get that wrapped up, get the production line back to full health and as I said, we're committed to meeting our year-end overall delivery guidance.","Operator","Next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you very much. So you took your R&D guide down by $200 million and yet R&D was a lot lower than I think most of us expected in the third quarter and to get to even your lower number, R&D has to ramp-up sequentially by close to $300 million. First, is that a conservative estimate so that that has some more opportunity and what does that imply for the R&D run rate corporate-wide next year given you're considering the NMA?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, the run rate expectations going into next year, Cai, haven't changed, but there's certainly some timing from quarter-to-quarter just between the transition of 777X and some of the MAX spending and then just some of the other projects we have in place, so I wouldn't read too much more into that other than some timing.","As far as kind of broader, I'll say, kind of at a high-level R&D spend to revenue, still kind of that 3.8%, 3.9% is still what we see going forward, taking all of what we talked about into consideration. So think of quarter-over-quarter here just more timing between programs.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","You're welcome.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Thanks, Cai.","Operator","Next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Thanks, good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","I was wondering if we can we talk about the BCA margins and the kind of underlying margins you've seen over the last couple quarters, what you're looking for in the fourth quarter and Dennis, it looks that mid-teens margin target is going to arrive a year early in 2019. Greg, is there any pushback you're going to give me as a conservative CFO to tell me that's not going to happen?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Myles, first of all, thank you for the feedback there. You do see the progress in our margin performance and as we said, we're very intent and focused on that, and strong performance by our Commercial Airplane team in the quarter. There are a number of items behind that, but it reflects the overall drive on productivity and performance across our product lines and the investments we're making there are showing results, and we laid in a long-term plan to make this a mid-teens margin business. We are making great progress on that journey and we remain very committed to that.","As we said before, not only getting there by the end of the decade but then beyond that, continuing to grow our margins and as Greg mentioned in his comments, we see this as a long-term year-over-year cash growth and margin growth business. Greg, do you want to add some color to Myles' point there?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah,","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Talk me off the ledge here?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","I'm sorry?","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","You want to talk me down?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Well, I'm going to give you the facts. Look, there's been a lot of effort been going on program-to-program. In particular on the 787 of improving the margin profile and we talked a lot about it. The mix, supplier step-down and then just our own productivity and sharing those best practices across the company, and everybody's on one score in the company and that's one of the big enablers. So, it's first and foremost on everybody's mind of how do you leverage these best practices and bring them to the program. So you're seeing some of that.","You're seeing a lot of discipline on the spending across-the-board, that is obviously very cash focused, just like the program margins are, but you are seeing some ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter. So you're going to see a little more period expense in the fourth quarter. So we had some favorable timing in third quarter and you'll see some of that come back in the fourth quarter and obviously we're keeping a mindful eye on some of the things that Dennis talked about and I did as far as what we're watching between now and the end of the year.","In particular, 737 delivery profile, so that recovery plan is something that we're focused on daily, and in particular, around our engine recovery and so we're taking that into consideration as well. So lots of moving pieces, but net-net, the objective hasn't changed. You're seeing progress towards that objective and you're going to see that continue.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Thanks.","Operator","Next we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning and thank you for the time.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Just on services, the margins compressed a little bit. Can we talk about the implied recovery in Q4 and maybe what the some of the period costs were associated with that and how we think about the profitability profile of that business as KLX plays into it?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Sheila, first of all, overall services business, we're very focused on growing profitably, so growing both top and bottom line. You'll see that year-to-date, as we said, about 12% growth in our services top line, so our growth strategy is working. You do see some variability on bottom line performance in margin quarter-to-quarter. We did make some targeted investments in the third quarter that you see in the local margins there, but you can see we haven't changed our year-end guidance for BGS margin. So we still expect this to be a robust-growing business both top and bottom line. And Greg...?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, a lot of initiatives in place here as well. Obviously bringing the two together and really looking for efficiencies across the board. A lot of effort going on there and obviously, the go-to-market, but there's thousands and thousands of contracts, obviously in this business, so as I think I mentioned on prior calls, you're going to see some ebb and flow from quarter-over-quarter just by mix alone but the overall objective long-term, get outside of quarters here and look kind of year-over-year, is to continue to grow the margins and deliver something to our customers that's really differentiating and that's why we brought these businesses together and I think you're seeing some of that starting in our order book and in our backlog, and it's bringing the best of Boeing to the services elements just like we do on the platform. But again, that objective of being the most efficient \u2013 delivering those services in the most efficient way delivers value back to us to reinvest and to our shareholder and back to our customer, so that objective has not changed at all.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the analyst question-and-answer session. I will now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Interim Vice President of Communications. Ms. Toulouse, please go ahead.","Anne C. Toulouse - The Boeing Co.","Thank you and good morning. We will continue the call with media questions for Dennis and Greg. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our Media Relations team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we are now ready for that first question. In the interest of time we ask that you limit everyone to just one question please.","Operator","Thank you and we'll go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Julie.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Greg, you'd mentioned that Boeing now selectively is taking sort of longer-term market opportunity into account when it looks at a business case for products like T-X and MQ-25. Does that mindset and that sort of strategic outlook carry over to the NMA? And just sort of curious also if it does, how you go about ring fencing risk and costs.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, I'd actually say the MQ and T-X are really more looking at it like we typically do and you would on a commercial-type opportunity, so it's really the reverse of that. Having said that, there's a lot of things that we're doing on these programs that Dennis indicated that we're looking at about how does that make us more efficient and more productive on the NMA, and how does it de-risk the NMA business case. So this is where it really is bringing the best of Boeing together in really not reliving lessons, leveraging our investments and our lessons learned across the portfolio. So as we've had NMA teams, we've had 787 teams over on T-X. We've had T-X teams over on NMA and on 787, and we've had people like Mark Jenks, who was obviously a key element on the 787, reviewing T-X. So it's really more again, looking through that commercial, I'd say pretty \u2013 I'd say kind of standard business case over that total market opportunity and what's it take to win in that market and how do you competitively differentiate yourself and bring value back to all the stakeholders and really look for any opportunities to de-risk and leverage again, some of the lessons learned from across the company.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Tangel with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Hi there, good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Andrew.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","You all talk about the strong state of the airline business and industry overall, strong profits in passenger and cargo growth. Recently, some low-cost airlines have ceased operations and there are some predictions that some other carriers may not make it through the winter as they face higher fuel bills and labor cost. How concerning is that to Boeing, given how much new demand for commercial planes you've all been seeing from low-cost carriers around the world and how much exposure do you have to the order book and how much exposure do you see to demand for commercial aircrafts at least in the short-term?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Andrew, to your point, while we do see some variability amongst the broad range of airline customers that we have, I would say as a composite, we're continuing to see airline profitability trending in a good direction. The airline industry is very healthy overall, across all of the different types of business models including low-cost carriers. And so while there have been some selective challenges within the industry, as a composite it's a strong and healthy airline industry. It's being well-managed. And part of it is the fact we're able to provide our airline customers with advanced capability technologies that are helping them drive profitability and further growth.","So we keep an eye on that, but we feel very confident in the overall health of the airline industry, but more broadly, the health of the macro passenger traffic market. Again, year-to-date, 6.8% growth in passenger traffic. It continues to significantly outpace global GDP. That is a fundamental difference from almost any other big industrial sector, and the growing middle-class population around the world is really the driving factor behind that. As I said, 150 million new passengers every year in Asia; people that fly for the first time. Less than 20% of the world's population has yet taken a single flight. So when you think about the macro population trends around the world, that's fueling growth and that's going to be good for the airlines, it's going to be good for us as airplane producers, and if you look at the overall strength of our current market outlook, that 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, we remain very confident in that. In fact we continue to see upward pressure on our market assessment.","Operator","Next question is from Eric Johnson with Reuters News. Please go ahead.","Eric M. Johnson - Thomson Reuters","Thank you, guys. Appreciate the opportunity. Dennis, I wanted to ask about the charge on T-X and if it is in some way an effort to sort of front load the pain and anticipate a situation similar to what is happening with KC-46. In other words is it inevitable that it may go off course?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","No, Eric, it's dramatically different than that. These, as Greg said, these are planned, purposeful investments up front with a commercial business case wrapped around them. And in particular, on T-X, we have one, de-risked the program with investments that are behind us, having built those two production-ready flying aircraft. That reduces risk in the development program which makes it significantly different than Tanker. But if you look at the forward investments, where we're taking the charges in this quarter, those apply to the future production program and the business case around those, because we see a production opportunity that is well beyond the current contract, the initial contract. So think of these as investments that enable a production run that begins in the early 2020s and will extend literally for decades.","So it's fundamentally a different approach. It's making a commercial-like investment in a defense program where we have confidence that it will run for decades both in terms of production line and support and services. Investments behind us are the ones that have de-risked the program and also make it dramatically different than Tanker.","Anne C. Toulouse - The Boeing Co.","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","That will be from Marcus Weisgerber with Defense One. Please go ahead.","Marcus Weisgerber - Defense One","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Earlier this month the White House released an assessment of the defense-industrial base which warns of excessive Chinese-made content in American weapons. And in light of that the Pentagon is planning a legislative package and they are saying they plan to invest in U.S. areas of the supply chain to reduce that Chinese dependence. So my question is does the report make you look differently or reassess any of your suppliers and do you have any indication if Boeing supply chain will be getting any of those pentagon investments?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, we are very much connected into the defense-industrial base policies and plans, working hand-in-hand with the Pentagon and our U.S. customers. We, as a matter of normal business, have great visibility into our Supply Chain and all of the export\/import rules and regulations that get applied to that are built in and are something that's built into how we do business every day.","So as we look at deep supply chain capabilities and supply sources, this is not new to us. In fact these are things that we completely understand and govern our business today, and we'll be continuing to work jointly with the Defense Department as we define sources for the future and ensuring that we have, I'll say the diversity of supplier sources that we need here in the U.S. to satisfy our defense customer needs.","I don't see this as anything that's going to substantially change our business model or our Supply Chain going forward. It will just add additional discipline to ensure the security of that Supply Chain.","Anne C. Toulouse - The Boeing Co.","Okay, that concludes our earnings call.

Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the internet. ","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy Lahr","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's second quarter 2017 earnings call. I'm Troy Lahr, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy. After management comments, we'll take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thank you, Troy and good morning. My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, the health of our business environment and our performance and growth plans. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and our outlook.","With that, let\u2019s move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of employees throughout our company, Boeing delivered second quarter 2017 financial results that included strong operating performance and robust cash generation. During the quarter, we generated $5 billion of operating cash and repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing\u2019s stock as we continued to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, while investing in innovation, future growth and our people. ","From 2012 till now, we've repurchased more than 200 million shares and increased our dividend per share by 190%. Revenue in the second quarter was $22.7 billion, reflecting planned production rates and timing of commercial and defense deliveries. Core earnings per share of $2.55 was driven by solid execution across the company. Based on our strong first half 2017 performance and improving confidence in our outlook, we are raising full year guidance for operating margins, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Greg will discuss these in more detail shortly.","Now, let's look at the second quarter operating performance for our businesses. For the quarter, commercial airplanes generated revenue of $15.7 billion on 183 deliveries and reported operating margins of 10%. The healthy pace of sales announcements at the Paris Air Show contributed to 183 net new airplane orders or $22 billion during the quarter, adding to our already robust backlog that now stands at more than 5700 airplanes.","Other key commercial milestones in the quarter included delivering the first 737 MAX 8, launching the 737 MAX 10 and manufacturing the first 777X test parts in our new composite wing center. Also, the second third and 787-10 aircraft entered the flight test program ahead of schedule.","Boeing Defense, Space and Security reported second quarter revenue of $6.9 billion. Operating margins were a record for this business segment at 12.9% on continued strong operating performance. New orders booked during the quarter totaled $5 billion, including a $1 billion award from the US Missile Defense Agency, a contract for the UK Ministry of Defense for 38 Apache attack helicopters and an F-15 support contract with the Defense logistics Agency. ","Key milestones for our defense and space unit included a successful ground based midcourse defense intercept test and first flight of the second production ready TX trainer aircraft. Also as part of our next step in driving market based affordability, Defense, Space and Security announced a more streamlined organizational structure, designed to accelerate decision making, further improve productivity and enhance our competitive position. Overall and to summarize for the quarter, we delivered solid execution across the company, generated strong cash flow, increased our backlog and returned significant cash to shareholders.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy demand in our commercial Defense, Space and Services markets. In the commercial airplane market, airlines continued to report solid profits and passenger traffic continues to outpace GDP with traffic growth 8% through May. Also, cargo traffic is starting to experience a healthier recovery with 10% freight traffic growth over the first five months of the year. Beyond positive traffic growth trends, we've seen over the past few years an evolution in key market dynamics that we believe in the aggregate are driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry. ","For example, demand is more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe. It is more diverse and balanced across the spectrum of customer business models as well. There's also more balance in demand between new airplanes needed to replace older airplanes and those needed to support fleet growth requirements and consumer purchasing patterns to become more stable and consistent, driven by sustained and increasing airline profitability. Reflecting these shifts, we recently updated our 20-year commercial market outlook and we now forecast $6.1 trillion of demand for approximately 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, an increase of more than 1400 aircraft from last year. More specifically, we see demand for more than 29,500 aircraft in the single aisle market and approximately 9100 aircraft in the wide body market. ","This long term demand combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog provide a solid foundation for our planned production rate increases. Our high confidence in increasing 737 production to 57 per month in 2019 is based on our existing backlog of nearly 4500 aircraft and a production skyline that is oversold through the end of the decade. In the wide body market, we continue to see some varying levels of near term demand across aircraft models. However, we have seen steady orders and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide body replacement demand early in the next decade. 777 production for 2017 is sold out and for the current generation 777, we have 111 orders in backlog, which includes four additional aircraft that we booked in July. ","Production continues at the seven per month rate before we lower the production rate in August to five per month and as we've previously stated, that production rate will result in 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019 as we transition production to the 777X. At that rate and with the existing orders and commitments in place, we are now in an oversold position in 2018 and approximately 90% sold out in 2019. While we still have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on the current environment and our ongoing sales campaigns, we believe the rate plan that we put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current triple 777 to the 777X. ","And we have a strong foundation of 340 777X orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of the new 777X. Our 787 Dreamliner program also stands on a strong foundation for long-term production with over 700 firm orders in our backlog. The recent order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners illustrates continued healthy near term demand for this unmatched fuel efficient family of aircraft. As we've discussed on prior calls, we have a focused effort underway to secure additional 787 orders to support the 14 per month production rate planned for the end of the decade. We remain disciplined in our ongoing 787 production rate assessment, with an emphasis on production stability, growing profitability and ensuring that supply and demand are kept in balance.","Turning to Defense, Space and Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. In the enacted FY17 federal budget, Congress added 7 AH-64 Apaches, 12 F-18 Super Hornets and four V22 Ospreys as well as a significant funding increase for space launch system. We're also seeing strong support for numerous Boeing programs above the president's FY18 budget request. International demand for our defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular for Rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. ","We continue to make progress towards completing a healthy mix of previously announced international sales, including 36 F-15 fighter aircraft to Qatar, 28 F-18 fighter aircraft to Kuwait, up to 48 Chinook helicopters to Saudi Arabia and the final C-17 to India. Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, Rotorcraft satellites services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. ","As part of these efforts, we're also leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise by winning future franchise programs such as the JSTARS recapitalization, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, Unmanned Carrier Based MQ-25A and the T-X Trainer, along with advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities.","Turning to the services sector, we see the $2.6 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for the company. To capture an increasing share of that growth, our new Boeing Global Services business is focused on traditional services such as parts, modifications and upgrades as well as new offerings, utilizing data analytics and information based services. Comprised of major elements from our formal commercial aviation services and global services and support groups, Boeing Global Services successfully began operating as an integrated new business unit on July 1st and it has already begun capturing key market opportunities.","On the defense services side, we announced exclusive aftermarket distribution agreements with GE Aviation and Rolls-Royce for engine spare parts that have a combined potential value of more than $10 billion over the life of the program. Also during the quarter, Norwegian selected Boeing global services provides flight training across its entire Boeing fleet and in part to fuel our growth in digital aviation, we launched Boeing analytics. ","It brings together our enterprise capabilities and the work of more than 800 analytics experts across our company, we are focused on transforming data into actionable insights and customer solutions. With growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel investments in our future. The gains we have achieved thus far this year and those we expect in the months ahead are reflected in the increased guidance for margins, earnings per share and cash flow that Greg will discuss in more detail.","With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results.","Greg Smith","Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everybody. Let's turn to slide 4 and we\u2019ll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue came in as planned at 22.7 billion, while core operating earnings per share increased to $2.55, driven by solid performance across the portfolio.","Let\u2019s now move to commercial airplanes on slide 5. For the second quarter, our commercial airplane business reported revenue of 15.7 billion, reflecting the execution of planned production rates and timing of deliveries. BCA operating margins were 10% on solid execution on production programs and within our services business. As Dennis indicated earlier, BCA captured $22 billion in net orders during the second quarter and backlog remains very strong at 424 billion, more than 5700 aircraft, again equating to more than seven years of production. Cost performance on the 787 program continues to improve with deferred production balance declining by $531 million in the quarter.","Turning now to Defense, Space and Security results on slide 6. Second quarter revenue on our defense business was 6.9 billion and operating margins were 12.9%, largely driven by strong performance at military aircraft and Global Services. Boeing military aircraft\u2019s second quarter revenue was 2.9 billion, reflecting the planned wind down of the C-17 program. Operating margins of 13.2% reflect overall solid core operating performance. Network and space systems reported revenue of 1.7 billion on planned timing of satellite volume and operating margins were 9.1% for the quarter. Global Services & Support revenue was 2.3 billion, reflecting timing of contracts. And mix in operating margins of 15.4%, reflecting strong execution across the portfolio and favorable contract mix. Defense, Space and Security reported backlog at $58 billion with 37% of that from international customers.","Let\u2019s move to cash flow on slide 7. Operating cash flow was very strong at $5 billion for the second quarter, driven by solid operating performance across the company and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. With regard to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $2.5 billion in the second quarter and for the first half of the year, we've completed 28.5 million shares, totaling $5 billion. Our continued balanced cash deployment efforts reflect our ongoing confidence in the long term outlook for our business. We anticipate completing the remaining $9 million repurchase authorization over approximately the next year. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth again remain a priority for us.","Let's move now to cash and debt balances on slide 8. We ended the quarter with $10.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. This cash position provides us flexibility to invest in highly profitable growth opportunities, while again also returning cash to shareholders. We also announced today that we're taking action to further de-risk the company by accelerating $3.5 billion of pension funding, which we expect will eliminate nearly all future mandatory pension funding through 2021. ","During the third quarter, in addition to the previously announced $500 million cash pension contribution, we will make another 300 -- $3.5 billion of discretionary pension contribution using Boeing common shares. We will utilize our strong cash position to increase share repurchase by the 3.5 billion above our prior plan for 2017 and we now expect to repurchase approximately $10 billion of Boeing common shares for the full year. We continue to expect operating cash flow to grow annually through the end of the decade and we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to investors. Over the past several years, we have taken meaningful actions to reduce risk in cyclicality in our business and today's actions are another step in that direction.","Let's turn now to slide 9 and we\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2017. We increased 2017 core earnings per share guidance by $0.60 to now be between $9.80 and $10, driven by improved performance across the company and lower than expected tax rate. We're also increasing BCA margin guidance to greater than 10% and BDS margin guidance to greater than 11.5%. As Dennis indicated earlier, we're also raising cash flow guidance for improved performance in tax savings from the additional pension funding. Cash flow guidance is increasing by 1.5 billion to 12.25 billion with approximately $700 million related to tax savings and about $800 million on improved operating performance. We're also lowering CapEx guidance, spending guidance by 300 million to $2 billion for the year on improved efficiency, disciplined spending and some favorable timing.","So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results, increasing momentum for our company. In the second half of the year, an important focus for us will be ensuring that continued seamless ramp up of Boeing Global Services and leveraging our new three business unit strategy in the marketplace. We\u2019ll also be expanding our efforts in driving key cross enterprise levers to improve productivity and affordability and accelerating innovation across the company, all with an eye towards profitable growth in the second century.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis Muilenburg","All right. Thank you, Greg. With a strong first half of the year behind us, our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. In addition to the encouraging commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we've also taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business, including remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical. ","Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments and to stretch beyond those plans to sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp up in commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, delivering on our development programs, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, driving world class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments and innovation in growth and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry. ","All of which positions Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth and to create increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.","Now, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first questions comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Dennis, in the past, you\u2019ve talked about taking free cash flow up sequentially year-over-year. You've obviously got a very big free cash flow number this year, an increase. And first, I want to make sure that\u2019s still true in the following years, but I'd like to understand two aspects of it. First, is your outlook with rising free cash flow assume that you'll get to the mid-teens target for margins that you've talked about in the past or could that be additional upside? And then second, on CapEx, you've taken down CapEx 300 million for this year. How does that fit in with the trajectory going forward where you've got the 777X and you potentially may have longer term new mid-size airplane coming out. So how do you think about both aspects of the cash flow trajectory?","Dennis Muilenburg","Doug, first of all, on your initial question, absolutely confirm, we still expect year-over-year cash growth throughout the end of the decade even with a higher foundation starting point for that based on the performance this year. We still expect year-over-year cash growth going forward. A lot of that again is driven by just fundamental performance in the business, increasing profitability on the 787, you can see the progress we're making there and we expect to make more progress going forward, the ramp up on 737 production and just fundamental improved performance across our program. So we still expect this to be a sustained year-over-year cash growth business. ","And our work on margins, as you referenced, contributes to that. We still have our target out there for our teams to get to 15% margins by the end of the decade. You can see that we're making progress towards that target. And as we've mentioned to you before, we expect that to be steady progress, not progress that awaits till the end of the decade, we expect to see incremental margin improvement over the next several years. That is a contributing factor and we're keeping that target closely in focus. ","And then on the CapEx point, you did see us reduced our guidance for the end of the year in terms of CapEx spend this year, reflecting some efficiencies in our performance as well as a bit of timing, but you should expect to see a very stable CapEx profile going forward. Part of our plan for the company is to have a non-cyclical business and a well-tailored R&D and CapEx profile and we think as we're in the middle of 777X over the next few years, that'll be winding down. We have other investments that we're contemplating for the future, but all of those are feathered in to provide us a very nice stable CapEx and R&D profile for the rest of the decade.","Doug Harned","Does that CapEx reduction reflect anything about how triple 777X is proceeding?","Dennis Muilenburg","I think it gives you a sign that the program is proceeding on plan. We have hit the peak on the CapEx spending for 777X, the project Wing Center was one of our big investments there. We're now building initial production parts in the composite wing center, so 777X is moving forward right on plan and we expect to begin delivering those airplanes in 2020 as planned.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai Von Rumohr","Thank you so much and good performance. So Dennis, of your plan to get to sort of 15% margins in commercial, how much of that should we anticipate being from extension of accounting blocks and how much of that is just core line performance?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. All of those are contributing factors, Cai. Certainly, we're working productivity internally and that's a day-to-day activity in every dimension of our cost profile, of our market based competitiveness work. Both direct and indirect costs, every element of overhead, those are elements that we're working hard. It applies to our supply chain. Recall that 60% to 70% of our cost base in the commercial airplane business is in our supply chain, so the work we're doing through our Partnering for Success initiative. Again, we're making some great progress there with our suppliers and partners. More work to go there and it's also true that favorable mix going forward and what we see in terms of block extensions as we continue to grow our production profile. That certainly contributes as well, those production block extensions are margin accretive. And also related as we stand up our services business, in general, we expect services growth to be accretive to margins. So all of those are contributors to that 15% target.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Howard Rubel.","Dennis Muilenburg","Operator, we'll go to the next question.","Operator","One moment please. We're having some technical difficulties. From Jefferies, your line is open. Please go ahead. And Mr. Rubel, if your line is on mute possibly.","Dennis Muilenburg","I think we should try to go to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Yeah. We\u2019ll go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Yeah. I wanted to start on MAX execution. With the 6 you delivered in the second quarter, do you feel that you\u2019re on pace to meet that delivery, but you kind of said I think 10% to 15% of the total 737 deliveries for the year. And then kind of along with that, can you give us a sense of how the switch over transition is going on the three lines in Renton, just in terms of kind of switching over the other two lines, from the NG to the MAX and kind of what level of risk you think that entails?","Dennis Muilenburg","Let me take a first cut and Greg, feel free to add in here. But the MAX ramp-up is going well. As you noted, the 6 deliveries in the quarter, we're continuing to ramp up right on pace and the airplanes also performing well in the field. As we mentioned before, our production system transitioned overall on 737 to 47 a month was scheduled for this quarter and the production system is now running at 47 a month. So we've successfully ramped up while we've introduced the MAX and we are now in the process of moving from the separate third line to integrating into the NG line and actually have airplanes flowing through that integrated NG MAX line. So team is doing a great job of ramping up the production system and fully integrating the operations. We still expect deliveries to be in that 10% to 15% of the total 737 volume for the year. ","Greg, have you got anything you want to add?","Greg Smith","Yeah. I mean the only thing I would add Pete is, as we've made these transitions in rate, again, think about risk reduction and so I think the team has done a great job of pre-planning that and investing in that third line, getting the program up and running and then transitioning into the main line and this is just another example of how do you de-risk that transition and continue to drive value and meet our customer commitments and the team is doing that. So we've got a big back half in front of us, but they know exactly what they need to do and they're off to a great start.","Pete Skibitski","That's great, Greg. Maybe one follow up, period costs, as more MAX enter service and more operators get the aircraft over the next couple of years, do you expect period cost to grow over the next couple of years on that or is that going to be kind of flattish?","Greg Smith","It will be around flattish.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky","I wonder if you could spend a few minutes talking about your updated thoughts on the middle of the market and you obviously spend some time over in Paris and probably had some customer conversations about that aircraft. So maybe just talk a little bit about how the business case is coming along on that one, a little bit about the production system and how you think you're going to get there from a cost perspective? And then you've talked about the free cash flow at work for the rest of this decade, but this is a program that's going to probably began ramping in 2020. So just kind of talk about the handoff from your current development programs into the middle of the market and the impacts that that might have on cash? Thanks.","Dennis Muilenburg","We're continuing to make progress on our efforts there as we talk to customers about the potential middle market airplane. We've talked with more than 50 customers around the globe with a diverse set of business models and business needs. We continue to see a potential market there for 2000 to 4000 aircraft. We're continuing to work our way through the details of what that airplane might look like potentially a family of two airplanes working through passenger sizing, range of the airplanes and having good meaningful discussions with our customers. ","We're also working through the details of the supporting business case. We're certainly going to leverage all of the investments that we've made across things like 787 and 777X, the composite technology that we've invested in, but an important part of this is also taking a look at the fundamental manufacturing system and how we design and build for the future and taking advantage of some of our new digital tools and that allows to take significant cost out of development, production and improve down field support. And then all of this, we're looking at it through a lifecycle lens. ","And as we ramp up our services business, this could also be a contributor to helping us ramp up in services. So that\u2019s all work that's productively moving forward. We're still looking at a timeline that we've talked about before that if we were to introduce this airplane, it\u2019s probably an entry into service in the 2024, 2025 timeframe. So we have time to do our homework and do it well, we\u2019ll make a good disciplined business decision. From a R&D and CapEx standpoint, it feathers in very nicely with the work we have underway. ","And by that 2020 timeframe, we\u2019ll be down the backside of the 777X R&D profile and CapEx profile, we\u2019ll begin delivering 777Xs in that time frame and so if we were to launch a middle of the market development program, it would rather end very nicely on the back side of 777X. But we really don't see a significant change to our profile in terms of CapEx and R&D spending. We think we'll see a nice steady profile throughout that time period. So we're going to continue to do our work here and make a good business discipline decision and one that adds value for customers.","Operator","Our next question is from David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Wanted to ask about cash progress through the rest of the year. Year-to-date, it looks like advances Greg have been a pretty big tailwind. Your guidance for the full year, how are you thinking about advances? And then your commitment to free cash flow growth from here, how are you thinking about advances playing into that and then also 777X and the inventory build there. Thanks.","Greg Smith","Yeah. There was some favorable timing in the quarter on advances, but there will not be favorable timing in the year. So the guide increase is on performance as well as the tax benefit associated with the pensions. So again, as I outlined, about 700 million for the pension, about 800. So this is, you got to equate this to core performance. This is focused on working capital and all elements of working capital, right down to the program and functional level, looking at payables, receivables, probably most of the focus getting into inventory, right down to the line and making a very efficient business decisions there. So you got to equate this to performance. ","As you look at the cash flow going forward, I think Dennis addressed it earlier, we still expect it to grow for all the reasons he outlined that I won't repeat them, but on top of that, again, we've got more focus on the elements within cash down to the team level and they're off to a great start. So I think there's more opportunity there for us to capture. In 777X inventory build and so on, is all in those comments about us expecting cash flow to grow. We've taken that all in to consideration. ","So it's about execution. It\u2019s about being more efficient as Dennis outlined and it's about executing on our production rate increases as we have and at the same time, looking for opportunities to reduce risk, like we talked about earlier with Pete on MAX or another example on the pension. We're taking that risk off the table and we're pre-funding that to give ourselves again a clear line of sight that really focuses more so on just day to day efficiency and operating performance.","David Strauss","And Greg, in terms of the working capital opportunity, receivable, payables, inventories, how far along do you think you are in terms of capturing the opportunity you see there?","Greg Smith","I think there's still a lot of opportunity there. And again we're benchmarking ourselves, not just within the industry. We're benchmarking ourselves to the top quartile as Dennis has outlined. So we're benchmarking with people that you wouldn't traditionally benchmark with outside the industry that are really good at this, taking those best practices and bringing them in and there are some areas who are more mature than others and by the way, there's areas within Boeing that we are at best in class level, so how do we take those best practices and bring them across on the other program. So bottom line is, I think, there's more opportunity there for us to capture.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","I was hoping to follow up on the margins at BCA. Obviously, the core underlying margins, I\u2019m not sure you are kind of pre R&D, the mature margins look like they've been the best and it was a decade and kind of leads me to the next question, which is you raise the guidance to greater than 10% for the year. I think the prior guidance contemplated either retaining your 14 a month target for the 787 or kicking that decision out. Are you implying that you're in a more comfortable position to retain the 14 a month 787 production by the end of the decade with this guidance raise?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. The assumptions on the guidance raise around 787 are unchanged. So they're within the guidance there and obviously we haven't, we have assumed that we are going to 14 a month and we've got a market to support that, but we've still got some work to do and so we\u2019ll continue to finish that work, but all of that is taken into consideration in margin guidance.","Greg Smith","Those alternatives are bounded by the guidance.","Myles Walton","And was there any, just kind of clarification, were there any block adjustments unusual in the quarter. Could you say what they are?","Dennis Muilenburg","Just one, 737, nothing unusual, but 737 all MAX.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","I wanted to come back, Dennis, to middle of the market aircraft and maybe approach it in a bit of a different way. You\u2019ve been talking more about the prospects of it obviously. Would it be fair to assume that such a program could service leverage to increase aftermarket opportunities on existing programs as opposed to just this new one, and then if you\u2019ve had any successful conversations to that effect?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. Rajeev, as I said, as we contemplate middle of the market airplane, we are taking a look at that through a lifecycle value lens services lens. It can be a way for us to amplify some of the investments we're making to grow services. As we look at our parts business downstream and how we structure that for the future and making sure we have the right kind of intellectual property arrangements to do that that, that gives us some opportunity to expand that thought process to other product lines. The investments we're making in digital aviation information based services, the architecture of the airplane to maximize that value. ","There's a learning associated there that again allows us to cross-pollinate to our other production lines. We're also thinking through our vertical strategy as we build out vertical capabilities for the future, how we might use a middle of the market airplane to amplify that effort, things like our composite wing investment that you're well aware of, propulsion integration is another area where we've been investing, we're standing up in actuation capability that's going to provide support to 777 and 737, we could further amplify that. So this is a way for us to also build our vertical strategy with an idea that vertical depths can also add lifecycle value. So those are all lenses that we're working on and we are certainly evaluating middle of the market airplane as a mechanism for helping us grow services and as we think through that lifecycle lens, that's a business process approach that again can provide value more broadly to our services business across commercial and defense. ","Rajeev Lalwani","And just a brief follow-up, just as you look more on the services side and you\u2019ve obviously even talking about a lot more, Dennis. What have you been hearing from some of your suppliers and customers as far as just the feedback which you\u2019re looking to do.","Dennis Muilenburg","The key is as we move to this dedicated integrated services business, we're absolutely focused on our customers and we believe there's great opportunity here to add value for our customers and provide better solutions for then. So that's where this all starts. As we've had discussions with our customers those have been very encouraging because we are focused on adding value for them. And we're convinced that with our depth of OEM knowledge, some of the investments we're making and our partnerships with our suppliers that there are ways to do that together. And certainly throughout our supply chain there's interest in what we're doing in the services area. As we contemplate this growth markets I said about $2.5 trillion market over the next ten years. We see that as a growing market and one we're working with our supply chain, we can grow together and provide better value for our customers. That is our focus on this effort.","Operator","The next question is from our with Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","The shift from performance because it's pretty impressive to talk about maybe orders and sort of the outlook for a moment, sort of two parts to it. One is that it looks like book to bill this year based on what you've done in Paris and to date is clearly going to be better than one. But could you also talk a little bit about what's going on in the leasing market because those are kind of what I call shadow orders where we're seeing aircraft being placed that had already been ordered by the leasing company so that you're expanding your footprint and what does that mean and give you confidence in terms of your forward look to volumes?","Dennis Muilenburg","Well, first of all on overall book to bill, Howard, we\u2019re still expecting a book to bill of about 1 for the year. You're right we had a very strong Paris Air Show and we're very pleased with the outcome there. And I think in general, there was some upside there compared to what we had expected going into the Air Show. So we\u2019re encouraged by the momentum there, but if we look at overall market both narrow bodies and wide bodies, we still expect orders volume to be similar to last year, a book to bill of about one. As you know there's a lot of timing associated with orders volume. That said with a backlog of over 5,700 aircraft, we don't have a great sense of urgency to have to build overall backlog, we\u2019re in a solid position. We are very focused on filling out the 777 Bridge as a key part of our orders effort. You can see we've made some great progress on that. And I want to reiterate again that we're now in an oversold position in 2018, so that new good news for the 777 Bridge although we still have more work to go there.","Now to your point on the leasing companies, we do see a lot of energy there. Again both narrow bodies and wide bodies. And as we have customers around the world that are thinking through different business models, the leasing channels are certainly providing some good support to the overall market growth and you can see that satisfying needs in both passenger and cargo growth. I think just as another really good sign post is during the quarter, AerCap's order for 30 787-9s. While we continue to be mindful of some hesitancy in the wide body marketplace having a premier customer like AerCap's and their releasing horsepower making a big order in the wide body marketplace. I think is another good signal for us. So we're going to continue to be mindful about the risks and be very focused on filling out the 777 Bridge. But I'm feeling good about the progress we're making and I think the energy we see in the leasing market it supports the overall market strength.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Gollan with Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Andrew Gollan","So I have a broader question on capital structure. So in light of the decision today that we learned about accelerating the pension funding. In recent years, Boeing has a neutral balance sheet position in terms of gross cash and consolidated debt broadly. So with this injection in pension funding we moved to a net debt position of about 4 billion. I just would like you insights into how you think about capital structure, is this the reflection of just confidence or how you think about the right capital structure for the group relative to history?","Greg Smith","Yes, I think it certainly reflects confidence we have in our business in the market and our ability to execute in that market and it goes to the foundation that Dennis talked about as far as the backlog. But I think as far as general capital structure what you see today is what you should expect to see going forward and we're very focused on again on risk mitigation and topline and bottom line performance. And so as we make these decisions like pension and that really ties to our performance. If we weren't performing at the levels we were at, we wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity do something like this and this is a really great opportunity to look after that kind of profile up to 2021 and kind of pull that back, take that risk off the table. And at the same time very committed to meeting our obligations to all of our employees. So returning cash to shareholders, balance deployment, investing in our company in innovation that's what's gotten us here, over the last hundred years that's what's going to get us and allow us lead in the second century as Dennis has articulated and that's going to continue to be our focus.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","I wanted to ask about the 787 and very good progress on the deferred balance this quarter, the $530 million dollar reduction. Was there anything kind of unique about this quarter or is that sort of the new floor for deferred reduction going forward. And then when we think about the second half of the year and how much better things could get. I was under the impression that there were some price step downs coming in the second half and that we would see further acceleration from that level?","Greg Smith","Seth, I said there's nothing unique, it is just again as we've articulated the kind of big moving pieces on improving deferred. Certainly first and foremost executing to making the deliveries and making rate. Team has done a great job in doing that. Coming down the learning curve in the factories as well as step down in the supply chain and then of course the more favorable mix as we bring more -9s and 10s in. But frankly I guess the only thing that would be a little bit unique here is that we've got -10s and 12, and they\u2019re in early production and that would be more of a headwind. So I think what you see here again beyond that is pretty straightforward. So obviously we expect that to improve going forward as we continue to focus on each of those elements. Again, my credit to the teams in Charleston and Seattle because they've done a great job. Staying day to day focused on every unit being more efficient than the prior one, they in some cases are setting new standards for the company. So back to my kind of best practices. We have teams coming in now that are looking at some of these initiatives they have on A7 and we're bringing them across to places like rotorcraft and the fighter line. So that just gives you a sense of how day to day focus is really making a difference in the progress that's been made in 77 program.","Seth Seifman","And to your point, Greg, on 787-10, its showing the value of real manufacturing commonality as well with those first jet planes flowing through the line.","Operator","And next we\u2018ll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Dennis, how do you think about the health of your supply chain, particularly as start to go up - continue - not to start but continue to go up in rate on the narrow bodies. Are there any pressure points that you worry about and how do you think about managing those because obviously you guys are doing very well with your inside performance, but how do you make sure everybody kind of feeding that is up to snuff as well, particular as rates go higher.","Dennis Muilenburg","You bet. Ron, we spend an intense amount of time with our supply chain just as rigorously taking a look at their productivity curves and investments and ramp up as we do to our internal operations. In fact that's all done hand in hand because we know that we're only going to be successful when our supply chain is successful. And as we're ramping up narrow bodies with the 737 line now up to 47 a month in the production system having just taken that step from 42 to 47, our supply chain has come with us. As you know we've been paying very close attention to the ramp up on the MAX and LEAP engine, and our partners at GE have been doing a great job of ramping up in parallel with us. We\u2019re keeping a very close eye on any other pressure points that we might see in the supply chain. So I don't want to make this sound like it's easy, but it's something that is on track and something that we're paying attention to every day.","And we're confident that we have the ability to ramp up to 57 a month. The market certainly supports that kind of the ramp up and by doing it in a disciplined fashion, bringing our supply chain with us, we're confident we\u2019ll be able to execute. This move that we just made from 42 to 47 a month didn\u2019t get a lot of fanfare. But her team executed it really very cleanly and that's really a credit to our team that they know how to do these great ramp ups and do them incrementally to take out risk and bring our supply chain along. Next year, we\u2019ll ramp up to 52 a month and then 2019 will ramp up to 57 a month. So the nice disciplined progression and its part of our partnering for success effort we\u2019re bringing our supply chain along. And we'll continue to keep a close eye on that. if we see any risk points or single source risk points we\u2019ll make sure that we're building a risk mitigation behind those. But right now we're healthy and marching forward.","Ron Epstein","And if I may as a follow up to that question, when you think about standing the service organization, how are your balancing obviously your needs and wants in the aftermarket with your suppliers, right, because from the supplier perspective, for a lot of them that's their lifeblood. So how do you balance that?","Dennis Muilenburg","As I said earlier, Ron, our objective is to grow together in a growing market, right. This is a market that has a lot of headroom for all of us to serve our customers in a more value added way. Now certainly from a Boeing perspective, at the market as it stands today we\u2019re about a 7% to 9% market share in today's market. So that gives us headroom to grow in a market where clearly we have a significant platform presence that's well beyond 7% to 9% of the market. Going forward we expect that market to expand and so while there are some places where we will logically have some competition between ourselves and our supply chain in terms of competing for certain service market segments, in large part this is about growing the market together and adding more value to our customers. I think we're just beginning to scratch the surface on these digital aviation solutions, a value add for our customers that's going to grow the market and something that we can do together with our supply chain.","So that is our preferred business model. Now where we need to we\u2019ll build out vertical capabilities because we're determined to make sure we're adding value for our customers and we've made some of those investments already. We're currently looking through about 40 different categories of support and parts areas where we may invest for the future. In some cases those will be vertical capabilities and some cases new partnerships with our suppliers and in some cases when we need to build an additional supply chain component we\u2019ll make those kind of investments. I think a good example there is the 777X landing gear as an example. So that whole portfolio of options is in front of us. Now the key here is that majority of the work should be growing the services business together, doing it in partnership with our suppliers and in a way that ultimately adds value for the customers. That's how we win in this market.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","I\u2019m wondering if you could follow up a little bit more on the global services. You did give a 20-year outlook earlier in the week. Can you talk about the 7% to 9% share. Looking at the growth rates of the different end markets that you're targeting. I just wonder when can you get to that aspirational $50 billion target, is that five years, ten years, 20 years, just in terms of thinking about it. And some other related is, as you stand up the global services and pull out what I presume is a relatively high margin business out of the segment, how does that affect your PCA aspirational goal of 15% margin just because it's not going to be a different business.","Dennis Muilenburg","Let me take on that first part and then I'll ask Greg to chip in on the second question there. If we take a look at that 50 billion target, revenue target annual sales, we set an aspirational goal for our team that is an aggressive target. We are targeting to hit that level over the next five to ten years, so we provided some span of time to do that. Our preference is to do it more quickly, but we're making the right discipline investment, so we grow in a value added way both for customers and for our company and partners. We do see the majority of that growth being organic investment. We do expect some complimentary inorganic investments either acquisitions or in some cases new partnerships, but working through a whole range of options right now that will fuel that growth. So this is a place where we will invest to grow, but we do see it primarily as organic growth. And I think already we've seen a number of successes here just coming out of the gates better. Encouraging signs on the value we can add for our customers. We stood up Boeing Analytics as you heard that's adding information based services value for our customers. ","Just recently we signed contracts with Delta, China Airlines, and Korean Air for airplane health management predictive alerts. We've got a new agreement with AirBridgeCargo for the fuel dashboard, we've got a ten-year service contract with Turkish to optimize navigation capabilities. We've got the agreement with Norwegian that I mentioned in my comments on flight training capabilities. So we're seeing steady progress, great opportunities for us to leverage our OEM depth, leverage our fundamental parts and services business, upgrades and mods, and then really begin to drive accelerated growth in information based services and data analytics. So all of those will contribute to that $50 billion target. We\u2019re going to move forward in a disciplined way, but in an aggressive way. And Greg you want to comment on the\u2026","Greg Smith","I would say from the aspirational goal perspective, it hasn\u2019t changed. So yes, they'll be some movements in the portfolio to the three business units that of course will report out in third quarter and give you further insight into that movement. But that's going to be, the services business is going to be about $14 billion business at about 15%. But the aspirational goal for BDS and BCA is unchanged. Now obviously we're looking at the BGS side of it and looking at the marketplace there and the risk and reward and you can imagine we're raising the bar there internally as well. So it's not just the $50 billion but it's also from a margin perspective is the risk and reward in balance and what we're offering to the customers as far as value goes. So broader aspiration, again, I wouldn't think of it any different with the change in setting up three business units versus two.","Operator","Our next question is from..","Troy Lahr","We got time for only one more question.","Operator","Okay great, that will be from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Dennis or Greg, when we were Paris we talked a little bit about the kind of the productivity initiatives kind of the champion time concepts and I think we're talking about the 787 for example about in terms of the productivity and what you're squeezing out there. Is this an issue that you're going to be able to still roll out broader across BCA or is that a little more unique just because it was a newer program at 787? Just kind of getting at the productivity gains that you guys are making.","Dennis Muilenburg","Peter, absolutely we're going to roll it out, but it's even broader than commercial airplanes. And this idea of champion times not only at the unit cost level but at the complement level. We have teams that are working mid-body and half-body on 787. They're setting new champion times and what we're seeing is this culture of champion time performance. The farther you drill down, the more powerful it is. And we get teams at the workgroup level that are adopting this philosophy. We're now taking that and we're transporting it to other commercial airplane programs. And Kevin McAllister is doing a great job of spreading that across his enterprise. But in collaboration with Leanne over in the defense and space business, the same thing we've taken that same philosophy to our fighter lines, the satellite lines, the rotorcraft lines. So this is part of our One Boeing strategy and this champion time approach to driving productivity we think is a real enabler for the future and our teams are where the great ideas, our people are the holders of our innovation and this champion time work is really unleashing that innovation.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that completes the analyst question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President Of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Tom Downey","Thank you, we will continue with questions for Dennis and Greg now. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002. Operator we are ready for the first question and we ask in the interest of time that you limit everyone to just one question please.","Operator","And we'll go to Doug Cameron with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron","Can I go back to the supply chain stroke services, sort of mantra is that we've got a close eye on this and PFS 2.0 is a win-win et cetera et cetera. But yesterday somebody like kind of trumpeted their latest Partnering for Success deal basically today. Is it a profit warning and is basically scare of bankruptcy? Another of your big partners or pick suppliers basically said, if services expands like you talk about that they might have to change their pricing model. So, is there a disconnect between what you say and some of your suppliers say or have you really got all of this sorted not just now but in the medium term?","Dennis Muilenburg","Doug, when we take a look at this again the key is when we talk about growing services we always go back and start with the customer. And this is about adding value for our customers and we can do that in partnership with our suppliers as we always have done in the past. Now certainly as you pointed out there's some sense of nervousness or uncertainty as we ramp up. We understand how that might be the case within some of our supply chain, but our actions are following through, it\u2019s in developing partnerships with our supply chain and adding value for our customers. Now there are going to be some places where we're going to have to make some hard decisions, we're going to have to develop alternatives, we're going to have to build additional supply chain capacity, yes, there will be some hard things that will have to do, but all with a ultimate focus on adding value for our customers. And I do believe overall the services market is a high growth market and the large majority of our work can be work that we grow together with our supply chain and where we do have some hard spots we\u2019ll deal with those. That's what our Partnering For Success initiative is designed to do, it's allowed us to get tough business issues on the table, drive those to resolution so that ultimately we can grow together and ultimately will provide better value for our customers.","Operator","The next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson","Dennis, you mentioned inorganic growth for BGS a couple of minutes ago. And BDS has been overshadowed over the last few years by the grow with the commercial division. Would you mind just updating your thinking, your approach to mergers and acquisitions. I mean Boeing has been focused on bolt-on deals for long time, maybe going back to the McDonnell Douglas merger. And I'm wondering now with your stock trading up near 230 per share. That's a really rich currency and are you open to considering larger strategic acquisitions?","Dennis Muilenburg","Julie, our strategy and our position has not changed. When we look at uses of cash we consistently see our priorities as being first most important news is organic investment. And we are making good use of that today . We are bringing more innovation to the marketplace today than we ever have and that spans our entire business not to leave out or our defense business, it certainly includes things like the 787, the 737 MAX, 377X, but it also includes investments that we're making in programs like TX, our satellites business, the autonomous systems that we're developing. So we are making organic investments across the board that's still our number one use of cash and that's what the purpose about innovating our competition.","Secondly, we're going to continue to return cash to our shareholders. And approximately 100% of free cash flow being returned through repurchases and dividends continues to be our second priority. Third is inorganic investments and we don't see a need to change that strategy. We're going to continue to look for bolt-on opportunities things that complement our organic investment, but our best most efficient use of capital is our organic investment machine. That is a well tested, well honed machine one that's producing real growth and we complement it with our M&A actions. And we're going to be focused on growing our services business and targeted verticals and those are areas where we have made investments in the past and will continue to make inorganic investments and we see those as been complimentary as we build out vertical capabilities with lifecycle value. So that's our strategy going forward.","Operator","Our next question if from Alwyn Scott with Reuters . Please go ahead. ","Alwyn Scott","So Boeing has done a lot to restructure, downsize its workforce, reduce production costs. Does Boeing\u2019s size and structure now properly match the revenue and demand that you see or if not how do you think about what more needs to be done? And I'm not thinking about incremental, I'm thinking more about sort of large structural moves.","Dennis Muilenburg","You bet. In terms of our business structure, obviously the big move we just made to stand up are integrated services business was a major structural move and we're very pleased with the three business unit structure that we now have. We think that's the right framework for future growth. Now within that we need to be driving competitiveness every day and we're going to continue to be relentless on that front. And just a reminder, our cost structure is much more than headcount. We're looking at all dimensions of our cost structure, this includes our supply chain and includes every category of overhead, includes efficiency both inside and outside. And we're going to be relentless on driving our cost structure down and gaining efficiencies so we can fuel the future. They said before our number one use of cash and what we create as we drive competitiveness is to invest in future innovation. And that's really important investment not only in products and services, it's also in our manufacturing and design systems, it's in our support and services systems. And it's in our people and we're focused on making all of those investments for the future. This is not work that we're ever going to be finished with. This is a relentless effort to drive competitiveness to fuel our future innovation.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Jon Ostrower with CNN. Please go ahead.","Jon Ostrower","Couple of questions. First is on CapEx and how it relates to M&A. You kind of think about the spending you want to put forth as far as your business plan goes. How much are you weighing the existing infrastructure that you have in factory space and current investments as it relates to what you can use for M&A whether it's Composite Wing Center, existing infrastructure in Everett like 787 line and also availability in Charleston and St. Louis. How do you look at that and kind of continuing the M&A thought. You put out a forecast this week that calls for 637 new \u2013 637,000 new pilots over the next 20 years. How much of M&A sizing and the need for an aircraft like that. It relates not only to the congestion at airports, but also a long-term expectation about the availability of pilots and the need to fly larger aircraft if they're not available. Is the pilot shortage a real threat here and is the M&A strategy partially in response to that?","Dennis Muilenburg","I'll take the second one, but Greg why don\u2019t you start with the one question.","Greg Smith","Look Jon, I think just like any good business discipline and decision you look at capability, you look at capacity and then you look at affordability. And all that will be taken into consideration when we look at the M&A with obviously a clear eye towards winning in the marketplace and how do you do that in the most efficient effective way possible. So basically everything would be considered just like again any good business decision you're going to look at all your alternatives, taking in all those three elements into account. And then make a good business decision at the end of it. So that's what will be embedded into the M&A business case as we think about how we mature that going forward.","Dennis Muilenburg","Exactly. And then Jon, on your question about the pilots and demand for the future. We are taking a very hard look at this growing marketplace. This is sort of in the good problem to have category. But as the world needs 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years as we see traffic growing at 6% to 7%, 8% so far this year, clearly fleet growth is right in front of us, we're projecting that the global aircraft fleet after you account for replacements will roughly double in size over the next 20 years. That's going to drive pilot demand. And so we're working very closely with our customers on how do we help create that pipeline by the way that affects both our commercial business and our defense business where there is a need for future pilots. Some of it is in how we design our future airplanes, how we improve training efficiency, how we allow for rapid ramp up in talent. Part of our services business is going to be related to improved pilot training and efficiency for our customers. I wouldn\u2019t say that the launch of the middle of the market airplane as we consider our options there is really driven by the potential for pilot shortage, it's really more driven by just the overall market demand. We see traffic growing. We see route structures evolving. There are new point to point regional structures that may require a new airplane. If that's really the basis for the 2000 to 4000 potential market that we see. Now we\u2019ll have to be mindful of pilot shortages as a potential risk area. But we don't see that as the driver for going to a middle of the market airplane, middle of the market is really more driven by market growth and customer needs.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to let Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead. ","Dominic Gates","Staying on me the M&A and the next new airplane. You did despite Greg's answer just now, you did during the previous talk about increasing vertical depth, the potential for doing more propulsion work, more wing work. I'm just wondering how significant a shift you see there. Of course historically every new plan that Boeing has come up with has had more buy in it than make in it. The proportion - the make buy proportion has shifted towards buying and like 15 years ago Boeing was talking about getting out of the parts business, but here you're now talking about increasing vertical depth. How significant a shift might we see in that next new airplane in terms of the make-buy proportion. And also how do you see employment within Boeing being affected by that because we're seeing a lot of jobs lost here in Washington State. How do you see that near term as well.","Dennis Muilenburg","Dominic, to your first question we do see increasing focus on vertical content and lifecycle value going forward. I think you've seen some of that evolution reflected in the 777 X compared to the 787 where we brought more of the engineering back in-house. We think that's a more efficient way to design and engineer for the future. Composite wing manufacturing, complex composite manufacturing is a core capability that we've brought back in-house and invested propulsion integration as you noted. We see selective areas in actuation systems as a place where we want to invest for the future. We noted the ramp up that we just announced in both Portland and Sheffield associated to 737 and 777 actuation. There are several other categories of capability that we're looking at. And where we can build vertical capability that adds value, takes risk out and adds lifecycle value as we look through the services lines. Those areas we're going to invest. So I think you will see an evolution that's more towards additional vertical content with a clear focus on lifecycle value addition as an evaluation criteria around that. And if we decide to proceed with middle of the market airplane that philosophy, that strategy will be reflected in the airplane.","Now in terms of your question around employment, as you know we\u2019ve had to continue to make some tough decisions as we're driving competitiveness. We're continuing to do that in a way that is very respectful of our employees and our people and where we can voluntary layoffs and other actions that are frankly good for our people and good for our company. And this is a continuous process. So I'm not going to try to give you any long-term trend or numbers prediction. Just knowing that we're going to continue to drive competitiveness because we're going to invest in innovation for the future. And ultimately that investment is good for our company, it's good for our people, it's good for growth of our business and it's going to provide value for customers. And that's our headset as we make these decisions, we're going to do the right thing to grow the company and ultimately that'll be good for people as well.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Peggy Hollinger with Financial Times. Please go ahead.","Peggy Hollinger","Just a couple of slightly different questions, not about the performance. We've noticed the controversy over the head of the Ex-Im Bank. And I just wondered whether you think perhaps given that controversy, it would be a good idea to have another nominee or do you think you can work with this nominee. And just a little bit of a statement on where we are with regard to the Ex-Im Bank. And if you could update us a bit on Iran please.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, on both of those, first, on Ex-Im Bank, again we continue to believe it is fundamentally important that we get Ex-Im Bank up and running and fully reauthorized. There are about $30 billion of deal opportunities in the pipeline that when the bank is fully up and running again can be executed and will create American manufacturing jobs. And those aren't just Boeing deals, those are spread across all of the industry. So fundamentally as a country we need to get the Ex-Im Bank back up and fully running. Now part of that process, the nomination process to fill the Board seats is crucial. We do think it's important that we have a Chairman of the Ex-Im Bank who supports the banks mission. And as various candidates are being evaluated that's an important lens to be looking through. And we know there are a number of nominations inflow right now, we're encouraged that there is action being taken. We are also urging Congress and the administration to move forward with finalizing those nominations, filling the board positions and getting the bank back up and running at full speed. That will be good for the economy and good for American manufacturing jobs. On your on your second question around Iran, we are continuing to make steady progress on that front. Again, all of this is being governed by US government policy and we're staying completely within that licensing process, stepping our way through the gates. That is moving forward on track and we still expect to begin delivering airplanes next year.","Troy Lahr","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","And that will be from Gillian Rich with IBD. Please go ahead.","Gillian Rich","My question is kind of a follow up to an earlier one on what specific changes in the airline industry would you say are driving these requirements for this new kind of mid market plane, like a new design, what specific things that your customers kind of been telling you about?","Dennis Muilenburg","When we take a look at the market for this airplane again, we see route structures around the world continuing to evolve as general passenger traffic growth is occurring. In particular, new regional structures, point to point connectivity that's in this 4,000 to 5,000 nautical mile range airplanes that are in 220 to 270 passenger range. That's the ballpark that we're looking at and discussing with customers. So this is really reflects the fact that the overall market is growing and these new regional point to point structures are evolving and those new regional structures aren't served well by existing airplanes in general. And so there is an opportunity here to add value for our customers. That's the real focus here and in order to have a airplane that could serve that marketplace, it needs to have some of the efficiencies in terms of turn times that you get with a wide body and it also needs to have the economic efficiencies that you get with a narrow body airplane. So hence sort of a hybrid approach to what that design might be. Those are the details that we're working through with our customers right now.","Troy Lahr","That concludes our call.

Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Co. Please go ahead.","Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. I am Maurita Sutedja, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy.","After management comments we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risks which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our first quarter operating performance followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook.","Now let's move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of employees throughout our company, Boeing delivered strong first quarter 2018 financial results that included higher revenue, earnings and operating cash flow, driven by solid execution on production programs and services. During the quarter, we generated $3.1 billion of operating cash and repurchased $3 billion of Boeing stock. We also paid $1 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year.","We continued to deliver on our commitments of returning cash to shareholders while investing in our people, innovation and future growth. Revenue in the first quarter was $23.4 billion on higher volume of commercial deliveries and mix, along with services and defense contract volume. Core earnings per share of $3.64 was driven by strong performance across the businesses, volume and mix and lower tax rate. Based on our strong first quarter 2018 performance, we are raising full year guidance for operating cash flow, earnings per share, and Commercial Airplane's operating margins. Greg will discuss these in more detail shortly.","Now let's look at the first quarter operating performance of our businesses. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $13.7 billion, reflecting 184 deliveries with operating margins of 11.0%. Continued healthy sales activity contributed to 221 net new airplane orders worth $18 billion during the quarter, adding to our robust backlog that stands at more than 5,800 airplanes and is worth $415 billion.","Key commercial milestones in the quarter included the delivery of the first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines and the first 737 MAX 9 to Lion Air group. We achieved first flight of the 737 MAX 7, completed firm configuration on the 737 MAX 10 and hit the 10,000th production milestone for the 737 program. The smooth introduction of the 737 MAX into our production and delivery stream continued with 36 737 MAXs delivered in the quarter.","On the 767 program, after carefully assessing market conditions and customer demand, we plan to increase the rate of production from 2.5 to three per month beginning in 2020. Today's 767 freighters are the best they've ever been and the demand for the 767 continues to grow from both freight and military customers around the world.","In the quarter, we started building the first 777X fuselage for structural testing as this exciting development program remains on track. Additionally, our partner, GE, achieved the first flight test of the GE9X engine.","Now over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported first quarter revenue of $5.8 billion, reflecting international fighters and weapons volumes and the final C-17 sale with operating margins of 11.3%. The $12 billion of new orders booked by BDS during the quarter demonstrates the value we bring to our customers across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio. These orders included the Missile Defense Agency's sole source contract extension to Boeing for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program, an initial contract for 28 F-18 Super Hornets for Kuwait, a contract for the final C-17 for India and a Joint Direct Attack Munition kits contract for the U.S. Air Force. Key milestones for BDS included the second commercial cruise spacecraft achieving power-on and delivery of the space launch system's intertank hardware to NASA for testing and integration.","In the quarter, the KC-46 Tanker program achieved a successful refueling flight between two KC-46 tankers, which completed the required supplemental type certificate fuel onload testing. Additionally, earlier this month, we completed all planned supplemental type certificate flight tests for the Tanker program, a very significant milestone that we've been aiming towards since we took first flight three years ago. We are making steady progress, closing out technical risk on the path to final certification and to delivering the first 18 tankers this year. We remain confident in the long-term value of this franchise.","Turning to Global Services, BGS reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operating margins of 16.3%, reflecting higher commercial volume along with product and services mix. During the quarter, BGS won new business totaling approximately $5 billion that demonstrates the value that we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers. These included an F-15 Saudi support contract award, a follow-on contract to support the Royal Canadian Air Force's Chinook fleet and the landing gear exchange contract for Aeromexico. These orders highlight the strength of our One Boeing offerings. Also in the quarter, BGS completed flight testing for the 737 Boeing Converted Freighter Program and signed a new distribution agreement with GE for T700 engines.","In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong operating performance, captured noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog and returned significant cash to shareholders.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand in our commercial, defense, space and services markets. These markets are growing and sizable at $7.6 trillion over the next 10 years. In the commercial airplanes market, airlines continue to report robust profits and strong passenger traffic, outpacing global GDP. Passenger traffic in 2018 grew nearly 6% through February. Meanwhile, cargo traffic maintained its strong momentum, growing by 7.7% in 2018 through February, as we see trade and industrial production growing in all regions.","Our global customers continue to recognize the compelling value proposition that our new more fuel-efficient product family brings to the market, as reflected in the healthy new order intake we've seen year-to-date. We continue to see the trend of diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective, as well as across the spectrum of airline business models. There also is more balanced demand between fleet growth and replacement of older aircraft, and we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns.","We believe the evolution in key market dynamics in the aggregate are driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry. Over the long term, we remain highly confident in our commercial market outlook which forecasts demand for approximately 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, comprised of more than 29,500 aircraft in the narrow-body market and approximately 9,100 aircraft in the wide-body market. This long-term demand, combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog, provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates.","Turning to our product segments. Starting with the narrow-body, our planned production rate for the 737 going to 52 per month this year and 57 in 2019 is based on our backlog of more than 4,600 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. We continue to assess the upward market pressure on the 737 production rate.","In the wide-body segment, we have seen steady orders for the 787 and 777 airplanes and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide-body replacement demand early next decade. For the current generation 777, we received five net new orders in the quarter, bringing the backlog to 90 aircraft. We continue to make progress on the 777 bridge as highlighted by these orders and the recent letter of intent from Qatar Airways for five 777 freighters. As we transition production to the 777X, we expect 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019, as previously announced.","While we still have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on our progress of maturing commitments into firm orders, managing the skyline and working new campaigns, we continue to believe the rate plan we put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current 777 to the 777X. As we look forward to the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 340 orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft.","We also captured 24 orders for the 787 Dreamliner family in the quarter, a solid platform for long-term production. With more than 630 firm orders in our backlog, our plan to increase Dreamliner production to 14 airplanes a month in 2019 is well supported. We continue to see repeat orders for the 787 Dreamliner, as demonstrated by the order from American Airlines earlier this month for an additional 47 787s. And the recent Hawaiian Airlines decision to select the 787 as its flagship airplane for medium to long haul flights highlights the strong market preference for the 787 and its superior value.","Turning to our 747 and 767 programs. With our unmatched freighter product lines, we are well positioned to capture the increased cargo demand. During the quarter, UPS ordered 18 incremental freighters including 14 747-8s and 4 767s. We remain focused on our long-term strategy to capitalize on the strength of the aerospace industry fundamentals. It is important to have this in perspective as we navigate through global trade discussions.","Boeing is a global company with operations around the world supporting commercial and government customers in more than 150 countries. We are continually working in a range of geopolitical and business environments. We maintain strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world and continue in our own efforts to proactively engage the different governments. A strong and vibrant aerospace industry is important to global economic prosperity.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. The final appropriation bill for fiscal year 2018 U.S. federal budget funds our key programs across our fixed wing, rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft and also missile, space and satellite products. With our portfolio of reliable, proven and affordable products, we continued to see strong support for our key products in the fiscal year 2019 President's budget. The highlights include increased funding for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program and various programs in our weapons portfolio. Additionally, there continues to be support for increased procurement of the F-18 Super Hornet across the future year's defense plan.","International demand for our defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. As I mentioned earlier, we received an initial contract for 28 F-18 Super Hornets to Kuwait and a contract for the final C-17 to India. And we are making progress towards completing other previously announced international sales including additional Chinook helicopters for Spain and Saudi Arabia.","Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers such as commercial derivatives, rotorcrafts, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. Much of that investment supports the priority we have placed on capturing future franchise programs where we are leveraging capabilities and technologies from across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, ground-based strategic deterrent, unmanned carrier-based MQ-25A and JSTARS recapitalization along with several other important opportunities.","Turning to the services sector. We see the $2.6 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. In this market, both our commercial and defense customers remain focused on improving aircraft readiness and availability while driving improved operational efficiencies. BGS provides agile, cost competitive services to our customers worldwide. We aim to grow faster than the average services market growth of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share.","Strong orders of $5 billion in the quarter along with other agreements announced earlier this year demonstrate the progress we are making in this key area. They reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational cost through the lifecycle. These activities stretch across BGS's four capability areas including parts, engineering modifications and maintenance, digital aviation and analytics and training and professional services.","Earlier this month we announced a number of new products and services across the BGS portfolio including tools powered by Boeing AnalytX, such as self-service analytics and the Service Bulletin Value Tool. We also added new features to Aviator, an all-in-one app that provides centralized access to a seamless integrated suite of tools.","These new service capabilities are driving lifecycle innovation in the form of faster flow times, lower operational costs and enhanced end-to-end reliability. As these tools are introduced to fleets, aircraft will become more efficient and less expensive to operate.","Our focus remains on optimizing the businesses and expanding our portfolio offerings through organic growth investments such as vertical capabilities, complemented by strategic acquisitions to position BGS for sustained long-term and profitable growth. Our services expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well positioned to compete and win in this important sector.","Highlighting again the value we bring as One Boeing is the recently announced memorandum of agreement for a joint venture between Boeing and Saudi Arabian Military Industries to provide sustainment services for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia fleet of fixed and rotary wing military aircraft, demonstrating the strength of our comprehensive defense platform and services offerings.","In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future.","With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Thanks, Dennis, and good morning everyone. Let's turn to slide 4 and we'll discuss our first quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was strong at $23.4 billion reflecting higher volume of commercial deliveries, favorable mix, along with improved service and defense volume. Core earnings per share of $3.64 reflect strong performance across the business, again driven by higher volume and improved mix along with a lower tax rate. All of these more than offset the additional tanker cost growth in the quarter of $81 million.","Before we go into the business performance, I should also note that with the adoption of the new accounting standards including revenue recognition, as of the beginning of this year, we have adjusted our financial statements to comply with these new standards.","Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue increased to $13.7 billion during the quarter, reflecting higher deliveries and improved mix. BCA operating margins increased to 11% driven by strong operating performance on production programs, reflecting the volume and mix and also timing of some period expense. BCA captured $18 billion in net orders during the first quarter and backlog remains very strong at $415 billion and more than 5,800 aircraft, equating to approximately seven years of production.","On the 787 program, we delivered 34 aircraft and booked 24 net orders in the quarter and our team remains focused on improving 787 profitability and cash generation, driven by favorable delivery mix, additional supplier step-down pricing and a relentless effort to further drive internal and supply chain productivity.","Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. First quarter revenue increased to $5.8 billion reflecting the sale of the final C-17 and higher international fighters and weapons volume. Our continued focus on productivity and execution resulted in margins growing to 11.3%.","During the quarter, BDS won key contract awards worth $12 billion and our backlog stands at $50 billion with 36% of that from international customers.","Let's turn now to Boeing Global Services results on slide 7. In the first quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $3.9 billion, reflecting higher commercial services volume. Year-over-year growth of 8% for the quarter meets our objective to outpace the average annual services market growth of 3.5%.","BGS operating margins were strong at 16.3%, reflecting ongoing productivity efforts as well as mix of products and services. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $5 billion and our service backlog now stands at $20 billion. BGS results were a testament to the teams and the enterprise focus on achieving top-line growth while maintaining disciplined execution. The key wins during the quarter underscore the strength of our One Boeing offerings to our customers.","Let's turn now to cash flow on slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter was strong at $3.1 billion, driven by planned higher commercial production rates, strong operating performance across the business and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. We remain focused and on track with our balanced cash deployment strategy, and in the first quarter we repurchased $3 billion of Boeing stock and paid $1 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividend per share from last year.","We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $15 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next two years. Since the end of 2012, we've returned $45 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase at the same time we've invested in key strategic areas to ensure long-term sustainable growth for Boeing. We remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to investors, while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities.","Let's move now to cash and debt balances on slide 9. We ended the quarter with nearly $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash position continues to provide us with flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities while again returning value back to our shareholders.","Let's turn now to slide 10, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2018. As Dennis indicated earlier, due to our strong Q1 performance and our outlook for the year, we're raising 2018 earnings per share, BCA margin and cash flow guidance. We increased 2018 core earnings per share guidance by $0.50 to now be between $14.30 and $14.50. BCA margin guidance is increasing to approximately 11.5% from our prior guidance of greater than 11%, and operating cash flow guidance is increased to be between $15 billion and $15.5 billion from our prior guidance of approximately $15 billion.","As we look towards the remainder of the year, we remain focused on strong execution and risk mitigation within our company and through without our supply chain. So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. We will continue to use a three business unit strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments, leverage the talent and innovation across the company. At the same time, we will continue to set challenging goals and objectives around elements of operations and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency to generate cash and improving working capital while delivering value to our customers. All of these will help us achieve our goal to grow year-over-year revenue, cash flow and margins.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for closing comments.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, Greg. With a strong first quarter on which to build continued momentum for the year, our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. We would not have been able to achieve these strong results without the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnership with our customers and suppliers.","In addition to the strong commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we've taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business. This includes remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical.","We have executed on our long-term strategy of robust and continuing organic growth investment and returning value to shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. As the world's largest commercial airplane maker, our nation's second largest defense contractor, a global leader in space flight and a growing force in lifecycle services, we are as optimistic about our future and the future of our industry as we have ever been.","Being a global company, we are continually working in a range of geopolitical and business environments. We maintain strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world, and we will continue to engage in our own efforts to proactively work with different governments.","Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts.","Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, disciplined leading-edge investments and balanced value-creating cash deployment and continuing to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom-line growth, and increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.","With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Could you describe in more detail where you stand on your two most current new programs? And I guess specifically, on the MAX, are you comfortable with your ability to insulate the delivery ramp from supplier delays, such as the LEAP engine and Spirit fuselage? And then on the 777X, where do you see the greatest challenges in getting that airplane into service on schedule in 2020? And could there be any risk to free cash flow from that program other than early inventory build?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Doug. Let me take a cut at that and then, Greg, feel free to add anything in.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Sure. Yeah.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey first of all, on the MAX, again we're feeling very bullish about that program. The MAX introduction has gone well. The customer intros operationally have been effective. The airplane is performing well in the field. Reliability for the fleet in the field is very high, so we're pleased with the performance of the program.","On the production systems side, feathering that into the mainline of the 737 factory overall has gone well. We're continuing to hit all of our customer delivery commitments. You notice that we delivered 36 MAXs in the first quarter. We expect about 40% to 45% of our 737 deliveries this year will be MAXs. That's right on plan.","Now to your point, we're continuously keeping a very close eye on our supply chain. And while there's been some challenges in the LEAP engines, there's been some noted challenges in fuselages with Spirit, those are all issues that we're on top of. We're working very closely with our partners. They are responding well, and we're continuing to meet all of our customer delivery commitments. And we're going to keep a close eye on that. We're ever vigilant on our supply chain. We know there will be pressure points as we ramp up, but we're confident that we'll continue to ramp up and hit our delivery marks.","On the 777X, just had a chance again to visit the team last week, and we're marching through the development program. We're now building the first static airplane. We're going to be building, or we're underway, on production on the first flight test airplane as well so you see real hardware coming together in the factory. The associated production system transformation for the 777X is being implemented. That includes some of the automation that we're building into the core 777 line to de-risk it for 777X. So we're marching right through the factory step-up as we implement 777X. We're going to be building those airplanes, getting into the flight test program and the program remains on track for 2020 delivery.","Now again, any time we've got a big development program, Doug, as you point out, it's one that we keep a very close eye on. So daily the team is working 777X with great focus, great intensity, but the development program remains on track and the R&D profile that we committed to, the spend profile remains on track, getting to your point on cash management. So we're confident but again ever vigilant on our development program. Greg, you got anything you want to add?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","No. I think you captured it well. Having the mid-body in the factory right now and watching the components coming into the factory and the team knocking down any risk that they have in place real-time. And I think some of the upfront work we did on de-risking is you're seeing that paying off but we're watching it closely.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Are there any points when you're seeing higher risk step in this process whether it's related to the wing, wing joined, final assembly, any timing that we should be cognizant of as you look at the next year or so?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","I think, Doug, the key wait points will be once the first static airplane is fully assembled and we get into tests of that airplane, getting into the flight test program on schedule as we get into next year will be important. So that'll be a key milestone for us and that's the point at which we hand off the airplane if you will from the ground laboratories, the simulation facilities where we've wrung out the risk and we get into the flight test program and then just executing on the flight test program. So those wait points will be visible as we head into next year and then of course getting to first delivery in 2020.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good morning, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So wanted to ask you on the reconfiguration of the aft section of the 787-8 for better production commonality and also these new orders that you've taken. It puts a little bit more life into that variant. Does that impact the configuration of a future NMA perhaps at the high end? And what's the latest status on timing for some kind of authority to offer on NMA?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey Rob, on your first question, we're very pleased with the progress we're making on the 787 production line overall and commonality between variants in the production system is a key part of that productivity plan. As you well know, we have very high commonality between the Dash 9 and 10 which is borne out in the early production costs on the 787-10 and so we're pleased with that progress. And then as you noted on the 787-8, there have been some opportunities to drive additional commonality in particular in the aft body between the Dash 8 and Dash 9. And that has shown up as flow time reductions in the factory, additional efficiency and cost reductions. And you're right, that has given us some additional life and strength in the 787-8 variant.","That said, going forward, we still see more of the future mix being Dash 9s and 10s but fundamental strength in the Dash 8 as well. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities for production system commonality between the variants.","To your second question on NMA, we continue to make progress on our studies there. Again, we have not made a launch decision at this point, but we're having very good discussions with our customers, continuing to hone details of not only the airplane but perhaps even more importantly the associated production system, taking a hard look at the business case. Timing of that decision is still to be determined as we work our way through the details. We have time to do our homework and do it well, but I will say we're making progress and clearly advancing our analysis.","We still see that airplane, if we decide to launch, is a 2025 timeframe airplane in terms of entry into service, so we have time to do our homework. And the R&D profile for that airplane if we proceed would feather in very nicely on the backside of 777X. So from an overall cash deployment, cash management standpoint, we feel confident as well. So.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Dennis.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","We feel confident as well. So we'll do our homework and continue to stay very close to our customers and make sure we're meeting their future needs.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Dennis, what's the outer limit on when you'd have to make an announcement to launch to make that 2025 timeframe?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","We're not going to pin that down too tightly, Rob, because really this is about having the business case discipline and making sure we have crystal clarity on the future production system, which is part of our broader enterprise transformation. But this is something that we'll be getting to over the next year, if you want to put a rough bounding on it.","Again, the idea is an airplane that would enter into service in the 2025 timeframe. So if you back off from that timeframe with our standard milestones, you'd be looking at a decision in that timeframe. But to me, this is not one where we're going to be making a decision just based on a schedule that we have to meet. This is about having a disciplined business case, a future production system and making sure that we're meeting our customers' future needs. This is really about providing value to our customers.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question's from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, David.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Wanted to follow up on 777X. So within your forecast that cash flow's going to continue to grow from here, what exactly are you assuming for 777X in terms of the inventory build over the next couple of years? And then following on that, how key is the reversal on Tanker, getting that delivered and that flowing from a big cash burn, I assume closer to cash breakeven to cash flow positive. How key is that to allowing for your forecast for free cash flow continuing to grow? Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, I mean, I'll start with Tanker, David. As you know, we're going to start delivering here this year. So it is important from a cash perspective when you look at the year-over-year from 2017 into 2018. And then beyond that, it's modest growth really from there. So this is kind of the transitional year on the program but also obviously from a cash perspective.","I think when you look at the 777X, a lot of what you talked about is what's been taken into account in our forecast. So obviously, building the static aircraft and having those in inventory as well as the blanks that we're firing, the risk mitigation efforts that we're putting into the line is also taken into account combined with the production rate. I'll say kind of slow on ramp-up from there. So all of that is kind of taken into consideration as we talk about continued growing cash flow.","Now other moving pieces around there are obviously significant. 787 going up in rate, 737 going up in rate as well, Dennis just talked about the 767 up slightly. So you got to kind of take all those into consideration, combined with some of the headwind we'll have on 777X. But we've bounded that in our forecast, and like I said, taken that into consideration around our commentary around growing cash flow.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, in terms of 777X actual inventory, are you thinking the equivalent of like 15 to 20 production aircraft in flow by the time you get the first delivery in 2020?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","I think it's a little bit less than that, David. I mean again, you got the static aircraft and then you got the flight test aircraft that will be out operating and getting test points. So obviously those won't be delivered in the near term. So you've got that kind of built-up inventory along with the production rate ramp-up and the advances coming in on the 777X. So taking all that into consideration within that kind of that 2020, 2021 timeframe.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Okay.","Operator","Next we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you talk a little bit about the tariffs and the sanctions environment and really how that's impacting any customer discussions and then also how you're thinking about the impact on the supply chain? And how you do things, whether it's aluminum, titanium, et cetera?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet. Yeah, Sam, as you might guess, this is something we're keeping a very close eye on. This is daily actions and daily vigilance on this topic. We're engaged with governments around the world. Obviously one of the hot topics right now is the U.S.-China trade relationship. We know aerospace is very important to both countries, and while some initial statements have been made about potential tariffs, none of those severe actions have been implemented. And we're frankly encouraged by the continuing dialogue. And we've heard from leadership in both countries that both are seeking to find negotiated positions that will be productive for both countries.","The fact that the administration just announced a senior-level trip to China next week to have negotiations and continue the engaging dialogue I think is another positive indicator. So we're staying very engaged on that front. We know trade policy is very important. But this is not a surprise to us. We operate in a global environment. We have to deal with these kind of issues continuously, and we're going to stay very close to our customers and the governments as we proceed. But we're hopeful for a positive outcome from the discussions between the U.S. and China.","More broadly on some of the other matters you mentioned, material costs, titanium supply chain, aluminum and so on, again we're not seeing anything there that's material effect right now. We're very engaged with our suppliers, as you might guess. Over many years we've been continuing to build alternative sources, and daily we're testing our supply chain for any pressure points. And that is a continuous process and one where we remain ever vigilant.","And I think just the fact that you can see our production system continues to run well, we're continuing to meet our customer deliveries, it tells you that we're effectively managing that risk. And we're just going to stay very close to it, and our team is on a daily basis, hourly basis, engaged with our supply chain.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I feel like a few years ago there were some issues with regard to titanium, and you ended up carrying a little bit more than usual. Is there anything in terms of the inventory levels we should think about where you might do the same in terms of getting some additional buffer?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","No, Sam, we really don't see any changes there. Those actions that we took a few years ago, those were long-term actions. So we're still frankly benefiting from some of those actions. And that's allowed us to diversify our supply chain, maintain the right inventory levels, balance that around the world. And we're going to continue to actively manage that portfolio. Greg, you have anything to add?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","No. You're absolutely right. You won't see any impact on the inventory, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Ron.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It's really encouraging that the 767 rate's gone up on the heels of improving health in the air freight market. Can we look at that? Or do you guys see any other indicators that the large aircraft markets have stuff bigger than 787s? That, that segment of the market, 777, 777X, 74, we're starting to see at least the early stages of recovery there? Because it seems like that market really kind of got hit hard. And are we finally starting to see some pick-up there or not? I mean what's your sense on that?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Ron, as you know, the freight cargo market had been down for a couple of years. We saw some re-strengthening last year, and we see further strengthening year-to-date. So I think as I mentioned in my comments, we see freight traffic growth at 7.7% so far this year through February. That's another encouraging sign. We do see long-term strength in that market. We're seeing it grow across all regions around the world. We're seeing general increases in trade levels and transport levels. E-commerce, the growth of e-commerce, is also fueling some of that.","So we see this as a longer-term growth trend. That's part of what's factored into our decision to increase the 767 production rate from 2.5 to three per month in 2020. But as you noticed, we're also seeing increased orders for 777-Fs, 777 freighters, including the letter of intent from Qatar just this past quarter, as well as two additional birds for ANA. So we're seeing strength in those larger freighters. And the UPS order on 747s I think is another good indicator.","So again, we're going to be, maintain a very balanced approach on our production delivery schedules and our production rates. But the fundamental strength in the freighter market is encouraging. And I would say our product lineup to support that demand is a really good lineup. So we're pleased with the fact we've got a portfolio with different airplane scales that can satisfy that growing need.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But do you see that as a leading indicator for potential pick-up in passenger demand, for passenger jets I mean in that segment?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","I don't know that I see that as a indicator that would ripple into passengers. Those two marketplaces have some common catalysts. I'd say world GDP growth, trade growth, is something that can support passenger growth. But in many cases we've seen passenger growth be somewhat independent of GDP growth based more on just the fact that we see a rising population of travelers that are entering the market for the first time.","So while an increased freighter market I'll say can be helpful to the passenger market, we see the passenger market growth being independently strong based on other factors. And that's why we continued to see sustained passenger growth of almost 6% so far this year and that is a long-term trend and we're seeing more and more new city pairs being connected. We're seeing global network traffic grow. We're seeing 100 million new passengers per year in Asia alone. And by our estimates, less than 20% of the world's population has even taken a single flight in their life. So you can see that passenger growth has a lot of headroom beyond what might be driven by cargo growth.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, great. Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning everyone.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Noah.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Greg, what can you share with us about the change in the 787 cash unit accounting margin through the year, end of 2017 to end of 2018, that you're embedding in your cash flow outlook?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Well, I mean you've got the obviously the improvement in mix that we've talked a lot about and you've seen how smooth the Dash 9 has entered into the production system as we planned and you've seen the ramp-up in deliveries there year-over-year. As well as the Dash 10, you've seen us hit significant milestones there, making our first deliveries, so again that mix will start to pick up some pace here throughout the year and into next year. You got the supplier step-down as we've talked about and then the including the additional productivity in the factory.","But those are really the big elements, certainly mix being the biggest one. And the team's done a fantastic job of getting these airplanes not only certified but getting them into the production system on time and doing that smoothly. And that obviously is impacting the cash flow and improving the cash flow overall and of course improving the deferred production.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Sequentially you had a faster pace of deferred decline but on fewer units. So the sequential cash margin jump just looks pretty good compared to what it was the last few quarters. But you also have your seasonality of cash flow, total cash flow guidance quarter to quarter implies the first quarter is a little higher than normal. So I'm trying to figure out if you're assuming that the nice, looks like several hundred basis points of sequential change that you had in the quarter keeps going or if that slows down as you move through the year.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","No, I mean we expect continued increase in productivity and overall cash profile will improve on the 87 through the balance of the year. I mean like I said to you, the difference I think you saw here was primarily due to some mix and some step-down pricing. But I think because of the elements of you got three different variants in the production system and so on and that's why I keep kind of bringing you back to cash flow.","Look at the overall cash flow of the program and that ties directly to the productivity, ties directly to the mix and the step-down in the supply chain that we've talked about a lot as we move through these blocks and you're seeing that improving. So I think the team is executing extremely well, not only in our factories but reaching back into the supply chain and improving the productivity there that's helping on the nonrecurring side, like things like the Dash 10 but also helping overall on the recurring side. You're going to continue to see improvement on the 787 going forward.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So your commercial profitability looked really good even if one excludes the lower R&D, certainly than we expected. Could you give us some color on that in terms of were there any increases in program accrual rates? Were there any increases in the block sizes? And lastly, given your R&D was so low in that quarter, it looks like it has to ramp very sharply to get to your full year bogey. Is that number perhaps a little bit conservative?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Cai, it's expected to ramp and that again is tied primarily to the profile that Dennis articulated earlier on the 777X. So that's what we plan, and look, if we see more opportunities with regards to R&D spending, we'll certainly capture them and we're as focused on that level of spending as we are of any level of spending in the company. So we do have challenging targets out there for the team but they're achievable.","But there's some timing elements that come in from quarter-to-quarter. So we do expect the back half to be a little richer in R&D. As far as block extensions, we extended the 737 by 200 units and then the 767. And then as far as booking rate changes, we saw an increase really kind of very slightly but across the board on all programs.","So good core performance, and again, I think the productivity focus we've had for the last number of years and continuing on that path and sharing of best practices across the entire company and leveraging that, at the same time getting out into the supply chain and taking these best practices out and allowing them to be more efficient and sharing the benefit of that on our overall program performances continues to be the objective. But there's a lot of focus and energy around it. Team's doing a great job but plenty more for us to do here.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Cai, just to reinforce Greg's last point there, that fundamental productivity machine, that's a relentless effort that we have the whole enterprise just focused on. And the longer-term goal we set to drive our business to mid teen margins and what you see in this quarter is another step of progress towards that longer-term goal and we expect to make sustained progress on margin expansion across all of our businesses.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you very much.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You're welcome.","Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.","Operator, we have time for one more analyst's question.","Operator","And that will be from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey. Good morning guys. Nice quarter.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good morning. Thanks, Carter.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Thanks, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Just a couple quick points of clarification if I can, Greg. On the unit profitability versus program, was that good 787 offsetting anything material in the other programs or did you have a contribution from any of the others in a positive sense? And then on BGS, I think you commented around favorable mix. Can you just help us, since BGS is new to all of us, understand what that means and what we should expect in mix terms?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, well maybe I'll start there. I mean as you know, this is a breadth of a portfolio and a lot of contracts, so you're going to see variability quarter-over-quarter, but like as Dennis just articulated, we've set objectives for ourselves to drive not only a top line but bottom line and margin overall productivity. So the team's getting their arms around. We've talked some of the backroom opportunities as we brought these two businesses together and really leveraging again some of the, I'll say kind of core operational aspects of the business at the same time grow the top line.","So you're going to see some variability in there, but net-net the objective is to continue to grow those margins and we think there's good opportunity to do that, at the same time deliver better value to our customers. So just kind of like I said watch quarter-over-quarter. You're going to see some variance and really that's just contract mix in there. But overall, expect margin expansion for that business.","On the program versus unit, obviously the biggest difference here from what we've talked prior quarters is we have no more 787 early builds. So it's a lot cleaner I'll say comparison when you look at unit versus program, and again you're seeing the fundamentals on the unit basis of improvement productivity taking place unit after unit and looking for further opportunity. And you saw that in the quarter. So a lot of the productivity initiatives that we've had in place, teams continuing to focus on them and chip away at them and obviously, they're impacting unit and therefore they're impacting the cash profile.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Is there anything material outside of the 787 program in either direction?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","No, not really, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analysts' question-and-answer session. I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Phil Musser, Senior Vice President of Communications. Please go ahead","Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.","Thank you. We'll continue now with media questions for Dennis and Greg. If you have questions following this part of the session, please contact the Media Relations team here in Chicago. Operator, we're ready for the first question. And in the interest of time, we'd ask you please that you limit your questions to just one. Thank you.","Operator","And first go to Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Oh, great. Dennis, I'm a youngest child. I well remember my sisters used to push me to the front in front of my parents to ask for something or break some bad news, so here we go. It's about 20 years since you announced plans for the China Completion Center, maybe not quite 20 years, but can you just give us an update on that? I mean, how long does it take to build a big shed? And when do you actually expect to start putting aircraft through there?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Doug. Good morning. Hey, to your question, yeah, we've been engaged in China for a long time, as you point out. The new delivery and finishing center that we're building in Zhoushan is underway, so site preparation has been initiated. Construction is under way. We're still driving towards a goal of beginning to have operational capability towards the end of this year. We're working very closely with our Chinese partners to drive that to closure. So we're in stride. We're on track to open that capability, and it will be something in the near term.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Hepher with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Tim Hepher - Reuters","Hi, Dennis. Can you hear me?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, got you, Tim. Good morning.","Tim Hepher - Reuters","Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much. You mentioned where you were talking about some of the various sanctions issues amongst the geopolitical problems. Of course, an important one is Iran, and that we understand is completely out of your hands. You've said very clearly you will follow U.S. policy. But presumably you must be planning what to do. You must have some contingency plans for the 15 777-300ERs that you were supposed to sell them. I believe, if I'm not mistaken, the first one was originally due to be delivered this month.","So have you had a chance to examine whether if that deal does collapse, you would have to cut 777 production further, bearing in mind that when you last adjusted production you said that your target incorporated the Iran order? And could you just tell us roughly how many aircraft would have been involved this year and next year? Thanks.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Tim, we're continuing to manage our overall 777 production skyline very effectively and understand the risks and implications around the Iranian aircraft deal. First and foremost, it's important again to restate that we continue to follow the U.S. government's lead here, and everything is being done per that process. We have no Iranian deliveries that are scheduled or part of the skyline this year, so those have been deferred again in line with the U.S. government process.","And I can tell you with confidence that we've continued to build risk mitigation into our 777 production plan. The plan that we outlined for you, the production rate that we've put in place is not dependent on the Iranian orders. If those orders do come to fruition, if we do ultimately deliver airplanes, those represent opportunities for us. Again, we're going to follow the U.S. government's lead and we've ensured that from a skyline management standpoint and from a production systems standpoint, we are not dependent on those aircraft.","And the good news is that the fundamental strength of the 777 product line and the increased sales volume that we're seeing in the marketplace both for 777-300ERs and for the 777 freighters has only bolstered our confidence in that line. And while we still have some work to do to fill out the remainder of the 777 bridge, we're steadily marching through that, and we think we're well positioned. So as I said earlier, the production system delivery plan, the skyline, the delivery rate that we've already announced we think represents a solid position for that program and we're on track to bridge to the 777X.","Operator","Next question is from Jacqueline Klimas with POLITICO. Please go ahead.","Jacqueline Klimas - POLITICO LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for doing this. I'm hoping you guys can talk a little bit about how or whether the administration's focus on space and the proposed budget increase in the space program is impacting Boeing's investment and prioritization of its space business segment.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Jacqueline. Good morning and thank you for the question there. We continue to see the space segment and human space flight in particular as one of our key investment areas going forward. We're encouraged by the administration's support and strong leadership on that topic. That includes funding for NASA programs, among those the Commercial Crew Program where we're marching through the milestones on our CST-100 Starliner, as well as support for the space launch system program and deep space exploration.","We do think strong and continued funding of those NASA programs is really important to our country, and that sustained funding and support that we're seeing from the administration is very encouraging. I also think the reinstitution of the National Space Council under Vice President Pence's leadership and guidance, along with President Trump, has been a very important step. We're encouraged by that as well. And we're continuing to invest in that area. We do see it as an important business segment for our future. And Boeing has had a leadership role in human space exploration since it was invented, and we continue to expect to lead in that field.","Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.","Great. Operator, we have time for one more question from media.","Operator","And that will be from Marcus Weisgerber with Defense One. Please go ahead.","Marcus Weisgerber - Government Media Executive Group LLC","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Dennis, about two years ago the narrative on St. Louis was pretty grim, mostly alluding to the end of fighter production. Now you have the President of the United States actually sitting in a Super Hornet. I was wondering if you can reflect kind of on the turnaround of the defense business in recent years and how politics and the recent budget deal is changing your outlook for the defense business. Thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Marcus, thanks for your question there. I'd say first of all, from a macro standpoint, again we're encouraged by the strength of the U.S. defense budget. And I think after several years of having to endure the damage of sequestration and a challenging defense budget, we're now seeing reemerging strength of that budget supported by both parties, and we're encouraged by the future year plans that we've seen. And that is something that has bolstered our expectations for our defense business going forward.","Now in particular to St. Louis, the support for individual programs there has been strong both domestically and internationally. Our weapons business, which is based there, has been strong and we're continuing to see growth there in a number of programs and our fighter business. And that includes F-15 international sales as well as upgrades to the F-15 fleet domestically. And perhaps most encouragingly is the progress we're seeing on the F-18 Super Hornet line. And I think it's a testament to the quality of the product.","You can hear our customers are very supportive. The U.S. Navy and what that airplane is doing for them every day in the fleet is important. And we have a great program that's producing capability that our customers need. And we're looking forward to continuing to grow that program going forward.","As you noted, a couple years ago, we had some questions about that production line. We can now see both the F-18 and the F-15 production lines extending far into next decade. And one good example of that is in the five-year future defense plan, we see a Navy request now for 110 new Super Hornets as well as the Service Life Extension Program for the existing Super Hornet fleet. So we're bullish about the fighter lines for the future.","Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, Dennis. That concludes our earnings call for today. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002 or contact us via e-mail.

[Operator instructions.] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019m turning the call over to Ms. Stephanie Pope, vice president of investor relations for the Boeing Company. Ms. Pope, please go ahead.","Stephanie Pope","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. I am Stephanie Pope and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer.","After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release, issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we may include in our discussions this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking disclaimers at the end of this web presentation.","In addition, we refer you to this morning\u2019s earnings release and to the presentations that accompany the webcast for disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we may use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I will turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","Jim McNerney","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning everybody. Let me start today by addressing the business environment, followed by some thoughts on our strong performance during the quarter, and then a few word covering my view of where we are at this point on the battery issue with the 787. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook, including the new non-GAAP measures we\u2019re introducing, which we believe will provide more insight into our underlying business performance.","Turning now to slide two, our view of the business environment remains positive overall, given our record backlog and our customers\u2019 continuing need for the efficient and value-creating products we provide. ","Passenger traffic remains resilient, despite limited global economic growth, and airlines continue to replace older airplanes in favor of new ones that provide compelling economics and increased fuel efficiency. We continue to monitor pressure in the air cargo market, with the expectation that conditions will begin to stabilize this year. ","In 2012, Boeing restored our market share leadership, and commercial airplane deliveries was 601 delivered, the most since 1999, and the second-most in commercial aviation history. On continued strong demand for our new airplanes, we also led the industry in net new orders, with 1,203, the second highest total in our company\u2019s history. Orders for our new 737 MAX were especially strong last year, and the program has surpassed 1,000 cumulative orders to date. ","Our commercial backlog of nearly 4,400 airplanes totals a record $319 billion, and reflects global customer preference for Boeing airplanes. Nearly two-thirds of our order book is with customers outside the U.S. and Europe, a major shift, as many of you know, from past cycles. In addition, demand continues to be split roughly equally by worldwide fleet growth and a healthy replacement cycle. Furthermore, with ongoing volatility in fuel prices, our customers continue to seek accelerated deliveries, while requests for deferrals and cancellations remain below historical levels. ","Turning to Defense, Space, & Security, while overall U.S. defense budget pressures persist, the United States nevertheless remains a substantial market for our products and services. We also continue to capture extensive growth opportunities in international defense markets, driven by increased regional security requirements and the modernization of aging platforms and systems.In 2012, international customers for defense space and security represented 24% of revenue and grew to 41% of our current backlog. \u00a0While notable alone for its size, the strength of our international defense backlog also comes from its diversity across our product and services portfolio and the wide geographic mix of its customer base.We continue to see strong demand for our offerings particularly in the Middle East, Brazil and the Asia Pacific region. \u00a0Our defense business also continues to maximize efficiencies and reduce infrastructure costs, further enhancing our competitive position.These aggressive affordability actions combined with our existing portfolio of proven reliable and affordable systems and services uniquely positions us among our competitors in this challenging budget environment.And while the threat of budget sequestration creates added uncertainty, unmanned systems, C4ISR, cyber security and international markets continue to offer a broad range of new opportunities.As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to focus at an enterprise level on our initiative to partner with suppliers to drive significant improvement in supply chain quality and flow and efficiency, to increase productivity at lower product and services costs for customers.Given the growth potential booked in our backlog and with pending new program decisions, we are offering supplier partners who step up to the challenge, a win-win opportunity to share in that growth and profit potential and earn work on future programs.We are taking a team oriented one (Boeing) approach to examine opportunities up and down the supply chain in design, production and support. \u00a0We are applying lessons learned on past programs sharing best practices and process expertise and where we find partners who can\u2019t, who won\u2019t step up to these objectives, we will recomplete the work or pull it back in-house if that\u2019s what provides the most value to our customers.We are pleased with the response from many of our partners at this early stage and the effort is already producing real savings.Moving on the Slide 3, 2012 was a year where we successfully achieved our plan for higher airplane production rates, improved execution on new programs and continued strengthening and repositioning the defense business.We reported strong revenue growth, sustained solid operating margins and generated significant cash flow. \u00a0These achievements, combined with the strength of our balance sheet, enabled us to announce in December a dividend increase of 10% and the resumption of our share repurchase program this quarter. \u00a0We delivered 165 commercial airplanes in the fourth quarter for a total, as I mentioned before, of 601 deliveries in 2012, which compares with 477 in 2011.For the quarter, we delivered 23 787s, reaching a total of 46 for the year. \u00a0On the 737 program, we had record deliveries of 105 in the quarter and 415 for the year.Revenue of commercial airplanes reached a record $49 billion with a healthy operating margin of 9.6%, a meaningful accomplishment in the face of dilution from the 787 and 747-8 deliveries.In 2012, we also successfully achieved five separate rate increases on our commercial airplane programs. \u00a0Other key accomplishments included delivering the 1000th 777, adding Boeing South Carolina to our commercial airplane production certificate and delivering the first three Charleston built 787s to Air India.Our success in standing up Charleston to expand our production capacity and geographically diversify our capabilities will be a competitive advantage for us going forward.We were also successful last year in more than doubling 787 production, increasing the rate from two airplanes per month to five per month. \u00a0The program remains on track to further increase the final assembly build rate to seven per month in mid 2013 and 10 per month by late 2013 with a subsequent increase in delivery rates naturally following that achievement as we move into 2014.Job one on the 787, however, is supporting the investigations underway on the two battery incidents that occurred earlier this month. \u00a0But while we are limited by the rules of the investigation on what we can say publically, let me assure you that\u2019s not always comfortable for us. Nonetheless, we rigorously support the process because it gets to the right answers the right way, and that is what has made air travel the safest form of transportation in the world.","We do believe good progress is being made in narrowing down the potential cause of the events. We have assigned hundreds of experts from across Boeing, brought in experts from outside, and are working around the clock with the NTSB, JTSB, and the FAA to identify the problem and develop any corrective action that may be needed to get the airplanes safely back into the air and to resume deliveries to customers.","We deeply regret the impact this situation is having on our customers. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the flight crews and passengers who fly our airplanes. We will get to the bottom of this, and in so doing we will restore confidence in the 787 and Boeing.","I want to personally thank all the Boeing engineers, scientists, and other experts, along with the various government agencies for their tireless efforts over the past few weeks. As we work through these events, it is important to reiterate that 787 production continues as planned, and we remain confident in the future of the program and the integrity, safety, and performance of the airplane.","We look forward to returning the airplane into service and our customers are looking forward to that as well, because of the compelling business case it represents for them. They chose the 787 for its game-changing fuel efficiency, its superior operating economics, its unparalleled passenger experience, and the lower noise and emissions it means for communities. We\u2019ve seen the airplane in service for 15 months, and we know it delivers on those promises, and I am confident it will continue to serve our customers well for decades to come. ","Progress on the 787-9 continues as we near the end of the engineering and design phase. Early-stage assembly is underway, and final-stage assembly is still expected to begin in mid-2013. As we\u2019ve discussed, and consistent with previous introductions of new minor models, we have planned a period of longer production flow times across the extended supply chain for the first few 787-9 airplanes. This will accommodate learning and ensure that we minimize disruption while still achieving our planned rate increases. First customer delivery remains on schedule in early 2014.","The 747-8 is producing at two airplanes per month, with 10 deliveries in the fourth quarter and 31 for the year. Customer satisfaction with the airplane\u2019s performance remains high, as it has set a new industry standard for efficiency. We remain focused on improving production processes and program profitability while closely monitoring the softness in the cargo market. ","Our core commercial airplane production programs, the 737 and the 777, continue to create tremendous value and growth. The 737 production rate will increase to 38 per month in the second quarter of this year and then move up to 42 per month in the first half of 2014. The 777 program successfully completed its increase in production rate to 8.3 per month. The 737 MAX development is tracking to plan, with firm configuration expected mid-year and entry into service in 2017. ","Progress on our wide body development efforts continues along the disciplined, gated process we\u2019ve put in place based on lessons learned from the 787 and other past programs. More specifically, the case for the 787-10 airplane has strengthened based on our recent discussions with customers in anticipation of potential launch this year. ","We are also making good progress assessing customer requirements for improvements in the market-leading 777 to ensure this signature twin-aisle franchise maintains its advantage over competing products for years to come. We continue to strengthen and mature the business case. However, we have more work to do, and that\u2019s a big part of what we\u2019ll be focused on in the months ahead.","Defense, Space, & Security generated revenue of $8.3 billion in the fourth quarter, delivering 34 aircraft and one satellite. Despite the challenging environment, revenues for the year increased 2% on 144 aircraft and 10 satellites delivered, including significant increases in production of Apache and Chinook helicopters. ","We captured several important awards during the quarter, including a contract to upgrade 68 international F-15s, a contract for work on the space launch system, and a C-17 sustainment contract. Among the many noteworthy program milestones achieved during the quarter were delivery of the first P8I to the Indian Navy, initial production on the KC45 refueling boom, completion of the preliminary design review for the space launch system core stage and delivery of the final design for (AEW&C) winch tip.In summary, 2012 was a very strong year for Boeing with higher revenues and core earnings as well as outstanding cash generation. \u00a0We achieved significant milestones in both businesses, continued to successful execute on production and development programs that are important to our customers and our team\u2019s relentless attention to productivity enabled continued investment in our future, all of which sets the stage for further growth and sustained business performance for customers and shareholders in the years ahead.Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg to discuss our financial results and our 2013 outlook. \u00a0Greg?Greg SmithThanks, Jim, and good morning. \u00a0Before we review our financial results, I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to discuss the details of our new approach for providing enhanced visibility into our core operating performance of the company. \u00a0We can now move to Slide 4.As we discussed during our third quarter call, the continued decline in the pension discount rates driven by the unprecedented low interest rate environment has caused a significant non-cash increase in our pension expense, which is unrelated to our underlying operating performance.While we continue to focus on managing and reducing our overall pension liability in an effort to provide better transparency into the core operating results from our businesses going forward, we have decided to introduce new non-GAAP measures.Consistent with how other companies have addressed this, these measures will exclude certain components of pension and post-retirement benefit expense that we believe are not reflective of the underlying business performance but are driven by financial market volatility.We refer to these new measures as core operating earnings and core earnings per share. \u00a0Again, consistent with how several other commercial companies have addressed pension expense, the operating pension expense in our commercial airplane business will include both current and prior service costs related to pension benefits earned by our employees.In our defense business, we will continue to include pension costs determined under cost accounting standards, which are allowable under government contracts. \u00a0Let\u2019s look at the details on Slide 5.You will see the walk from our GAAP earnings to our non-GAAP earnings measure for the fourth quarter and full-year results with, again, the difference being cost associated with market volatility and unrelated to our underlying operating performance.Again, we believe this enhanced reporting provides improved transparency into the core performance of our company. \u00a0With that said, now let\u2019s move to our full-year results on Slide 6.Revenue for the year was $81.7 billion reflecting growth of 19% from last year driven by higher deliveries across commercial and defense businesses. \u00a0Core earnings per share for the year was $5.88 representing a 12% increase when we exclude the 2011 favorable tax settlement.This increase was driven by continued strong operational performance from both of our businesses.Operating cash flow was very strong at $9.1 billion before $1.6 billion in discretionary pension contributions made in the year. \u00a0The strong operating cash flow in 2012 was largely driven by the higher deliveries at both commercial airplanes and defense business, strong defense orders in the year and effective working capital management across the business.Moving now to our quarterly results on Slide 7, for the fourth quarter, revenue increased 14% to $22.3 billion reflecting the robust growth in commercial airplane deliveries which more than offset the expected revenue in our defense business.The company reported strong operational performance in the quarter with core operating earnings per share of $1.46, a 4% increase excluding the favorable $0.52 tax settlement in 2011. \u00a0Let\u2019s discuss commercial airplanes now on Slide 8.For the fourth quarter, our commercial airplanes business reported revenue of $14.2 billion, up 32% from the prior year and strong operating margins of 8.9% on deliveries of 165 airplanes.Boeing commercial airplanes revenue for the year was a record $41.9 billion, up 36% from last year driven by our successful execution on planned production rate increases, which contributed to a total of 601 deliveries in 2012. ","Operating performance from our 777 and 737 programs and our services business helped offset margin dilution from our planned increase in 787 fleet support for airplane deliveries to new customers and higher 787 and 747-8 deliveries. This strong operating performance is a testament to the focus and determination of our teams as they continue to execute and drive productivity and profitability on our airplane programs. ","Gross inventory for the company included $25.5 billion related to the 787 program, an increase in the fourth quarter of approximately $700 million. This is driven by the planned increase in production rates on the program, partially offset by the increased deliveries. ","Included in the work in process inventory are the deferred production costs. The deferred balance for the program was $15.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and includes approximately 46 airplanes still in process. Commercial airplanes captured $26 billion of orders during the quarter, and increased backlog to a record $319 billion. ","Turning now to Defense, Space, & Security results on slide nine, our defense business generated $8.3 billion of revenue during the fourth quarter, with strong operating margins of 9%. For the full year, Boeing Defense, Space, & Security reported sales of $32.6 billion, a 2% increase from the prior year driven largely by higher P-8 and Apache deliveries and growth in our service and support business. International customers accounted for 24% of our defense revenue in 2012. ","Aircraft deliveries increased to 34 in the quarter, and were 144 for the full year. Operating margins for the year were 9.4%. Ongoing affordability efforts at our defense business further reduced our cost structure, allowing the business to continue to be more competitive in this challenging environment. Our focus on market-based affordability efforts will continue into 2013.","Boeing Military Aircraft revenue was $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a 5% increase, driven by higher volume on U.S. Air Force Tanker and deliveries of P-8. Operating margins of 8.1% was primarily driven by delivery mix. ","Network Space Systems reported $1.9 billion in revenue. Operating margins of 6.2% reflect lower earnings versus fourth quarter 2011, due to lower margin on our ground-based mid-course defense contract and favorable contract settlements on several satellite programs in 2011.","Global Services & Support had fourth quarter revenues of $2.3 billion, primarily driven by lower volume on the C-17 sustainment contract. Operating margins improved in the quarter to 13.1%, reflecting strong performance in integrated logistics.","Defense, Space & Security maintained a solid backlog of $71 billion, reflecting more than two times current revenue. International business remains very strong, with approximately 41% of our current defense backlog representing sales to customers outside the United States.","If we could now turn to slide 10, Boeing Capital generated $116 million in revenue during the quarter. The portfolio balance remains steady at $4.1 billion. Unallocated expense for the core operations of $200 million was relatively stable compared to prior quarter.","Moving now to cash flow, on slide 11, as I mentioned earlier, we had very strong operating cash flow in 2012. The $9.1 billion of operating cash generated by the businesses was driven by higher deliveries of both commercial and defense, strong core operating performance in both the businesses, and timing of international business captured at our defense business in 2012.","Moving now to cash and debt balances on slide 12, we ended the year with $13.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. Debt levels were down during the quarter on scheduled debt maturities, and as Jim indicated, based on our strong liquidity, continued cash management, and increased confidence in our backlog and production plans, in December we increased our dividend 10% and announced our plan to resume share repurchase in 2013. We expect to spend about $1.5 billion to $2 billion on repurchases in 2013.","Moving now to slide 13, to discuss our outlook, our guidance for 2013 again reflects solid core operating performance in our businesses, higher volumes at commercial airplanes, and the impact of the current DOD environment. In addition, our guidance assumes no significant financial impact resulting from the FAA directive on the 787 program. If this assumption changes after we have gained greater fidelity, we will let you know.Revenue for 2013 is forecasted to increase between $82 billion and $85 billion, largely reflecting, again, higher commercial airplane deliveries and continued challenging DOD environment.Core EPS guidance is set to be between $6.10 and $6.30 a share, representing approximately 5% growth driven by continued strong execution across our businesses. \u00a0We expect first quarter core EPS and cash flow to be the lowest during the year based on timing of deliveries and phasing of expenditures.The 2013 commercial delivery forecast is between 635 and 645 airplanes. \u00a0This includes greater than 60 deliveries for the 787, which takes into account our planned increase in build rate and additional production flow time provided throughout our factory and across our supply chain that will minimize disruption as we introduce the new 787-9.We\u2019ve also forecasted fewer deliveries from our Everett Modification Center as we begin to work on earlier produced airplanes that require significantly more work than the change (in corp) airplanes we delivered in 2012.Our commercial airplane revenue guidance is between $51 billion and $53 billion, reflecting approximately 6% growth as we continue to execute on our record backlog. \u00a0We expect commercial airplane operating margins to be approximately 9.5% in 2013, resulting from higher deliveries and continued strong core operating performance while considering for some dilution on 87 and 747 deliveries and further investments in the future growth of our business.Defense space and security revenue guidance for 2013 is between $30.5 billion and $31.5 billion, reflecting healthy international growth that is offset by the continued challenging DOD environment.Operating margin guidance in our defense business is forecasted to be greater than 9%. \u00a0This reflects continued strong performance and execution of our market-based affordability strategy, which has already yielded over $2 billion in savings since 2010.Turning to cash flow, we expect operating cash flow before pension contributions to be greater than $8 billion, reflecting again higher delivery volume and continued strong performance.Our 2013 cash generation also reflects the timing impacts of receipts and expenditures that contributed to the strong results in fourth quarter 2012.While required pension funding is minimal in 2013, we plan to make discretionary pension contributions of approximately $1.5 billion.Overall, 2012 performance continued to deliver strong operating results as we remained focused on program execution, successful production rate increases at commercial airplanes and ongoing productivity and profitability improvements in both commercial and defense business.We expect this performance and focus to continue into 2013. \u00a0Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim for some final thoughts.Jim McNerneyThank you, Greg. \u00a02012 was a year of disciplined execution and delivering on our commitments to our customers and our shareholders. \u00a0For 2013, our first order of business obviously is getting the 787 back into service.Our standing priorities for the year are to continue converting our record backlog into growth while delivering strong core operating performance and investing in our products, technologies and people to sustain our growth and competitiveness for decades to come.Our priorities going forward are clear: successful and profitable ramp up and production of our commercial airplane programs, executing our commercial and defense development programs well, driving productivity and affordability throughout the enterprise and continued strengthening and repositioning our defense business with investments in growth areas and further international expansion.As we move a year closer to our centennial in 2016, I believe we have the products, services, people and technologies to enter our second century in aerospace a bigger, better and stronger Boeing than we have ever been. \u00a0Now we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And first we\u2019ll go to Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford Bernstein ","I know you can\u2019t go into detail related to the recent battery incidents while the investigations are underway, but if you think hypothetically, if we were to see an extended delay in deliveries for, say, six months, I\u2019m interested in how you would think about the impact on your plans in two areas. One, what would make you consider reducing production rates for the 787, and then also, how might this affect the availability of engineering resources for other programs, such as the MAX and the 777-8X\/9X?","Jim McNerney","Well, Doug, you\u2019ve presented a highly hypothetical situation that\u2019s very difficult for me to comment on. I can\u2019t predict an outcome, and I\u2019m not going to. We\u2019re in the middle of an investigation. We\u2019re making progress in the investigation. We have got every expert in the world looking at this issue. We are working with the regulatory agencies productively, and for me to predict an outcome, or to sort of drive any kind of a hypothetical follow-on set of actions off a hypothetical is just not someplace I could go. ","And so our plan, as you know, is to continue production of the 787, and to continue the development of the wide body airplanes we\u2019ve told you about. And we\u2019re continuing to do that.  ","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford Bernstein ","Well, if you look at it just from the standpoint of engineering resources, I\u2019m assuming this is a priority effort. It\u2019s taking probably more resources than you would normally expend. Is that impacting what you\u2019re doing on the other programs, on the other development efforts? ","Jim McNerney","No. It isn\u2019t. This is a highly compartmentalized issue. We have a deep supply chain with expertise, and we have deep expertise within Boeing. I mean, we\u2019re bringing people from all around Boeing to help look at this. And because of the specialized nature of the technology and of the investigation, it\u2019s not drawing from any critical resources on any other growth programs we\u2019ve got.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Jim, attempting not to ask you about the investigation, since we know you can\u2019t comment there, but could you talk a little bit about the parallel paths that Boeing might be pursuing here, ranging from perhaps a modest software or procedural solution against a battery replacement or a more complex electrical system change? ","And then Greg, perhaps could you give us some sense on the numbers the relative probability of those various paths and cost that they would represent, especially given the fact that the media has really highlighted or perhaps characterized a very high cost to this thing at this point. And I\u2019m wondering if you could clarify that. ","Jim McNerney","Well, I think my answer to Doug\u2019s second question sort of puts a dimension around the drain on resources, which is not significant. Look, I cannot talk about any of the specific paths of investigation, but I can assure that there is a comprehensive root cause analysis and related series of technical efforts that I am confident will identify the root cause of these incidents. And so confidence in the process, confidence in the right resources, confidence that it\u2019s not distracting to the balance of Boeing, and when we know the answer, we\u2019ll know the answer, and we\u2019ll act on it. And again, as much as it frustrates me, it also frustrates you. I really can\u2019t comment on the specifics at this stage. ","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Well, perhaps then I could ask this question, which is somewhat unrelated. But can you at least reconcile the 787 delivery plan of just more than 60 with your rate plan and your production numbers for the year, since those should be different. \u00a0I know you touched on it earlier, but \u2026Jim McNerneyWhat I would say is that the guidance we\u2019ve given you is unimpacted by anything we might have to do with the battery.Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit SuisseIt\u2019s not a battery question. \u00a0It\u2019s just you\u2019re going to deliver 60 but you\u2019re going to build on an average, we think it\u2019s six per month to stay on plan. \u00a0And understanding your layering in -9, is production roughly 72 airplanes?Greg SmithSo, Rob, as Jim noted earlier, we\u2019re going to continue to produce obviously planning on making the rate bakes that are planned throughout this year. \u00a0And the differentiators doing the math are really two things.One is the EMCs. \u00a0And as I talked about in my opening remarks, we had fewer EMC deliveries in 2013 because these airplanes require more work than the ones in 2012 and it\u2019s about 15% of about 60 that we expect for the full year. \u00a0That\u2019s one element.The second element of that as \u00a0you noted is the -9. \u00a0So as we bring the -9 into production, just like every other derivative program we\u2019ve had, we have longer flows associated with that product as we come down the learning curve.So that is happening throughout the year. \u00a0But at the end of the year, the plan is the production system will be operating at 10 per month.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan.Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorganCould you speak to the cash flow a little bit in the fourth quarter and then the outlook for 2013? \u00a0It\u2019s very strong in the quarter and relative to your guidance and I think all of us were expecting. \u00a0So what really came in in the fourth quarter that you weren\u2019t expecting? \u00a0I imagine you\u2019re going to say it\u2019s a little bit of pull forward from 2013.But if you build a bridge from \u201912 to \u201913, what would you alert us to in terms of the headwinds?Jim McNerneyYes, I think, Joe, as you said, there\u2019s some pull forward there and we\u2019ve been very actively managing our cash management process throughout the business, both of the businesses.And Q4 was a lot of that as well as, as you know, higher deliveries. \u00a0As we go into \u201913, that discipline is going to continue with the ramp up in commercial and continued focus on cash generation, so I think to your point when you pull the two years together you can see very strong cash flow.Looking forward, as I\u2019ve talked about, as you see us breaking rate and increasing our volume at commercial, we expect the cash flow to continue with that. \u00a0So it\u2019s just a combination of timing and discipline on overall cash management.Joe Nadol - JPMorganYou guys have been very conservative in the past couple years in terms of your cash flow guidance. \u00a0As I look at this number, it\u2019s not half bad considering what you saw in the fourth quarter and any pull forwards.But that\u2019s only tied to 60 aircraft roughly, 60 deliveries of the 87, so can I extrapolate a little bit and say there\u2019s upside to it not only from your conservatism but also if you deliver more than that 60?Jim McNerneyWell, if you deliver more than 60, certainly, but the rate where we are today at about 60 is our plan and I think it\u2019s prudent considering where we are. \u00a0But it\u2019s a day-to-day focus on cash management as it has been and we\u2019re going to continue that into 2013.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company.Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and CompanySo in the past \u2013 and I\u2019m thinking about the DC10 crashes \u2013 the FAA\u2019s approach to situations like this has been that once the problem is identified \u2013 and in most cases then you could avoid recurrence of the problem by some procedural changes and maintenance \u2013 the FFA has allowed the plane to continue with those procedural changes while at the same time the manufacturer, in this case McDonald, made design changes \u2013 I\u2019m thinking of the cargo door \u2013 so that basically the planes can get back into service and the root cause of the problem in the first place can be dealt with.Is there any reason to think that the FAA\u2019s approach is going to change on the 787?Jim McNerneyCai, I think our assumption here is that we\u2019re going to understand root cause side by side with the regulatory agencies. \u00a0That is the main series of efforts right now. \u00a0I don\u2019t want to prejudge what form of service will be specifically acceptable to them. That\u2019s their call. The two incidents are very different. I think you could understand the magnitude of what happened then, and the magnitude of the incident here. But that doesn\u2019t lead me to conclude, or to pre-judge, what is exactly going to happen. I think we all want to understand root cause here, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. ","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Thank you. And second question, if I look at your guidance, you\u2019re basically saying you\u2019re going to deliver nine planes out of EMC, and I believe you said you had 46 in process, of which I would assume 35 or 40 are EMC, because you\u2019re building at five a month? Why don\u2019t we get more planes out of EMC? Or is it going to take until 2015 or 2016 until all these early 787s get delivered?","Jim McNerney","As I said earlier, the planes that are expected to deliver this year do have significantly more work than the 2012 airplanes we delivered, so that\u2019s why there\u2019s this longer flow. So we\u2019re not able to deliver 32 like we did in 2012. Looking forward, as I\u2019ve said before, right now the plan is to have them complete by 2015, all airplanes out of EMC. We\u2019re certainly working to pull that to the left as much as we can, but that\u2019s the current plan that we have in front of us.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","But how does it square? If you\u2019ve got 35 or 40 planes to go, the only way those numbers work is if you increase deliveries. ","Jim McNerney","We don\u2019t have 35-40 airplanes to go. That\u2019s where I think we\u2019re seeing a difference there.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Okay. Well, I mean if you have 46 in process, what is left to go of EMC?","Jim McNerney","46 is work in process throughout the factory.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch","Maybe changing gears a little bit, because it seems like you can\u2019t say too much about the ongoing investigation, but jumping on to other product development, so maybe one big question, but how\u2019s it going with the 737 MAX? What should we think about 787-10, when that might happen? You alluded to maybe the second half of the year? ","And then three, and most importantly, the 777-X, or whatever you want to call it, I guess one, timing on that, given A350 seems to have gotten some orders, and two - and this is a question that I think Jim we brought up when we visited in Chicago - is it\u2019s a 20-year-old airplane. So how do you incrementally evolve a 20-year-old airplane, as opposed to 787-10, which is a clearer derivative of existing new technology? ","Greg Smith","I\u2019ll try and get all that. The MAX development is going very well. I think we are hitting all benchmarks at or slightly in advance of schedule. Our engine partner, Snecma, and GE, [unintelligible], are hitting their benchmarks, so our confidence is growing every day that we will deliver that airplane, not only on time, but at the performance and productivity levels at least that we\u2019ve promised. So we\u2019re feeling very good about that.","I think the -10, as you know, we have been conditionally offering the airplane in the marketplace and the response has been very strong. And so that is less of a technical challenge in the sense of there\u2019s not as much technical scope to that airplane, so our confidence is growing daily that that airplane is going to be a winner at a price and value equation that makes sense for both Boeing and their customers. So I don\u2019t want to prejudge when we might reach a final launch decision, but good progress toward that. Very good progress toward that. ","777-X, it is 20 years old. Hard to believe. But we are focused on a technical solution that offers significant performance advantages to an already market-leading airplane. I think it\u2019s been widely discussed that the most likely design is some increased capacity and a composite wing with new engines and some other additional work that is not too large in scope.But the \u2013 that airplane has eye watering kinds of performance associated with it. \u00a0We\u2019re just trying to put final touches on \u2013 final touches. \u00a0We\u2019re trying to get the business plan to where we need it to be and then we will conditionally offer it to customers.And we\u2019re getting close to that situation, so as you march down those three developments, moving in every real way that you can think of toward a successful launch on the max, getting very close on the -10 and getting close to offerability on the 777X.And all of those airplanes are going to have the kinds of performance capabilities that I think is going to keep us in the market share lead for a long period of time.Ronald J. Epstein \u2013 BofA Merrill LynchAnd on that 777X, just the same question, how do you think about \u2013 I mean, a new composite wing on a wide body airplane, that\u2019s not limited. \u00a0By no definition is that a limited development program. \u00a0That\u2019s pretty chunky. \u00a0So how do you think about that?Jim McNerneyWell, the implication being that it is a significant development, not just \u2026Ronald J. Epstein \u2013 BofA Merrill LynchYes, reengineering, (inaudible) classified is easy \u2013 it\u2019s not really but sort of easy but they\u2019re wings. \u00a0There\u2019s nothing easy about that.Jim McNerneyWell, this will be \u2013 you are correct. \u00a0This as derivatives go, will be a significant amount of work. \u00a0The confidence that we\u2019ve got \u2013 this will be the third, depending how you count, the third or fourth generation composite air foil we\u2019ve build, so our confidence is growing that we know what we\u2019re doing with a composite wing and this will be one heck of a composite wing.You\u2019re right. \u00a0It\u2019s at a scale that\u2019s different than what we\u2019ve done before, so it\u2019s not without challenges. \u00a0But the advantage we have in using composites for air foils and other aerospace applications is something I don\u2019t want to give up on and I think it\u2019s an advantage that you\u2019re going to see us continue to press in a lot of different ways. \u00a0And this may be a great example of that.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays.Carter Copeland \u2013 BarclaysJust a clarification on your earlier points about the 787 deliveries, what will we outwardly see as these longer flows come through for the nine during the year? \u00a0I\u2019m just trying to get my arms around the cadence of deliveries relative to your prior comments.And then also, I wanted to ask, Greg, about pension since you\u2019ve got the introduction of this core EPS, which calls this out as this non-operational and related to financial markets.Despite the fact that discount rates are obviously at unprecedented low levels and required funding is low in the near term, you\u2019ve still got a very sizeable liability to address there. \u00a0So I wondered if you might tell me how you guys are thinking about addressing it long term and also with the introduction of this core operating earnings metric, will that change in any way the incentive structures accordingly within the operating units?Greg SmithThe answer to that question is no. \u00a0Let me go back to your first question on the flow. \u00a0So the -9 really goes throughout the year, Carter, so it\u2019s not, I wouldn\u2019t say, lumpy. \u00a0It gets feathered in throughout the year, primarily really through second quarter to fourth quarter.And like I said earlier, this is very similar to 777 as an example when we introduced derivative models and we put that additional flow in there, so it\u2019s a good comparison to how we performed prior with some improvements in there.So as we come down that learning curve, we\u2019ll reduce the flow time on those units in production as the supply chain has and then we\u2019ll get again to the full rate of 10 per month by the end of the year.So we\u2019ve got a, I think, very good plan in place based on facts and data of how we\u2019ve performed prior along with some productivity improvements and I should also note a lot of the supply chain is already at seven a month, has -9 components in their factories and is making good progress there.With regards to liabilities, it continues to be a primary focus for us. As you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve taken action in various areas, in particular around our investment strategy, and revised that a number of years ago, that match our liability much better, and I think that\u2019s proven well for us. On the benefit side, salaried individuals, as you know, in 2009 went from, new hires, from a DB to a DC. So we\u2019re continuing to make progress in that area, but this measure, by no means, takes focus off of the liability.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Samuel J. Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. ","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","If I could change gears from the 87 to just the 47, if I just look at that, it seems like for a wide body airplane, it\u2019s going to take a lot longer in terms of configuration.

We are mindful that there is softness in the cargo market. So we are getting volume the old fashioned way on this program right now, which is finding customers, working with them.

Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","And actually just on a follow up, if you can help in terms of the increase in the deferred production on a per-unit basis, where it moved back up. Is that all -9 related, and if we took out the -9 would we have continued to see that path down on the -8s?","Greg Smith","Yeah, you would have. It\u2019s predominantly -9, and then increased rates, as I said, some of the supply chain actually broke rate earlier than planned. But primarily -9.","Stephanie Pope","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","And that will be from Howard Rubel with Jeffries. Please go ahead. ","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company","I want to go back to talk just for a moment about production efficiencies on the 78. Jim, what are you seeing, and could you talk about quality and final delivery, and some of the other metrics that you\u2019ve posted us on before? And also, while you\u2019re at it, prior to this event can you talk a little bit about what the operating performance of the airplane has been in terms of reliability and sort of fuel burn, and some of the other efficiency measures?","Jim McNerney","Yeah, I think the quick answer would be every operating metric that I think you would be contemplating with your question - quality metric, jobs behind schedule, open jobs, [travel to] work, those kinds of things that are indirect measures of quality and delivery - are all improving significantly and at the rate that we anticipated in our learning curve. So we\u2019re feeling very good about that. ","A subset of that would be Charleston. Charleston, I would say, ahead of most of the metrics that we\u2019d planned on down there, and a terrific job by the team of standing that up. I think in terms of in-service, the second part of your question, the in-service numbers as reported by our customers, which is the acid test, have been at or better than we had promised them.","I think the in-service, whether it\u2019s fuel efficiency or whether it\u2019s range, or whether it\u2019s the kind of cabin experience that we wanted them to be able to provide to their customers, early dispatch reliability, were all sort of on par with either experience we\u2019d had introducing new airplanes. ","And in the case of dispatch reliability, or as we\u2019d promised in terms of fuel burn and we haven\u2019t fully gone through the whole maintenance equation, so it\u2019s tough predict that. And they\u2019re the ones to ask. Most customers would say that the experience has been as promised. Now we\u2019re working the battery issue. ","OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. \u00a0(Operator Instructions). \u00a0I\u2019ll now return you to the Boeing company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporation Communication. \u00a0Mr. Downey, please go ahead.Tom DowneyThank you. \u00a0We will continue with the questions for Jim and Greg. \u00a0If you have any questions after the session ends, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002. \u00a0Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question and in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question, please.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Josh Freed \u2013 Associated Press.Josh Freed \u2013 Associated PressCan you give a number on how many of the 787 batteries have been returned at this point and then more broadly whether that system, aside from the recent events, was a system up until January behaving in line with your expectations?Jim McNerneyI don\u2019t have an exact number on how many batteries have been replaced. \u00a0What I do know is batteries are replaced on our airplanes every day, every type of battery, including these batteries.What we do know is that the replacement cycle that we\u2019ve been experiencing there has been for maintenance reasons. \u00a0There\u2019s been no incident that we\u2019re aware of where a battery\u2019s been replaced due to any kind of safety concerns, so it\u2019s \u2013 what we\u2019ve seen is replacement which is not uncommon.It\u2019s a replaceable unit designed to be replaced and a matter of routine maintenance rather than any safety concerns. \u00a0That\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned.Josh Freed \u2013 Associated PressBut have those replacements been at the rate that you predicted?Jim McNerneySlightly higher.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Al Scott \u2013 Reuters.Al Scott \u2013 ReutersI\u2019m just curious, you said no impact from the work on the 787 on other programs. \u00a0But I\u2019m wondering what impact on the investigation the broader FAA review and finding a solution would come if there was a strike by (SPEA) engineers, which seems at least possible next month.Jim McNerneyThat is hard to predict. \u00a0Again, it\u2019s a very hypothetical situation. \u00a0I don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re all very hopeful that our discussions with (SPEA) will not come to that.But I think we\u2019re going to have enough experts available to keep looking at this issue if it goes that far because there is a two or three-week cycle time now where \u2013 and we could be discussing far longer things beyond that with (SPEA), so that\u2019s a hypothetical question that hasn\u2019t presented itself as a real issue yet.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jon Ostrower \u2013 Wall Street Journal.Jon Ostrower \u2013 Wall Street JournalProduction of the 787-9 is now at a pretty advanced stage, so it\u2019s a very real airplane at this point. \u00a0What provisions do you guys have, if any, to protect the flight test and delivery schedule if any design battery electrical changes are required at this point?Jim McNerneyWell, again, Jon, we can\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t want to \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make much sense for us to speculate on the battery and its impact on anything because we\u2019re working through it right now and we\u2019re making progress. \u00a0And when we learn something, we\u2019ll be working with the regulatory agencies to implement anything fixes, if any.Jon Ostrower \u2013 Wall Street JournalAnd beyond any kind of speculation about the cause of your \u2013 looking back on the supply chain as a whole, it was designed to be more flexible in terms of specifying a rate. \u00a0Are you at a point now where you\u2019re looking at the supply chain? \u00a0Are you concerned at all that the 787 supply chain is actually more rigid than you had originally planned in terms of being able to be more flexible in the rate if you needed to add a bit of buffer there for any design changes so you don\u2019t build up a huge inventory that requires major rework later on?Jim McNerneyWell, we obviously have some bugger in our planning. \u00a0I think, for example, the -9 is a plan that has a lot of unique parts when compared to the -8, which is why you do want to build a little buffer, you do want to give the people on the lines some experience with assembling the airplane in a slightly different way with different parts and different ways to fasten things together, and so that\u2019s generally part of our planning. And so it anticipates some of that, and some of that obviously does happen. And we think we\u2019ve got it in hand. ","Jon Ostrower \u2013 Wall Street Journal","And how do you think about that for the -8? How do you think about that same challenge for the -8, which is already dominating the overwhelming production of units coming through the factory? ","Greg Smith","Are you talking about the robustness of the supply chain? The plane\u2019s largely designed. And it\u2019s flowing. So we\u2019re beyond the place, in general, where a major redesign is going to cause disruptions in the supply chain. I think it tends to be more of an issue during the development phase of an airplane.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Phil Lebeau with CNBC. Please go ahead. ","Phil Lebeau - CNBC","Is there any consideration of ditching the lithium ion battery in terms of using it in the Dreamliner? Or are you committed to sticking with the lithium ion batteries? ","Greg Smith","Nothing we\u2019ve learned has told us yet that we have made the wrong choice on the battery technology. We feel good about the battery technology, and its fit for the airplane. We\u2019ve just got to get to the root cause of these incidents, and we\u2019ll take a look at the data as it unfolds. But there\u2019s nothing we\u2019ve learned that causes us to question that decision at this stage.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Dominic Gates with the Seattle Times. Please go ahead. ","Dominic Gates - Seattle Times","I\u2019ve got a question about the supply chain, and I\u2019d like to focus on the electrical system. Not on the battery, but on the entire electrical system. You mentioned earlier your initiative to squeeze out costs throughout the supply chain. And I want to ask, first of all, does that put a lot of pressure on your suppliers? Does it worry you that costs will be cut, and quality might suffer?","And also, how does your supplier management organization keep tabs, specifically, on all the electrical system components when your suppliers have such autonomy and have so many far-flung subcontractors?","Greg Smith","I\u2019ll try to get to all elements of your question here. We have done a lot to increase the visibility down through our supply chain, of their bill of materials, as they\u2019re working it. And we\u2019ve made significant progress there. So we tend to have far better knowledge when bottlenecks are coming, when there are supply and quality issues, and so I have confidence we\u2019re making progress there.","What was the first part of your question? ","Dominic Gates - Seattle Times","Whether the initiative to squeeze out costs may have consequences for quality. ","Greg Smith","Yeah. Listen, I can understand where that question comes from. I see it just the opposite, quite frankly. My view is, we want to work more efficiently with suppliers, reduce cycle time, which generally increases quality in almost every case I\u2019ve been involved in, share business processes, as opposed to throwing things across fences to each other. And so it is not a cost-squeeze initiative. It is an improve process initiative, and costs will come out of it. And the people that are willing to make that investment in process improvement are the ones we want to do business with. And so the objective is to increase quality through improved process, and as a result, reduce cost. That\u2019s the objective.","Dominic Gates - Seattle Times","A follow up on your first answer. For example, obviously after the incidents with the battery, people have gone into the factory in Japan, the Yuasa factory, to look at their quality control. But before all this happened, before the two incidents that have grounded the airplanes, how much had Boeing people, in your supplier organization, gone into Yuasa? Or was that left to [unintelligible]? ","Greg Smith","We have no idea, yet, even though we\u2019re making good progress, and we\u2019re narrowing down the things that could have gone wrong. We don\u2019t have root cause yet. So it\u2019s very hard to speculate on anybody, anybody\u2019s role in these incidents. As to our quality flow-down through our supply chain, we have very robust processes that do that. And if we miss something along the way, we\u2019re going to fix it. But we do, of course, rely on our partners but we also expect them to pursue a quality process that we\u2019ve all agreed to and we do monitor it.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Susanna Ray \u2013 Bloomberg News.Susanna Ray \u2013 Bloomberg NewsI\u2019m wondering what impact this whole situation has had on Boeing\u2019s relations with the Japanese carriers and suppliers there. \u00a0I know that the whole system has been very loyal to Boeing, so I\u2019m just wondering what kind of impact this has had.Jim McNerneyI think I would characterize it more as a group of customers and technology providers that have worked together for many decades. \u00a0We\u2019re all concerned. \u00a0We want to get to the bottom of this quickly but I would characterize it more as pulling together to solve the problem.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mecham \u2013 Aviation Week.Mike Mecham \u2013 Aviation WeekCan you tell me what instructions you may have given your 787 supply chain to either slow down their deliveries or get rate for slow down? \u00a0Is the flow continuing as normal or have you had to adjust that flow because of the delivery stop?Jim McNerneyNo instructions to slow down, business as usual. \u00a0Let\u2019s keep building airplanes. \u00a0And then let\u2019s ramp up as we planned.OperatorYour last question comes from the line of John McDermott \u2013 The Post and Courier.John McDermott \u2013 The Post and CourierCan you tell me \u2013 you had mentioned that the 787 plant here in Charleston is outperforming the metrics you originally had. \u00a0Can you also say \u2013 that\u2019s the only plane we make here. \u00a0What is management out there telling the employees whose jobs rely on this one airplane?Jim McNerneyWell, we\u2019re telling them, number one, you\u2019re doing a hell of a job and, number two, to keep charging. \u00a0And you\u2019re a part of what is going to be the most successful wide body that our company has ever made. \u00a0That\u2019s what we tell them.John McDermott \u2013 The Post and CourierCan you go into some of the metrics or bring us up to date on where that plant is as far as production?Jim McNerneyYes, I think we had some targets in terms of how long it would take to assemble the first airplane, the quality metrics associated along the way, the traveled work that either happened or didn\u2019t happen, the amount of work that traveled out to the flight line, the amount of time it took to do test flights to get the planes in the hands of our customers.And by and large, that team exceeded those metrics and we\u2019re very proud of them.John McDermott \u2013 The Post and CourierDo you see \u2013 will they hit the three a month by the end of the year?Jim McNerneyI have a lot of confidence that they\u2019ll hit their targets.Tom DowneyThat concludes our earnings call. \u00a0Again, for member of the media, if you have further questions, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002. \u00a0Thank you."],"3550":["The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 24, 2019 10:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Maurita Sutedja - Vice President of Investor Relations","Dennis Muilenburg - Chairman President & Chief Executive Officer","Greg Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance & Strategy","Anne Toulouse - Senior Vice President of Communications","Conference Call Participants","Carter Copeland - Melius Research","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","David Strauss - Barclays","Seth Seifman - JPMorgan","Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Jon Raviv - Citigroup","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Doug Harned - Bernstein","Myles Walton - UBS","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg","Eric Johnson - Reuters","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times","Operator","Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Boeing Company Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions, are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead.","Maurita Sutedja","Thank you, John, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's second quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance & Strategy.","After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin I need to remind you that any projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me start with the 737 MAX. The accidents that occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia continue to weigh heavily on us. We will always be sorry for the lives that have been lost and the families that have been impacted. These accidents affect all of us personally and reinforce the importance of the work that we do. We know lives depend on it and nothing is more important to us than the safety of the flight crews and passengers who fly on our airplanes.","We're also committed to supporting the families and communities affected by the Lion Air and Ethiopian accidents. Earlier this month we pledged $100 million in funds to help support those families and communities. And last week we announced that $50 million from this pledge would be dedicated to providing near-term financial assistance to families of the victims. And we have partnered with renowned experts Kenneth Feinberg and Camille Biros on disposition of these funds.","Now let me turn to the latest on the MAX technical updates. Last month the FAA directed us to address a specific condition of flight unrelated to MCAS that the planned software update did not previously address. We agreed with the FAA's decision and we are currently working on the software changes to address this requirement.","In addition, we are working with the FAA and other regulators to complete as many elements of the certification process as possible in parallel with the development of the software update. We will submit our final certification package to the FAA once we have satisfied all of their requirements, which we currently estimate will be in the September time frame.","However, as we have consistently emphasized, it is the FAA and other global aviation regulators that will determine when the 737 MAX returns to service and we are working tirelessly to meet their requirements. The process is dynamic and involves constant dialogue on outstanding questions and open issues that will continue in the days and weeks ahead. We are committed to working with these regulators to satisfy all of the requirements and to ensure the 737 MAX's safe return to service.","As I mentioned last quarter, as part of our commitment to continually improve safety as we have always done, we've established a new Board committee to review Boeing's policies and processes for the design and development of airplanes. The committee has sought input from outside experts, from both industry and government and is working expeditiously to conduct its review and provide any recommendations it deems appropriate.","In preparation for the safe return of the 737 MAX to service, we've conducted a dozen customer conferences with MAX operators around the world and nearly 225 simulator sessions to develop test and demonstrate the software. In addition, we conduct weekly technical calls with our customers worldwide to ensure that all the appropriate steps are being taken so that the fleet is fully prepared to return to service when the grounding is lifted.","This involves having the necessary technical kits and expertise on hand while adopting a new airplane entry-into-service mindset in partnership with our customers. This also includes a comprehensive package of training and educational resources.","In April, we reduced the 737 production rate to 42 per month to accommodate the pause in MAX deliveries. Both within Boeing and our supply chain, we are using this time to improve the production system health and stability. As we said in our pre-release last week, our best current estimate is a return to service for the MAX that begins early in the fourth quarter. Based upon this estimate and other factors, we expect to be able to maintain our current production rate of 42 deliveries per month to be followed by incremental rate increases that would bring our production rate to 57 during 2020.","As our efforts to support the 737 MAX's safe return to service continue, we will continue to assess our production plans. Should our estimate of the anticipated return to service change, we might need to consider possible further rate reductions or other options, including a temporary shutdown of the MAX production.","The grounding has also impacted our customers and their flight schedules. The production rate adjustment to 42 per month will also cause associated airplane delivery delays in the future. We've been in constant contact with our customers to support them during this difficult time and we'll continue to work closely with all of our customers around the world and deal with the impact individually customer by customer. As we announced last week, we are recognizing impact to our second quarter results from both the longer-than-expected lower production rate and also estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers.","I want to personally thank everyone who continues to be our partner in this journey, from our airline customers and their pilots, flight attendants and others who have been impacted by these groundings, representatives from all levels of government who share our commitment to safety, to the flying public and everyone in the aviation community impacted by these events. We are grateful for your support and we will continue striving to earn and re-earn your trust.","Now let me turn to an overview of our second quarter operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and how we are maintaining financial discipline and prudently managing liquidity as we work through the safe return to service of the MAX.","With that let's move to slide 2. During the quarter, we recorded revenues of $15.8 billion and core earnings per share of negative $5.82, reflecting the MAX charge as well as lower volume of 737 deliveries partially offset by higher defense and services volume. We recorded negative $0.6 billion of operating cash and paid $1.2 billion in dividends reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year.","Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for our businesses. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $4.7 billion reflecting 90 deliveries and the $5.6 billion pre-tax MAX charge. We saw solid widebody activities in the quarter and our backlog remains healthy at more than 5,500 airplanes worth $390 billion.","Also earlier this month, we launched our latest round of flight testing through our ecoDemonstrator program to assess new technologies from enhancing safety and environmental performance to improving the flying experience. We debut a Boeing 777 that will serve as the 2019 flying testbed for 50 projects. The majority of the test flights will fly on sustainable aviation fuel to reduce emissions and demonstrate the fuel's viability.","Now over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported second quarter revenue of $6.6 billion and booked $4 billion of new orders demonstrating the continued value we bring to our customers across our defense space and security portfolio. Those orders included contracts for a second lot of MH-47G Block II Chinooks for the U.S. Army; service life modification for the U.S. Navy's F-18 fleet; Wideband Global Satellite Communications for the U.S. Air Force; and a 5-year extension of Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kits spares repairs and technical services for the U.S. Air Force.","Key milestones for BDS included the first T-X trainer program flight test on contract with U.S. Air Force and successful completion of the Starliner's final parachute test in preparation for upcoming launches. We delivered five KC-46 Tankers to the U.S. Air Force in the quarter.","Year-to-date, we've delivered a total of 13 tankers. We look forward to continuing to work with our customer during their initial operational test and evaluation of KC-46 and we are committed to delivering the highest-quality product to our customers.","Turning to Global Services. BGS reported revenue of $4.5 billion representing 11% growth year-on-year. BGS continues to win new business highlighting the value we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers and the strength of our One Boeing offerings.","During the quarter BGS won new business totaling approximately $4 billion, which included Performance-Based Logistics contracts for AH-64 Apache for the U.S. Army and KC-767 Tanker for the Italian Air Force. BGS also received commitments from ASL Aviation Holding and GECAS for up to 45, 737-800 converted freighters.","And as announced at the Paris Air Show, we're excited about Boeing's first off-platform component service program with British Airways for the airline's A320 and A320neo aircraft.","Also in the quarter, aligned with our targeted vertical integration strategy to strengthen internal capabilities increase innovation and provide greater end-to-end value for our airline customers, we entered into an agreement to acquire EnCore Group an aerospace interiors company.","Additionally, through Boeing NeXt which leads our future mobility efforts, we announced the strategic partnership with Kitty Hawk Corporation to collaborate on future efforts to advance safe urban mobility. Progress also continues with the Embraer transaction as we work through regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. We still expect to complete the transaction by the end of the year.","In summary, our priority continues to be the safe return to service of the 737 MAX and we've continued to prioritize additional resources and focus on this effort. At the same time, we are maintaining our focus on keeping the business strong and healthy. As we demonstrated in the second quarter, our team continues to execute on operating performance and capture noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog.","With that let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in commercial, defense, space and services. These are sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals with a combined market opportunity of $8.7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's up from $8.1 trillion in our previous forecast.","The increase was driven by strong commercial aviation fundamentals, airline productivity, widebody replacement demand and large stable defense and space markets as well as the need for life cycle services solutions. As a global company with customers in 150 countries, we are always mindful of the potential impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic forces.","We continue to track a host of near-term issues including the U.S.-China trade discussions. We believe in the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. In commercial aviation, while we have seen moderation of traffic in the first half of this year, global passenger traffic continues to grow faster than GDP and near long-term trends.","In 2018, we saw the ninth straight year of above-trend growth for passenger traffic. So far in 2019 passenger traffic has grown at a solid 4.6% through May. On the air cargo market, we saw a contraction in the year-to-date traffic. While we expect cargo traffic headwinds to linger in the near-term, we anticipate an improvement in the latter part of the year.","Our view of the demand fundamentals remains robust. We are highly confident in our industry outlook which now forecasts the demand for approximately 44,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. That's up from approximately 43,000 in our previous forecast, doubling the size of the global fleet and requiring a sizable ecosystem of life cycle solutions to maintain and support it.","We continue to see sustainable long-term growth in commercial aviation, powered by mature and emerging economies, a growing middle class, and continued innovation in business models and products.","The changing nature of travel has fundamentally expanded traffic patterns with improved accessibility and affordability. At the same time, airlines are maintaining capacity discipline and keeping supply and demand in balance. They are also more balanced between airplanes purchased for fleet growth and replacement.","Of the 44,000 new airplane demand, 44% will go towards replacing aging aircraft leading to more stable purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in these key market dynamics in aggregate continues to drive less cyclicality for our industry.","These long-term demand fundamentals provide a solid foundation for our commercial business. We are well-positioned in this market with a strong portfolio of airplanes, a large and diverse order backlog and a strong One Boeing team.","Additionally, we are forecasting demand for around 800,000 new civil aviation pilots and 770,000 new maintenance technicians over the next 20 years. About 80% of them will be for commercial aviation.","Meeting this strong demand will require a collective effort from across the global aviation industry. The aviation industry will need to adopt innovative training solutions to enable optimum learning and knowledge retention. The narrowbody segment will command the largest share of new deliveries.","We expect airlines to need more than 32,000 single-aisle airplanes in the next 20 years. These new airplanes will continue to stimulate growth and provide requirement -- and provide required replacements for older, less efficient airplanes.","Our 737 program has a backlog of more than 4,400 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. Last month International Airlines Group, one of the world's largest airline groups, signed a letter of intent to purchase 200 737 MAX jets. We are honored by their trust and confidence that IAG is placing in the 737 MAX and ultimately in the people of Boeing and our deep commitment to quality and safety above all else.","In the widebody segment, we have seen steady order activities for the 787 and the 777 and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in widebody replacement demand early next decade.","In the near-term, we continue to monitor and inform the U.S.-China trade discussions. China is an important part of the global aircraft market and progress on this front will help support our widebody production rates.","The current-generation 777 continued its steady sales momentum with two new orders from DHL in the quarter and 12 new commitments and letters of intent from Qatar Airways which we firmed up earlier this month and also from China Airlines and Turkmenistan Airlines. These provide further support for the 777 bridge.","Turning to 777X, orders and commitments of 364 aircraft provide a strong foundation that supports our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We continue to focus on further bolstering the 777X skyline.","On 777X development, our first two flight test airplanes are now in preflight testing. Overall the airplane is performing well in preflight tests with intermediate gauntlet and initial taxi tests completed during the quarter.","Our teams are currently focused on final systems, propulsion, and airplane level tests. However, the GE9X engine remains the pacing item as we work towards first flight. As we previously mentioned, GE, our engine supplier is working through some challenges with the engine that are putting risk on the overall test schedule.","Based on GE's latest assessment on what it will take to address these challenges, we are currently projecting that first flight will occur in early 2020 rather than in 2019 as we have previously mentioned. This scheduled flight is obviously disappointing given how well the aircraft has been performing in preflight tests and that we are on track on non-engine activities.","While we continue to target 2020 for first delivery of the 777-9 the engine issue has added significant risk to the schedule. We continue to work closely with GE as well as explore opportunities to improve the schedule such as leveraging our system integration labs and additional airplane ground testing as we strive to meet this delivery target in a manner consistent with our commitment to safety.","We continue to expect 777 delivery rates to be approximately 3.5 aircraft per month in 2019. Given the pressure around 777X first delivery timeline, we are reassessing the 2020 skyline. In light of the strong demand for our freighter line, we intend to mitigate some of the impact by producing more 777 current-generation freighters in 2020.","Turning to the 787 Dreamliner, in the quarter we saw Air New Zealand, Korean Airlines, and Air Lease Corporation announce their commitments to purchase a total of 33 787-9 and 787-10s. Korean Airlines firmed up their orders last week. Our 787 backlog stands at more than 550 airplanes. Similar to the 777X, we will continue to focus on further bolstering the 787 skyline.","On our 767 program, we added six new 767 freighter orders in the quarter and as previously announced, we plan to increase the 767 production rate from 2.5 per month to three per month in 2020.","At Defense Space & Security, we continue see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. Looking at the defense and space market for the next 10 years, we see a $2.5 trillion market of opportunities for our business. About 60% of that is in the U.S., so there's tremendous opportunity around the world.","Our strategy of global reach with local presence is key to our success. You see that across Europe, Australia, India, and the Middle East to name a few. The BDS portfolio is well-positioned with mature world-class platforms to address current needs and innovative capable and affordable new franchise programs to build the future.","We continue to see broad support for our products from the Pentagon, NASA, and Congress including for procurement of the Boeing F-15EX and F-18 fighter jets, Apache and V-22 Osprey rotorcraft, JDAM weapons, satellite programs, the Space Launch System, and key derivative programs like the KC-46 Tanker and the P-8. We have also seen robust support for our future franchise programs.","We are maintaining a clear focus on these future franchises, including the ongoing MQ-25 and T-X development programs and our NASA Commercial Crew and Space Launch System programs at the leading edge of space exploration. Additionally, we're focused on leveraging our work to date on GBSD to help deliver this essential national security capability.","Turning to the services sector. We see the $3.1 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. This is a very dynamic and exciting marketplace, one that is driven by new technology and a relentless drive for greater efficiency, reliability and safety. BGS provides agile cost-competitive services to our customers worldwide. The future of commercial and government aircraft and services will be increasingly centered on technology and data services to drive smarter business decisions in commercial aviation and improve the commercial passenger experience and to enhance war fighter safety effectiveness and mission readiness.","We aim to continue growing faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share. Strong orders of $4 billion in the quarter reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational costs through the life cycle. The market continues to recognize our broad and deep portfolio of digital solutions, which harness the power of big data to significantly expand fleet capability and cost savings for commercial and government customers.","During the quarter, we expanded our global rosters of customers, including announcements at the Paris Air Show by Delta Airlines and JetBlue Airways. We signed up for our crew navigation analytics and other solutions to help optimize their operations. In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains committed to growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future. Our One Boeing strategy and offerings across our three businesses are key differentiators that strengthen our position as the world's leading aerospace company.","With that, Greg over to you for our financial results.","Greg Smith","Thanks, Dennis, and good morning everyone. Before we discuss the second quarter results let me also touch on the 737 MAX and explain how the grounding has impacted our financials to date and what we're doing to focus on today and going forward.","Let's move to slide 4 please. As previously announced, BCA revenue and earnings were reduced by $5.6 billion of pretax charge related to our estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers or disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. As Dennis mentioned, we will deal with the impact individually, customer by customer and we will look at various forms of economic value that we can provide.","While the entire estimated amount has been recognized as a charge in the second quarter, we will expect any concessions or other considerations to be provided over a number of years. Therefore, you can expect the impact on our cash flow to affect 2019 and beyond. We currently see this impact to be more front end-loaded in the first few years, but of course it will depend on individual discussions with our customers on considerations.","We also booked an additional $1.7 billion of program costs on the 737 in the second quarter. This increase is primarily due to higher costs associated with the longer-than-expected reduction in the production rate. These include additional fixed costs and other items such as labor escalation support, parts and material. These costs will be spread across the undelivered aircraft in the accounting block of approximately 3,100 units and therefore reduce the 737 program margin.","As you know, when the program margin is adjusted it will affect the current quarter and the booking margin for subsequent periods. Also as Dennis said, we continue to work with the civil aviation authorities to ensure the 737 MAX's safe return to service and these authorities will determine the timing and condition of return to service. For the purpose of our second quarter financial results we have assumed that the regulatory approval in the U.S. and other jurisdictions begin early in fourth quarter 2019.","While this assumption reflects our best estimate at this time, I just want to reiterate that the actual timing and condition of return to service will be determined by the regulatory authorities and could differ from this assumption and our estimate. Our current second quarter results also assume a gradual increase in the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 57 per month in 2020.","We will also assume airplanes produced during the grounding, which are stored and included in our inventory will be delivered over several quarters following return to service. Any changes to these assumptions could require us to recognize additional financial impact.","With regards to cash, lower cash receipts due to fewer 737 deliveries and lower production rate combined with building and storing 737 aircraft adversely impacted operating cash in the quarter. Looking forward, the key drivers of our financial impact related to the 737 continue to be the return-to-service time line and conditions.","The delivery ramp-up which will be dependent on how fast we can deliver the aircraft once the fleet returns to service and how fast our customers can accept the aircraft, but also the 737 production rate profile I discussed going forward; and discussions with customers regarding potential concessions and other considerations.","We expect our financial results to continue to be adversely impacted until we safely return the 737 MAX to service, ramp up production rates and resume deliveries to customers. We continue to perform detailed scenario planning around return to service and production rates, including analyzing the implications on our supply chain, customer fleet and deliveries to fully understand the range of financial outcomes.","We will continue to assess our current production plans and incorporate any new insights such as return-to-service time line, storage capacity and supply chain in our analysis to help inform us on whether further rate reduction or other options including a temporary shutdown of the MAX production are needed.","As discussed last quarter, we've taken steps amid current challenges to preserve the future value and growth of this important franchise program for our company and for our customers. The production rate adjustment to 42 per month we instituted starting in April has helped our factory health and also supply our progress to getting back to master schedule and improving consistency and stability.","We've also taken actions to prudently manage our liquidity and increase our balance sheet flexibility including raising additional debt. These actions also include even sharper focus on productivity and strategic prioritization of spending. We will continue to diligently review all levers available to minimize the financial impact.","As discussed last quarter given the dynamic 737 MAX return-to-service time line and activities we're not in the position today to provide forecast of the impact of the 737 MAX grounding on our full year 2019 financials.","We will provide you with an updated full year 2019 financial forecast when we have returned to service the MAX fleet our production plans and delivery ramp-up profile and corresponding financial impacts. Returning MAX safely to flight continues to be priority one for us. It has been a team effort that leverages the best talent from across Boeing and also outside experts.","The operating rhythm and the momentum of our cross-functional team has not let up since day 1. The team continues to meet daily with our Executive Council fully engaged.","We will continue to apply whatever resources are required to return the 737 MAX safely into the fleet and take the time necessary to do so working hand-in-hand with our customers. At the same time we'll also remain focused on our priorities delivering results with excellence.","So with that let's move to slide 5 and I'll discuss our second quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was $15.8 billion with core earnings per share of negative $5.82 reflecting lower 737 deliveries and the MAX charge partially offset by higher defense and services volume.","Now let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 6. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue decreased to $4.7 billion during the quarter reflecting the 737 MAX charge and lower 737 deliveries partially offset by favorable mix.","BCA booked negative operating margins in the quarter due to the 737 MAX impact partially offset by higher 787 margins. BCA backlog continues to remain strong at $390 billion and more than 5500 aircraft creating more than six years or production.","Let's now turn to Defense Space & Security results on slide 7. Second quarter revenue increased to $6.6 billion reflecting higher volume across derivative aircraft, government satellites, weapons and new franchise programs. It was partially offset by lower F\/A-18 volume.","Our margins of 14.7% in the quarter include continued focus on productivity and a $200 million gain on a sale of property. Similar to what we saw last quarter the sale of this excess property is the result of the team's continued market based affordability efforts to optimize our footprint and productivity. During the quarter BDS won key contract awards worth $4 billion and our backlog stands at $64 billion with 31% from outside the U.S.","Let's now turn to Boeing Global Service results on slide 8. In the second quarter Global Services revenue increased to $4.5 billion reflecting the acquisition of KLX and higher international government services volume. Year-over-year growth of 11% for the quarter continues to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%.","BGS booked operating margins of 15.1% and as I mentioned before BGS margins quarter to quarter are subject to fluctuations due to factors such as mix of products and services as well as performance on individual contracts. During the quarter BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $4 billion bringing its backlog now to $20 billion.","Let's now turn to cash flow on slide 9. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was negative $590 million driven by lower 737 deliveries and production rate offset by solid underlying performance and timing of receipts and expenditures.","As mentioned earlier, we expect continued working capital pressure to adversely affect cash flow until MAX deliveries resume. Strong operating cash flow from other parts of the business a strong balance sheet and future balance sheet levers will help provide adequate liquidity during this period.","In the second quarter we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and as I previously mentioned until we have clarity on the 737 return to service, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase program. However our long-term balanced cash deployment strategy and commitment remains unchanged.","Let's now move to cash and debt balances on slide 10. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. As I mentioned earlier, we raised additional debt in the quarter increasing the balance by $4.5 billion to help shore up the liquidity position as we work through the current MAX challenges.","Our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet provides us with substantial borrowing capacity through capital markets access and unused credit facility of $6.6 billion.","Our long-term goals and strategic objectives remain unchanged. We will continue to use our three business unit strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments and leverage talent and innovation across the company.","So in summary, while focusing on the very important priority of a safe 737 MAX return to service and minimizing the significant impact on our customers and the flying public, our team keeps the core operating management, strong delivering results and meeting customer commitments. We recognize that we have a lot of work and not insignificant challenges in front of us in the weeks and months to come, but we're confident we have the right focus, team and resources to navigate through them.","We're committed to providing you with additional updates on the MAX return-to-service progress and production plans as we have more information. We'll strive to continue to keep all of our stakeholders informed through public statements and information posted on our website. Once we have further clarity, we will schedule a follow-up investor and media call to discuss the financial impacts and provide revised guidance.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for closing comments.","Dennis Muilenburg","All right. Thank you, Greg. These are challenging times, first and foremost for the families and loved ones affected by these recent events, and also for our dedicated people who work tirelessly to deliver on our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire the world all with a relentless focus on quality and safety and doing so with the utmost integrity.","This is a defining moment for Boeing, and we're committed to coming through this challenging time better and stronger as a company. We'll stay true to our enduring values, while driving operational excellence across the enterprise. The safe return to service of the 737 MAX is our company's top priority.","I want to thank my Boeing teammates, who are delivering on this priority and on our other commitments of executing on our key priorities for our customers driving growth and operational excellence across the business in close partnership with our customers and suppliers and returning value to our shareholders. From engineers to analysts, to our factory teams and field service reps, to designers and planners, and to everyone at Boeing who has worked tirelessly to apply our culture of continuous improvement and learn from these events to innovate, to challenge, and to improve you have my sincerest thanks.","I'm humbled and inspired by the response of the people of Boeing and our many partners. The shared responsibility of safety binds us together and reinforces our purpose and mission as an aerospace leader.","The long-term fundamentals for our businesses remain strong and our key priorities are unchanged. Our One Boeing advantage has never been clearer, and we will leverage this unique strength to deliver and improve on our commitments to our customers and our partners around the world.","With that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning gentlemen.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Hi. Greg, can you help us understand the relative degree of confidence you had or used to reach the financial impacts you announced last week and maybe how you thought about the variability in outcomes there, especially, I guess in the context of a temporary line stoppage that you both mentioned in your prepared remarks.","And then I guess related you said the phasing of those impacts would be front end-loaded, but can you maybe help us understand how you're thinking about that impact on the kind of higher-level multi-year cash flow trend you've talked about in the past? Thanks.","Greg Smith","Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, look obviously our booking position for the second quarter is our best estimate. And that's our best estimate based on a variety of inputs that we take into consideration and our engagement with the regulators, our software schedule, and our production plans the storage that you brought up all of that coming together in the second quarter. And again, that's our best estimate at this time.","Now, as I said and Dennis said, obviously, some of those assumptions could change from here and if they do, they could have financial impact further than what we've booked in the second quarter and we'll keep you up-to-date if that's the case. But again, based on all that information, that's the best estimate we've got right now.","And as far as the path forward on the customer concessions as we've said, we're working and will continue to work with each of our customers and talk about how we can help through this period around the grounding of the aircraft, but also as we move deliveries out. And those will be individual conversations customer by customer, but likely be multiyear-type I'll say financial outcomes and particularly around cash.","As we see it today, it\u2019d probably be a little more front-loaded into 2019 and some of the early years, but then phase out over that period. But again, this will be based on individual conversations and we'll pull that together as those conversations become more mature.","As you look at the cash profile going forward, I maybe step back a little bit and take the MAX out of the equation for a second, and tell you that the balance of the company and I'd say the key puts and takes that we saw pre-MAX remain intact. So, all those fundamentals are still intact. The real obviously outlier here is the MAX. And if the MAX returns to service based on the estimate that we have right now, then you'll obviously see significant cash in 2020 that will really be driven by those airplanes being delivered off the ramp at a higher rate, but as well as the production rate increases that we've talked about.","But until we have complete clarity on exactly that return-to-service date, and then the associated deliveries and production plan it's obviously TBD at this point. But again, the fundamentals remain intact and the objective certainly remains intact as well of having this year-over-year long-term cash flow objective. And like I said, the operating engine outside of MAX continues to achieve the results we expect.","And again lots of puts and takes as we move into the future years, but those are bounded very similar to the way they were pre-MAX. So it really is dependent on MAX return to service, and then that ramp-up from there. And as I said, we'll continue to keep you posted on that.","Carter Copeland","So it basically just sounds like the working capital reversal and the phasing of the settlements are the two big moving items for 2020?","Greg Smith","Yeah. Certainly, yeah as you think about 2020 like I said delivering off the ramp and not only our ability to deliver off the ramp at a higher rate, but as I said the customers ability to take those; the concessions and considerations as you said; obviously lower advances at this lower production rate that you're seeing currently and you'll continue to see; and then the 777, 777X schedule that Dennis talked about. So yeah, there's lots of moving pieces within there, but we're clear-eyed on all of those and we're running various scenarios around those and taking a lot of action as we indicated on the prior call to try to mitigate some of that risk.","So all this effort in the factory, and all this effort in the supply chain to get stable to get folks back on schedule and get productivity initiatives that we had planned for the year and using these additional resources to get those mature and ready, so when we do go up in rate and we do start delivering off the ramp, we're doing that in a most efficient way possible. So that's kind of the investment, I'd say, we're making currently to ensure and minimize that risk as we get return to service and start to put the airplanes back into the hands of our customer.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thanks.","Greg Smith","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. So the 777X schedule slip, what is the financial impact both in terms of \u2013 what does your skyline for next year look like? Can you hold the Classic at three and half per month? And what does it mean in terms of when the cash outlay for the 777X will peak? Thank you.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. Hey, Cai let me jump in on that first and then I'll ask Greg to add on. First of all, just to give you a little additional context on 777X schedule on the airplane side of the effort, we've been very pleased with the progress. And over the last quarter, as we mentioned we did the final gauntlet test, so think of those as the airplane-level system integration tests in the factory. And we also did our initial low-speed and high-speed taxi tests under power.","All of that was very effective. We're very pleased with the results. So the airplane side of the equation here is progressing on plan and one of the cleanest development programs that we've seen. We're disappointed by the slip in the engine schedule and GE is steadily working through that challenge and getting their arms around the precise schedule for recovering. We'll be proceeding through engine testing as that solution becomes clear, but that does push our first flight out into early 2020, as we're currently projecting. We still expect this year to be our peak expenditure level on the 777X development program, but you're going to see the cash profile where we had hoped to get into the tailwind part of the program next year. You're going to see that extend out as first flight is extended out. Greg, do you want to add some additional color on that as well?","Greg Smith","Yeah. No, I think \u2013 I think Dennis framed that perfectly. And obviously looking at 777 opportunities and obviously we're seeing continued demand for that product and particularly around the freight market, and so we're feathering that in with this current revised schedule Cai. And really that's an opportunity to meet the demands of our customer, but minimize the financial impact to us.","So lots of moving pieces in there, but we're continuing to work it. And like I said, the 777 continues to remain strong. It's certainly helping us through this period. And then the 777X skyline we talked about our priorities when it comes to widebodies in the market and certainly 777X and 787 continue to be high priority of filling in that skyline. So like Dennis said, we're disappointed considering the progress that's been made on the program. And these investments, we made to de-risk the development phase of the program, we're seeing the benefit of that today, but we're disappointed by where we are with that \u2013 with this engine. So we're trying to get ahead of this Cai and putting mitigating actions in place and really again minimize the impact on us, and ultimately on our customers.","Dennis Muilenburg","And as Greg said, the encouraging thing is the current 777 continues to do well in the marketplace. So we still expect our factory to be running a five per month production rate next year as we said our delivery rate of about three and half per month this year and we'll be looking at the exact delivery mix next year within that production rate the exact delivery mix of 777 to 777X. And so that's work that's still underway. We've got some work to do.","Cai von Rumohr","Thanks so much.","Dennis Muilenburg","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And next we go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Thank you everybody. Good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning, Hunter.","Hunter Keay","Regarding the comment around potentially suspending the MAX line, when will you need to make a decision on that? What are some of the gating factors? And then \u2013 and once you resume deliveries what's the bigger concern between the customer's ability to accept and your ability to deliver it? Thanks.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, Hunter first of all, when we take a look at the overall MAX plan and return-to-service plan as we said, our current best estimate is that, we return to service early in the fourth quarter. And as long as we remained solid on that assumption, we believe we can maintain our current 42 per month production rate, and as we said incrementally step back up to 57 a month as we go into 2020.","Now, if that estimate of return to service substantially changes then we'll have to consider alternatives. And every day, we are doing scenario planning, working through every dimension of this program. We're looking at the ongoing software update development, the regulatory approvals, the certification process, the return-to-service process, working hand-in-hand with our customers, supply chain health, production system health every dimension of the program. And we have that knit together. We understand it. We understand the ripple effects of any changes to the schedule, and we're going to continue to monitor that on a day-to-day basis.","Currently, and as I said daily, we're working with the FAA, EASA and other regulators as we step through the certification process headed back to ungrounding the fleet. We have a clear understanding of the work that has to be done, but there is still uncertainty in the time line. And we do have to go through a multi-regulator approval process and it's a complex process and one that will take time to get done.","The important thing here is everything is based on safety of the airplane. We are confident that when the 737 MAX returns to service, it will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly. That is the most important thing here. We're going to take the time necessary to ensure its safe.","And as I said if any of the time line assumptions change significantly from a start of the fourth quarter return to service, then we'll have to evaluate alternatives. And those alternatives could include different production rates. They could include a temporary shutdown of the line, not something we want to do, but an alternative that we have to prepare for, I think it's a smart part of our thorough and disciplined process here to make sure we're covering all scenarios.","Hunter Keay","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Dennis, you talked about a software fix for this latest issue that the FAA identified. Are you sure it's a software fix at this point and not also potentially a hardware fix? And then, it's also being reported that EASA has five mutual requirements before it'll lift the MAX grounding. Is that in fact accurate? It seems to be more encompassing of what the FAA is talking about. And if so, is that accurate, they have these five requirements? And if so, is meeting those lineup what the September time frame that you've outlined? Thanks.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. David, let me give you a little context there. So, first of all, on the software update that's going on, we are confident that is a software update not a hardware update. Our process here as we step through certification is, we have the regulators come in and fly in our simulator and we test out a number of different conditions that are all part of the final certification. And during those simulator sessions, we identified this additional scenario that with the FAA, we decided that we would make this software update to mitigate a potential risk. And this was a simulated failure in our -- in the microprocessor of the airplane as previously reported.","That is a software update to address that risk area. It's an understood update and we're in the middle of working our way through that. The time line for approving that update and finishing up the certification is still uncertain as we're working through the details with the regulators. The FAA has also convened a number of multi-regulator boards and reviews and venues to bring in EASA, Transport Canada, Brazil, other regulators from around the world. And those convening sessions are bringing all of the questions to the table that any of the regulars have.","So the reports that you mentioned about the five questions from EASA, all of the questions from all of the regulators around the world are being brought together, convened and integrated with the FAA's leadership. So all of those inputs have been considered in our current timeline analysis and are all consistent with the time line that we've laid out here for submitting our certification package in the September time frame and a return to service in the October time frame. Now again, that's a time line that we base-lined for the moment, but there's still uncertainty in the exact process that the regulators will step through.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. Follow-up on a couple of questions that have been asked already and hopefully not be too repetitive. But just in terms of how you think about the rate and where the line should be? I appreciate the fact that you guys have to be very disciplined and thorough in your planning. But as we've seen over the past few months, it's not surprising to see the dates move around here and there. And when you balance some of the risks of continuing to producing 42 without delivering versus the risk that would emerge on the supply chain if you were to cut the rate significantly, I mean, is it safe to say that the type of slips that we've seen already which is a couple of months here and a couple of months there don't necessarily affect the rate?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Seth, I guess the way to think about that is, we're continually assessing all of these different pressure points in the system and supply chain health is certainly one of the key considerations for us as we think about the production rate. We're also taking a look at storage capacity and our ability to take care of the airplane from the field, our return-to-service time line and the effect that will have on our customers and the work that needs to be done on preparing the airplanes.","So we're taking a look through all dimensions of these pressure points around the schedule. And no one item is going to drive the schedule. This is balancing all of the inputs in perspective. So, I won't make any dramatic assumptions around any one parameter. It's more of a balancing act as we continue to look at all of these dimensions.","Seth Seifman","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Spingarn","Good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Hey Rob.","Rob Spingarn","Dennis, you've said it a couple of times on the call now that you'd have the fix-in you think by September and hopefully recertification in October. Given that the FAA is in the building and working with you on this, what are the mechanics of what happens in that one month? Is the idea here that they will have already vetted most of this before they even receive the official submission? And then the other part of the question is, are you -- is discovery over here and we are just implementing and testing? Or is discovery -- new discovery still ongoing? Thanks.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Rob, I would characterize this as an iterative process. So we are in daily communication with the FAA and other regulators. Our teams are daily working on software updates, running through simulator sessions. There's a great deal of certification -- documentation that needs to be completed.","So all of that engineering work is underway. As we complete that work and complete the documentation of what's called the system safety assessment that will lead into the final formal certification process, which will include a certification flight test. And then subsequent to that flight test we'll submit the final documentation that will go through the FAA's normal approval process.","In parallel to that we have a number of pilot evaluations that will be done. There's a joint operational evaluation board that will look at the training dimension of bringing the MAX back up and flying. So all of these are parallel activities that we're working jointly with the regulators but it is an iterative process. And as we go through those iterations it's possible that we will discover new items.","So our goal is over time to close out uncertainty, answer questions that are coming in from the regulators. We're making good, steady progress on that. We see convergence, so we know we're making progress. But until we complete all of the certification activities there's always some risk of new items opening up. And so that's why we try to be very disciplined about the engineering process here but also our scenario planning to account for any of these potential uncertainties. And until we get through the final certification step and we all confirm that the airplane is safe, we won't return to service. So that's really the pacing item here.","Rob Spingarn","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Thanks, everyone. Dennis, can you give us some perspective on the widebody market please, some thoughts on why you're not over supplying as some of your competitors might have suggested and also how you're achieving what some have suggested are very aggressive prices?","And then just a little bit also on the near-term versus long-term dynamics in that market, including China. Why is that a near-term driver and then more of a replacement dynamic in the 2020s? Thank you.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. You bet Jon. Well, a couple of things. One, as you look at our current market outlook as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to see strong overall growth. And if you look at the next 20 years, the world needs about 44,000 new commercial airplanes, up from about 43,000 in our previous forecast.","So directionally the market continues to expand. The fundamentals are solid and passenger traffic in particular continues to expand. A key part of that future demand is the widebody marketplace. We continue to see a significant wave of replacement demand early in the next decade as we've said before. And we believe our 787 and 777X families are perfectly positioned for that replacement wave that's coming. And you can see that our products are winning in the marketplace.","Despite a fairly tough marketplace in terms of overall orders, so far this year our widebody segment has been doing well. And we've been winning in the marketplace with both the 787 and the 777X and I think that speaks to the value that we're providing customers.","So I can't comment on our competitors' comments that you mentioned but I can comment on the fact that our customers see value in the 787 Dreamliner and 777X. That's showing up in orders. And while we still have work to do on the skyline as we noted for both 777X and 787, we feel confident in the production rates that we've laid out. And you've seen that with the 787 currently running at 14 a month, we're continuing to gain efficiency on that line and that's allowing us to be even more competitive in the marketplace.","So we're going to be mindful about filling the future skyline. We're mindful of those risks and we'll continue to pay attention to that. But the long-term marketplace for widebodies is solid and our family of products is well-positioned to compete and win.","Jon Raviv","Thanks. I\u2019ll stick to one.","Operator","Next we go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Yeah, hey good morning guys.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning Ron.","Ron Epstein","So one thing that really hasn't come up too much in the call is where do we stand on NMA. And on NMA when we kind of stand back and look at it, given the difficulties that we run into on the MAX and the difficulties on 78 and the difficulties on 74-8 and the difficulties on KC-46, how do we get comfortable around NMA? And can you just talk about that?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah Ron. First of all to put it in context, we continue to have a dedicated team that's working on NMA, working through our business case. Our assessment of the market opportunity hasn't changed. We see a potential market there for 4,000 to 5,000 aircraft and we continue to see significant customer interest in that marketplace.","But in terms of relative priorities, it's clear that our top priority is getting the 737 MAX return to service safely and so we have prioritized that in terms of resourcing and focus for our company. And that will be first and that is ahead of our NMA work.","That said, we're continuing to progress on building our business case and when and if that business case closes, we would make a launch decision. We still see it as a two-step decision process as we've described previously. And we're not going to run to any artificial time line. We're going to make decisions based on disciplined data and as the business case close.","Part of that business case is addressing development program risk as you noted and we are investing significantly in improving development program performance. We know it's an area that needs continued improvement going forward. This gets in all the work we're doing on things like model based engineering, our digital transformation, production system of the future. These are all important elements of reducing development cost and also de-risking development programs for the future. That's all part of what goes into the business case for NMA and our confidence in the maturity of those new tools and the ability to implement them at scale on our development program will be part of the decision process.","Ron Epstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Thank you, good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Harned","On the MAX, as you look toward presumably the September time frame, one of the issues that's been out there has been training requirements. And if you look across a number of aviation authorities there, appear to be very different views also across airlines. When you consider different scenarios for what training requirements will be whether they're full simulator computer-based, how could that affect your ability to deliver even if we get certification in the time frame that you're hoping it will occur?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, Doug. That's another area that we're paying close attention to and working daily. So as part of our ongoing work, not only the software update on the MAX, we've also made a comprehensive update to the training materials and expanded educational resources. And that is being done in concert again with regulatory authorities and with our customers around the world.","In fact, we've conducted, as I mentioned earlier, hundreds of simulator sessions with customer pilots around the world to get their inputs on the training packages and some of the updates that we're making. So that work is going on in parallel. The next significant waypoint in that process is something that's called the Joint Operational Evaluation Board.","That is a convening of regulators and government pilots that will fly the airplane with the updated software. They will evaluate the training curriculum and will make final recommendations on the overall training requirements.","And we have prepared a comprehensive set of computer-based training modules that we're confident will address the training needs for the MAX. But in addition to that, we've also prepared options and are continuing to work through options for simulator-based training for airlines that may want that or regulatory agencies that may require it.","And we do expect in the end that we'll have a consistent set of computer-based training that all airline customers will use and there will likely be some selective use of simulator-based training. It depends on the maturity of the fleets and whether they already have MAX aircraft or whether MAXes are new to their fleet. It depends on their pilot training curriculum.","Some airlines will use simulator training as part of their normal recurrent training. Some may want training upfront before they fully return the fleet to service. So that can be a pacing item, Doug, as you noted and it's another one of those uncertainty elements that we're working our way through.","That's why when we say return to service early in the fourth quarter we have to work through all of these uncertainties: the software update and the certification of the airplane itself as well as the training curriculum as well as preparation for all of our customers to get the fleet back up and running.","And we have good understanding of each of those workflows. We know the work that has to be done. We are on it on a daily basis. But the exact time line for completing all of that and getting regulatory approval across the board is still uncertain, and that's why we keep saying we've made our best estimate of that time line, but we're also protecting for uncertainty of that time line with our scenario planning.","Doug Harned","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning.","Myles Walton","I was hoping that you could comment on -- with the new updated time line if you have made changes to those suppliers you're maintaining at a higher than 42 a month rate. And then, also if you can maybe talk about the logic between a temporary shutdown versus just a more significant leg down in your production rate of 42. Thanks.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. Myles, a couple of things. One is our solution on the supply chain plans and the scenario planning we're doing varies by supplier. So we have some that are supplying at our production rate, others that are continuing to run at higher than our 42 a month production rate. It's really tailored supplier-by-supplier. In some cases, we had suppliers who were behind schedule, and we'd use the opportunity here to catch up to master schedule as Greg mentioned.","Obviously CFM with the engine, Spirit on the fuselage as examples there where we've been able to increase -- improve our production's health and stability by having them run at a higher than 42 a month production rate. With CFM, for example, we're also working to sustain that higher production rate to make sure we have sufficient engine spares available when we return to service. So each of these are tailored plans, and it's all part of the supply chain health that we're thinking our way through with more than 600 suppliers on the MAX program.","Regarding your latter questions, we think through production system planning, it depends on the time line and our understanding of the time line. If we are able to maintain our early fourth quarter return to service again we hold it at 42 a month production rate, if we have a significant change we would consider alternatives.","Stepping down to a lower production rate below 42 a month, presents some challenges more broadly to our supply chain synchronization of our workforce as well, learning how you would consider ramping back up later and the impact of that. So in some cases, depending on time line, a temporary shutdown of production line could be more efficient than a sustained lower production rate. And that's what we're thinking our way through.","If you had a temporary shutdown if it was necessary that is one way to reduce the outflow of airplanes and the storage requirements while to a degree maintaining supply chain health and workforce learning for consistency in the production system. So we're thinking through all of those parameters and making sure we have all those scenarios available.","Maurita Sutedja","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","And we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you. Good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just to elaborate on the global demand environment a little bit more, what are your thoughts on air traffic decelerating close to the 4% to 5% long-term rate? What are watch items there? And as it relates to that, how do you think about the service business and implication from the MAX to that segment? Thank you.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, Sheila, on the overall market, the fact that we've been operating at a 4.6% passenger traffic growth through May, is not surprising to us. We expected some slowdown in the early part of the year. Some of this has been driven by local effects. The MAX, to a degree, has played into this. Local airport shutdowns in a couple of key locations have impacted it.","But we don't really see a macro driver behind the passenger traffic numbers year-to-date and it is consistent with the longer-term trend of continuing to grow it faster than GDP. So our overall confidence in the market and our 20-year growth outlook, our current market outlook, remains solid. And I wouldn't read anything more than that into the passenger traffic stats that we've seen so far this year. And the second half of your question was?","Greg Smith","Service business.","Dennis Muilenburg","On the services business.","Greg Smith","The MAX, yes.","Dennis Muilenburg","So, on the MAX impact, we have seen some impact of the MAX grounding on our services business. Things like engine overhauls, for example, have been pulled back a bit as we have customers who are keeping existing airplanes in service longer, because of the less capacity in their fleets.","They're deferring some engine overhaul work, so some ripple effect into our services business. I wouldn't say it's extensive, but some impact that we've seen. And again, we expect that to be localized and temporary, nothing that we're seeing as a long-term trend change.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Senior Vice President of Communications. Ms. Toulouse, please go ahead.","Anne Toulouse","Thanks, John. Good morning. We'll continue with questions for Dennis and Greg. For those in media, if you have additional queries following this session please call our team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we're ready for that first question. And in interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question.","Operator","And first we go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson","Hi. Dennis, you've talked in the past about how the MAX experience has been. The last few months have been gearing for your personally, but just an enormous challenge for Boeing. And there's been some discussion of lessons learned and I think a lot of people would like to actually hear a little bit more about what those are. And what's changed in terms of how Boeing operates and how it approaches designing and certifying aircraft?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, Julie, let me make a few comments on that note. I appreciate the question. Certainly, it's been a challenging time for us as a company, but more broadly across the aviation industry. And one, I think, this whole situation has certainly reinforced the importance that we place on safety and quality and reminded us of the importance of the work we do. And we know that lives depend on the work we do and this is just further reinforcing that and reinforcing our commitment to safety and quality. And in the end, that's going to make us a better, stronger company.","We are taking a look at all of our airplane design and certification processes end-to-end. As you know, we have a Board Committee that we've stood up and they're doing a lot of hard work right now, looking through all of our processes. We also have a number of external government reviews that are ongoing, looking at certification processes. Any learnings from that we will certainly incorporate going forward.","And then, we're also taking a look at things around communications and integration and how we can make sure safety issues if found or recognized, those quickly come to the surface, can be dealt with, that we have effective communications with our customers and all the constituencies that are involved. And those are changes that we'll be making as well for any lessons learned. This is all about ensuring that we have the right safety and quality culture for the future. We have a very solid foundation of that today, but we also know we can always get better and that's our focus.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Johnson with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Eric Johnson","Hi. Thank you. Dennis, so do I understand it correctly that you have to sell more 777 freighters to avoid a slowdown in 777 output due to the 777X delays? And how easy is that at a time of global trade tensions?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes, Eric, as I said, we look at the skyline mix through 2020. With the delay in first flight of the 777X, it's obviously going to put pressure on entry-into-service timing. We're still holding 2020 for first delivery.","But we know there's clear pressure on that, given the delays in first flight. So we are taking a look at production skyline mix in 2020.","And as we mentioned earlier, we anticipate that means we'll probably build more current-generation 777s, 777 freighters in that time frame. The good thing is the market signals are positive there.","We've made progress on continuing to sell 777 freighters including during this last quarter. We continue to see strong demand signals there. And so our ability to maintain the production system at five a month and alter the delivery mix between 777s and 777X.","We're confident we can do that. We have work to do to fill out the specific orders and delivery slots. But the good news is that the 777 bridge is strong and we continue to see a lot of demand for the 777 freighter.","Operator","Next we go to Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates","Good morning. The news you've delivered today, gives us two very different scenarios for production in Renton. The one scenario there's a possible shutdown. And the other scenario, you're ramping up from 42 to 57 a month in a year basically.","I just want you to address, how -- they look like there are some optimistic assumptions in there. You're going to fly the plane in September is your hope. But usually after a flight test it takes weeks for the FAA to process the documentation. And analyze all the data from the flight test.","So it does seem optimistic that you would then enter service in October. And then, it seems equally optimistic that you could ramp up from 42 to 57 in a year. You normally take a lot of incremental pieces that takes half a year to get from 42 up to 57.","So, what is the trigger for which scenario happens in Renton? If you slip into next year for entry into service, does that mean a shutdown?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah, Dominic there's no one specific trigger. Again, as I said, we're laying out a multitude of scenarios given all the variables in the schedule here. Our current best estimate, as we said is to deliver our certification package, including the certification flight in that September time frame. And then return to service in the -- early in the fourth quarter.","And you're right, post certification flight it's typically a process that's measured in a number of weeks with the regulators including the FAA to evaluate all of that data, to confirm it, and to give us approval to unground the fleet and return to service. We have taken our best estimate at that and factored that into the analysis and numbers that we shared with you today.","And we are assessing that on a daily basis and working hand-in-hand with the FAA in this process. And we are dependent on the FAA and other regulators for achieving that time line. And we're going to work very closely with them to do that. If that time line changes significantly, we will have to evaluate these other scenarios.","And, there's no one specific trigger, but know that we're going to continually look at this as, what is the optimum solution for our customers, to ensure first of all safety of flight and to help them return to service in a healthy way.","And while we do that maintain production system health, both within our own factory in Renton as well as our supply chain health. That includes a very close focus on our workforce, the health of our workforce, stability of our workforce as well as all these other parameters around storage and other factors that play into the schedule.","Now we're going to continue to balance all of those. To your point about our ability to ramp up later, I will remind you that, we have been at higher production rates previously. So we have experienced, not only up to 57 a month, but at 52 a month.","And that experience, that learning, that understanding, gives us confidence in how we can rate back up. And we've factored that into our analysis as well. And I think you've also noted that, even though we have stepped down to 42 a month on our production rate, we have held our workforce in Renton.","And we place incredible value on our teammates there. And the incredible work that they do. And we're working every dimension we can to preserve that workforce and maintain that learning for future production system ramp-up, so all of these things are factoring into our decision process.","Anne Toulouse","That's going to conclude our earnings call. So again if you're a member of the media, and you have additional question, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analysts and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead.","Maurita Sutedja","Thank you, John and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's third quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's President and Chief Executive officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance & Strategy.","After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin I need to remind you that any projections estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks which are detailed in our news release, in our various SEC filings, and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I will turn over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Thank you, Maurita and good morning. This month marks the one year anniversary of the Lion Air Flight 610 accident. It's been roughly seven months since the Ethiopian Airlines' Flight 302 accident. Not a day goes by where my team and I don't think about these accidents. They weigh heavily on us and we will never forget the lives lost aboard those flights. We are sorry and we continue to extend the deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones.","These accidents affect all of us personally and reinforce the importance of the work we do. We know lives depend on it and nothing is more important to us than the safety of all those who fly on our airplanes.","Let me walk you through the latest developments regarding the 737 MAX on the next slide. Our priority remains supporting the safe return to service of the MAX and assisting our airline customers and operators through this difficult time. We are working daily with the FAA and global regulators on the process they have laid out for certifying the 737 MAX software and training updates and ungrounding the global fleet.","Again, I want to express our regret for the difficulties that the release of an instant message document on Friday has presented to the FAA and other regulators and we understand entirely the scrutiny it's receiving. We are committed to working with the investigative authorities and the U.S. Congress as they continue their investigations.","We are focused on going forward. As we have shared, we completed the MCAS software update earlier this year which addresses concerns found following the two MAX accidents and provides three additional layers of protection to prevent accident like these from ever happening again.","To-date we have conducted more than 800 tests and production flights totaling more than 1,500 hours with the updated software which incorporates feedback from across global regulators and MAX operators.","We are making steady progress on the second software update announced in June for additional flight control computer redundancy to eliminate the possibility of even extremely unlikely risks that are unrelated to the accidents.","In the upcoming days, Boeing will complete additional testing of this software update and conduct multiple simulator evaluations and reviews leading up to a certification flight with the FAA onboard.","Just last week, the company successfully conducted a dry run of the certification flight test. We're making daily progress on these important certification steps. We have brought the very best of Boeing to this effort dedicating all resources necessary to ensure that the improvements to the 737 MAX are comprehensive and thoroughly tested, that includes spending over 100,000 engineering and test hours on their development.","Looking forward, we target regulatory approval for the 737 MAX return to service to begin this quarter. As we've said before, however, it's the FAA and other regulatory authorities who will ultimately determine the timing and conditions of return to service in each relevant jurisdiction. This may include a phased approach and timing may vary by jurisdiction.","During this process, we have been working closely with the FAA and other regulators. We'll provide the documentation, have them fly the simulators, and help them understand our logic and the design for the new software. All of their questions are being answered. The process is dynamic and involves constant dialogue with government agencies that will continue in the days and weeks ahead.","In preparation for the safe return of the 737 MAX to service, we have worked to build the trust and confidence of our customers and regulators. We have partnered with customers and pilots from around the world as we've developed our solutions. We have welcomed and encouraged their questions and giving them opportunities to test those solutions first-hand in our simulators.","We have hosted 545 participants for more than 140 customers and regulators around the globe to experience the software updates in our simulator sessions. We have also conducted 20 global conferences with more than 1,100 participants from more than 250 organizations to help operators and financiers prepare for return to service and provide them the opportunity to ask questions for our teams.","In addition, we're conducting weekly technical calls with our customers worldwide to deliver the highest quality support and fully prepare the fleet to safely return to service when the grounding is lifted. This involves an entry-into-service approach augmented with advanced analytics. This also includes the proposed comprehensive package of training and educational resources.","With our first and foremost priority the safe return to the service of the MAX, we announced a change earlier this month that separates the Chairman and CEO roles to further enable me to center my attention on running the company as Boeing's President and CEO.","Dave Calhoun, our Board's Independent Lead Director is now serving as our Non-Executive Chairman. I'm fully supportive of this division of labor and look forward to continuing my close partnership with Dave, who has a deep knowledge of the aerospace industry and has been a strong and independent leader on Boeing's Board since 2009.","Together, we can be a force multiplier for this important work underway across the company and with our external stakeholders. This move is just the latest of several actions by our Board and senior company leaders to strengthen Boeing's governance and safety management processes, which I will discuss next.","Let's turn to slide 3. As part of our long-standing commitment to safety, last month I announced several actions we're taking to continuously improve. The actions followed recommendations from our Boeing Board of Directors that was a result of the five-month Independent Board Committee review that I've requested of our policies and processes for the design and development of our airplanes.","Members of the committee on airplane policies and processes rigorously explored these aspect of our business and made several recommendations focused on further improving safety throughout the company and the broader aerospace ecosystem. My team and I fully embraced our Board's recommendations and took immediate steps to implement them across the company.","With the committee's input, we established a new product and services safety organization that will review all aspects of product safety and maintain oversight of our accident investigation team and the company's safety review boards. Additionally, we're strengthening and elevating our engineering function through a direct reporting line to Boeing's Chief Engineer, who reports to me.","We're also establishing a formal design requirements program, enhancing our continued operation safety program, partnering with our airline customers on flight deck designs that continue to anticipate the needs of future pilot populations, and we're expanding the reach of our Boeing safety promotion center.","These actions are on top of the steps our Board already has taken to reaffirm its commitment to and oversight of safety, including establishing a permanent aerospace safety committee and adding safety-related experience as one of the criteria for future directors.","In addition to implementing the Board's recommendations, we are committed to reaching even higher. We're concurrently expanding our efforts to strengthen the way we manage safety across Boeing and our supply chain, for example, by broadening the use of a comprehensive safety management system and safety review boards. We're already driving a company-wide approach to safety, quality and integrity that strengthens our vision and serves to reinforce and improve our operational performance.","Additionally, investments in enhanced flight simulation and computing capabilities have increased our company's ability to proactively test a wide range of scenarios resulting in improved product safety. Advanced research and development efforts in future flight decks are also underway, leveraging leading-edge work in human factors, science and design.","Safety is our continual focus. Looking to the future, we'll be exploring ways we can strengthen global aviation safety in partnership with stakeholders across the aerospace community.","We also continue to invest in talent for the future. At this defining moment, Boeing has taken expanded leadership role with a heightened focus on safety. We'll keep learning from these recent accidents, we'll stay true to our values and we will come through this together as a company and industry.","As we keep safety at the forefront, we also remain focused on stability across our production systems and supply chain, as well as mitigating impacts to our customers. As I mentioned earlier, our best current estimate is return to service of the MAX that begins this quarter.","Based upon this estimate and other factors, we expect to maintain our current production rate of 42 deliveries per month with a focus on supply chain and production systems stability. This will be followed by incremental rate increases that would bring our production rate to 57 by late 2020.","After return to service, we expect the 737 MAX airplanes produced during the grounding and included within inventory will be delivered over several quarters with the majority of them delivering in the first year.","We will continue to assess our production plans as part of our scenario planning process. As mentioned before, the FAA and other regulatory authorities will ultimately determine the timing and conditions of return to service in each relevant jurisdiction.","Should our estimate of the anticipated return to service change, we might need to consider possible further rate reductions or other options including a temporary shutdown of the MAX production line.","I want to reiterate my personal thanks to everyone who continues to be our partner in this journey. We are mindful these are challenging times for many and we remain grateful for your support.","Now let me turn to an overview of our third quarter operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and how we are maintaining financial discipline and prudently managing our liquidity as we work through the safe return to service of the MAX.","With that, let's move to slide 4. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $20 billion and core earnings per share of $1.45, reflecting lower 737 deliveries partially offset by higher defense and services volume. We recorded negative $2.4 billion of operating cash due to the 737 impact. We paid $1.2 billion of dividends in the quarter.","Now let's look at the third quarter operating performance for our businesses. Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $8.2 billion reflecting 62 deliveries. BCA ended the quarter with our backlog of nearly 5,500 airplanes worth $387 billion. As we discussed before, global trade tension is putting near-term pressure on our widebody production rates, especially the 787. I will discuss that in more detail later.","Now over to Defense Space & Security, BDS reported third quarter revenue of $7 billion and booked $5 billion of new orders, demonstrating the continued value we bring to our customers across our Defense Space & Security portfolio. Those orders included contracts for our fifth KC-46 Tanker production lot for the U.S. Air Force and nine AH-64E Apaches for the U.S. Army.","Key milestones for BDS included the MQ-25 unmanned aerial refueler first test flight. Also T-X trainer, now renamed the T-7A Red Hawk performed its 100th test flight. Other accomplishments in the quarter included the first flight of the inaugural P-8A Poseidon for the UK Royal Air Force, and final assembly of the Space Launch System core stage structure. Also noteworthy is the satellite launch services award received by our United Launch Alliance joint venture from the U.S. Air Force.","Moving on to tanker. As mentioned, Boeing received a $2.6 billion contract for production lot five covering 15 KC-46 aircraft spares and support equipment. We delivered nine tankers to the U.S. Air Force in the quarter and 23 year-to-date.","Turning to Global Services. BGS reported revenue of $4.7 billion, representing 14% growth year-on-year. BGS continues to win new business, highlighting the value we bring to our commercial and government customers and the strength of our One Boeing offerings.","In the quarter, BGS booked contracts for commercial modification, component and training services as well as contracts with the U.S. Air Force for F-15 training to Qatar, A-10 Thunderbolt II re-winging and KC-46 Tanker lot five services.","Also in the quarter, India-based carrier SpiceXpress took delivery of the first 737-800 Boeing-converted freighter to expand its air cargo operation. Progress continues towards our planned strategic partnership with Embraer. We're actively engaged with authorities and relevant jurisdictions and have obtained a number of regulatory approvals including clearance to close in the U.S. and Japan.","The European Commission earlier this month opened a Phase 2 assessment in its review of the transaction. We remain convinced that both the Commercial Aviation and the KC-390 joint ventures will increase competition in the market and create value for our customers and the traveling public as well as drive innovation in products and services. We now expect the transaction to close in early 2020.","In summary, our priority continues to be the safe return to service of the 737 MAX and we've continued to allocate additional resources and attention on this effort. At the same time, we are maintaining our focus on keeping the business strong and healthy, while focusing on operational performance.","As we announced yesterday, we made several leadership changes that will further strengthen our company during a challenging time. Stan Deal has succeeded Kevin McAllister as President and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and Ted Colbert has succeeded Stan Deal as President and CEO of Boeing Global Services effective immediately.","Stan brings extensive operational experience in commercial airplanes and trusted relationships with our airline customers and industry partners; and Ted brings to our Global Services business, an enterprise approach to customers and strong digital business expertise, a key component of our long-term growth plans.","We are also grateful to Kevin for his dedicated and tireless service to Boeing, our customers and our communities during a challenging time and for his commitment to support this transition.","With that let's turn to the business environment on Slide 5. We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in Commercial Defense Space & Services. These are sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals with a combined market opportunity of $8.7 trillion over the next 10 years.","In commercial aviation, while we have seen some moderation of traffic growth, global passenger volume continues to be resilient, building on nine straight years of above-trend growth. Passenger traffic this year is growing at a solid 4.5% through August, again outpacing global GDP and tracking with long-term growth rates.","Meanwhile, the air cargo sector is facing more headwinds, as overall volumes have contracted year-to-date amid a challenging trade environment. That said, we continue to see steady utilization of the global freighter fleet while carriers are placing incremental orders to support their fleet replacement needs.","Additionally, traffic data points to solid growth in air cargo intensive sectors, such as pharma, technology and express shipments. Improvements in industrial production and global trade will be key to a rebound in air cargo in 2020.","With an industry outlook for approximately 44,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years and an ecosystem of life cycle solutions needed to maintain and supported, we continue to see sustainable, long-term growth in commercial aviation. This is powered by mature and emerging economies, the growing middle class and continued innovations in business models and products.","We believe the evolution in key market dynamics in aggregate, continues to drive less cyclicality for our industry. These long-term demand fundamentals provide a solid foundation for our commercial business. We are well positioned in this market with a strong portfolio of airplanes, a large and diverse order backlog and a strong One Boeing team.","The narrowbody segment will command a larger share of new deliveries with expected demand for more than 32,000 single-aisle airplanes in the next 20 years. These new airplanes will continue to stimulate growth and provide required replacements for older, less-efficient airplanes. Our 737 program has a backlog of more than 4400 aircraft.","In the widebody segment, we have seen solid order activity this year for our market-leading 787 and 777 families. In the quarter, Korean Air and Air New Zealand placed follow-on orders for the 787 to replace aging aircraft, reflecting the start of the widebody replacement cycle that we expect to accelerate early next decade. We see the need for more than 1000 small to medium widebody aircraft to be replaced over the next decade.","In the near term, as we have shared, the U.S.-China trade situation has presented challenges for our widebody production plans, in particular for the 787 program. As part of our practice for a significant market such as China, we have forecasted orders from operators based on the country as part of our skyline assumptions. The lack of orders from China in the past couple of years has put pressure on the production rate.","We are in the planning window on the rate decision due to the production lead times. Therefore, as part of our disciplined rate management process, we believe it is appropriate to make a production rate adjustment to balance the supply and demand. So beginning in late 2020, we plan to transition the 787 production rate from 14 per month to 12 per month, for approximately two years.","We will maintain this disciplined rate management process going forward, taking into account a host of risks and opportunities. We will continue to assess the demand environment and make adjustments as appropriate in the future.","We'll also continue to monitor and inform the U.S.-China trade discussions. We value and maintain strong relationships with our customers and government stakeholders around the world, reinforcing the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. And we remain hopeful that airplanes will ultimately be part of the trade solution. At our planned rates, our 787 backlog of nearly 530 orders, provides a solid foundation and represents more than 3.5 years of production.","Moving to the 777 program. The current generation 777 continued its steady sales momentum with 14 new orders in the quarter. These provide further support for the 777 bridge.","On 777X development, we continue to progress in our preflight testing, focusing on final systems propulsion and airplane-level test. On the static airplane test results, our detailed analysis of the data is progressing well. What we've seen to-date reinforces our prior assessment that this will not have a significant impact on the design or on the preparations for first flight.","The GE9X engine remains the pacing item, as we work towards first flight of the 777X. GE our engine supplier has made good progress to address the durability challenges. GE has installed retrofit components in the certification test engines and testing has restarted. Once the engines become available, GE and Boeing will need to successfully complete additional testing before we are ready to fly.","We still expect first flight to take place in early 2020. We continue to explore opportunities to improve the time line, such as leveraging our system integration labs and additional airplane ground testing consistent with our commitment to safety.","That said, as we further assess the impact to the GE9X engine and associated risk, we now expect first delivery of the 777-9 to be in early 2021. The combined 777, 777X production rate is five per month. We continue to expect the 777 delivery rate to be approximately 3.5 aircraft per month in 2019. The delivery rate is expected to be at approximately three per month in 2020, as we mitigate some of the impact of the slide in 777X time line by producing more 777 current generation aircraft.","We are focused on further bolstering the 777X skyline. The 777X orders and commitments of 364 aircraft, provide a strong foundation that supports our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft.","On the 767 program, we added 16 new orders in the quarter including 15 for the KC-46 production lot 5. As previously announced, we plan to increase the 767 production rate from 2.5 to three per month in 2020.","In Defense Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. Looking at the defense and space market for the next 10 years, we see $2.5 trillion of opportunities for our business with 40% of that from outside the U.S. The BDS portfolio remains well positioned with proven world-class platforms to address current needs and innovative capable and affordable new franchise programs to build the future.","We continue to see broad support for our products from the Pentagon, NASA and Congress including for procurement of Boeing F-15Ex and F-18 fighter jets, Apache and V-22 Osprey rotorcraft, JDAM weapons, satellite programs, the Space Launch System and key derivative programs like the KC-46 Tanker and the P-8. We also see robust support for our future franchise programs. We are maintaining a sharp focus on these future franchises.","The MQ-25 recently began test flights and we are humbled to honor the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen with the T-7A Red Hawk. We also remain absolutely dedicated to Commercial Crew and the Space Launch System, which will maintain our nation's position as the leading edge of space exploration.","Turning to the services sector. We see the $3.1 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant opportunity for our company. We continue to see growth with expanded service offerings, across the supply chain portfolio and our global digital solutions.","New business in the quarter reflects our superior products both on and off platform with new digital agreements signed with Air Canada for our manpower planning software and with IndiGo for ops control and tail assignment digital solutions. In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains committed to growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future.","So, with that, Greg over to you for our financial results.","Greg Smith","Thanks, Dennis. Good morning everyone. Let's move to slide 6 and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was $20 billion with core earnings per share of $1.45 reflecting lower 737 deliveries, partially offset by higher defense and services volume.","Before we discuss the segment performance, let me also touch on the 737 MAX and explain how the grounding has impacted our financials, what we've done to mitigate some of that impact and what we're focused on today and going forward. For the purpose of our third quarter financial results, we have assumed the regulatory approval for the MAX return to service begins in the fourth quarter this year. While this assumption reflects our best estimate at this time, I just want to reiterate that the actual timing and condition of return to service will be determined by the regulatory authorities and could differ from this assumption and our estimate.","Our third quarter financial results also assume a gradual increase in the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 57 per month by late 2020. We also assume that after return to service of the MAX airplanes produced during the grounding and including within inventory will be delivered over several quarters with the majority of them being delivered within the first year. Any changes to these assumptions could require us to recognize additional financial impact.","We added $872 million of program costs on the 737 in the third quarter. This is primarily to reflect current assumptions regarding timing of return to service and the timing of planned production rate increases. These additional costs will be spread across the undelivered aircraft in the accounting block of approximately 3,100 units and therefore reduce the 737 program margin.","During the quarter, we reassessed our estimate of potential considerations and other in concessions for customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. This reassessment included updated -- updating estimates to reflect revised return to service and production rate assumptions as well as latest information based on engagements with 737 MAX customers.","We have made no significant adjustments to the recorded liability in the quarter.","As we've mentioned, we're also addressing the impact individually customer-by-customer and we will look at various forms of economic value that we can provide. We expect any concessions or other considerations to be provided over a number of years. And therefore, you can expect the impact to our cash flow to affect 2019 and beyond. We continue to see this impact to be more front-end loaded in the first few years but of course will be dependent upon individual conversations with customers.","Looking forward, the key drivers of the financial impact related to the 737 continue to be the return-to-service time line and conditions; the delivery ramp-up, which is dependent on how fast we can deliver aircraft once the fleet returns to service and how fast our customers can accept the aircraft; also includes 737 production rate profile; and as discussed customers regarding potential concessions and considerations.","We expect our financial results to continue to be adversely impacted until we safely return the 737 MAX to service, resume deliveries to our customers and ramp-up production rates. We continue to perform detailed scenario planning around return to service and production rates, including analyzing the implications on our supply chain, customer fleet and deliveries to fully understand the range of financial outcomes.","We will continue to assess our current production plans and incorporate any new insights, such as return-to-service time line, storage capacity, and supply chain all in our analysis to help inform us on whether further rate reductions or other options including a temporary shutdown of the MAX production are needed. We've also taken actions to prudently manage our liquidity, increasing our balance sheet flexibility in managing our spending and laser-focused on productivity. We will continue to diligently review all levers available to minimize the financial impact","It's important to note that everything we do are focused on quality and safety are and always have been our highest priority. We do not compromise these values for cost or schedule. Returning the MAX safely to flight continues to be priority one for us. It's a team effort that leverages the best talent from across Boeing and outside experts. We will continue to apply whatever resources are required to return the 737 MAX safely into the fleet and take the time necessary to do so working hand in hand with our customers.","Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on slide 7. Our Commercial Airplanes business revenue decreased to $8.2 billion during the quarter reflecting lower 737 deliveries. BCA operating margin declined to negative 0.5%, reflecting lower 737 delivery partially offset by higher 787 margin. BCA backlog includes nearly 5,500 airplanes valued at $387 billion equating to more than six years of production.","Let's now turn to Defense Space & Security results on slide 8. Third quarter revenue increased to $7 billion reflecting higher volume on satellites, weapons and new franchise programs T-7A in particular, partially offset by lower F-15 volume. BDS booked operating margin of 10.7% in the quarter reflecting improved performance. During the quarter BDS won key contract awards worth $5 billion and our backlog stands at $62 billion with 30% from outside the U.S.","Let's now turn to Boeing Global Services results on slide 9. In the third quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.7 billion reflecting the acquisition of KLX and higher government services volume. Year-over-year growth of 14% for the quarter continues to outpace the average services market growth rate of 3.5%. BGS booked operating margins of 14.4%. And as I mentioned before BGS margins quarter-to-quarter are subject to fluctuations due to factors such as mix, products and services as well as performance on individual contracts. During the quarter BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $6 billion bringing its backlog now to $21 billion.","Let's now turn to cash flow on slide 10. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was negative $2.4 billion driven by lower 737 deliveries, lower advance payments and timing of receipts and expenditures. We expect continued working capital pressure to adversely affect cash flow until MAX deliveries resume. Strong operating cash from other parts of the business, a strong balance sheet and further balance sheet levers will help provide adequate liquidity during this period.","In the third quarter we paid $1.2 billion in dividends. And as I previously mentioned, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase program. Our long-term balanced cash deployment strategy and commitment to returning cash to shareholders remains unchanged. However in the near term managing our liquidity and balance sheet leverage are top priorities and will continue to be so until the 737 MAX deliveries resume we execute the 737 production rate increases and see stability in the production system.","Let's move now took cash and debt balance on slide 11. We ended the quarter with $10.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. We raised additional debt in the quarter increasing the balance by $5.5 billion, primarily to fund the Embraer acquisition and also to help shore up liquidity position as we work through the current MAX challenges.","Our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet provides us with substantial borrowing capacity through capital markets access and unused credit facility of $6.6 billion. Our long-term goal and strategic objectives remain unchanged and we will continue to use our three business unit strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments and leverage talent and innovation from across the company.","As always we'll continue to keep a close eye on the geopolitical and macroeconomic developments prudently managing risk. As Dennis said, we maintain our disciplined rate management and continue to monitor the environment and make rate adjustments as appropriate in the future.","As a reminder in addition to the MAX, our financials particularly cash flow will also be impacted by the decrease in the 787 production rate and timing of 777X entry into service. Reduction in future deliveries create cash headwind due to lower cash from pre-delivery and delivery payments.","So in summary, while focusing on a very important priority of safe 737 MAX return to service and minimizing the significant impact on our customers and the flying public, our team keeps the core operating engine strong, delivering results and meeting customer commitments.","While we still have a lot of work in front of us, we're confident that we have the right focus, team and resources to navigate through. We're committed to providing you with additional updates on the MAX return to service, progress, production rate plans as we have more information.","We'll strive to continue to keep all of our stakeholders informed with the utmost transparency through our public statements and information posted on our website. Once we have further clarity, we will schedule a follow-up investor and media conference call to discuss financial impacts, provide financial guidance which will capture the puts and takes including the impacts from the recent widebody changes.","With that I'll turn it back over to Dennis for closing comments.","Dennis Muilenburg","All right. Thank you, Greg. These are challenging times first and foremost for the families and loved ones affected by these recent accidents. They will always be on our thoughts. This is also a defining moment for Boeing, and I can assure you that we have learned from this and we'll continue learning. We have changed from this and we will continue changing. And we're committed to coming through this challenging time better and stronger as a company.","We'll stay true to our enduring values of safety, quality and integrity while driving operational excellence across the enterprise. We will never waver in our commitment the importance of our work demands it.","Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers and the flying public. The safe return to service of the 737 MAX is our company's top priority. I want to thank my Boeing teammates who are delivering on this priority and on our other commitments of executing on our key priorities, driving growth and operational excellence across the business in close partnership with our customers, suppliers and regulatory agencies while returning value to our shareholders. With the changes we're making to the MAX software and training, we're confident that the MAX will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly.","The long-term fundamentals of our businesses remain strong and our key priorities are unchanged. Our One Boeing advantage has never been more clear and we will leverage this unique strength to deliver and improve on our commitments to our customers and partners around the world.","With that we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thanks. Good morning, Dennis and Greg.","Greg Smith","Good morning, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Greg, perhaps a question for you on cash. Given MAX production and changes in working capital associated with the aircraft as well as the recent widebody cut on the 87s, how are you thinking about the free cash flow profile of the company over the next few years?","Greg Smith","Yes. Yes. Well, look, considering the circumstances of where we are obviously the cash profile is more challenging than it was. But I'd say the long-term objective that we had in place continues to be in place. I'd say outside of MAX in the service and defense business we continue to see opportunities there. But as you mentioned between getting the 737 MAX back up that will be the single biggest driver safely return that back to service, deliver on our aircraft off the ramp and meeting those rate breaks that we talked about and maintaining stability will be the key driver in the cash flow profile going forward.","We've got more 777X inventory build as a result of the scheduled change so we see that use of cash now peeking in 2020. And obviously with the 787 rate decisions that we announced today and the associate advances that also will have an impact within that time frame. So lots of puts and takes but 737 MAX being the biggest driver through that period.","So when we have better clarity on that path forward and the stability we'll give you a further update of where we think we are over the long-term profile. But again that remains our objective and the underlying engine continues to perform well, but we've got to continue to execute. And like I said those key elements are really going to be the big drivers of cash going forward.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Good morning. Thank you.","Greg Smith","Good morning, Doug.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Harned","If we go back a little ways you had previously said that you'd expected to have a completed fix for the MAX to the FAA by the end of September. So we're in mid-October now that appears to have slipped. But yesterday, Steve Dickson made - at the FAA made some statements that sounded fairly positive regarding software and documentation that Boeing has provided to the FAA. So I'm trying to understand where we stand now. Is there -- what constitutes the delivery of a final fix? And is there a milestone that we should be looking for ahead of an FAA certification flight?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. Doug good question. And as you know we've been working this at a very detailed level, basically every hour, every day in close coordination with the FAA. And we are in the process of delivering those certification items and that includes the final software, the training products, the system description documents. And that has been an iterative process.","We did start that incremental process in September. The review cycles have taken a little longer than originally planned. But I think that's a good representation of the fact that we're diving deep into the documents, we're answering all the questions. And the FAA has taken the time to make sure we get it right. So I think that level of scrutiny is good.","We have -- now have the final software in our regression testing labs. As you heard from Administrator Dickson, yesterday the FAA has been involved in that final software delivery. You also heard from Administrator Dickson that we've now delivered the final system description document of the changes to the MAX. That's another important milestone. So there are tangible milestones being achieved, but we still have more work to do.","Last week we did complete an initial dry run of the certification test flight. We anticipate doing a couple more dry run kind of flights. But to a next big milestone that you might look forward Doug to your question when we get to the certification flight that will be a key weigh point on the way to the airworthiness directive.","And again that final decision around the airworthiness directed to un-ground the fleet and bring the MAX back up that will be the regulator's decision, that will be the FAA's decision. But we're going to lean forward and provide every piece of data we can. We're going to make sure the depth of analysis is complete. We're going to answer every single question.","And I can tell you we are making steady daily progress. We have a well-defined plan and we're performing against that plan. And the preeminent focus here is on safety. We're going to take the time to get it right, make sure it's safe. And we'll continue to share the milestone progress as we go.","Doug Harned","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yes, good morning Dennis, Greg.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hey Peter.","Peter Arment","Dennis, maybe you could just talk about 787 decision. This is really, obviously, the first production cut for that program. It's been so successful. Maybe just on holding that rate at 12 a month kind of confidence levels around that just thoughts about in general the longer-term production profile for the 787? Thanks.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. Peter it's a good question. Obviously not a decision that we take lightly. As Greg mentioned and as we've talked about before production rate discipline is one of our key management principles, something that will drive stable, long-term growth.","Our prospects for the long-term widebody market haven't changed. We still see that as positive. As I mentioned in my comments, we see a market for roughly 1,000 new small to medium-sized widebodies over the next decade. So that replacement wave cycle early in the next decade that we've talked about previously we still see that coming.","But in the near-term, our skyline has been dependent on orders from China. And now that we're within lead time on our production system and those orders from China have not materialized, we need to make a decision. And so that's what you see reflected here.","We think the decision to take the rate down to 12 for approximately two months is a good -- or excuse me for two years is a good disciplined decision and fits with the market signals that we're seeing. We're going to continue to monitor the U.S.-China trade policy discussions and then we'll continue to make our plans going forward.","We have a very disciplined process for looking at the market, our supply chain health, all of the other parameters that might affect our customers' decision making process. And the decision we're announcing today is something that's consistent with that disciplined approach. So bottom line here is our long-term prospects have not changed, but we need to make prudent decisions here in the near-term that match with the economic realities.","Operator","Next we'll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. Dennis, you've had a mid-teen BCA margin target out there a while. I'm just curious with all the changes, I guess the 37s now 400 basis points maybe lowering the block program, looking forward the 87 rates and the 777, are we now looking more in the 10% to 12% range? And then Greg just a clarification on share repurchase. I was interpreting from your comments you mean you don't anticipate share repurchase until 2021 after everything is back up? Is that accurate?","Dennis Muilenburg","Greg you want to take the second question first?","Greg Smith","Sure. I think -- don't anticipate share repo until we've got return to service. We're executing on the production rates and reaching the stability that we expect. And once we get to that level then we'll reassess our cash deployment efforts. And, of course, as I mentioned we've got additional debt on the balance sheet and we plan to address that as well.","So we'll keep you up to speed, but those are the key milestones to watch for. And until we're satisfied with where we are and we're generating the cash that we would expect as a result of reaching those milestones, we'll re-execute on our cash deployment strategies. But as I said our long-term objective is certainly what it was, but we've got to get through that -- those milestones before we'll readdress repo.","Dennis Muilenburg","And Myles to your first question, similar thing on the operating margin side. Our long-term objectives and targets have not changed. We're still driving towards a mid-teen margins business. We haven't altered our plans for that. But again in the near-term, our laser focus is on the safe return to service of the MAX. That is the most important thing we can do and we're going to invest all of our resource and focus in making that happen.","The fundamentals of the business, the investments we're making in digitizing our enterprise, lean principles in our factories, a lot of these production rate discipline and efficiency we're continuing to drive during this interim time period. While we have had to make production rate reductions on the 737 line for good reasons, we're also using this as an opportunity to continue to invest in the line and maturing some of our advanced manufacturing processes. And that will make for a healthier production system for the long run and keep us on track for those long-term targets. But in the near term, no question, our focus is on the safe return to service of the MAX. And I can tell you without any question our preeminent focus every day going forward is on safety and quality.","Myles Walton","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Greg, just a clarification on the cash. Are you no longer receiving MAX PPs and advances? I just -- I didn't quite catch that out on your earlier comment. And then on the 87 margin increase, I mean you've had several steps upward in that margin in the last several quarters. Are we to assume that this is similar in scale in terms of the increase? Or should it be significantly less because of the rate decision? Just wanted to dive in there just because you have good deferred production numbers there and so it looked like that might have been better?","Greg Smith","The team continues to do a great job in executing on their plans across not only the two sites, but within the supply chain with the partners as well in integrating the mix between 9s, 10s and 8s. The team has done a great job and you're seeing the results of that in the margin. The profile that you've seen, you should expect that to continue as we work through these blocks. As we talked about there are some key levers within those blocks our own productivity, supplier step-down as well as mix. That will be favorable to the margin as we work through the block. So that's all about executing on those fundamentals. And if we do that and do that as planned, you'll continue to see margin expansion associated with the program.","On advances, obviously the profile of advances in particular on the 737 has changed dramatically and appropriately so. So we are still getting some advances. But with the shutdown all of those have been rescheduled. And that profile again is very different than it would have been clearly if we were at full rate. So we continue to work with each of our customers on this. But again as we talk about cash flow going forward as we execute on the rates going up and do that and maintain stability through that period and the efficiencies, we'll start to see that advance stream picking up and associated back with a higher delivery. So obviously a key enabler for cash flow going forward. But as we're at this period right now, as I said, you're going to see continued pressure on cash -- on operating cash until we get back to service.","Carter Copeland","And so just to be clear on that 87 margin, the step-up was similar to what you've seen in some of the recent quarters?","Greg Smith","Yes. It varies from quarter-to-quarter Carter just depending on -- again depending on mix and delivery profile and just overall kind of again model mix plays into that pretty significantly as well.","Carter Copeland","Okay. Thanks, Greg.","Greg Smith","Okay. You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Hey, good morning guys.","Greg Smith","Hey, Ron.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hey, Ron.","Ron Epstein","How do we think about -- in the backdrop with the change in leadership with Boeing commercial, how do we think about where NMA stands now, right? I mean the broader margin keeps moving right along, right? So how are you guys thinking about NMA? And how should we think about NMA? And is that still a project you guys are interested in so on and so forth?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Ron first of all let me be really clear on our priorities. Our priority is safe return to service for the MAX and that's been clear to our team, clear to all of our suppliers, clear to all of our constituencies. And we've applied additional resources there. We put additional talent there. That is our focus. Now with that in mind, we are continuing to drive forward with our efforts evaluating NMA. We still are not at a decision point nor are we ready to be at a decision point yet. We're continuing to mature the business case.","We're continuing to invest in risk reduction around the production system of the future and that continues to be a productive effort for us. So we'll continue to leverage those investments. And when we're ready to make a decision we will. So still a project of interest. We're still looking at a middle of the next decade entry-into-service time frame as we talk to our customers. And we'll make a good prudent decision when we're ready. But let there be no question, our focus is on safe return to service for MAX.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. So maybe you can walk us through the milestones required to achieve your FAA airworthiness directive, the sequence of those milestones and then the milestones between receiving the AD and resumption of U.S. service, because most of your customers in the U.S. are talking about flying again in February not at year-end. Thanks so much.","Dennis Muilenburg","You bet. Cai, good question. Let me just walk you through that at the top level. And again, this is a very detailed plan that we've laid out with all of our teams and stakeholders and one that we're working together with the FAA and our regulators. In the near term, we're marching through the technical steps if you will and that includes finalizing the software. That will go into a series of simulation -- evaluations. There's a near-term milestone that we referred to as the line pilot evaluation that will take that final software and with external line pilots from airlines come in and evaluate the handling quality of the airplane.","We'll also have a external set of pilots coming in, again authorized by the regulators that will conduct what we call a Joint Operation Evaluation Board. And that set of pilots will evaluate the training materials. So over the near term those are two key milestones for us. One that evaluates the software update to the airplane; and the second that evaluates the training products.","In that same time frame, as those two milestones are completed, we'll roll into the certification flight that I mentioned earlier. That will be another key milestone for us. And then after all of the assessments are completed, those evaluations are done, that will roll into the Airworthiness Directive decision that the FAA will make and that other regulators will make.","Subsequent to the issuance of the Airworthiness Directive and the ungrounding of the airplane, then we would move into the phase of ungrounding the aircraft and incrementally bringing up fleet operations for our airline customers. And the reference points that you're seeing out there from our customers are perfectly aligned with the detailed technical plan that I just walked you through.","So they're very aware of that plan. And there is a time period between the airworthiness directive and when they can resume full operations, revenue-bearing operations. And that includes bringing each individual airplane up, making sure that each airplane is safe and ready to perform.","We've been working, as we've been storing airplanes to ensure the health of those vehicles, but we'll be working tail number by tail number with our customers to ensure they can bring the fleet up back successfully and then get back to full revenue-bearing operations.","And that's why you see a bit of a time lag between the Airworthiness Directive and what our customers are now quoting as going operational dates. So, hopefully that gives you a feel for the time phasing of the plan. And ultimately, bringing all of those grounded airplanes back up and all of those stored airplanes back up to fleet operations will be a multi-quarter operation.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Good morning. Dennis, Greg, staying on the 737, maybe moving at a slightly different direction. In terms of the backlog, it's obviously remained stable here over the last couple of quarters. But with the easing backdrop in some of the MAX issues, have you not seen a wave of interest in cancellations? Maybe just talk more about that dialogue with customers. I mean, at a minimum, it seems like advances are pushing out. Obviously, the orders aren't there, et cetera. So want some color.","Dennis Muilenburg","You bet, Rajeev. We've been having a good productive conversations with our customers around the world. We're engaged with them daily, keeping them abreast of the progress we're making on the safe return to service. We've seen continued strength in our backlog, stability in that backlog.","Our customers still, around the world, see the value of the 737 MAX and they know what it will ultimately bring to their operations. So that backlog of roughly 4,400 aircraft has remained solid and stable. We have had discussions with customers who, given time lines and fleet needs, may want to move skyline positions. In some cases, model differences or model trades are options.","So as we think through customer compensation models, as you know, we're having those discussions with our customers. There is some trade space around delivery profiles in skyline positions. But all of that within the context of what I think, overall, is a very stable backlog position and we continue to see strong customer commitment around the globe.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Spingarn","Hi. Good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hi. Rob.","Rob Spingarn","Greg, with regard to the concessions not changing ,no material change there, it does seem, and to the prior couple of questions, that we have slipped to the right for RTS, at least from October to likely December. So I wanted to see why we wouldn't see a change there, because it certainly adds a couple hundred delayed airplanes.","And then the other part of it is, how aligned are the customers on this concession figure? If I understood correctly last time, they had not necessarily endorsed the figures that were in the 5.9 billion.","Greg Smith","Yes.","Rob Spingarn","Those weren't necessarily based on agreements with them has that changed?","Greg Smith","Yes. No. So, Rob, I would say, there's a lot that goes in that. So multiple data points, obviously, going into that and we assess it on a regular basis and obviously go through that quarter-by-quarter. So that could change, obviously, with time. So our discussions with our customers, the methodology, their expectations and kind of working through customer-by-customer the impact on them and then ultimately a form of settlement continues to be a regular dialogue and it will be.","So we did not see a change in what we have for a liability this quarter. That does not mean that we won't -- could not see a change going forward. This is part of our regular, I'll say, closing process that we will go through every one of those in what's outstanding and assess what we believe is the liability, again, based on multiple data points including conversations and overall, I'll say, kind of impact that they have experienced. But we don't, again, expect significant change in that. But, again, we assess it every quarter.","Rob Spingarn","Thank you, Greg.","Greg Smith","You're welcome.","Operator","And next we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hi, Seth.","Seth Seifman","Greg, sorry, I definitely appreciate that you guys aren't giving guidance right now. But just in terms of thinking about the cash trajectory going forward, nearly $3 billion of cash burn in the quarter, plus $1 billion for the dividend. Do we think about something similar in Q4? And I would assume that Q1 will still have some challenges in it.","There's some cash on the balance sheet, but some of that is earmarked for Embraer. You talked about the potential maybe to still have additional balance sheet levers. Can you talk a little bit more, maybe even just in broad numbers, about the near-term liquidity and balance sheet profile and what you expect to do?","Greg Smith","Yes. Well, look, over the short term, as you know, on a quarterly basis, just through timing of expenditures and just through advances, that varies significantly or can vary significantly. So I would not take necessarily one quarter and apply it to the next, as you know.","So we've got key milestones in the fourth quarter around advances, around deliveries and of course within our defense business as well. So there's a lot of puts and takes in there Seth. But that RTS assumption and then that production rate increase in delivering those units, again off of our ramp, are real key drivers to cash going forward. So, if those assumptions and our estimates change, that profile obviously will change resulting in that.","So that's the near term, I'd say movements. Beyond that, if you went outside of MAX again, the services business, defense business is doing a nice job on their working capital. We're reprioritizing spending as we navigate through this.","And as I said, we do have additional balance sheet levers. If we need to pull additional levers, we'll do that. We don't see that over the short term. But we're again managing this prudently, best we can and running various scenarios to really kind of understand our banding around liquidity and taking some proactive actions internally as well as in the debt markets. And we'll continue to do that, again, until we have final RTS and then start delivering airplanes.","Seth Seifman","Operator","Next we'll go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Thanks for taking me on. Good morning guys. I'd like to talk a little bit about 777X certification process. If you decide -- I don't think you've said whether you're going to go derivative or new type yet, but how does that decision impact the -- not only the process itself, but the operating economics for the airline customers when they consider the benefit; like training costs and things like that of a derivative versus a new type? Thanks.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Hunter on that point, we're continuing to work through the certification and development process and -- with the FAA. The key is going to be any process updates that we might learn from the 737 MAX, any revisions to the certification timelines or procedures, we're thinking through that and any lessons learned that we might have, any applications we might want to make to the 777X.","As I said we're continuing to march towards our first flight early in the coming year and then EIS now we're looking at first delivery early in 2021. And we'll be thinking through all the details of that certification plan with the regulators over the next many months. And again, if there are any updates to the plan or any of the requirements, we'll be sure to discuss those and factor those into the planning going forward.","Maurita Sutedja","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","That will be from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Thank you. On that topic Dennis, again, bigger picture it's been a while with the MAX grounding. You've seen what it takes to certify and we've seen some of the shortfalls in your previous processes. So just -- over the long term beyond 777X to what extent could the future aircraft development just essentially cost more whether it's engineering testing certification? And in the context and if there's some uncertainty around that, why does it make sense to maintain the current capital allocation priorities?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yes. Jon once again as we take a look at our development processes, we're always continuously learning and applying any lessons learned we might have from the previous programs. And certainly through the process of the MAX development and flight testing and everything that we're proceeding with right now to get to safe return to service, anything we're learning from that process is factoring into all of our development programs going forward.","We're taking a hard look at our safety review board processes our certification processes. We're going to take a look at flight deck designs for the future. All of those things will factor into our future development programs. But in terms of our priorities for capital allocation, those priorities haven't changed.","As we've always said, our number one use of cash is investment in organic growth and that continues to be the case. We think that is the best use of our capital. It's the way that we build our future. And we haven't seen anything here that would turn us in a different direction, so we're going to continue to invest in organic growth for the future.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Senior Vice President of Communications. Ms. Toulouse please go ahead.","Anne Toulouse","Good morning. We will continue the call with media questions for Dennis and Greg. And John we're ready for that first question. [Operator Instructions].","Operator","And first we'll go to Eric Johnson with Reuters News. Please go ahead.","Eric Johnson","Hi Dennis, hi Greg. Thank you very much.","Dennis Muilenburg","Hi Eric.","Eric Johnson","And so the comments you've made is focused on FAA approval, but I wonder how you see the risk of surprise and delays from overseas regulators as they take longer to or ask for more changes. And then separately, I wanted to get some details as you can on why -- on the decision to fire Kevin McAllister? Thank you.","Dennis Muilenburg","All right. Eric on your first question regarding international regulators, we've been working hand-in-hand with the FAA on those interfaces throughout this entire process. The FAA has convened something that they call the certification management team which includes Transport Canada, ANAC out of Brazil, and EASA out of Europe.","We've been engaged with the regulators in China and -- frankly several dozen regulators around the world. So this is all a highly coordinated process with the FAA's lead regulator role.","We've taken some of the same deliverables that I mentioned earlier things like the system description document, things like other certification deliverables and with the FAA's approval have shared those with the international regulators. Those are also undergoing review. So all of this work is being done, concurrently.","Now until the reviews are complete, we may have additional actions additional questions from some of these international regulators. As I mentioned earlier, while the coordination is ongoing it could well be that approvals will vary by jurisdiction. And again the regulators will make that decision. Ultimately it will be their time line.","But we are and will continue to share the data consistently and transparently with all of the regulators. Our interest here is on the safe return to service of the MAX. That is our focus.","And we're working that hand-in-hand with the FAA. And we'll continue to support the other regulators, as well. To your second question on our leadership changes, again, our focus here is on ensuring that we continue to field the strongest team we can.","And these are decisions that we've made as a company, that are aligned with our leadership plans, our plans to have a strong and growing company for the future. And these changes are aligned with that plan. Our focus is on safety and quality, and performance, and delivering operational excellence.","Operator","Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson","Hi. Good morning.","Dennis Muilenburg","Good morning. Hi, Julie.","Julie Johnsson","Hi. Hey, would you mind walking us through your expectations for trade ceasefire, between the U.S. and China? President Trump a few weeks ago, hinted at a mega-potential Boeing deal coming with a Phase one agreement.","We've been puzzling as to what he was referring to, when he mentioned $16 billion to $20 billion in orders. And I'm also wondering, how we should square that up with the 787 rate cut today.","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. Julie, good question and as I mentioned, we're continuing to engage with the constituencies in both the U.S. and China on the trade discussions. We've been continuing to inform those discussions.","We continue to see, benefit to both countries with a healthy aerospace ecosystem. Here in the U.S., as you know the aerospace industry is the largest exporter. We contribute about $80 billion of trade surplus per year to the U.S. economy.","And we are a heavy manufacturing industry. We generate strong manufacturing jobs here in the U.S. China, clearly needs the airlift capacity. Of those 44,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, that I've mentioned about 7,700 of those are in China.","And so there's mutual interest in both countries that we continue to see. I think the recent trade discussions have been productive. They're moving in a good direction. But given the time line, and the fact that we don't have firm orders from China at this point, we're within production lead times.","And so we have to make the decision on the 787 line which is what you see reflected in our announcement today. We're going to continue to monitor and support the China trade discussions. Those are still very important for the future.","But for purposes of our company, we have to be, very disciplined in our production rate management. And we're going to continue to do that. And the decision that we're announcing today is consistent with that discipline.","Anne Toulouse","Hey, John, we have time for one last question please.","Operator","And that will be from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Please go ahead.","David Koenig","Yeah. Thank you very much. Mr. Muilenburg, looking ahead to your congressional testimony next week, I'm curious, how are you preparing for that? What kind of reception do you expect? And will you meet with any families of the passengers from the accident flights, who say they are going to be there?","Dennis Muilenburg","Yeah. David, we are preparing for those hearings. Of course, we've been supporting the document requests from the committees both the Senate and House. And we're going to continue to do that.","We welcome the discussion and the questions. And I'm looking forward to participating in those hearings. I anticipate there will be tough questions, challenging questions, a lot of scrutiny.","And frankly, we support the scrutiny on the work that we're doing. I think everybody here is aligned on, the objective of a safe aviation system for our country. And I know that's the interest of the committees. That is clearly the interest of our company.","And I look forward to participating in those hearings and talk about what we're doing, all again with a focus on safety. And that's our culture. That's what our company is about. And I hope to represent that, represent it well, at the hearings next week.","And as I mentioned earlier, our sympathies continue to go out to the families and loved ones of those that have been affected by these accidents. That will never go away. And I anticipate that some of those families will be represented next week. And I hope to be able to express my sympathies to them, as we're at the hearings.","Anne Toulouse","Okay. That concludes our earnings call. Thank you for joining us today.

Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions, are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Stephanie Pope, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Pope, please go ahead.","Stephanie Pope","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. I am Stephanie Pope, and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer.","After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we may include in our discussions this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking disclaimers at the end of this Web presentation.","Now I will turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","W. James McNerney","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everybody. Let me start today by addressing the evolving business environment, followed by some thoughts on our performance during the quarter. After that, Greg will walk through our financial results and outlook, and we'll take your questions.","Starting with the business environment on Slide 2. Despite slower global economic growth and a range of uncertainties, including the European sovereign debt crisis, we continue to see positive worldwide expansion in air traffic. Passenger traffic, in particular, remains resilient, led by trends in emerging markets. Cargo traffic, on the other hand, is stabilizing, with growth expected early next year. This is an area we will continue to monitor closely in the months ahead.","Customer demand for our Commercial Airplanes is being driven roughly equally by a strong replacement cycle and worldwide fleet growth. Deferrals and cancellations remain at or below our historical averages, and we continue to foresee aircraft financing as broadly adequate and available through 2012.","With 694 new orders thus far in 2012, we expect order traffic to remain strong through year end, with a book-to-bill ratio finishing well above 1, primarily driven by demand for the 737 MAX.","Customer response to the 737 MAX remains brisk. We are receiving new orders and converting previous commitments at a steady pace with 649 firm orders among more than 1,200 total orders and commitments. The recent order from United Airlines for 150 737s pushed the 737 program above 10,000 orders for all 737 models, marking the first commercial airplane program in history to surpass the 10,000 order mark.","With approximately 4,000 total airplanes on order, our backlog is one of the most balanced and diverse by geographic region and product type that we have ever experienced, with about 2\/3 of it committed from airlines based outside of the U.S. and Europe.","We continue to focus on steadily increasing production rates to deliver that backlog faster and create new capacity for customers wanting to get more efficient airplanes into their fleet sooner.","Overall, we are positioned exceptionally well in the growing commercial airplane market, with a superior lineup of innovative new products and services that deliver unmatched fuel efficiency and operational performance.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security now. While the threat of budget sequestration and further U.S. defense cuts continues to create uncertainty. International markets continue to offer a broad range of new sales opportunities. As you know, an extended downturn in U.S. defense spending has been our planning assumption for several years. And our teams have taken substantial steps to maximize operating efficiencies and reduce our infrastructure costs.","We remain committed to continued action in this regard to ensure our near-term performance and competitiveness, while delivering greater value to budget-constrained customers and continuing to fund investment in future capabilities.","Leveraging the strength of our expanded international presence and partnerships, we expect the substantial share gains made in recent years will continue, generating up to 30% of our Defense revenues in the near future. With our portfolio of proven, affordable and reliable systems and services, combined with a track record of strong execution and innovation, we believe we are well-positioned for continued success in this constrained and challenging environment.","Turning to the second quarter highlights on Slide 3. Core operational performance was strong during the quarter, and we achieved some key milestones across both of our major businesses. Commercial Airplanes generated healthy results as production and services programs continue to make productivity gains. We delivered 150 airplanes for the quarter for a total of 287 airplanes year-to-date, including 11 787s and 13 747-8s. We also completed 3 additional 787s, which are ready to be delivered to our next customer, Air India, once an impending government review process is complete.","We delivered the 4,000th next-generation 737 and the first passenger 747-8. Lufthansa now has 2 747-8s in revenue service. We also completed final assembly of the first 787 built in South Carolina and received FAA certification of that new facility.","Condition of assembly and out-of-sequence work within the 787 production system has improved significantly. And airplanes are now flowing off out of final assembly in Everett without a stop in our modification center. With stability now achieved at 3.5 airplanes per month, we expect to increase the rate of 787 production to 5 per month by the end of this year, tracking to our plan to reach a rate of 10 per month across our final assembly lines by late 2013.","On the 747-8, we successfully transitioned to a production rate of 2 airplanes per month. As we stabilize at that rate, we continue to focus on productivity to drive increased profitability.","In addition to its sales momentum, definition of the 737 MAX continues to mature to plan. We recently firmed up our maximum takeoff weight projections, extending the airplane's existing range advantage significantly to allow our customers the flexibility to open up new markets. We are on schedule to reach firm configuration in 2013 and to enter service in 2017.","Our disciplined increases in production rates on the 737 and 777 also remain on plan. The 737 rate will increase to 38 per month in the second quarter of 2013 and then move up to 42 per month in the first half of 2014.","Production rate on the 777 program will increase to 8.3 per month in the first quarter of 2013. These 2 programs continue to generate substantial value for our customers and our stakeholders.","Defense, Space & Security also generated strong operating results for the quarter, delivering 35 aircraft and 1 satellite for a total of 65 aircraft and 4 satellites year-to-date. We also captured several new and follow-on awards, including the F-15 Singapore performance-based logistic follow-on contract, Apache Block III low rate initial production for the U.S. Army and the first international contract in our growing cyber security business.","A key execution milestone was met during the quarter, when the KC-46 Tanker program successfully completed its Preliminary Design Review with the U.S. Air Force. The review demonstrated that the preliminary design meets systems requirements and establishes the basis for proceeding with detailed design. The program will now focus on the Critical Design Review plan for the second half of 2013 and remains on plan to deliver 18 combat-ready tankers by 2017.","In the unmanned systems area, the autonomous X-37B spacecraft returned safely to Earth after 469 days in orbit. We also completed first flight of the autonomous hydrogen-powered Phantom Eye long endurance unmanned aircraft, another key milestone as we continue to perfect this technology.","In summary, strong core operational performance continues across both of our businesses as we move into the remaining 2 quarters of the year. This momentum, combined with a backlog of $374 billion and an expanding portfolio of market-leading products and services, has strengthened our outlook for 2012 and increased our confidence for delivering on our growth plans in the years to come.","Now over to Greg who will discuss the details of our financial results and our outlook. Greg?","Gregory D. Smith","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with the second quarter financial results on Slide 4. Revenue for the quarter was $20 billion, up 21% from last year, driven by higher Commercial Airplane deliveries and Defense volume. Net earnings were $1.27 per share, up 13%, excluding pension expense, reflecting strong core operational performance from both of our businesses. Operating margins of 7.7% and operating cash flow of $908 million again reflect strong performance across our core businesses.","Let me discuss our Commercial Airplane business on Slide 5. Commercial -- Boeing Commercial Airplanes' second quarter revenue was $11.8 billion, up 34% from the same quarter last year, reflecting the planned and successfully executed increase in airplane deliveries. Commercial operating margins were strong at 10.2%, reflecting solid core operating performance across programs. Gross inventory for the company includes approximately $23.5 billion related to the 787 program, an expected increase from the second quarter of approximately $1.9 billion as we continue to ramp up production rates on the program.","Included in the work in process inventory are the deferred production costs. The deferred balance for the program was $13.2 billion and at the end of the second quarter and includes approximately 56 airplanes still in process. As I stated previously, the deferred production balance will continue to grow as we increase production rates and introduce the 787-9 derivative as we see deferred production peaking at slightly over $20 billion, then declining after the program achieves the planned rate of 10 per month and stabilizes at that level. Increasing profitability remains a top priority on this program as we continue to identify opportunities to improve producibility and drive cost reductions in our factories and throughout the supply chain. Commercial Airplanes backlog remains a strong $302 billion at the end of the second quarter.","Moving now to Slide 6, our Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing Defense, Space & Security second quarter revenue increased 7% to $8.2 billion, with solid operating margins of 9.1%. Military Aircraft quarterly revenues increased 13% to $4.1 billion, driven by increased delivery volume on AEW&C and Apache programs. Operating margins decreased to 8.8%, reflecting strong core operating performance, offset by an inventory adjustment on the A160 program due to near-term market conditions and technology maturity. Network & Space Systems revenues of $1.9 billion decreased from last year, driven by lower volume associated with the Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. Operating margins of 6.7% reflect lower earnings due to a onetime positive contract adjustment in the prior period at United Launch Alliance.","Global Services & Support revenue increased 11% to $2.2 billion for the quarter, primarily driven by higher revenue on integrated logistics support. Operating margins were strong at 11.9%, reflecting performance improvements in maintenance, modification and upgrade programs.","Defense, Space & Security backlog remains constant in the quarter at $72 billion, reflecting over 2x its 2012 revenue. International business remains very strong, with approximately 37% of our current Defense backlog representing sales to customers outside the United States.","Now turning to Slide 7 in our other businesses. Boeing Capital generated $31 million segment earnings in the quarter. The portfolio balance declined to $4.1 billion on normal portfolio runoff and asset sales. During the quarter, unallocated expense was $200 million higher than the prior period due to higher pension expense in 2012.","Let me turn to Slide 8, and I'll discuss cash flow. Increased commercial deliveries and strong operating performance in both of our businesses generated $1.7 billion of operating cash before pension funding. Operating cash flow of $908 million includes $763 million of planned discretionary pension contributions made in the quarter. Cash flows are expected to continue building through the balance of the year as we continued our disciplined cash management focus and execute on planned increase in commercial deliveries.","Turning now to cash and debt balances on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with $10.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, which includes $422 million of debt repayments made in the quarter. Our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. Capital expenditures of approximately $356 million were as expected.","Turning now to Slide 10, and we'll discuss our outlook. Due to strong performance in the first half and the outlook for the balance of the year, we're increasing our earnings per share guidance for 2012 by $0.25 to be between $4.40 and $4.60 per share. We have solid plans in place to execute our growth plan. However, we\u2019re recognizing that there is still a lot of work to accomplish, and this guidance continues to include consideration for uncertainties and risks associated with that ongoing business growth. We're also raising our revenue guidance for the year to be between $79.5 billion and $81.5 billion to reflect increased volume driven by F-15 Saudi wins earlier in the year. Our forecast for Commercial Airplane deliveries remains at between 585 and 600 airplanes. Our forecast continues to include a combined 70 to 85 787s and 747-8 deliveries, split roughly equally between the 2 programs.","The planned increased deliveries in the second half of the year are driven by continued successful execution of production rate increases, increased change incorp aircraft completions and newly manufactured 787 airplanes flowing directly off the production line to our flight line. Our forecast for Commercial Airplane revenues remains unchanged at between $47.5 billion and $49.5 billion for the year.","Commercial Airplane operating margin guidance has been increased and is now expected to be approximately 9%, reflecting the strong performance on production and service programs. We expect commercial operating margins during the second half of the year to be lower than the first half, primarily due to dilution from the 787 and the 747-8 deliveries, as well as increased investments and period expenses associated with increased deliveries and production rates.","Defense, Space & Security revenue is increased to be between $31.5 billion and $32 billion, reflecting increased volume on F-15. Operating margins are expected to remain at greater than 9% as we continue to focus on maximizing efficiencies and reducing infrastructure costs across BDS.","We continue to expect operating cash flow for the year to be greater than $5 billion, including $1.5 billion discretionary contribution to our pension plan. Other segment expense remains at about $200 million and unallocated expense of approximately $1.5 billion.","R&D expense for 2012 is also unchanged, forecasted to be between $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion as we continue to invest for future growth. And capital expenditures remain at approximately $2 billion.","Overall, second quarter performance continues to deliver strong operating results, and we expect that performance to continue as we remain focused on production program execution and profitability, rate ramp-up and ongoing productivity improvements across the enterprise.","Now I'll turn it over to Jim for some final thoughts.","W. James McNerney","Thank you, Greg. With a strong first half performance behind us and a strengthened outlook for the remainder of the year, our team remains focused on disciplined execution, quality and productivity improvements and meeting customer commitments. Our priorities going forward are unchanged: successful production ramp-up and profitability across our Commercial Airplane programs, performance to plan on our development efforts on the 787-9 and the 737 MAX and Air Force Tanker, and repositioning our Defense business while extending our core programs and expanding internationally.","I must say, I am proud again of our team's achievements, and I have confidence in our ability to deliver on our goals for the remainder of the year. With strong product and services strategies, a diverse backlog and a commitment to innovation and continuous improvement, we are well-positioned for sustained growth in the years ahead.","Now we'd be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Rob Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This question is for either or both of you. You provided a nice guidance boost, and it's more than we had expected at the second quarter. But as Greg just noted, there is still risks in the second half, which in part seems evidenced by your 9% BCA margin target. So the question is, what are you continuing to protect for in the current guidance for H2 in both businesses? And specifically, how does the introduction of the MAX into the 737 program pull factor in?","Gregory D. Smith","So Rob, the MAX is in the guidance that you see, and we're expecting to introduce that into the block probably sometime in the third quarter. But when you look at the balance of the year, there's certainly -- we're provisioning for some risks there. And with regards to rate ramp-up that we have planned for the balance of the year, I think we've got good plans in place. And I think we'll execute that to plan, but we're making sure that we're getting everything in order and having the appropriate diligence put into that. We're making some investment in productivity and tools in the balance -- the back half of the year. And obviously, state taxes increased slightly as we think through the -- look at the delivery profiles through the balance. And as I said, the pricing provisioning for the MAX is already in the guidance that we provided. But that's essentially it.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Anything other Defense side?","Gregory D. Smith","No.","Operator","And let's go to Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to dig a little bit more into that 737 block situation. You're not only going to be adding MAXs, but I believe some current NG aircraft that are probably facing some pricing pressure out there in the competitive market. And you have 2,000-and-change aircraft in the block right now. You'll probably add, I don't know, 500, 600, something like that, Greg. Could you maybe quantify how much pressure we might expect on the 737 gross margin? Any kind of context?","Gregory D. Smith","Well Joe, as I said, it's in our guidance. We're certainly -- just like I talked about before, any time we introduce a new airplane, there's certainly some introductory pricing with new customers. We've got learning curve obviously on the new airplane, and we're working that. We're working productivity across the board to try to offset any of that. And I think we've covered that appropriately in the balance half of the guidance we provided. So I think we got it well understood, and we're going after it. So I'm not, I don't think, as concerned about it as some of the folks that I've seen publish on this topic are.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is the bigger issue the MAX? Or is it the pricing on the remaining NGs?","Gregory D. Smith","Well, I think it's just -- as I said, it\u2019s any time you're ramping down a program and then ramping up a new one, certainly, there's pricing considerations taken in that. Customer by customer, it's different. But again, I think we know where it is. We're working through our production system. We're working through our supply chain. And again, I think we've got good plans in place to address it.","Operator","And our next question is from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On the 787, Jim, you said that right now you're on-track in terms of production to ramp to 5 per month by year end and then 10 per month at the end of next year. But could you describe what are the things that you're looking for as the most important hurdles to have absolute confidence you're going to make those goals? And specifically, can you comment on Charleston? I know the aft fuselage has been a little bit of an issue down there, and where do you stand on that?","W. James McNerney","Well, you're right. I mean, the aft fuselage in Charleston is a hot spot for us, and we're addressing it. I don't think it's a showstopper in terms of getting to rate, but it is something we're focused on. I think there are a couple of other areas in the supply chain that have been well known to us for a couple of years now. And we've been addressing them in a very disciplined fashion. Again, we don't see trains stopping as result of it. We have a little more work to do in a couple of places. But the big thing, as you know, is getting the final production line steadied and producing airplanes with no further stops in the modification center. That has been happening according to plan. That is probably the single most important thing. The -- and also that we're getting the modification airplanes that we're still going to be working on here for another 1.5 years, plus that those come out, that the work scope is understood, and that those come out as planned. I think you noticed for the first time in a long time on one of our development programs, we produced more planes than we delivered this quarter as some of the machinations with our Air India customer had to get settled out as they went through a political transition there. So it's not as if we don't have issues, but I think we know what they are, and we're working on them.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then on that point about producing more than you've delivered, if you put Air India aside, do you feel you're on-track right now in terms of the deliveries? I know there haven't been too many just recently here. And I just wanted to get a sense if getting those out to customers is going the way you expected to, aside from that Air India?","W. James McNerney","Yes, I think Air India -- and I'm looking around at the guys around here. Air India is the only one that there was a deviation from plan. There were fewer in May by customer design. That's just the way the demand worked out than in some other months. And we do have a ramp-up in the back half of the year. But as I pointed out, we're on-track with the final assembly now, steadied and matured. And the modification airplanes coming out on time. So I think we're in good shape.","Operator","Our next question is from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, Jim, you had talked early on and said that the deferrals and cancellations are running below historical average. Can you just talk a little bit more about the discussions you've had with customers with regards to postponements? And can you tell us about how the overbook situation looks right now on narrowbodies versus where it was, say, a quarter ago? And if there's anything that might change your comfort in reaching some of these production plans just from the economic backdrop? And then I know I only have one question, but just Greg, if you can just say, have there been any changes in the accounting quantities in any of the commercial programs?","W. James McNerney","So I'll answer quickly. I would say there is relatively little change in our outlook for the stability of the backlog, for want of a better word, I think that's what you're asking. I mean, the deferrals and cancellations are at or below historical averages. That's a number we track. And what that generally means is that airlines for reasons that more accrue to their own operating challenges are coming to us and asking to move things around. And other airlines that are doing better can take things earlier. So we're having a normal amount of that discussion. We are very vigilant to the point you are implying though. I mean, the world is a fragile one economically. But you've got to keep in mind that these airplanes, half of them, if not slightly more than half in some of the major models, are replacement airplanes that -- where people view this as a quick payback investment. To get airplanes that are somewhere between 15% and 25% more efficient is a very quick payback -- replacement -- a payback investment that is independent of overall GDP growth, which is what we tend to focus on. So a lot of the demand is driven by that. And when viewed in that frame, it makes a little more sense. Now we are very vigilant here. And we track financeability of the airplanes out a year or 2, even though they tend to get financed a little closer in than that, so that we can see things, we can see storm clouds as they gather. And we're always talking to our customers. But right now, the data we see says, for the reasons I've mentioned, says we're in a stable situation. Greg, do you want to answer\u2026","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, Sam, we had 2 changes in the quarter. 777 increased by 50, and the 747 increased by 25 units in those blocks.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick point of clarification and a question. Greg, can you tell us of the $1.36 billion in unit versus program differences, how much of that roughly is related to the 87? And I wondered if you might speak to recent press commentary that suggests some of the challenges with the Rolls Trent 1000? And any potential pressure you think that may put on, one, your delivery guidance for the year and, two, your production plans?","Gregory D. Smith","So it's about 3\/4 that is related to the 787. But just kind of on that point a little bit, Carter, just to kind of give you a sense because I know folks are focused on this, and I completely understand why. But just to kind of give you a sense from an operational point of view because -- and then get into kind of the deferred production and what we're seeing. But to Jim's point earlier, we're seeing a lot more improvement in the condition of assembly. So these major subs are coming in at or near 100%, much better condition over time. And when you look at kind of jobs behind schedule, significant improvements there across the board, whether that's in Charleston or in Everett. When you look at open jobs that are traveling out to the flight line, I think we talked to you about line 66 going clean. Just as an example, I just walked line 70, and we're looking at about 160 open jobs, so much, much improvement. We're cycling landing gear where we should be cycling landing gear. We're putting engines on where engines should be put on. We're putting interiors in. So when these airplanes are rolling out now, they're rolling out right to the flight line, which again is a real significant improvement, even over the last couple of months. And then of course, you know the progress at Boeing South Carolina. Also in EMC, we're seeing improved performance there on the jobs behind schedule. And then just overall, shortages, they're down about 50% from a year ago. So I think it gives you a sense of the focus and the discipline that's being put in place to drive efficiencies in this program and get the airplanes delivered. Now translating that into unit cost progress, which is really what you were asking there, we're seeing improvements, and you can see that, in how the deferred production balance has grown quarter-over-quarter. So on a per-unit basis, we're seeing improvements. When we look across units from again kind of the line 7 or 8 to line 66, I told you before, 40% to 50% improvement. It's now closer to 50%. So making good progress on both fronts. So I think it gives you confidence in the production system. Certainly, a lot of work left to do, but also gives you a sense of the focus on productivity and profitability on the programs. So that's kind of how we look at it on an ongoing basis.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Would it be fair to say that you're tracking ahead of your own internal projections for the curve?","Gregory D. Smith","I\u2019d say we're tracking pretty much to plan across the board.","W. James McNerney","Gearbox, yes.","Gregory D. Smith","Oh, gearbox. So gearbox, you saw was a very small number of airplanes. We\u2019ve swapped 4 of the 5 out, and the fifth airplane we expect to be complete early next week. So we're well -- got it well in hand.","W. James McNerney","So 4 are back in the air. And round-trip, a little over a week, so pretty minor.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, 2-part question on the 787. First is, if you look at the deferreds and kind of set it up to where you measure that by planes produced, it looks like the deferred per unit went from kind of near $160 million in the first quarter to somewhere $120 million, $130 million. Is that essentially your understanding? And secondly, given that you've got -- more of the planes are clean, what's the opportunity that you could be at the upper end of 42 planes delivered of 87s or even above it?","Gregory D. Smith","So directionally, Cai, on the unit cost, deferred, that's right. I mean, that's the improvement we're kind of seeing quarter-over-quarter. And it's back to all the things I had talked about, the focus on improving the production line, getting things back in line where they need to be, to get the Boeing Production System up and running. So we\u2019re making good progress there. On the deliveries, as we've said, and as we've planned, the bulk of those are planned for the balance of the year. About 50% will come out of EMC and 50% will come off the line. Again, kind of pretty much as we had planned. So I think the team's very focused on it, and I think we got a good plan in place to meet our guidance there.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You talked, gentlemen and lady, you talked about being sold-out for 2012. Could you talk a little bit, Jim, about 2013 and how you're thinking about the challenge of -- with such a large backlog in many cases, where you really see the next opportunity to slot customers?","W. James McNerney","Well, I think as you pointed out, we're out a little further than we want to be ideally. Of course, that reflects a lot of strength. And I think we have some nearer-in opportunities on the 747 and the 777, but we're pretty -- the story is more the robustness of the backlog than open positions, unless you had a specific model you were interested in, Howard.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I mean, we could go through them all, but I won't do that now. But as you sort of -- I mean, what you might be able to say is that the discussions with customers really point to not very many available slots over the next 12 to 18 months. And so that if we look at your orders, they may not be as robust as this year or next year, but one shouldn't interpret that as a challenge to the health of the business?","W. James McNerney","I would characterize your characterization as being right. I mean, I think that's true. I mean, we stand to have a pretty robust orders year this year, as you know. And there are still some opportunities out in the mid-teens in some of our widebody products. But by and large, the pressure would likely be downward beyond this year slightly. But we still haven't sorted that out yet. We've got to figure out what our guidance is or isn\u2019t. But we still have some slots, and we have a big backlog to work through.","Operator","And our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about potential future capital deployment. The company has not bought back stock or raised the dividend for a few years now. And there's obvious reasons for that with the macro and the cash profile as you're developing new programs. But as you move forward, obviously, the development program and the cash generation picture changes. The demand profile looks pretty good. How are you thinking about what you might do with the dividend and with share repurchase as we move further along in the year?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes. So as I've talked about prior, to your point, as we're executing through the year and gaining more confidence as we ramp-up our production rates and generate cash, we're starting to get more -- having more robust dialogue around specifics of cash deployment. So kind of more of a balanced approach similar to what you've seen in the past. Certainly, investing in the business, and we've obviously talked about the MAX and some of the other potential investments going forward, proactively managing the pension fund, as you've seen, we started to do this year. Returning cash to shareholders, whether it's dividend or share repurchase, we'll have further dialogue again later this year. But expect to kind of restart share repurchase, in particular, in the 2013 timeframe and then, of course, pay down our debt. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. We'll solidify our plans later this year and give you a sense of what we're doing specifically in those areas.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I could just slip one follow-up in there on pension. Can you size the P&L headwind that we're looking at next year versus this, whether it's -- assuming discount rate doesn't change or assuming you used the rate as it is today?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, I think that's the big thing. It depends on what happens with the discount rate obviously. But for every 25 basis points, it's an additional $70 million in expense. So that's kind of the sensitivity that we look at.","Operator","And next we go to Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, a question on Defense side. It was nice to see the big guidance raised, and I'm wondering if you\u2019ve baked in an assumption of a macro bounce-back in the second half or if you just see risk takedown on the domestic Defense business balanced by international ramping. I'm just trying to kind of better understand the puts and takes in the second half for Boeing that gives you the confidence. It's nice to see. I just want to know your assumptions a little bit.","W. James McNerney","Yes, okay, Heidi, I don't think it speaks to an assumption of a macro bounce-back this year or next year or the year after. I think we're in a cyclical downturn. I think it really reflects international order strength. That's what the raise this year reflects. I think the domestic orders -- or revenues, I should say, domestic revenues are about what we assumed at the beginning of the year.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Jim, can you talk just a little bit about your appetite on the M&A side in Defense. Typically, in down cycles, the big players tend to pick up the weaker players. And is your interest -- do you have interest in small tactical deals? Or are you starting to maybe think about maybe some larger deals going forward?","W. James McNerney","Well, I think the small tactical deals are kind of the flow deals that we're implementing in areas that you're well aware of. And we're continuing that. I think it's -- the big major deal is one that is -- would not be done without a great deal of thought. And that's really not on our radar screen, despite the impending storm clouds. We think we\u2019ve got a pretty strong business here.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right, great. And one last housekeeping question for you, Greg. I may have missed this in earlier comments. But can you tell -- give us an update on the parked planes in Seattle? How many did you deliver in this quarter and year-to-date? And refresh us on the full number for the year.","Gregory D. Smith","So for 787s, Heidi?","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, yes.","Gregory D. Smith","So our guidance for 787s is 35 to 42 airplanes. And we -- obviously, we've delivered 11 year-to-date. So as I said, the balance is -- as we planned it, was in the back half. About 50% of those will come out of the change incorp facility, and another 50% will come right out of the final line. So as I talked about, as the airplanes are rolling off the final line in -- right to the flight line, that will happen kind of around August timeframe, and that's when you'll see that start to ramp up.","Operator","And we'll go to Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Greg, just a quick clarification question and then one for Jim. On the 737 block, you mentioned that you might extend it during the third quarter. So that means that the margin rate for the entire back half of the year would be impacted by that change? And then Jim, if you could just maybe update us on Global Services & Support, the trends that you're seeing kind of big picture in that business, and whether you think the revenue rate that we're seeing here today is sustainable for the next couple of years?","Gregory D. Smith","So, yes, on the 737, as we work through and finalize our cost projections and mature those, we'll embed those into the -- into our normal process of increasing our block, which again I think will be in the third quarter, and we'll have that all put together. But as I said, the margin that you see in the guidance today, that incorporates that initial block. So we've already, I'll say, kind of provisioned for that going forward. But again, we're working across the board on the cost structure of that as we introduce that airplane. So again, I think we have good plans in place. Certainly, lots of work going forward. But we're feeling pretty good about where we are.","W. James McNerney","As to your question on services, I think we still see a robust commercial services business. There is some pressure from parts of the world where the economies have slowed. There's always some pressure on so-called deferred maintenance, but we haven't seen big pressure yet. On the Defense side, a little more pressure. I think as you may be aware, when downturns like the one that's facing us now happen, the Defense customer often looks to protect employment and brings some more of the work back in-house, which puts pressures on us to do a better sales job and get more technology into our solutions. And we're going through some fit and finish there now.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Stallard with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, a couple of questions on pricing. You've mentioned narrowbody pricing is competitive at the moment. How would you characterize this versus your experience in the past? And also, have you been able to use the monopoly position on the 777 to maybe subsidize the 737 price situation?","W. James McNerney","Well, the -- I would characterize the pricing around the narrowbodies as similar to other transitions that I've seen, for example, the NG transition from the classics. And so I would not call it abnormal. As Greg mentioned, there is always some launch pricing that is -- tends to be a little more aggressive for a while. And as the older models wind down, there's some fill-the-gap pressure. But our view is, we're not going to change that. And so our issue is driving productivity to offset it. So we're 100% focused on getting the productivity in our factories and in our development efforts to the point that, as we did before, where we offset this. That's the thing we can control. As to the 777, the -- monopoly was your word, not mine. I have my legal counsel sitting next to me. But it is fair to say that as the A350-1000 stays out to the right, that some of our earlier assumptions about early competition from that airplane haven't come true. So it's fair to say that pricing is a little better than we had assumed a year or 2 ago.","Operator","And we'll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was wondering if, Greg, maybe you can comment on the cash contribution for pension profile in the next several years and how that's probably improved from the transportation bill. And is that going to pull forward some of -- to an earlier question, some of your cash deployment initiatives? And then just a clarification, you mentioned $70 million for 25 basis points and just to put us all on the same page, the benchmark from which to start that, is that $300 million headwinds if they stayed flat and then $70 million on top of that?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, that's about right, Myles. And on the trans bill, certainly, from a mandatory funding point of view, it certainly pushes it out to the right and gives us some relief there. But as we have always kind of focused on a disciplined approach to funding our pension plan, we're going to continue that. But it certainly does give you some flexibility in the years to come. But I don't see our plan on how we will fund that changing going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Strategic question for Jim. When you think about Airbus potentially setting up a production line in Alabama, what implications does that have for Boeing?","W. James McNerney","Well, I mean, I think the -- if doing it produces better performing, lower cost, more reliable airplanes, then I think it's a good move. I think by and large commercial customers care less about where things are produced and more about the attributes of the airplane. So if that move furthers those goals, then it will be a good move. On the other hand, if it complicates their supply chain -- I think this will by their fourth final assembly around the world. I'm impressed with controlling a supply chain for one final assembly factory, then that could present some challenges. My guess is they also have some challenges around employment with some of their European worker constituencies. But look, it's tough enough to run one company rather than two, so I'm -- it's up to them to manage it.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Greg, can you tell us specifically how many airplanes you plan on adding to the 37 block to account for the MAX, at least initially? And then second question on 787 deferred production cost, should we expect to see a bigger step down than what we've been seeing here, a bigger step down in the second half of the year given that more airplanes will be coming straight off the line?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, so David, remind me again of your first question.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question was how many specifically you're adding to the block for MAX.","Gregory D. Smith","We haven't finalized that yet. So we'll finalize that in the third quarter, and we'll let you know what that is. With regards to the deferred production, yes, I mean, we're continuing, as I said, to kind of come down that learning curve. When you look at the in-factory, obviously, flow of that, that's where we're seeing the improvements. On the delivery side, as I've talked about before, when you look at the progress there, it's not going to be linear because we're delivering out of sequence. So you've got some older airplanes in there mixed with some newer airplanes. So that's going to be a little choppy over time, but overall trajectory heading in the right direction.","Stephanie Pope","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","And that will be from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a question, Jim, on demand for 747-8. Now that you have production stabilized here at 2 a month, and it's been a number of, I guess, a little bit of a period of time where we've seen some order activity for that aircraft. What do you see for demand out there and going forward?","W. James McNerney","Well, we have a pretty good pipeline. So I am not worried strategically at all. I think there's a couple of campaigns that we need to convert over the course of the next 6 months. And I think we're well-positioned to do that. And it's about where I thought it would be.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're still comfortable with holding the production rates at 2 a month here over the next...","W. James McNerney","Yes.","Operator","That completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Thomas J. Downey","Thank you. We have time for a few questions today from the media for Jim and Greg. If you have any questions after the session ends, please call our Media Relations team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we're ready for the first question. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","And we\u2019ll first go to the line of Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal.","Jon Ostrower","A question about the remaining deliveries for 747s and 787s on the rest of the year. You've got 70 to 85 planned. You've kind of mapped out that half are going to be 787s. Can you talk about the balance of 747-8s and where that stands in terms of overall demand for freighter aircraft in light of sort of where the economy is and also where your production system is in terms of converting aircrafts that were already built before and the balance that are coming out of your factory directly?","Gregory D. Smith","Okay. Well, I'll address deliveries and then Jim will address the market. But we've got about 20 airplanes left in the third and fourth quarter to deliver. About 30% of those will come out of change incorp, and the balance come directly off the line. So as you've seen, we've had good deliveries in the first half and expect that to continue through the balance of the year.","Jon Ostrower","And in terms of your overall confidence for delivering those 70 to 85, where do you see kind of the key milestones for the remainder of the year? And what happens from your perspective if that 70 to 85 isn't hit?","Gregory D. Smith","Well, I think on the 747, as I said, most of it's coming off the line. So it's more of a, I'll say, traditional production system running. So I don't see a significant risk there. On the 787, as I said earlier, 50% coming out of EMC and 50% coming off the line. Certainly, the ones coming out of EMC, we've got a close watch on, good plans in place, making good progress. But if you were to ask me where the risk is, it's certainly more in that area. But I think we've got it well handled.","Jon Ostrower","And then in terms of the Rolls-Royce gearbox issue, you talked about the 5 aircraft that are currently in service with ANA. Are you willing to do gearbox swaps on airplanes that are already in production, in the flight line in Everett?","W. James McNerney","Sorry, you broke up there, Jon, at the end. Can you say that one more time?","Jon Ostrower","Do you have gearboxes to swap out on production 787s that are at Everett?","W. James McNerney","Yes. And as I mentioned before, we've implemented fixes on 4 of the 5 ANA. I'm not sure, is the fourth one in the air? We're not -- yes -- but we're doing the same thing in the production gearboxes, and we don't anticipate any impact on schedule at all.","Operator","Our next question is from Susanna Ray with Bloomberg News.","Susanna Ray","I'm wondering if you guys could you please comment on why many of the announcements at Farnborough were commitments rather than firm orders and what that might indicate.","W. James McNerney","That's typically the way we make announcements where -- what point are you trying to make with the question?","Susanna Ray","I'm wondering if there's any difficulties in converting the commitments into firm orders.","W. James McNerney","No. The orders are being committed, if anything, a little faster than we\u2019d planned.","Susanna Ray","Okay. And then if you guys could please clarify, I think earlier this year you had said that about 2\/3 of the year's 787 deliveries were going to be the change incorporation planes. So I'm wondering, now I\u2019m hearing the 50%, is that shifting more towards the newly built or is this just the difference between full year and half year?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes, that's it. Yes. Initially, that was the full year view. And now with the balance of the year, it's about 50-50.","Susanna Ray","Got you. So full year is still 2\/3?","Gregory D. Smith","Yes.","Susanna Ray","There's no change? Okay. Great.","Operator","And we'll go to Andrew Parker with the Financial Times.","Andrew Parker","Just want to ask you a question about the book-to-bill ratio. I take it you'll be well above 1 with your book to bill this year because of the progress you're making with 737 MAX orders. But will you expect book to bill then to decline in 2013? And if so, will that tell us that the order cycle will have peaked for you guys just as it appears to have peaked for Airbus already?","W. James McNerney","Well, I think you're right. I mean, this year's orders are driven by the success of converting the MAXs, and we're already above 1, I believe, at this stage of the year. And next year, just because the book to bill may come down a little bit mathematically, and my guess is that it will be around 1 somewhere next year, doesn't mean that next year isn't a strong year. It simply means we're not converting introductory orders next year.","Andrew Parker","Yes, I just wanted to know whether realistically though we're at the end of this sort of order cycle, right? I mean, it doesn't mean your earnings aren't going to grow because as you ramp-up deliveries, clearly earnings should grow, but whether you would agree -- I mean, John Leahy made this point at Farnborough, that he thought the order cycle had probably peaked. I mean, their book to bill is coming down this year. They say it'll be greater than 1. It feels and looks like your book to bill is going to come down next year, and it's probably telling us that this order cycle has peaked. But do you agree with that analogy?","W. James McNerney","Well, I agree that orders will probably be less next year than this year. I think it will be driven more by a massive introduction being converted this year. Recall that we still see a 5% growth rate, about half replacement, about half fleet. Fleet size increases link the GDP out into the future, which would imply, if we're right, that it will be a return to a steady state rather than a deep trough. I guess that's the way I'd answer your question.","Operator","And we'll go to Steve Trimble with Flightglobal.","Stephen Trimble","I was wondering if you could talk about your scheduling for the 787-10X and bringing that to the board for authority to offer to airlines.","W. James McNerney","Yes, we are getting greater fidelity on the evaluation now. And it's hard for me to predict exactly when we would move forward. But it's end of this year, beginning of next year could be timing. It's not timing we have baked into any plans yet, but the fidelity around what we want to do technically and how it could benefit our customers, we're getting near the end of that evaluation. So we'll make the judgment the last half of this year on exactly when we'd begin some conditional offerability. But it looks like a pretty good airplane that will have a lot of market demand and will be the absolute perfect next step on the 87. That's the way it looks today.","Thomas J. Downey","Operator, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","And that will be from the line of Mike Mecham with Aviation Week.","Michael Mecham","Can you talk through a bit about how airlines are approaching the ordering between the current offerings, the NGs and the MAX? They're kind of mixing -- you had a big mix, quite an order from United, you just got one from Mexicana. What is their thinking as to why they're choosing some NGs now? Is that a matter of trying to get airplanes as quickly as they can versus when they're going to factor in their new -- the MAXs as a new offering instead of an obsolete offering? And when that tide might change to the point where it will just be all MAXs or very heavily MAXs?","W. James McNerney","Yes, I mean, I suppose if we had unlimited amounts of MAXs that we could turn on tomorrow, which we don't, they would order all MAXs today. But the facts are, the NGs themselves represent dramatic improvements over the planes they're replacing. The MAX availability starts in '17 and ramps in the -- toward the end of the decade and into the next decade. So there aren't as many available. So we're in this very pleasant situation where they can buy the existing airplane, get dramatic operating improvements versus what they got now, ramp toward an even better airplane starting in 2017. So what that looks like in their operating plans is sort of steady improvement for the next decade, while ordering both. And that also helps us obviously as we transition production. So I think the whole thing is underpinned by a great airplane, the NG.","Michael Mecham","When do you think the big transition will take? Are we talking 2017 about the time that MAX actually starts entering service? Or when's that tipping point?","W. James McNerney","Yes, well, the tipping point will be when we get to full production, which I don't have the exact number of months it'll take to get to full production here in front of me. I don't think we\u2019ve provided that as guidance. But normally, these things take over a year or so to get up to full production. And so the market will not have full availability of the MAXs until toward the end of the decade.","Michael Mecham","By full production, you mean full production on total 737 lines?","W. James McNerney","Yes, yes, I'm saying full switchover from NGs to MAXs.","Michael Mecham","In 2014?","W. James McNerney","No, no, it will start in 2017 and then ramp from there. So the market -- and that's part of the reason people are buying NGs now.","Thomas J. Downey","That concludes our earnings call.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Boeing Company\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analysts and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy Lahr","","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings call. I am Troy Lahr and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Smith, Boeing\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in today\u2019s press release and you can follow this broadcast and slide presentation through our Web site at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals included in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this Web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now, I will turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","Jim McNerney","","Thank you, Troy and good morning. Let me begin today by acknowledging the families of loved ones of those aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. All of them and everyone affected by this horrific tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers at this time. For the men and women and Boeing and others throughout our industry who are passionately committed to ensuring the safety and security of passengers and air crews, this is a particular unsettling and painful moment in the history of civil aviation. We are providing technical assistance to the investigation at the request of the NTSB which is supporting international authorities in the important work they have underway.","Turning back to the subject at hand this morning, I\u2019ll start with some comments on the quarter and our business environment. After that Greg will walk you through details of our financial results and outlook.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 2. Boeing delivered strong quarter operating performance across our production programs and services businesses with solid revenue, double-digit core EPS growth and healthy cash generation. Our strong positive performance through the first half of the year has allowed us to continue returning cash to shareholders and increase guidance for our full year EPS by $0.75 which includes approximately a $0.50 tax benefit. Greg will discuss guidance in more detail in just a couple of minutes.","During the second quarter we did record a 272 million after tax charge on our fixed price U.S. Air Force tanker program engineering and manufacturing development contract. The charge was driven by higher spending needed to complete systems installation on the tanker to test that aircraft and maintain the schedule for delivering this vital capability to the war fighter. As you may recall we noted in our Investors Conference that we were beginning to see some challenges in the build and systems installation process. The increased spending is primarily related to additional engineering and systems installation rework required mainly to meet wiring specifications.","The issues at hand are well defined and understood which in no way mitigates our disappointment in having to take this charge, but the actions we have taken to keep us on path to the next major program milestone which is to begin test line fully provisioned tanker aircraft in the first part of next year. With a long-term potential market for the KC-46 tanker of up to 400 airplanes worth $80 billion, it remains a franchise program for Boeing. And we expect to realize strong returns over decades of production and in service support.","With that said let\u2019s discuss our core operating performance during the quarter. Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes was $14.3 billion and operating margins increased to 10.8% a result of both the higher volume and a favorable delivery mix. We delivered 181 commercial airplanes in the second quarter including 37 87-Dreamliners and we added net new orders of 264 airplanes. So far in July we have booked another 282 orders including those announced by customers at the Farnborough International Airshow bringing our current net order total to 783 for the year already a book-to-bill greater than 1.","Boeing Defense Space and Security reported revenue in the second quarter of 7.7 billion. During the period BDS captured numerous key contract awards including a $1.9 billion order of 44 U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Air Force E\/A 18 and F\/A 18 aircraft, a $700 million order for five years of AEW&C in service support from the Royal Australian Air Force and a $200 million order for our 9th 702MP Intelsat satellite. Significant program milestones included a successful missile defense system intercept test delivery of both the 4th P-8A, P-8I to India and the 100th P-18G to the U.S. Navy.","With that let\u2019s turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Global demand remains high for the superior fuel efficiency and economics provided by our family of commercial airplanes as recognized in the order totals I\u2019ve mentioned earlier. Global passenger traffic trends continue to be healthy and air cargo traffic is still gradually improving. In addition to growth driven demand we continue to experience and foresee sustained high replacement demand where newer more efficient airplanes offer compelling economics and a rapid return on investment compared to keeping older less efficient airplanes in service.","Combining growth and replacement needs over the next 20 years we forecast global demand for nearly 37,000 commercial airplanes a 4% increase over the last year\u2019s forecast. Deferral requests from customers are still running well below at historically average while request to accelerate deliveries remain brisk. This ongoing strong demand coupled with our already sizable and diverse backlog of more than 5,200 airplanes reinforces our planned production rates and outlook for sustained growth in the years ahead.","In the Twin-Aisle segment we continue to see healthy demand for both the 777 and the 777X which continue to out sell the competition by a wide margin giving us confidence in our ability to transition between the two airplanes. As part of our focus on that transition we are looking to maximize production efficiencies with existing best practices from other programs as well as advanced new manufacturing technologies. For example last week we unveiled a new robotic system for building 777 Fuselages this automated approach will increase first time quality reduce build times and improve work place safety for our employees.","On the 787 program we achieved major milestones with certification of 330 minute ETOPS and the on schedule certification in first delivery of the 787-9 to Air New Zealand. Development of the 787-10 also is progressing to plan with the first delivery in 2018. In the Single-Aisle segment demand for our new fuel efficient 737 MAX remains high with cumulative orders exceeding 2,100 airplanes from 43 customers, the production bridge from today\u2019s 737 to the MAX remains solid with the first MAX delivery in 2017.","Turning to Defense, Space & security, we continue to see solid support for our major programs in the FY15 budget process. We are encouraged by the actions taken in both the house and senate appropriations committees with regard to additional P-8s, Apaches and EA-18G aircraft. International Defense, Space & security business represented nearly 30% of BDS revenues during the quarter and remains at approximately 35% of the BDS backlog as we continue to leverage our unique One Boeing global advantage.","Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance, cyber security and the few but critical future large-scale programs identified as priorities by our customers like Long Range Strike, UCLASS and the T-X Trainer. The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable and is being delivered on budget and on schedule. We remain intensely focused on driving further efficiency, quality and productivity gains to improve program profitability and fund investment and future growth.","Defense, Space & Security continues to make great progress on our market-based affordability initiative as we strive to take out another $2 billion in operating costs. Along those lines benefits from our enterprise partnering for success approach with suppliers continue to accrue. For example in collaboration with our partner Japanese aircraft industries we\u2019re reducing cost of producing various 777 parts through value engineering, a great joint effort that will help ensure the continued competitiveness of the 777 airplane in the marketplace.","In summary, notwithstanding our disappointment over the charge on tanker our team delivered another strong quarter of core operating performance, captured meaningful growth through new business and made great progress on further improving productivity and achieving important program milestones for us and our customers.","Now, over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance, Greg?","Greg Smith","Thanks Jim and good morning. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 to discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue of $22 billion was driven by 7% increase in commercial airplane deliveries and higher commercial services volume. Core operating margins of 9% reflects solid productivity gains on production programs and across the services businesses offset by the impact of the tanker charge.","Second quarter core earnings per share increased 45%, $2.42 a share on additional tax adjustments, higher commercial volume, and continued strong operating performance on core production programs. During the quarter, we recorded a tax benefit of $116 million for the 2007 and 2008 tax settlements that we discussed in April as well as an additional $408 million tax benefit related to the 2009, 2010 tax settlement and the tax basis restoration.","The $425 million pretax charge or 272 million on an after-tax for the tanker program largely relates to additional engineering and manufacturing labor associated with challenges we encouraged in the wire installation as we move into the systems integration stage of final assembly on the initial test aircraft.","As we said before given the significant long-term Tanker market opportunity as Jim discussed, we bid the EMD phase with the Tanker program aggressively with zero margin with plant profitability generated during the production phase. Looking at our overall performance to-date on the program, we have met all customer milestones and are proceeding with functional testing to be followed by the start of the initial Tanker flight testing in early part of next year.","As Jim noted despite our disappointment in encountering these challenges, the issues are well understood, no new technology is required to resolve them. And we believe the program is sufficiently provisioned and has a solid path forward. We are confident we\u2019re taking the right steps to fulfill our promises to our customer. Excluding the Tanker performance encountered in the quarter, we continue to make great progress across other areas of the business. Let\u2019s now turn to commercial airplanes on Slide 5.","For the second quarter, our commercial airplane business increased revenue 5% to 14.3 billion on 181 aircraft deliveries and including a record 124 737s and 30 787s. The business also increased operating margins in the quarter to 10.8%. Higher volume and our focus on efficiently executing on our rate increases and continuously driving productivity led a strong operating performance during the quarter than more than offset the $238 million pretax charge related to the EMD Tanker contract at BCA.","Commercial airplanes captured $17 billion in net orders during the quarter and backlog remained very strong at a new record of $377 billion over 5,200 aircraft equates to approximately seven years of production. In the second quarter while at a declining rate 787 deferred production increased $1.1 billion to 24.2 billion, largely driven by increase in our rate of production on the 787-9 and inventory pull ahead to efficiently optimize our production and minimize -8 disruption as we introduced the aircraft into our production system.","Based on further production stability, plant contracted higher step down pricing and continued overall productivity improvements. We expect the quarterly change in deferred to improve over the remainder of the year. The cash flow profile of the 787 continues to improve as we drive productivity throughout the production system. We continue to see good progress on key operational performance indicators and unit cost as we further implement production efficiencies and increase 787-9 production.","As we continue our efforts to optimize the production system and maximize efficiencies at the 10 per month rate, the team continues to make progress in reducing 787-8 unit cost by approximately 13% and improved final assembly flow times by more than 10% over the past year. Travel work has also been significantly reduced declining by greater than 30% since this time last quarter. We are also continuing to see good progress in the 787-9 productivity where we\u2019ve seen 50% improvement in unit cost and a 25% improvement of flow time from the first aircraft to the seventh aircraft to rollout the factory.","Overall, we\u2019ve made solid improvement on the 787 program. However, great deal of work ahead of us as we increase -9 productions, introduce the -19 into early stages of our production system and continue to optimize to drive further productivity and profitability on the program. We remain on track to deliver approximately 110 787s in 2014 and again the team remains focused on day-to-day execution and improving long-term productivity and profitability on the program.","Let\u2019s now turn to the Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue for our Defense business was 7.7 billion and operating margins were 7.5%, a strong performance on production programs and favorable delivery mix offset by the $187 million pretax charge on the EMD Tanker contract. Boeing military aircraft second quarter revenue declined to $3.5 billion reflecting delivery mix and operating margins of 4.7% in the quarter again impacted by the tanker charge.","Global Services and Support revenue at 2.3 billion reflects slightly lower volume in the maintenance mod and upgrade business and strong operating performance across that business drove operating margins to 11.6%. Network and Space systems reported revenue of 1.9 billion on lower commercial satellite volume and generated operating margins of 7.8% in the quarter. Defense Space and Security reported a solid backlog of $63 billion with 36% of our current backlog now from international customers.","Now turning to Slide 7, Boeing Capital\u2019s net financing portfolio declined to $3.4 billion on run-offs that exceeded new aircraft volume.","Now look at cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was 1.8 billion driven by solid operating performance and timing of receipts and expenditures. With regards to capital deployment we paid $530 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 11.4 million shares for $1.5 billion in the second quarter. We continue to anticipate completing the remainder of 6.8 billion repurchased authorization over approximately the next two years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains the top priority for us.","Moving now to cash and debt balance on Slide 9, we ended the quarter with $11 billion of cash and marketable securities and our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us very well going forward.","Turning now to Slide 10 to discuss our outlook for 2014, we\u2019re increasing our core earnings per share guidance for 2014 by $0.75 to now be $7.90 to $8.10 a share reflecting the $408 million tax benefit and strong core operating performance that more than offsets the impact of the tanker charge. Guidance for revenue, operating cash flow and delivery remains unchanged. Commercial airplane operating margin guidance for 2014 has increased, to now be greater than 10% on continued strong operating performance.","Over the remainder of the year we anticipate BCA margins to be impacted by higher 787 deliveries, some additional fleet support and additional investments in productivity initiatives. Defense Space and Security operating margin guidance for 2014 is unchanged at approximately 9.5% with lower margin guidance in BMA, offset by higher guidance into the DS&S business.","In summary second quarter performance reflects the strength of our backlog, the strong demand for our products and services and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the entire enterprise. And furthermore as evidenced by the meaningful dividend increase and a higher share repurchase activity we continue to expect to deliver solid growth, productivity and strong cash flows going forward.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Jim for some closing comments.","Jim McNerney","","Thanks Greg. With a strong first half behind us and the team that is focused on sustained strong business performance we\u2019re ready and committed to deliver on our strengthened outlook for the remainder of 2014. Our priorities remain clear, the profitable ramp up in production on our commercial airplane programs executing on our commercial and defense development programs with the emphasis on tanker, driving productivity and affordability throughout the enterprise, continuing to strengthen and position our defense business with investments in growth areas midst further international expansion and all the while providing increasing value to both our customers and shareholders.","With that said we\u2019d now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) As reminder, in the interest of time we are asking that you limit yourself to one single part question. (Operator Instructions) And first going to Howard Rubel with Jefferies, please go ahead.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","","Despite the admonition, it's going to be sort of a two part question and part of its -- so there's two parts to it. If we think about it, the tanker -- you probably missed the program cost by about 10%. Can you help us understand why you've killed all the bugs in the program? And then second, if we adjust margins for R&D and maybe exclude what appears to be 787 revenues, your margins on the core business continue to improve. So the question really is, with that kind of improvement, why aren't we seeing some of that translate into even better numbers on the 787? Because if you are getting the core business there, some should spill into the other business. Thank you.","Jim McNerney","Let me address your second question first on margin improvement. You are right, I mean I think again the continuous focus on productivity whether it\u2019s within our four walls or through the partnering for success initiatives is driving a lot of that. And there has been improvement on the 787. We\u2019re certainly not at the levels that we expect. So we have high expectations on driving margins further on that program, but we have seen improvements on that program as well as I\u2019d say on the core program in particular the 37 and the 777, so continuing the focus there Howard, big priority for us, big priority within partnering for success certainly at 787.","With regards to the tanker program you know certainly as we worked our way through the integration on that first aircraft and learning from that and understanding from the challenges we were faced with, we certainly understand the scope of work that needs to be done on the balance of that aircraft as well as aircraft two through four and that\u2019s giving us the confidence to understand again how to get completion. This is not new technology or innovation this is basic kind of blocking and tackling who work through the redesign on the engineering effort primarily around the wire harnesses and then the manufacturing labor to work through installing those.","So we have got some of that activity completed on the first aircraft enough to move into first flight which will be late in the third quarter this year and then the balance will obviously be scoped that will be applied on those other airplanes. If you look at kind of some of the things that are done on this program maybe versus some of the others, lab so we have wet fuel lab, we have a lighting lab and those are all put been put in place and right from the beginning of the program to de-risk the program. So we have a very functional wet lab where we\u2019re actually running fuel through pumps and valves to validate that on the ground so when we get in the air that minimizes that risk.","And so there\u2019s things like that Howard that have been put in place that we\u2019re continuing to make our way, you know making progress on as well as working our way through the functional testing on that first airplane. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. Again we\u2019re comfortable about the path forward, we\u2019re committed to meeting the customer milestones through the balance of this contract and that\u2019s what the team has been focused on. And the long-term profitability I should also mention on this program and that objective is unchanged as we work into the production phase of the contract.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","","Thank you very much.","Jim McNerney","","Welcome.","Operator","","And next we go to Carter Copeland with Barclays, please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","","Hey, good morning gentlemen. Greg, just a question on the BCA margins which you know ex the charge look like they were very strong at 12.5 you know given the 787 mix it\u2019s a pretty high number and I wondered if you could help us with that a little bit, you know the universe\u2019s program differences were about $2 billion and I wondered if you might give us some color on that and let us know if there\u2019s any or there\u2019re negative differences on any of the mature production programs and did those program on the 73 and 777 you mentioned they were better but were those at record margin levels or was there something else going on in terms of period expenses, I know the R&D was a little bit lower but any color you can provide on how those margins compared to the historical trend?","Greg Smith","","Yes, I mean program to program they varied slightly I mean certainly 37 and 777 continue to have solid margins we did have a slight increase on the 787 as well, and you know the team is doing a very good job manning during the period expense whether it\u2019s the G&A or the R&D or the fleet support. Now when you look in the back half, obviously we got more 787s in there so we\u2019ll have some dilution on the margin from that perspective and a little bit higher period expense that I talked about I think on the last call where we got more new customer introductions going on so we\u2019re going to spend a little bit more on fleet support to ensure that our customers have a smooth transition of entering that airplane into service. That predominantly was what\u2019s driving the back half but again we\u2019re staying very laser focused on looking for further opportunities there and continuing to drive productivity but I would tell you that these safe programs are running very well and they\u2019re doing a very good job executing on these rate breaks at the same time continuously focused on productivity. ","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","","And were the 37 and 777 differences negative?","Greg Smith","","Negative, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t quite understand.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","","Meaning, were they -- did you subtract from those programs, meaning was their unit profitability better than their program profitability in the quarter?","Greg Smith","","Yes.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","","Okay, thank you.","Greg Smith","","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","","Our next question is from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein, please go ahead.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","","Thank you, good morning. When you look forward over the next, I would say four to five years and think about how you\u2019re investing in BCA and you go through completing the 787 in max models and then you\u2019re moving forward the 777x, how should we expect R&D and CapEx to go over that time period, what\u2019s the trajectory projection we should think about for those.","Greg Smith","","Well, let me, maybe I\u2019ll start with CapEx and then we talk more about R&D. But certainly on CapEx I think for next year you\u2019re going to see levels from all of this year and that predominantly almost all of it really investing in the future so this is all about the additional great breaks coming up along with productivity. Jim talked about the 777 automation so we are making some investments in the production system as well but again a lot of that is driven on the growth so after that Doug I think we\u2019ll start to see the CapEx moderate at I\u2019ll say kind of more normal levels at a stable production rate going forward.","On the R&D certainly you know we will peak out here on R&D on the MAX in about 2015, obviously 787-9 ramping down but -10 ramping up and then feathering in 777X and -10 in there so we\u2019re continuing to look at those profiles over the next couple of years and how they will play out in meeting our entry into service date, but we\u2019ll see slight increases in the next year but again we\u2019re managing it very tightly and I know Jim has talked a lot about how we\u2019re managing development we talk about a lot at the Investor Conference and we\u2019re continuing to do that optimize our spending.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","But should we think about it as these sort of ebb and flow here that things should be somewhat flat when we expect with the 777X as we\u2019ve seen improvements in the past some kind of a ramp up out in the 18-19 timeframe is that, we looking at that type of a difficult trajectory?","Jim McNerney","","I\u2019ll jump in here Greg is tired Doug.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","","Okay.","Jim McNerney","","Listen, this development program the two design pillars of the remaining part of the decade were aborting major pileups of engineering with concurrent work being done and the second pillar was not absorbing as much risk in each development I mean in other worlds capitalizing on some of the hard fought technology hands would have to not adding risk to that. And so I think those comments imply a design on some of pressure but nothing like your question imply I mean our plans do not have big pileups in R&D along the way is more characterized by very manageable no major year-over-year spikes now we\u2019ll report on that as we get close to this but the design of this is moderation would be a word that I use rather than precipitous in any given year.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Next we go to John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","","Thank you for taking my questions. Jim and Ray I was hoping you guys could maybe reflect a little bit on Farnborough and what transpired there particularly just given the A330 NEO announcement and you think it might affect the competitive bounce a bit and as well as 777 I think some of that I hope to see a little bit more other activity there but I understand that these campaigns can take a while to pull up?","Jim McNerney","","Well we did have a 150 777X orders at least the four Farnborough but look the competitive question and I know that\u2019s what you\u2019re really driving here, one way to look at the A330 NEO is that it replaces an ambition to have a second A350-800 model. So in some respect it\u2019s a tread of older technology re-engine up for newer technology and I\u2019m not sitting with the Airbus guys as they make these calls but F1 we\u2019ll look at it old technology for new and whereas we\u2019ve got in the wide body space five new airplanes all of which exceed the competitive performance of what we\u2019ve seen from our competitor and so I really like that line up and I think if you look at year-to-date orders wide bodies for example I think you will see a very healthy dose of I forget exactly someone to mid 200s wide bodies and I think with the Emirates cancellation our competitor may be negative for the year. So that is a more strategic timeframe than what happen during three days at Farnborough but I really like the relative strength of our wide body offerings, those five air planes all new, all selling briskly with a sort of a mix of new technology and reengineering technology that our competitor has.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","","There is a little bit of a concern among investors that book-to-bill might start to flip I was hoping that you could offer a little bit of perspective on that during your comments there.","Ray Conner","","I mean I think we continue to see risk demand as we\u2019ve said I mean as I mentioned in my remarks deferral requests are well below historical averages for our company, move the airplane up accelerate the delivery far above what we\u2019ve historically had and the reason for that is this new technology that we\u2019re offering pays back so quickly even when compared to airplanes that haven\u2019t reach their full life out there I mean you can for the least rate you have to pay incremental capital you have to deploy the payback is so quick with oil prices that don\u2019t promise to come down with the geopolitical world that we are in, payback so quickly that this replacement demand is half or some segments more than half of the demand not just growth not just underlying GDP growth or growth in aircraft.","So it is in our book-to-bill for example in July is already above one-to-one and we\u2019re halfway through the year. So we haven\u2019t seen signs of it yet. I realized that it is a professional sport to call the cycle in this industry that we\u2019re in, but this industry has not seen this kind of replacement economics since the 707 and that was in the mid 1950s where the payback was so dramatic and the performance was so different. So we\u2019re seeing those signs of it yet.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s a lot of the great color. Thanks a lot.","Jim McNerney","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Yes, so your deferred on the 787 went up by 1.1 billion, maybe give us some color on how much that was the rate increase and how much was the inventory pull forward which is essentially discretionary move on your part to improve? And give us some color on the pattern in the third and fourth quarter. I mean we\u2019re going to get the zero and the impact on the deferred from the fact that while A330 NEO is probably not as efficient as the 787, it\u2019s certainly priced lower given the orders they have received and you know what response you\u2019re going to make and what impact does that have on 787 deferred? Thanks.","Greg Smith","Okay, let me -- I will talk about the deferred and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Jim, who can talk more talk about kind of pricing on the 787. But you\u2019re right our airplane is much more efficient. So on the 787 on deferred Cai, about a third of that growth we saw there was inventory pull head to support -9. And as I talked about in my opening remarks, I mean, seven airplanes and we\u2019ve seen 50% increase in unit cost, so it really gives you a sense of the cadence and the work that people are focused on to improve productivity on the program, as you think about the kind of the path forward to the end of the year certainly learning curve.","We got to continue to come down the learning curve as we have and that includes obviously on the -8 but obviously with more -9 in the flow, so got to continue to work that. We do have some supplier step down through the balance of the year. There is some model mix movement that will take place in the balance of the year that should be favorable for deferred. And then as you\u2019ve mentioned, I mean quarter-over-quarter I\u2019d say month-over-month, we are making inventory decisions to pull forward components if they\u2019re ready, get them into the pictures and do all much pre-work as we can and frankly that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen us being able to stabilize that production system.","So that\u2019s kind of the given take that\u2019s going to take place through balance of the year. At the same time, we\u2019re not doing as much pull ahead as we have because we\u2019re more stable at end of month. It\u2019s really-really around -9. And then again continue to focus on stabilizing the production system in all positions of the assembly.","So that\u2019s kind of I\u2019ll see the moving pieces as you look through that end of the year Cai. As I said to you certainly, this is a big focus area for us but the day-to-date focus on that program is on unit cost and cash, that\u2019s the focus which ultimately I recognized in deferred, but that\u2019s with that team is executing to -- again good progress but again we got to continue to comedown that learning curve through the balance of the year and going forward to drive profitability and ultimately impact deferred.","Jim McNerney","Yes, Cai, your question about A330 NEO as compare the most comfortable airplane would be the 787-10 in terms of remission. Look our strategy is to produce the most capable airplane and then share the value with our customers that that value produce and obviously the values to components, one is efficiency that\u2019s all about fuel big advantage -10 compare to the A330 NEO in the neighborhood of mid double digits kind of advances and also performance. I mean I think the reach of the airplane little greater.","And so we feel very comfortable even under scenarios where, as your question implies they would have to accept less-price for a less capable airplane. We feel very comfortable when we sort of model that all out that our returns are good and the capability of our airplane sustains value for both us and our customers. And so, I think I understand why they made this decision. It\u2019s a far less capable airplane and don\u2019t have to make decisions on how they price it and how they market it. But these aren\u2019t pancakes we\u2019re dealing with. These are airplanes, major investments that produce a lot of value and they are good.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","I was intrigued with the comment that you increased by a small amount the accrual rate for 787. I think that's, if I'm not mistaken, the first time you've done that except for the time that you extended the accounting quantity by quite a bit. And I was just wondering if you could give us any detail on what gave you the confidence to do that.","Jim McNerney","Well certainly again coming back to partnering for success that was one of the bigger elements of the movement within the quarter Joe. And like we talked in the past, on the partnering for success efforts 787 is the big, our number one priority. So started to see some of that come together with our suppliers and reaching agreements and we booked it. And that\u2019s essentially what drove the change quarter-over-quarter.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Greg, do you feel like that there's room for small steps if things keep going in that direction in the coming periods? Or that 787 margin is something we are going to have to wait a while for or is this something that -- how do you feel about, I guess, the prospects?","Jim McNerney","I think it\u2019s going to take time Joe there is no question about it. I mean quarter-over-quarter I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot of movement. But we have a plan by supplier, by component and working with those folks. So it really kind of gets to how we can accelerate those discussions or negotiations and reach up an agreement. The more time we spend on partner success the more mature we\u2019re getting with those discussions and we expect to do that. But it\u2019s going to take some time, but clearly again it\u2019s the number one priority and focus and we have a plan and so we got to continue to execute that and work with our partners. Because the long-term certainly prospects of this program are extremely beneficial to everybody including our suppliers. So we continued on the journey that we started here.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","","Greg, maybe a question for you on cash flow, it's been pretty strong year-to-date when you consider the headwinds from the 67 and the union bonus. And I look at the full year and there's been no raise there and I'm assuming the tax benefits are no cash. But it still would imply the second half of 2014 cash flow is half of what it was in the second half last year despite lower deferred production growth. So maybe can you just walk us through how much conservatism is there or other puts and takes?","Jim McNerney","I mean remember last year too we had a lot of timing benefit very late in the fourth quarter which I don\u2019t expect at the same level as we were going to experience this year. We got more cash taxes by close to $1 billion this year compared to last year and again some of that is back loaded when you compare. But I would just say very focused obviously on generating cash, we\u2019re comfortable with our approximately $7 billion cash flow and if we see that improving through the next quarter then we\u2019ll update our guidance going forward. But at the same time when you look at the long-term prospects on cash flow for the company that is unchanged, I mean delivering on this backlog and executing to our plans is going to generate a significant amount of operating cash going forward and we\u2019re going to deploy that in the most efficient and effective way possible. So continue to focus on Myles, again it\u2019s hard to compare fourth quarter or third quarter this one. Because a lot of moving pieces within the quarter but again if we see opportunities to improve that we will but we\u2019re comfortable with where we\u2019re right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","","Jim, just maybe you could just give us some thoughts on the outlook at BDS. I mean your backlog continues to be very strong. Book-to-bill was a little under one but you gave some comments in your opening remarks about the longer-term outlook there. I mean do you think that we're going to be able to sustain kind of this $30 billion-plus revenue number given your outlook?","Jim McNerney","","Yes I do, I mean I think the math for that business is over time tanker replaces C-17, actually little more when you look at the numbers. There was a couple of big development programs coming up. Three that I mentioned in my remarks there is a couple of other ones. Our opportunity to win those, a couple of those is good, which would mitigate risk on the fighter side as the F-18 and the F-15 over the next decade face some setting. And then the upside is international. I mean one of the unique things Boeing has is strong company to country relationships built over the years largely in our commercial business that has broad industrial base and cooperation in many of world\u2019s key countries that help us in campaigns both on the BDS and the commercial side.","And there is a lot of action out there. I mentioned the 35% of our backlog, I would probably say somewhat more than that as a percentage of our discussions of the pipeline out there. And historically we\u2019ve done well. So that adds up an equation with the helicopters and space and some of the other things staying flat or slightly up. That adds up to an equation of flattish growth with maybe some upside. But with the U.S. defense market being what it is. I think we want to keep our feet underneath this our costs under control because there is a unpredictability about that. We think we\u2019ve got that risk covered. We think we understand it, but it remains a bit of a wildcard and we want to be ready if there is a wildcard and I think we will be.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","","That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll stick to one, thanks.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll got to David Strauss of UBS, please go ahead.","David Strauss - UBS","","Greg, you talked about improvement on the 787-9 in terms of the unit cost. As you look out, when would you -- I think you talked about the 787-9 being better from a cash perspective long-term than the 787-8. When do you see the 787-9 catching the 787-8 from a cash perspective? And what are you assuming in terms of the 787-9 as a percentage of the production mix over the next 12 to 18 months?","Greg Smith","","I would say David you\u2019ll see that probably around the 2016 timeframe when you look at what\u2019s in the production flow and the mix between -8 and -9, that\u2019s probably where you\u2019ll really start to see the benefit of the -9 system. I\u2019m sorry I lost you on the second question.","David Strauss - UBS","","Just what you're assuming when you talk about deferred coming down per quarter. What you're assuming for the 787-9 as a percentage of the production mix over the next 12 to 18 months.","Greg Smith","","I can tell over the cost space you\u2019re looking at more about a 40% of that cost space is assumed to be about that -9, some of that obviously is already done and then there\u2019s some assumptions in there about key customers that we will convert from -8 to -9 but generally that\u2019s kind of the profile you see over the entire cost space.","David Strauss - UBS","","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo, please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","","I was wondering if you could just address the situation that got a lot of press around the Ex-Im Bank and the financing. I'm just time to think about if that were not to get renewed, should we start to see BCC's portfolio start to turn in the other direction? Or what would it take for BCC's assets to start to go back up?","Jim McNerney","","Well first of all Sam, I think the chances are good. My assessment is that the, the bank will be reauthorized now there\u2019s risk it won\u2019t okay, but I just want to give you my view and so addressing that risk. You know the Ex-Im bank has come down as a percentage of our customer base in terms of what percentage relies on them and that has reflected a lot of liquidity in the capital markets but there are times when the markets are less friendly that the Ex-Im bank does go up and becomes a significant percentage. The -- I think the issue is more about level playing fields with our competition than it is Boeing goes under without the Ex-Im bank, okay. I mean I think this idea of unilaterally disarming US manufacturers while European manufacturers continue to get copious kinds of Ex-Im type support is something that -- and that traces back to -- I don\u2019t think the political infrastructure will do that. So it\u2019s more an issue of that of losing some campaigns out there where that is important if we didn\u2019t have the Ex-Im bank. Scrambling, using our balance sheet somewhat more and we worked with the net earning assets at BCC down significantly over the last few years. So there\u2019s some room there, but it would be more an issue of competitiveness than it would be an issue, and that\u2019s a big issue, okay, it\u2019s a huge issue, that it would be the balance sheet of Boeing and the credit rating of Boeing being threatened.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","","Thank you.","Troy Lahr","","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","","We\u2019ll now hear from Jason Gursky with Citi, please go ahead.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","","Jim, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind just talking a little bit more about the cycle itself. And your view on how this cycle plays out. We don't have any production rate increases, per se, in front of us for a couple of years. Can you -- how long do you think we can sustain production rates over the course of the rest of this decade? What other growth drivers might you have if we are plateauing in production, per se? And are there plenty of opportunities out there to drive earnings growth through margin expansion if you have plateaued from a production perspective?","Jim McNerney","","Yes, I mean, just starting at the highest possible level I mean, one of the reasons we like being the world\u2019s largest aerospace company, participating in many sectors, some commercial, some defense, some state there obviously is some risk mitigation, value of diversification, some things are up some things are down, so that\u2019s an overall thought and we still like that thought. The -- but I know your question is more centered on the commercial part of our company and again you know we are in a, driven by Boeing in a big technology change out cycle here that is responding to oil prices, you and I can whether it\u2019ll be $90 or a $130. These airplanes payback at any considerable oil price in this unfriendly world we all live in. So starting with the 787 and it\u2019s now flowing through the rest of our wide-body product line promises to flow into our narrow-body product line sometime in the next decade and the next decade we don\u2019t know yet. This offer huge efficiency and maintenance advantages that do encourage people to retire plans earlier than they would where these alternatives not available so and they pay back. So every sign I see is that this technology change out is going to led just look at our airplanes 777X is going to keep going over the next decade or so that I can see right now.","So that\u2019s the difference compared to normal cycles. And so that supports the argument that says, it\u2019s extended and it\u2019s really hard to call. And we have a lot confidence in our production rates they do drop a little bit in \u201917 and \u201918 and in the 777 and in the 87 that we talk about. So we see the extended growth market here.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","","Okay. And then on the earnings growth side in that context and their focus on margins maybe little bit about the big driver see there?","Jim McNerney","","Well I think the big drivers are going to be in our commercial business. We tend to have lumpy earnings when we take too much risk in development. And I think which is why the mantra of de-risking the decade in front of us has been something that where we\u2019ve all after having gone through 787 experience, we all thought a lot about and so flowing the right amount of technology into the 787-9, 787-10 the 737 MAX, 777X-8 and 777X-9 enough to capture enough of this technology advantage but not more than people willing to pay for or more than what drive risk that we\u2019re not willing to absorb, we try to think a lot about that and as I imply and I think it was I forgot who ask the question it might have been done on R&D.","By design we sort of got a stability both in our research and development spending and in the amount of risk associated risk were taking during that and when you ask stability in this business and you get these programs driving margins as we\u2019ve I think demonstrated over the last three to four years you can make money in this business and I think you\u2019re going to see more of that.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","","That is helpful, thank you.","Jim McNerney","","Sure.","Operator","","That completes the analyst question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I\u2019ll now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President and Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Tom Downey","","Thank you, we will continue with the questions for Jim and Greg, if you have any questions after the session ends, please call our Media Relations team at 312 544 2002. Operator we are ready for the first question. And in the interest of time we ask that you limit everyone to just one question please. ","Operator","","We\u2019ll go to Julie Johnsson, Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg News","","Good morning gentlemen.","Jim McNerney","","Good morning.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg News","","Jim you have got a big birthday coming up next month. And can you just walk us through what we can expect on August 23? Will you be at your desk and has the Board approved you staying on past age 65?","Jim McNerney","","The heart will still be beating. The employees will still be cowering. I\u2019ll be working hard, there is no one to decide where continuing to build the succession plan and alternatives to succeed me eventually but there is no discussion of it yet. So there still be asking questions of me.","Operator","","Next we\u2019ll go to Christopher Drew with The New York Times. Please go ahead.","Christopher Drew - The New York Times","","Good morning.","Jim McNerney","","Good morning.","Christopher Drew - The New York Times","Jim and Greg, can you talk a little bit more just in simple terms on the tanker of how the design went off in terms of the wiring harnesses? And it seems like a pretty straightforward problem. What caused the issue?","Jim McNerney","","Just like I\u2019d say any development program once you reach the point of integration whether you\u2019re integrating the structure of the systems and wiring and that\u2019s where you\u2019re really give the capability of the how things are coming together in the efficiency. Structure of those airplanes came together extremely well where the challenges laid were really around the wiring and the wire harnesses themselves and redesigning effort to either move those wires or do whatever rework is required is really what we\u2019re dealing at. We started to experiencing that on the -- started the integration on that first airplane and that continued which really required us again to put some additional effort in place to go back and do redesign on those harnesses and along with that system installation and the manufacturing labor associated with it.","That is basically what is it and again it\u2019s well understood as I mentioned prior to one of the questions, it\u2019s not a technology leap. We know how to do it. We have done some of it already on that first airplane, so we\u2019re building off of that experience. And again, we\u2019re looking continue to de-risk the program and drive performance through the balance, which is again a reason why we put those labs or maybe investment in some of those technology labs and we\u2019re already seen the benefits of making that investment today. So team is very focused, they know what needs to get done and it\u2019s all about focusing on meeting customer commitments and that is our priority at this time. And we\u2019ve got a plan to go execute to do that and it\u2019s a day-to-day hour by hour and the team is very focused on again the task at hand.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Doug Cameron with the Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron - Wall Street Journal","Going back to the Ex-Im issue -- you seemed to imply a little bit that the -- you might be prepared to use the balance sheet but -- if you had to. But given that we know the arguments on both sides, Jim, would you be prepared to support some reform of Ex-Im going forward that perhaps restricted or limited the either the type of aircraft or the type of customer that had availability to it, which would at least preserve the broader competitive position even if perhaps Ex-Im fell a bit behind what the ECAs offer. But would you support some sort of reform?","Jim McNerney","Well, I think we have been supportive of reform over the last number of cycles. I mean as you know, the terms and conditions are a function of a treaty that basically the OECD nations debate and sign, and we have supported over the last couple of cycles increasing rates, increasing fees, making both of those more commercial term in nature. So that -- and do it in concert with the other ECAs around the world. And we\u2019ll continue to support this move toward more close alignment with commercial terms and we\u2019ll continue to support all kinds of efforts like that done in concert within the treaty. I think where we get uncomfortable is when we say, oh tractors, you can\u2019t land against tractors or gas turbines or wide-body airplanes. I mean why are -- why do we pick certain elements that some raise as not in need of support while the rest of the economy is. I support none of that.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Steve Wilhelm with Puget Sound Business Journal. Please go ahead.","Steve Wilhelm - Puget Sound Business Journal","Hi, gentlemen. In terms of the robotization of the 777X line, I wondered if you could talk about plans to expand that throughout other production lines in the future and also what that has to do with the competitiveness in terms of Europe and maybe China way in the future.","Jim McNerney","I think automation is and I know you\u2019re aware is we\u2019re starting with the 777 Fuselage. Lot of good work being done, hope of expanding it to both improve the quality of our airplanes to cost of which we produce them and the safety for our work and safety for our workforce. And yes, it is fair to say that overtime we would anticipate expanding that capability. There are other examples besides automation of the fuselage. There is paint shop 777 wing. I was out in Seattle recently and toward that, a terrific job being done using automation to paint major structures. So we are focused on that to improve our cost, quality and lives of our workers. And we will expand it overtime.","Troy Lahr","Operator, we have time for one last question please.","Operator","And that will be from Stephen Trimble with Flight Global. Please go ahead.","Stephen Trimble - Flight Global","On the tanker issue, we have seen a couple of warnings from DOCD and the DAO that the program could run 6 to 12 month late. And they haven't said anything about wiring harnesses or problems with the wiring. They've talked more about concerns about software and the aggressive flight test rates. Can you address those issues and are those things under control? Or is there a risk of further delays and further cost increases?","Jim McNerney","We don\u2019t see that today. I think on the flight test, we have from the very beginning as part of the fixed-price development contract, proposed a more commercial like flight test program. Our customer has agreed with us. When viewed parametrically, it seems shorter than other flight tests that are done in other ways, not as efficiently. So we disagree with that assessment. And other than the problems that Greg described on the wiring separation, wiring bundles some of that detailed design. The rest of the program is moving along well in part because of these laboratories we\u2019ve set up at our own cost to de-risk systems quickly to fuel system before installing it on the airplanes. So doesn\u2019t mean that something can\u2019t crop up in the future but we don\u2019t see it now.","Tom Downey","That concludes our earnings call again.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Scott Fitterer, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Fitterer, please go ahead.","Scott Fitterer","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Call. I'm Scott Fitterer and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer Elect.","After comments by Jim and Greg, we'll take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we may include in our discussions this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking disclaimers at the end of the web presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.","W. James McNerney","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin with a few brief comments on the business environment, followed by some thoughts on our strong performance during 2011. After that, Greg will walk through our financial results and our 2012 outlook. And then we'd be glad, as always, to take your questions.","Starting with the business environment on Slide 2. While global economic growth slowed during 2011, air transportation remained notably resilient on balance, adjusting to various regional economic impacts throughout the year. Passenger traffic grew at a pace slightly above the long-term average, while cargo traffic was flat for the year and even saw declines in recent months. With load factors at record highs and utilization rates near prior peak levels, we expect passenger growth rates to remain in line with historical trends during 2012.","Growth in cargo traffic is expected to trend below the historical average, although we expect to see improvement in the second half of this year. Emerging markets continue to fuel worldwide airline fleet expansion. Demand in developed markets also remains high, driven by retirement and replacement of older, less efficient airplanes.","The combination of strong demand and our customer-preferred line of more fuel-efficient products and services generated orders in 2011 that significantly exceeded our initial expectations. Our orders were balanced across programs, geographic regions and airplane business models.","Twin-aisle demand was exceptionally strong, with the 777 reaffirming its market leadership with a record 200 net orders across both passenger and freighter models. The 767 program also had a big year, extending its production well into the next decade with the U.S. Air Force tanker contract and signing an important order for new freighters with FedEx.","On the single-aisle side, we capped the year and a series of major wins with our largest Commercial Airplane order ever: the $19 billion deal with Southwest Airlines for 208 737NG and MAX airplanes.","Customer response to the 737 MAX accelerated rapidly through the fall, and orders and commitments now total more than 1,000 airplanes from 15 customers. We anticipate finalizing most of these arrangements this year.","The rapid uptake on the MAX since its August launch has validated our decision to address this important market segment with the solution our customers want along with the time line they need, and an airplane that maintains a sizeable economic advantage over its competitors.","With $75 billion in new orders for the year, Commercial Airplanes' backlog grew by $40 billion to a record $296 billion, further solidifying the unprecedented growth opportunity we have in front of us. While we continue to monitor the European debt crisis, we foresee a manageable situation for aircraft financing in 2012. Boeing airplanes are attractive, value-creating assets, and sources of financing for them remain broad and diverse.","Turning to Defense, Space & Security. Despite growing constraints on U.S. government spending plans, we were pleased with the results of the fiscal year 2012 budget process and the level of funding approved for Boeing programs. Our portfolio of proven, affordable and reliable systems and services continues to advantage us in U.S. and international markets.","While tough contracting conditions and flat to declining budgets will continue to characterize the U.S. defense budget -- the U.S. defense market, we foresee significant upside potential in international markets, which we expect will generate 25% to 30% of revenues within just a few years and offer an opportunity to offset domestic reductions.","Our core strategies for Defense, Space & Security are as I've described them before: extend our existing programs by bringing capability and affordability to our customers; capture a growing share of international opportunities; and continue investments in expanding target markets such as unmanned systems, cybersecurity and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. These strategies along with a relentless effort to maximize efficiencies and reduce infrastructure costs in support of the Defense Department's affordability initiatives will ensure continued success in the current environment and maintain our ability to invest in the future and respond to customer needs.","In summary, despite pockets of economic uncertainty and defense budget pressures, our markets remain large and growing in the aggregate. We are exceptionally well positioned for growth in the expanding commercial airplane market, and we are taking the right steps to maintain a competitive advantage in our Defense, Space & Security segment.","Turning to the fourth quarter and overall 2011 highlights on Slide 3. 2011 was a pivotal year for our company where we made substantial progress on our business strategies and delivered strong operating performance across our core production and services programs. Commercial Airplanes generated 9.7% margins, delivered 477 airplanes and recorded net orders for 805 airplanes.","It also retired key technical and business risks for the certification and initial deliveries of the 787 and 747-8. It was a long, tough road on both of those programs, but we got there. And thanks to the relentless determination and ingenuity of our people and the support of our program partners, we have created 2 new airplanes that will deliver significant value to our customers and company for decades to come.","The 787s in service with launch customer ANA are performing well, with high dispatch liability rates and a favorable passenger response to the features and capabilities of the airplane. Our priority on the 787 now is to ensure a disciplined ramp-up in production and to increase deliveries to our consumers. Although we fell short of our targeted 87 deliveries for 2011, transition to a production rate of 2.5 per month has been successfully implemented. Condition of assembly is improving with each airplane, and we are closely monitoring the entire supply chain to ensure operational stability as we systematically ramp up to higher rates. We plan to complete the next production system rate increase to 3.5 airplanes per month in the second quarter, tracking as expected to the planned 10 per month production rate and final assembly by late 2013.","With the airplane design stabilized and out-of-sequence work being reduced as planned, we expect change incorporation requirements to decrease progressively with each airplane moving through production in the first half of the year. The first non-change incorporation airplane will be a line number in the mid-60s coming out of the factory this summer.","Final assembly of the first 787 built in South Carolina also is progressing to plan, with weight on wheels achieved in December. First delivery from our new customer delivery center in Charleston is expected mid-year.","The first 787 powered by GE engines is on track to deliver later this quarter. We also continue to make steady progress on 787-9 development, with first flight scheduled for 2013 in support of the first customer delivery in early 2014.","Moving to the 747-8 program. During the fourth quarter, we delivered 9 747-8 freighters to 3 customers. The airplane is performing well in revenue service. In December, the intercontinental passenger model received its type certification and is scheduled for first delivery later this quarter. Production system rate increases on the 747 are underway and also tracking to plan.","In addition to managing to ramp-ups on the 87 and the 47-8, we continue to implement planned production rate increases on both the 737 and 777 in order to meet market demand. The 737 program has successfully increased its production rate to 35 airplanes per month, with the next planned increase to 38 per month in the second quarter of 2013, and then up to 42 per month in the first half of 2014.","The 777 has successfully increased rate to 7 airplanes per month, with the next planned increased to 8.3 per month in the first quarter of 2013. The value created by these 2 franchise programs is substantial and will continue to grow as rates increase.","We are working closely with our supplier partners to execute all planned rate increases efficiently and effectively. Over the next 3 years, our overall Commercial Airplane output will rise by more than 40%.","In December, we retired significant risk to our production rate ramp-up and growth plans when we reached an early 4-year contract extension with our machinist union in Puget Sound. This landmark agreement secures delivery stability for our customers and contains economics that make us more competitive. Engaging early was the right thing to do, and we were very pleased with the outcome.","Shifting to Defense, Space & Security. Despite a very tough environment, solid operating performance for 2011 generated 9.9% margins as we delivered 115 aircraft, 4 satellites and many other systems and services. Key deliveries for the year included the introduction of the next-generation Apache Block III helicopter, delivery of the first 2 Korean AEW&C aircraft and the final delivery of the Italian tanker.","Equally impressive for Defense, Space & Security in 2011 was a series of strategic wins of new business, starting with the Air Force Tanker Program. This win preserved our 50-year franchise as the provider of aerial refuelers to the United States military, and it opens the door to sizeable international opportunities. The program is progressing to plan with every program milestone met on schedule.","The second big strategic win was the agreement reached between the U.S. government and Saudi Arabia for the purchase of 84 new F-15 aircraft and upgrades to 70 existing aircraft. This purchase will extend the F-15 line into the second half of this decade and position it well for additional international sales.","Other major BDS awards for 2011 include: the Ground-based Midcourse Defense development sustainment contract from the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, a low-rate initial production contract for 13 P-8A Poseidons for the U.S. Navy, a U.K. Ministry of Defense order for 14 new Chinooks, a 5-year C-17 sustainment contract with the U.S. Air Force, and an initial contract for NASA's new Space Launch System.","Looking back at 2011, I think it would be tough to find another year that included such a broad-based set of achievements. We advanced the product and business strategies that are critical to our future, and we are a stronger, more competitive company as a result.","As we begin 2012, I am confident that our strategies and plans are aligned to the changing business environment, and that our focus on disciplined execution of our backlog will result in substantial growth in the years ahead.","At this point, I'd like to take just one more moment to recognize the big fella, James Bell, for his extraordinary service to Boeing. As you are all aware by now, James will retire at the end of the quarter after 40 years with our company. As CFO, he created a world-class finance organization and a culture of continuous improvement. He is an extraordinary leader and business partner, and his contributions over the years will have a lasting impact. We all thank him and wish him the best of luck and continued success in all that he does.","And with that, I want to welcome Greg Smith to his first call as our new CFO. Many of you already know Greg from prior roles, including our Corporate Controller for the last 2 years. He's an extremely capable and seasoned industry leader with a uniquely broad experience set. His insight into how the business works from the ground level up is a tremendous asset to have in a CFO. So Greg, with those kind words, which you may never hear again, over to you.","Greg Smith","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let me begin with our 2011 financial results on Slide 4. Revenue for the year was $68.7 billion, up 7% from a year ago due to higher delivery volume and mix. Earnings per share for the year were $5.34, with operating margins at 8.5%, both reflecting strong operating performance across our businesses.  Results were also affected by a favorable tax settlement and higher pension expense.","Operating cash for the year was $4 billion. This reflects strong performance from both businesses, offsetting our continued investment in the 787 and 747-8 program.","Let's look at fourth quarter performance on Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $19.6 billion, up 18% from the same period last year due to increased commercial aircraft deliveries and mix. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.84, again reflecting continued strong performance across the businesses and the favorable tax settlement, offset by higher pension expense.","Let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. Boeing Commercial Airplanes fourth quarter revenue was $10.7 billion, with operating margins of 9.2%. This reflects strong core operating performance across the business, lower R&D, partially offset by the dilutive impact of the initial 787 and 747-8 deliveries and higher period costs including 787 fleet support. For the year, Commercial Airplanes reported $36.2 billion of revenue on 477 airplane deliveries with operating margins of 9.7%, again reflecting strong performance across core production programs and our services business.","During the quarter, we extended the accounting quantities on the 737 by 600 units, the 767 by 24 units and the 777 by 50 units. The financial impact of these extensions in the quarter was not significant.","Gross inventory for the company includes $20 billion related to the 787 program, an increase of approximately $6.9 billion during 2011. Gross inventory for the 787 program is expected to increase approximately $4 billion in 2012 as we continue ramping up production rates.","Included in the work-in-process inventory are deferred production costs. The deferred balance for the program was $10.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and includes almost 50 airplanes still in process. As we said in the third quarter, the deferred production balance will continue to grow as we increase production rates and introduce the 787-9 derivative. We anticipate the deferred production cost to peak at slightly over $20 billion and then decline after the program achieves the planned production rate of 10 per month and stabilizes at that level.","The 787 program continues to record a low single-digit gross margin, and we're proactively working opportunities to offset risk and increase profitability. Some of those areas we're addressing include leveraging our buying power by combining purchases on common commodities such as raw material and fasteners, reducing cost for us and our suppliers. Through lean and other initiatives, we continue to look for opportunities to refine our assembly and fabrication methods and designs, focusing on cost and flow time reductions, again in our factories and within our supply chain.","We're also looking at our production rates. Once we've demonstrated our ability to successfully execute the planned rate increases, we will consider rates above 10 per month. All of these and other opportunities are being actively addressed, as improving our profitability on the 787 program continues to be a top priority for us.","Boeing Commercial Airplanes won 391 gross orders during the quarter, including 241 737s and 75 777s, while 11 orders were canceled. The commercial backlog remains very strong at over 3,700 airplanes valued at a record $296 billion.","Moving now to Slide 7 and our Defense, Space & Security business. BDS reported $32 billion of revenue in 2011, with operating margins of 9.9% for the year, reflecting strong core operating performance across the businesses. For the fourth quarter, BDS generated $8.5 billion of revenue with operating margins of 10.2%, again reflecting continued strong performance.","Boeing Military Aircraft quarterly revenues increased 9% to $3.9 billion, driven by improved mix and higher deliveries. Operating margins increased to 9.5%, driven by strong execution across various programs.","Network & Space Systems revenue of $2 billion decreased on lower volume associated with the Brigade Combat Team Modernization termination. Operating margins decreased to 8.6% due to increased research and development expense as we continue to invest in our future.","Global Services & Support revenue increased 21% to $2.6 billion for the quarter, primarily driven by higher revenue on integrated logistics support. Operating margins were strong at 12.6%. BDS backlog remains strong at $60 billion.","Now turning to Slide 8 and our Other businesses. Boeing Capital reported pretax loss of $8 million in the quarter and a pretax income of $125 million for the year, driven by smaller portfolio and higher asset impairments. The portfolio balance at the end of the year was $4.6 billion, unchanged from the beginning of the quarter and down from $4.7 billion at the beginning of the year.","During the quarter, Other segment earnings of $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 were driven by credit rate upgrade on certain financing receivables. In addition, the loss in the unallocated eliminations increased due to higher pension and deferred compensation expense, which was partially offset by the charitable trust contribution that impacted fourth quarter 2010.","During the fourth quarter, we recorded a non-cash income tax benefit of $397 million or $0.52 per share, resulting from a settlement with the IRS for tax years 2004 through 2006. During 2011, pension expense for the company increased $547 million to $1.6 billion, and we contributed $531 million to our pension plans. Our pension asset returns for the year were 8.4%, driven by strong performance in nearly all asset classes.","Our expected return assumptions going forward remain at 7.75%. The discount rates used to calculate pension liability decreased from 5.3% in 2010 to 4.4% at the end of 2011. The company's pension plans are now 75% funded on a financial accounting basis and 99% funded on an ERISA basis.","Let's turn now to Slide 9 to discus cash flow. We generated $4 billion of operating cash in 2011, driven by strong performance across the businesses, greater Commercial Airplane deliveries and advanced payments. Capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion were as expected.","Turning to cash and debt balances on Slide 10. We ended the year with $11.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. Debt levels remained flat during the quarter. Our cash position provides strong liquidity and positions us well to continue to focus on our cash deployment strategies and invest for continued growth.","Turning now to Slide 11 to discuss our outlook for 2012. Guidance for 2012 reflects solid core operating performance in our businesses, higher volumes in Commercial Airplanes, partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of the current DoD environment.","Revenues for 2012 are forecasted to increase by approximately 16% to be between $78 billion and $80 billion, driven by increased deliveries at Commercial Airplanes. EPS guidance is set at $4.05 to $4.25% per share. This includes a $2.21 per share impact for pension expense, an $0.83 per share increase from 2011.","We expect first quarter EPS and cash flow to be the lowest during the year, based on timing of deliveries and phasing of expenditures. First quarter EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full year earnings.","The 2012 commercial delivery forecast is between 585 and 600 airplanes and is sold out. This includes a combined 70 to 85 787s and 747-8 deliveries split roughly equally between the 2 programs. The majority of the 787s being delivered during 2012 will be airplanes that require change incorporation.","We're seeing continued improvements in quality and the condition of assembly of the units coming out of the 787 final assembly line, resulting in reduced change incorporation requirements on each airplane. We have a clear understanding of the scope of work that needs to be completed on each airplane, as well as dedicated resources and the facilities to complete the effort. In addition, we continue to actively engage with our overall supply chain and vigorously monitor predictive metrics that span the entire production system, allowing us to mitigate issues and potential risks.","Airplanes coming off the 787 final assembly line during the first half of 2012 will require substantially less change incorporation work than the earlier planes and by mid-year, we expect airplanes coming off the line will flow more directly into customer deliveries.","Moving to cash flow. We expect 2012 operating cash to be greater than $5 billion. This includes $1.5 billion of discretionary pension funding. We expect minimal required pension contributions through 2013, though we plan to make discretionary contributions above required levels.","In 2012, we expect Other segment expense to be about $200 million and unallocated expense to be about $1.6 billion. 2012 pension expense is expected to be $2.6 billion, an increase of $1 billion from last year. This increase is primarily driven by the low interest rate environment. R&D expense for 2012 is forecast to be between $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion as we continue to invest for future growth.","We are forecasting capital expenditures to be about $2 billion in 2012. This represents continued investment and ramp-up of commercial production rates, as well as investments in support of long-term growth and productivity.","Let me turn now to Slide 12 to discuss how we bridge our 2011 performance to our 2012 guidance. Our overall performance across the business continues to be strong in '12, with core operating engine producing 7% growth in adjusted EPS. Commercial Airplane core performance as well as increased 737 and 777 deliveries will provide positive impact to earnings in 2012.","Margins at BCA will be largely impacted by the lower R&D, offset by the 787 and 747-8 margin dilution, continued ramp-up of 787 fleet support and continued investment to support ongoing business growth.  Earnings and margins remain strong in the Defense business, but are expected to decrease in 2012. This decrease is driven by both volume and mix as we continue to realize the impact of the evolving DoD environment.","As I mentioned earlier, pension expense will be a headwind for us in 2012 when the expected EPS impact an additional $0.83. We expect that tax rate for 2012 to increase to approximately 35% due to reduced R&D spending and the resulting lower R&D tax credit.","Again, 2011 was a strong year driven by solid core performance across our businesses. We expect that performance to continue into 2012 as we remain focused on production program profitability, rate ramp-up and productivity improvements.","Now I'll turn it back to Jim for some final thoughts. Jim?","W. James McNerney","Thank you, Greg. In 2011, Boeing improved on every major financial metric: revenue, earnings and operating cash and all by pretty wide margins. And we generated tremendous momentum for the future with exciting new programs like the 737 MAX and the Air Force tanker.","As we enter 2012, our ongoing focus and priorities are: production ramp-up and profitability across all our Commercial Airplane programs; successful execution of ongoing development efforts on the 787-9, 737 MAX and Air Force tanker; and to continue repositioning our Defense business while extending our core programs and expanding internationally.","On the strength of our product and services strategies and our team's commitment to innovation and continuous productivity improvements, we have positioned Boeing for a period of strong and sustained growth in the years ahead. This is the moment we have been waiting for, and we look forward to delivering on the promise.","With that said, we'd be very happy now to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I've got a question that's kind of a commercial question. So if I look at what you're saying about your delivery guidance for 2012, it looks like the company's planning on delivering somewhere between 35 and 45 787s. Only 3 were delivered last year. You went through the targets where you want to get to in terms of break points of production rates. So the question really is how did that get there? And how did that dovetail with the operating margin projection for 2012, which is 8.5% to 9%, which seems kind of disappointing given where production rates are going?","W. James McNerney","Well, is there a particular part of that question you'd like me to focus on there, Ron? I mean, is it the...","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","They're both kind of tied together, so you pick.","W. James McNerney","Okay, yes. All right. I'll just start. Look, we're confident in the amount of 87s and 47s we have projected to deliver. Recalling that a little more than half of the 87s are going to come out of change incorporation, I mean, they're being worked on today and many of them are largely finished and the balance will come out of production, come off the end of the line as an increasing number as the mix changes from changing core planes to straight off-the-line planes, we'll get through a lot of that mountain this year. So there's a little more than half 87s in work now, a high degree of confidence in being able to predict when they'll be done. On the 47-8, I mean we're -- the production ramp-up is going well. I think if you extrapolate what we've delivered in the last part of 2011 into 2012, that all hangs together very nicely. And the margins, I think we've been very open with you on the margins on the 87, and we've got a big program that Greg outlined to improve them. But the margin -- if your question ultimately gets to why isn't there more operating margin?","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, where's the leverage?","W. James McNerney","It's in 2012. Look, I think as Greg said, the guidance for BCA is prudent. I mean, it hangs together. We're in an industry where experience has shown to be prudent at the front end and unfold as you go along is the way to live life. And this all hangs together in terms of increased lead support that we've got to do with the new airplanes and some sort of one-time things that are associated with 2 simultaneous introductions, those are headwinds, and the pension that we talked about. I think it's -- there's an opportunity to do better. But it's -- often times, it's prudent to plan for some things that have happened historically.","Operator","And next we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perhaps, Greg, you could talk a little bit more about the operating cash flow and the components within for '12; some of the moving pieces. You talked about deferred production, which rises throughout the year, because of course the peak sounds like it's a few years away. But maybe you can also talk about physical inventory and other components. For example, maybe the difference between production and delivery and how that works out on 787? It sounds like they're roughly similar. And then maybe finish up with your priorities on cash deployment.","Greg Smith","Sure. I mean, Rob, obviously a lot of the cash that's being generated in 2012 is directly linked to our delivery profile coming out of BCA. So the 787s and the 747s Jim just talked about, as well as the increased production on the 37 and obviously on the 777 deliveries, that is the key driver to our increased cash flow and it will be going forward. With regards to inventory, as I talked about, the inventory is going to continue to grow here, and that'll really start to taper off once we hit peak production on the 87 and start to stabilize at that rate, that's when you'll start to see that turn. And I think we've got solid plans in place to make that happen. What was your follow-on there?","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The last -- yes, how do you think about deployment? Yes.","Greg Smith","Cash deployment. Yes. I mean, certainly as we look at our plan and we look at our improved operating cash going forward, it's a priority for us. We continuously look at it. You saw we increased the dividend in the first quarter. But we'll take a balanced approach like we have in the past. We'll look at share repurchase. We'll look at our pension plans. We'll look at investing in our future and balance that out. But it's certainly at the forefront of our mind as we continue to deliver strong cash flow.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Greg, do you see different types of cash return solutions at different times like '12 versus '13 and '14?","Greg Smith","Well as I said, I think as we execute '12, we'll be looking a lot harder and ramping up our deployment strategies '13 and beyond.","Operator","And we'll go to Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I want to go back on the 787. And the rate has continued to slide. And I'm trying to understand 2 things. One is first, you've held fast to the 10 per month at the end of 2013, even as the rate has pushed to the right a little bit over the last year. And then also, when we look at the rate coming down, I'm trying to understand where the risk is on margin. And by that, I mean there's the margin on the 787 program itself, but if you see delays, that results in customer compensation, it results in issues around overhead absorption on other programs. So where should we look -- if we see more delays, where should we look for the margin issue? So really, those 2 things. How to keep the rate at this level, and where we should see the margin impact?","Greg Smith","Well, yes. There's no question, Doug. That would all put pressure on the margin if everything moved to the right. But as I mentioned, we are working other initiatives and opportunities to try to offset that risk. But when you look at kind of near-term, as Jim talked about, a lot of the airplanes that are -- or at least the majority that are going to get delivered next year on the 87 are in mod center. They're in the changing corp area. So when you separate that from rate ramp and then you look at the balance coming out of rate ramp, as you know, we've executed the last rate ramp and we're about to execute the next one. And then we'll execute another one by the end of the year. So we're on a steady pace. Charleston, you know the progress that we've made there, and we'll expect a delivery out of there in the second half as well. So we're balancing all of that. There's certainly -- again, there's no question that if you have delays, its going to put pressure on margins, but I think we're actively working opportunities, and we're trying obviously not have any schedule slips and execute to the plans we got in place between the change center and final delivery out of Charleston and out of Everett.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But the rate ramp, if we go back a year ago, you had the same target at the end of 2013. I'm trying to understand, the shape of that rate ramp looks somewhat different today. What's happened? What has that meant for performance in getting this ramp that obviously has to accelerate more in the back end?","W. James McNerney","I think, Doug, over -- I'd have to look at it to be sure, and the guys can clean this up if I'm a little bit wrong. I don't think the rate ramp has changed much over the last year, 1.5 years. I think what's happened, as events came out of flight test, as we went through flight test, a lot of engineering change went back into planes we'd already built. And that's been our challenge, is the planes that are in change incorp now are the ones that have been pushed out. That flow of change has stopped now. So there is much more clarity on what has to be done in the change incorporation. The rate ramp has stayed. That has been our plan for the last year, 1.5 years. And so we're -- and that's not the issue. The issue is engineering change, which has now largely stopped, back into the early produced airplanes based on flight test discoveries. That's done now. I think that math -- maybe you could sit down with me, Doug. If that makes any sense to you, Doug.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So your concern right now is more on getting deliveries out, which includes a lot of change incorporation more than it is getting your production rate up. Is that fair?","W. James McNerney","Yes. I mean that's forcing me into a big statement, because we're worried about both, okay? Those are both execution things that we've got to monitor very closely and work very hard on. But as I said before, more than half of the planned 87 deliveries this year are coming out of change incorp and then the ramping up after that. And there'll be some off the end of the line, but the ramping up after that will be as we move from 2.5, which we've already done, to 3.5 in the second quarter, to 5 by the end of the year. And that looks manageable as we sit here today.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I thought I would change things for a moment and talk about freighters, Jim. There's a number of things that you've accomplished, and you've still got some things still to do. Could you sort of address some of the open items still related with the 78 -- excuse me, the 74-8, and what are you -- how you're going to place those Atlas airplanes, for example? And then related to the FedEx order, you talked about incremental opportunities. Could you also talk and address sort of how this dovetails with what you're doing on the tanker?","W. James McNerney","Sure. Let me address the 47-8. The production is going well, and we have a pretty decent pipeline, Howard, of planes that we're working right now, most of which are decisionable in 2012. So we're cautiously optimistic about good order news this year. Now as you know, Howard, you've been around this industry a long time, I mean, this has been, for the ultra-big airplanes going through this economic cycle, has not been a big -- huge airplane's friend. But having said that, the freighters are very productive machines for these guys. The amount of money an operator makes versus what he's been making is tremendous incentive. But it's not only freighters. We have a decent international -- intercontinental pipeline, and there's some VIP airplanes that we're talking to people about. So a pretty decent pipeline. On the 67, we have -- the FedEx order was important for a very important customer, provides a nice bridge to the tanker production. We have a couple of other customers who are continuing to operate the 67 and with whom we are discussing. And a couple of them stand a good chance to come home. I think the -- but the linchpin was the FedEx order. And some of the others, we would have to sort of work in around FedEx and tanker production. We can do it, and we are actively trying to do it. But the big downside has been avoided, okay, is the way to think about that.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. But still you have -- just to push back for a second, you still have a couple of open-risk items on the 78. You've got that flutter issue -- excuse me, 74-8, excuse me, the flutter issue on the tail. And then also, as I said, how do you encourage someone to take the rejected Atlas airplanes?","W. James McNerney","Well, we're in active discussions on the Atlas airplanes. And the flutter issue -- look, any issue that we have to address is an important issue. I would not characterize that as out of bounds in terms of normal issues we deal with, with new introductions. And we have a good degree of confidence we'll be able to work through that issue, as do we on placing the Atlas airplanes and on executing a pipeline beyond the orders we have right now.","Operator","And next we go to Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, please extend our congrats to James on an amazing career.","W. James McNerney","We'll do. We'll do.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. Greg, I wondered if we could dive into some details with 2 quick accounting clarifications. First, you said the block extensions had no material impact on the quarter, but I would assume that those 600 737s should be higher average margin, unless you're leaving some room for a downturn in the kind of mid-decade. So if you could clarify there, it would be helpful. And then sticking with the accounting, it looks like the universe's program differences in Q4 were a little under $1 billion on a net basis. But I presume on a gross basis the 87 and 47 were a bit higher, with some offset from the mature programs. So if you could give us some color on how those numbers looked on a gross rather than a net basis, since you guys didn't provide a 47 deferred production disclosure, that would be helpful.","Greg Smith","Yes. So on that point, on the 87, I'd tell you on a unit basis, it's improved as we'd expect. So as we're coming down the learning curve, we'll have improved unit margins. I'd also mention that that's not -- don't expect that to be linear going forward because of the way we're delivering airplanes and some are coming out of change incorp, some of them are coming out of Everett final assembly, you're going to see a little bit of bouncing around on a unit basis. But certainly for this quarter, the biggest impact was the 9 747s. And that's really the big driver in there from when you at the difference over Q3 to Q4. But again, 87 on a unit did improve.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And was there a material -- on a gross basis, was there a material offset from the 37s and 777s in the quarter that gets you back down to $1 billion?","Greg Smith","Yes. It was a small offset there, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on the block extension, on the 600 73s?","Greg Smith","Yes. So obviously, some of -- it's a competitive environment we're dealing with on the 737, but we're facing into that. We're looking at obviously cost reductions going forward. And when you look at the maturity of that program and how far out this is in the time frame, it doesn't have a significant impact on the overall block. And obviously, it's something we continue to focus on and look at, but nothing significant within this quarter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But presumably, those airplanes are priced already, right? I mean, the backlog's so deep, you would know the prices on those planes. So I would think the only uncertainty would be the volume of when you're producing those 600 airplanes, which is kind of in the middle of the decade. So if I were to compare the production rates in the middle of the decade rather to where they are now, unless there's some sort of material negative to the pricing or unless you've got room there for reductions in volume, just for prudence, then I would assume that it'd be something. But apparently, there's nothing.","Greg Smith","Not material.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have -- I'm going to cheat a little bit. I have a clarification request and then a question. They're both pretty simple. On the clarification, Greg, the R&D -- I'm looking at Slide 12 in your margin reconciliation for Commercial, and R&D is 100 bip pickup. When I do the math, given your revenue guidance, that implies the R&D is going to be up $400 million in Commercial.","Greg Smith","I don't know -- I haven't done the math to that degree, but it's going to be lower by $500 million. And that should obviously give us a positive impact on the margin.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. I mean R&D was 7.5% of sales in 2011, and you're saying it's going to be 6.5%. But 6.5 times $48.5 billion of revenue is...","Greg Smith","You know what we'll do, Joe? I'll have Scott call you right after and make sure we clear it up.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I mean, it just seems like an $800 million gorilla kind of hiding the numbers. But...","Greg Smith","Okay. It is coming down, and we'll get a margin increase for that. But he'll get together with you and sort it out.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure enough. Okay. And then in the fourth quarter, your margin looked like it did tick down a little bit in your core programs, if I kind of back out a reasonable revenue number for the 47s and the 87s. Was there a pickup in fleet support? Or is there something else going on there? Did gross margins change on the 37 and 777 I guess is the question?","Greg Smith","Yes, there was a little bit of pickup on fleet support. And then we had some higher escalation as well that was incorporated into the booking rates. So that was essentially it.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So gross margins were, on the 2 core programs there, were intact sequentially?","Greg Smith","One was up slightly, and one was down slightly.","Operator","And we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the order outlook as you look into 2012? I'm trying to think about BCA and really with the 737 MAX, those indications turning into firm orders, and excluding that as well? And then if you can give us some indication on the defense side, I don't know if all of those orders, the Saudi, the GMD, I don't know exactly if everything is in backlog yet or if we should still see some pickup on that order activity as well? And then, I guess related to that is what that means on the advances line when we look at the cash flow?","W. James McNerney","I'll answer the market-oriented question while Greg is thinking about advances. With my tongue in my cheek a little, we will have more orders than production next year. But we -- and that's our official guidance. But we should have a pretty good orders year next year. As you pointed out, the conversion of the MAX commitments into orders, that's I think largely visible to you as you track this. But we also see robust order activity in our other product lines. And so we see, by historical comparisons, a pretty robust order situation of BCA. And Greg, you correct me if I'm wrong here. I think the Saudi deal, the finalization of that is not in backlog as we sit here right now. There's some final details being worked through between the governments before we can properly book it. But the arrangements are -- the key elements of the arrangements are done. So that is a pickup you will see. And on GMB -- is that in backlog? Yes, that'll be over the next couple of months as well.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And on the advances, is that something...","W. James McNerney","Greg? Go ahead, Greg.","Greg Smith","Are you talking on the Commercial?","W. James McNerney","I think he's talking Commercial. Right?","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Specifically, it's mostly commercial because unless it's -- I'm not sure if that's a direct order or not, the Saudi, but just in terms of just on the cash flow line, that advances line, how much of a net source will that be over the course of the year?","Greg Smith","I mean, it'll definitely be up, the Saudi being a big driver of that. And then the strong commercial orders that we're foreseeing will certainly help that in 2012.","Operator","And next we'll go to Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to put a little finer point on the orders in 2012. And also, actually, Jim, see if you can touch on financing and pricing a little bit for us. So you said it should be pretty good but obviously, when we look at the 737 MAX commitments, does it look like you could get north of 1,000 orders this year versus what you did last year?","W. James McNerney","Well again, I don't want to put an exact number down because as you know, it can move around. But I will say that the vast majority of the commitments that we got last year, in all likelihood will be booked this year, okay? And as you know, we exited the year with close to 1,000 orders and commitments, most of those were commitments. So there's a good slug there. And we have a pretty robust pipeline on our other models. So I don't want to exactly compare year-over-year, but it's -- versus historical kinds of years, it should be another pretty robust year. And that's included in our cash guidance.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then with respect of financing, Jim, because obviously there's concern about the European banks, is all of financing substantially in place for the 2012 planes? And maybe turn to comments on pricing, are you getting price appreciation on the 777 now the A340 is officially dead? And talk about 737 MAX pricing.","W. James McNerney","Yes. I think the -- I'll just take them in reverse order. The 737 pricing is about what we'd projected. I mean, there are not huge impact swings versus our plan. And as you know it's a competitive marketplace, but it is not dramatically different. And the dynamics there are to continue to sell out the NG up to and including the blend in of the MAX. And that's going well. As you've noticed, with -- i think virtually every commitment we've gotten on MAX's, we've also gotten commitments on NGs, which in some cases puts a little pressure on pricing, but more than offset by the economies of ensuring a smooth dovetail and smooth production. And so that all works out economically on a margin basis. And on the 777 -- listen, the 777 is in a very strong market position right now. And the value we're getting for that airplane is all different kinds of value, of which prices one element remains very strong. And then the financing situation you were asking about, Heidi, we do not see an issue with getting our backlog financed this year. I mean, there are some finance sources moving around, some people with less appetite, more with others who have more appetite. But I think when our BCC people and our treasury folks take a very cold-eyed hard look at it, and I know XM's being debated in Congress and we anticipate resolution there, I think we feel comfortable with getting the backlog financed.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And quickly, Greg, can you talk to us about the timing of cash flow over the course of the year? Is it lumpy? Or how should we think about that over the next coming quarters?","Greg Smith","Yes, it's lumpy but back-loaded as we would typically see in our profile.","Scott Fitterer","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","And that will come from Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So it looks like you missed your 787 delivery for the year and your forecast for this year assumes that you exit the year, it looks like, at approximately the same number of planes in inventory. So it appears as if completions are more difficult. Could you help us understand why? And secondly, it seems like maybe your ability to ramp the rate is in line with expectations or maybe improving. So maybe give us some color on those 2 issues if you could?","W. James McNerney","Well, you're right. A couple of planes slid out of '11 into '12 coming out of change incorporation, but they've already been delivered. This was not a major slide indicating a different view of our production capability. And as I said before, Cai, the majority of the planes we will deliver this year will come out of change incorp, slightly more than half. But we will exit the year with a pretty good production flow going. But there still will be some change incorp planes that are yet to be delivered. And so the lines -- you're right, change incorp down; production up; inventory same beginning of year, end of year. But then that will begin to change over time as the change incorp planes get flushed out of the system pretty soon thereafter.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So do you feel -- I mean, it sounds like the completions are a little more difficult, but do you feel equally or maybe more confident about your ability to kind of reach your increase in final assembly rates without having to incur an additional pause?","W. James McNerney","I think the way I'd say it is that the engineering change flow has slowed down to a trickle. Pretty much done. And as every day passes and we get closer to the goal and we pass other milestones yes, my confidence does increase because we are executing to plan. And the statement of work is better known without all the change flowing in. And so I think as each week passes, each month passes, my confidence does grow. It's something, though, that is -- these ramp-ups are always difficult and it has our attention.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Tom Downey","Thank you. We will continue now with the time remaining to take a couple of questions for Jim and Greg. If you have any questions after the session ends, please call our Media Relations team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we're ready for the first question. And in the interest of the limited time we have, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question, please.","Operator","And we'll go to Brendan Kearney with Post and Courier.","Brendan Kearney","Jim, in November, Jim Albaugh said he was very pleased with how the North Charleston operation was coming along, saying that some of the units had already demonstrated they could produce at a rate of 10 a month. I subsequently learned that he was talking more about the machines than the human element here. And then also between now and then, the NLRB cloud has cleared. And so with those things in mind, how do you feel about each of the 3 major units in North Charleston, aft midbody and final assembly and how they're doing now?","W. James McNerney","Yes, I feel good about them. They're all on plan or, in some cases, slightly ahead of plan. I think Jim -- I didn't read Jim's quote, but he may have been referring to the aft and midbody, which go to both Charleston final and Everett final and that ramp is on schedule. Final assembly. Actually, we're slightly ahead of our plan in final assembly, so I feel good about the execution I'm seeing down there.","Brendan Kearney","Okay. And you said -- I've heard second quarter here for the first delivery, but I heard midyear and second half during this call. Is it...","W. James McNerney","Yes, second quarter. Yes. I think one of us misspoke a little. Second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Susanna Ray with Bloomberg News.","Susanna Ray","I am wondering, with this huge production increase, is this in the works and planned? I'm wondering about your employment forecast, both for this year and for the next 2 years, I guess, through the 2014 guidance?","W. James McNerney","Well, a lot of the employment ramp happened in 2011. Our company added 11,000 employees, high-tech jobs in the United States, which are the bedrock of our company and very fashionable these days. But those employees were added both for the 787, 747-8 ramp in anticipation of the ramp of some of our other programs. And we're going to be adding some more, somewhat offset by some reductions in BDS. The defense side is tough right now, as you know. And I think all defense players, including that part of our company which is Defense, are tightening employment. So that will net out to a slight add this year. But most of the adds were last year.","Susanna Ray","Okay. Do you have any forecast then as far as how many more you might, like, total, including the BDS reduction you might add?","W. James McNerney","Yes. I think it's not going to be a big -- we'll get back to you. I don't have that specific number in front of me, Susanna. Tom will get back to you.","Susanna Ray","And the 11,000, that was global, right? Not just the U.S.?","W. James McNerney","Well, that was -- 99% of that's U.S.","Operator","Our next question is from Joshua Freed with Associated Press.","Joshua Freed","The status of the American Airline's MAX order, you talked about conversions earlier. When do you think that one might convert? And does it seem likely at this point that, that would happen post-Chapter 11 for them?","W. James McNerney","Just an overall comment would be -- I mean, Chapter 11 probably strengthens the likelihood of that getting booked, quite frankly, as the company goes through. And I think it's hard to predict because they're just at the beginning of the process. Whether that would be finalized, in bankruptcy or just after, it's hard to -- all I know is that American will emerge from that process more able to execute those orders than they would have had they not gone through it.","Joshua Freed","Okay. But I mean are you making your plans in one direction or the other in terms of the timing of that?","W. James McNerney","Well, our plan is to deliver them when we committed to deliver them which is, I believe, starting in '17. And so our anticipation is that their financing will all be sorted out well before that.","Operator","Our next question is from Dominic Gates with the Seattle Times.","Dominic Gates","I'm just going to ask for a little clarification on the 787 delivery rate this year. So you're guiding for 35 to 42 787s approximately in the year, and you said in the call that about half of those will be change incorp planes. And it's not quite computing for me because you're at 2.5 a month now flowing out of the factory...","W. James McNerney","No, you are right, Dominic. You're right. You're right. We said more than half. It's a lot more than half, okay? Greg, do you...","Dominic Gates","A lot more than half are change incorp?","Greg Smith","Yes. More like 2\/3 of them are coming out of change incorp.","Dominic Gates","I'm still not quite understanding because if you're 2.5 now flowing out of the factory, 2.5 a month, you're moving to 3.5 next quarter I think you said? And to 5 -- I think you said 5 a month before year end? So let's say you're averaging 3 a month at the low-end, that will be 36 planes flowing out of the factory with, you're saying, not too much work to be done on them. So shouldn't you have more of those planes rather than more of the change incorp planes?","Greg Smith","Well, some of those -- as I talked about, some of those will still require change incorp, just not as much. So as they're coming out of the factory, some of those will get -- go into change incorp and then get delivered through 2012. They just don't require as much as they do on those earlier units that we're referring to.","Dominic Gates","Right. So they might still require months of work actually?","Greg Smith","I'm sorry?","Dominic Gates","They might still require some months of change incorp work [indiscernible] coming out?","Greg Smith","Yes, yes. Some level of change, right.","Operator","And we'll go to Molly McMillin with the Wichita Eagle.","Molly McMillin","My question is I know when the announcement was made that the Wichita plant is closing that the folks are saying that an official study started last summer. But I'm wondering, when did you all start kicking around the idea of closing the plant and wanting to pursue that line of information?","W. James McNerney","Well, I think the -- it was that timing when it began to fall under serious considerations. I mean, we are always reviewing our plans, but I would say it really didn't crystallize. And of course the reason it did, I think the planning started to accelerate then, is a very difficult defense market, which it became clear middle of last year that there was going to be serious surgery done on defense programs, and we had to take an aggressive inventory of our sites and figure out where the most efficient places to produce our wares and our services in a dramatically constrained environment that we saw coming. And that's what really precipitated the second half of the year study in Kansas.","Molly McMillin","Okay. And then on the Air Force side, was it written in the contract for the tanker that Wichita would be doing the finishing work? Or was it more of a contingency plan in there? Or do you know...","W. James McNerney","No, I don't think it was written in the contract. We can tell you exactly what was written in the contract, but I'm pretty confident there was nothing like that in the contract.","Molly McMillin","Okay. So when you talk to the Air Force, they're fine with the change? Or how are they accepting it I guess?","W. James McNerney","Well, the Air Force has pressed us for a very good deal, and they're leaving it to us to make the decision on where and how to produce it. That's the nature of this particular contract.","Tom Downey","Operator, we have time for one last question from the media.","Operator","And that will be from Mike Mecham from Aviation Week.","Michael Mecham","Can you talk a little bit about where you stand on your plans for MAX production? Your labor deal puts it in Renton for sure. So where's the planning stand on all of that?","W. James McNerney","Where's the what? The planning?","Michael Mecham","The planning for how you'll phase-in doing both aircraft and the production elements.","W. James McNerney","Yes. I think there's 2 elements to the answer. One is we're on track with the development plan that we're working on now. And as you know, there's minor modifications needed to the overall airplane. The engine is the big story, and that's going well. The other element is to sustain productions of NGs up until the point we start blending in the MAXs in the first part of 2017 and I think when we start delivering them and as I mentioned earlier, we're making good progress on accomplishing that objective. Virtually every MAX order we're getting now or every MAX commitment has associated with it a NG order or commitment which will help bridge us right to the point of the MAXs, and that is also very important. So I think the planning is going well on a development side and on a production side, and I feel good about it.","Michael Mecham","Will the plant require a lot of tooling requirements or modifications actually to the factory itself?","W. James McNerney","I think the -- most of the work that'll be required there will relate to the increased volumes that we've got that will hit that plant a couple of years before the MAX. But there will be some modification required for the MAX, but it'll be done within the footprint that's established for the 42 a month that we've -- that we will be into 2014, 2015.","Michael Mecham","So it's ordering more of what you've got kind of a situation as far as tooling, because the aircraft is essentially the same...","W. James McNerney","The aircraft, yes. I mean -- but there will be some differences. I mean, the engine, the engine buildup and the cell and that part of it. There's a modification to a few things. But we can largely leverage the current footprint we've got, both in terms of tooling and in terms of facilities after we get up to the 42 a month in 2014.","Tom Downey","That concludes our earnings call.

Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analysts' and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice-President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.","Troy Jeffrey Lahr - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's third quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm Troy Lahr and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer. After management comments, we'll take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussions today are likely to involve risk which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Thank you, Troy, and good morning. My comments today will focus on our third quarter results and our business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through the details and provide you a glimpse into 2017. With that, let's move to slide two.","Our third quarter financial results reflect continued solid performance at both businesses and strong operating cash flow. We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash and repurchased $1 billion of Boeing stock during the quarter as we continued to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders while investing in innovation and our future growth. Through the first three quarters we repurchased 51 million shares totaling $6.5 billion.","Revenue in the third quarter was $23.9 billion reflecting slightly lower planned delivery volume as well as continued growth in both Commercial and Defense services. We reported core earnings per share of $3.51 on continued overall solid operating performance and favorable tax adjustments. Boeing Commercial Airplanes' third quarter revenue was $17 billion, on 188 deliveries, with a segment operating margin of 9.4%.","Key milestones in the quarter included completing testing to ensure the 737 MAX 8 is ready to enter service and starting 737 MAX 9 production. Furthermore, in October we began 787-10 mid-body integration and we rolled out of the factory our 500th 787 dream liner. At Boeing Defense Space & Security, third quarter revenue was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 10.4% reflecting solid performance on production and services programs offset by the Commercial Crew charge. Key contract awards for the defense side of the business included a $2.8 billion order for 19 KC-46 Tankers for the U.S. Air Force, an agreement with the UK Ministry of Defense to purchase 50 Apache attack helicopters and 9 P-8 Poseidon aircraft and a $1 billion award from the Defense Logistics Agency for F-18 spare parts. In summary, for the quarter, we delivered solid operating results in both businesses, drove further productivity across the enterprise, captured significant contract awards, and continued to return cash to shareholders.","With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide three. Our view of the business environment remains generally positive with solid overall demand for commercial airplanes, defense and space platforms, and services and support. In the commercial market, new order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace. In particular, we're seeing strong demand for narrow body aircraft such as the 737 MAX. In the wide body segment we continue to see some near-term hesitation in certain regions and the order activity has been more measured. Over the long-term, however, our view remains highly positive with our 20-year commercial market outlook projecting demand for more than 39,600 aircraft valued at $6 trillion.","Specifically for the wide body market, we see demand over the next 20 years for more than 9,000 aircraft and see replacement demand starting to accelerate again early next decade and we're well positioned with the 777X and 787 families.","We also recently updated our outlook for the commercial market in China where we now see a $1 trillion market opportunity for more than 6,800 aircraft over the next 20 years. The continued strength of our overall market outlook is based on solid ongoing replacement demand and traffic growth. This year, passenger traffic growth is again outpacing GDP with AIADA reporting approximately 6% increase year to date. On the cargo side, the market is improved slightly, but year to date growth is modest at 1%. As always, we are keeping a consistent watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand remain balanced.","Despite the relatively softening we've described for the wide body market, the strength and value of our offerings is illustrated by recent order activity for a total of 52 wide body planes. In October, Cutter Airways ordered 30 787-9s and 10 777-300ERs, and China Southern ordered 12 787-9s. In addition, we are pleased that the U.S. Treasury recently granted Boeing a license to sell 80 new airplanes to Iran Air including a mix of 34 wide body planes. There's more work to do to finalize the sale, but we are encouraged by the progress.","As we have noted on a number of occasions, the timing and outcome of several ongoing wide body sales campaigns will be the determining factors in final decisions on the 777 bridge production rate. We expect to have additional clarity on 777 production decisions in the next couple of months. On the 787 program, we have more time to further assess the implementation of the next production rate increase that is currency scheduled to ramp up to 14 per month at the end of the decade.","Also, as a reminder, even if we have to moderate our wide body production plans in the future, we continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to grow beyond 900 airplanes per year through the end of this decade, supporting our expectation that we will continue to grow cash flow year-over-year throughout this time period. Our production plan is built upon our large and diverse order backlog and underpinned by our fundamental belief in the long-term growth and replacement trends that have fueled increasing commercial airplane demand for the past several decades.","Turning to individual airplane programs, customer demand remains strong for the 737 with a robust backlog of more than 4300 firm orders for the NG and MAX models combined. We remain on track to raise the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 47 in the third quarter of 2017 followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be oversold. Simply put, this is a big, attractive market, and the 737 family's position within it is solid.","For the current generation 777, our backlog now stands at more than 160 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 17 net new 777 orders. We're on track to transition to the seven per month production rate at the start of 2017 as previously announced. At that rate, and with the Qatar order I mentioned earlier, delivery slots for 777 are now about 85% sold out for 2017. For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of 777X test aircraft, we are roughly 60% sold out at the planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month.","To bounce some scenarios for you on the 777, when we consider the recent order additions and our ongoing campaigns to fill the remaining delivery slots, at this time we don't envision a situation where we would need to lower production more than one or two units per month below our current plan. If that were to occur, implementation would begin in late 2017 or early 2018. On the other end of the spectrum, should we see success on ongoing campaigns, we may not need to adjust our existing production plans at all. We have disciplined processes in place for making these decisions in a timely manner as campaigns are finalized and of course any steps we might take to further align production with demand will include the necessary adjustments to maximize profitability and ensure a smooth transition to the 777X.","For the 777X we have a strong foundation of 306 orders that supports our production plan of ramping up deliveries in 2020 and beyond. On the 787 program, our backlog consists of approximately 700 firm orders which provide a solid foundation for future production. As I alluded to before, securing additional orders to solidify the 14 per month production rate at the end of the decade remains a priority. And the recent orders for 42 aircraft from Qatar Airways and China Southern improves our position. But, there's still more work to do.","On the 747 program, we are encouraged by the modest recovery in the air cargo market, and we continue to have a number of sales campaigns underway that will help to fill the production skyline. Regarding Commercial services, the market is an attractive opportunity that we are aggressively targeting by growing our services in support areas, including our traditional parts, mods, and upgrade business, as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services.","During the quarter, we entered into an agreement with Japan Airlines for a 10-year contract to provide spare parts under The Boeing GoldCare program. In addition, over the past few months, we won orders from Atlas Air to convert nine 767 passenger airplanes into Boeing converted freighters. Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive due to our market-leading product lineup, large high-quality customer backlog, and a culture that continuously drives productivity across all aspects of the enterprise.","Turning to Defense Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. While the fiscal year 2017 U.S. Federal budget is not yet finalized, congressional support for our key BDS programs is firm and we continue to anticipate modest defense spending growth over the next five years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites, and services.","We are encouraged by the recent White House approval and the congressional notification authorizing the sale of 36 F-15s to Qatar, with options for 36 more, and the sale of 28 F-18s to Kuwait, with options for an additional 12. During the third quarter, international customers represented 27% of BDS revenue and 38% of the current backlog. Our team is continuing to reshape our defense business with a focus on dramatically improving our cost structure. This is further enhancing our competitive position and expanding profitability. The team has captured nearly $6 billion of operating cost savings, and we continue to target an additional $2 billion.","In addition to improving cost competitiveness and affordability, we're also focused on investing in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration, and autonomous systems. Capturing future franchise programs remains a priority for us, and we're leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, JSTARS recapitalization, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, advanced weapons programs, and other important opportunities ,including the unmanned aircraft-carrier based MQ-25A, where we've recently won a U.S. Navy contract for risk reduction activities.","In summary, our overall business outlook is aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and we are optimistic and motivated by our future prospects. Our dedicated and talented teams across the enterprise are focused on delivering on our customer commitments while accelerating improvements in quality, safety, and productivity, and driving further innovation in our products and processes. We continue to generate results and identify additional opportunities through implementation of lean plus, capturing the value of quality, partnering for success, and our second century design and manufacturing initiatives.","Now, over to Greg for our financial results.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Let's turn to slide four and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $23.9 billion, driven by solid Commercial Airplane deliveries and healthy Defense revenue. Core earnings per share was $3.51, as solid operating performance and favorable tax adjustments totaled $0.98 more than offset the $0.16 impact on the Commercial Crew program. The $0.28 tax adjustment for the 2011-2012 settlement was expected and already factored into our full-year core EPS guidance; however, the $0.70 related to the tax basis adjustment booked in this quarter was not reflected in our annual guidance. Just to be mindful for next year, we expect to have a more normalized corporate tax rate of approximately 31% to 32%.","Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on slide five. For the third quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $17 billion on 188 airplane deliveries. BCA reported operating margins of 9.4%, driven by solid operating performance and delivery mix. Commercial Airplanes captured $9 billion in net orders during the third quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $409 billion and more than 5600 aircraft, equating to approximately seven years of production. On the 787 program, the deferred production balance declined by $151 million in the quarter. This decrease was driven by delivery mix, internal productivity efforts, and supplier stepdown pricing. Over the long-term, we continue to focus on improving 787 cash generation and again driven by favorable mix, further internal productivity improvements, and again additional supplier stepdown pricing.","Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide six. Third quarter revenue at our Defense business was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 10.4%, largely driven by strong performance at BMA and GS&S that was offset by results in network and space. Boeing military aircraft revenue was $3.3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and F-15 volume. Operating margins of 13.3% reflect solid execution across the portfolio. Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion. Operating earnings were $35 million, reflecting the impact from the Commercial Crew program.","As a result of delays in completion of engineering and supply chain activities of the program, we recorded $124 million reversal of cumulative pre-tax earnings, and a $38 million pre-tax reach-forward loss. At our Global Services & Support business, revenue increased 17% to $2.5 billion, reflecting higher volume in aircraft modernization and sustainment. Operating margins were 12.4%, reflecting strong performance in program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog at $53 billion, with 38% of that business coming from customers outside the United States.","Next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the third quarter was driven by solid operating performance across the enterprise. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis indicated earlier, we paid nearly $700 million in dividend and repurchased 7.6 million shares for $1 billion in the third quarter. Year to date, we've repurchased 51 million shares for a total of $6.5 billion. Again, returning cash to shareholders, along with continue to invest and support future growth remain a priority for us, and reflect our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.","Let's move to cash and debt balance now on slide eight. We ended the quarter with $9.7 billion of cash and marketable securities and again, our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.","Let's turn now to slide nine and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance by $500 million to now be between $93.5 billion and $95.5 billion on higher 747 and 787 Commercial Airplane deliveries. And guidance is increased five airplanes to now be between 745 and 750 deliveries for the year. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is increased by $0.70 to now be between $6.80 and $7 a share reflecting the third quarter tax basis adjustment. While we haven't yet finalized our plans for 2017, we'd like to take a moment and provide you with some initial insight.","As Dennis previously mentioned back in September, we expect 2017 to be a year, another year of solid financial performance. So first and foremost, our view on cash flow growth is unchanged. We continue to forecast cash flow growth in 2017 and then 2018 and beyond. At our current production rates we expect higher BCA deliveries next year while revenue should be flat to slightly down largely driven by delivery mix as we increase 737 production, implement the transition from the 777 to the 777X and begin 787-10 production.","BDS revenue next year should be also flat to slightly down on fewer C-17 deliveries and lower F-15 volume due to milestone revenue that more than offset the higher services and tanker revenue. Regarding operating margins, we continue to target near-term double-digit margins for both BCA and BDS. Obviously any production rate adjustments could modestly impact near-term margin at BCA. Having said that, and as we have discussed before, we have numerous productivity activities in work that we'll continue to work and look for opportunities to accelerate these best we can.","Again, we continue to work several sales campaigns which will ultimately be the deciding factor of any potential rate adjustments. Longer term, we're aggressively driving productivity throughout the business to maximize profitability as we strive to achieve mid-teen operating margins at both BCA and BDS. These are aspirational goals and we certainly have a lot of work to do and hard decisions in front of us. However, we believe this is the right objective and goal for us and our teams.","Regarding our outlook for cash flow growth next year, as expected, wide body product rate decisions can modestly affect that rate of growth. However, we still continue to see operating cash flow growing in 2017 and then again 2018 and beyond. Our confidence in this outlook is based on us delivering on our robust backlog, executing on our established development programs, driving additional productivity efforts, and finally improving the cash profile on the 787 program.","We have a strong foundation to grow cash flows over the remainder of the decade, and we are taking the necessary actions to de-risk the business while also more efficiently executing all elements of the business. Again, we still have some work to do to finalize our outlook for 2017, and as always, we'll provide more detail on the full year 2017 guidance on our call, on our January earnings call.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","All right. Thanks, Greg. To wrap up quickly here and move into your questions, working together as one Boeing, we are intensely focused on profitable, long-term growth, disciplined execution of our production and development programs, expanding our services business, and improving quality and productivity across the enterprise. Our priorities are to continue building strength on strength to deliver on our existing plans and to stretch beyond those plans by sharpening and accelerating our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. We're giving clear and consistent attention to the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, continuing to strengthen our Defense & Space business, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry; all of which is to position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and to create increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.","With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question's from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning everyone.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Jason.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Dennis, I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about the outlook for the wide body market as we move out into the 2020s. You've talked on a couple of different calls here over time about the replacement cycle that you view gets started out in that period. Can you talk a little bit about whether you think, at this point, that puts upward bias on wide body production or simply allows you to hold onto the production rates that you'll be enjoying as you exit the decade? And then perhaps put a little bit of color on that replacement cycle with regard to mix and what products you think are going to best address that replacement","cycle in the early 2020s. Thanks.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah. Hey, great question, Jason. So if you take a look at that 20-year current market outlook, as I said, we see about 9,000 of those 39,000 plus aircraft being wide bodies. And much of that is fueled by that replacement cycle just looking at the existing fleets that starts early in the next decade, early 2020s. In particular, if we look at the 777 fleet and we look for opportunities there, we'll have a number of aircraft that'll be reaching ten-year life span at that point in our replacement cycles. That timing is very well aligned with when we'll be ramping up and beginning to deliver the 777X. And that's been one of the things that's been fueling our focus on delivering that development program.","In addition to that, the 787 is going to be very well positioned for that market. We're continuing to see market dynamics that are expanding route structures, leveraging the technology of that airplane. If you look at the 787 since we've introduced it, our customers have now introduced more than 130 new city pairs based on the unique capability that the 787 brings to the marketplace. So we see strong opportunity for replacement of existing fleets; we see growth opportunities as passenger traffic continues to grow at a clip of about 6% a year, and we see growth associated with new city pairs, new routes, that are being enabled by the technology. All three of those fuel our prospects for the future, and we see a solid mix of both the 787 family and the 777 family feeding right into that cycle.","That all said, we've got a couple of years near-term in front of us here where we're working through the transition to the 777, and we're being mindful of some of the local wide body market hesitation that we're all seeing right now. We're confident that we're going to be able to work our way through that in a profitable and effective manner, transition to the 777X, and then move into that replacement cycle, strong demand signals as we get into the next decade.","And through all of this, we're going to be very mindful about matching supply and demand. It's in all of our interest to make sure those stay balanced and that we take the right actions to ensure that we do things profitably and efficiently through the transition. So that's some color around it. But, again, if we look at the 20-year cycle here, wide body marketplace is a strong marketplace and it's both replacement and growth driven.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Interestingly you didn't mention the 747 there, so maybe a little bit more of a follow-up there. And then just, do we see upward bias in the 2020s or are we just trying to hold onto the rates that we're going to be exiting this decade?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, if you take a look at the 747, the recent decision we made to go to half an aircraft a month production rate we think is a sustainable position. That very large aircraft segment we see as more of a niche, flatter segment. The 747 is well positioned there. It provides some very unique capabilities for that customer set. We don't see that as a large growth market for us, but a niche market that's sustainable. And we have the right product and we've made the right investment there for the long run. And customers that are operating in that space are giving us positive feedback on the 747-8.","We see more of the growth happening in 787 and 777, and of course we'll be ramping up 777X production nominally to the kind of production rates that we have on today's 777 line. 787 is where we're looking at that additional production step-up to 14 a month, and we'll be assessing that here over the next six months. So that longer-term profile will look flat to modest growth in production volume on our wide body lines overall.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question's from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. Greg, I wonder if you could...","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. I wonder if you could tell us as a swing factor for cash flow, if you could talk a little bit about the tanker program since we have had some of the charges. Can you tell us what the cash burn was on the tanker program last year? You know, maybe roughly what it is this year and then what the improvement would be in 2017 if you deliver the tankers that you're supposed to in the second half of the year?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, I mean, you're right. So obviously we've been making investments in the tanker program in the last couple years. So as we start to deliver those, the cash profile will improve over time. Obviously next year, that's factored into \u2013 as we talk about our cash flow growing over time, that's factored into that. I think just kind of some of the bigger moving pieces in 2017 obviously, the 787 cash profile continuing to improve and the production rates we talked about. At the same time, as you mentioned, tanker slightly. But cash taxes will pay more of those as we improve the unit by unit improvement on the 787. And then as we talked about, we're building the 787-10 flight test airplanes. So those \u2013 and of course 777 rate going down to the planned seven a month. So those are really the bigger moving pieces as we look into 2017, but certainly, tanker is part of that but not as significant as some of these items. So we're continuing to execute there. And we'll expect positive cash flow next year.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Next we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","You know, you mentioned again the goal of mid-teens margins in 2020 for BCA and Defense as well, but if we look at the BCA, you're describing this as aspirational, but I'm not sure what it means. Do you believe this is a realistic target, and can you give us a sense of what internal milestones would look like that would make you confident and make us confident that you can actually get there to mid-teens margins?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, hey Doug, let me start on that one and I'll ask Greg to add in. Yes, it's a realistic target, but a challenging target. But it's not something that we just stated without an intent to pursue. We're very serious about pursuing that, and we see a path to getting there. It requires a lot of hard work. Key items there will include increasing profitability on the 787 program. So if you're looking for milestones and checkpoints there, you'll see as we burn down deferred production inventory, hopefully you saw a good sign there this quarter. As we continue to drive profitability on that line, you will see improved profitability, incremental pickups on margins in BCA. Also additional work on partnering for success as we work across our supply chain. You'll see incremental improvements as we both capture agreements that are already in place or additional cost reductions in our supply chain.","And we are relentless on our broader lean plus activities in capturing the value of quality activities that get into all of our production lines and incrementally, those will add to profitability over time. Also making sure we execute on our development programs and cleanly finishing up on 737 MAX, which as you know we're expecting to deliver ahead of schedule. We're executing well on 777X, but we're very focused on ensuring we get to the finish line cleanly on those developing programs. So at a very detailed level, we've worked that into our business plans and commitments. Our team is onboard and driving execution. We're very focused on getting to double-digit margins here in the near term and achieving those mid-teen margins towards the end of the decade. So it's a very real target, very serious target, but we also acknowledge the fact that it's going to require a lot of hard work. Greg, you want to add anything?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, I think just the only thing I would add is the continued focus on de-risking the portfolio. So, combined with all the initiatives that we have in place across all aspects of the business and cost elements, at the same time a keen eye on, how do we de-risk anything, as you've seen from moderating the 747 rate, development program execution, the 737 MAX introduction, I think, is a good example of de-risking to ensure that we have long-term profitability over the portfolio.","Same thing with the moves we're making on 777 transition to 777X. So trying to be mindful of moderating and de-risking where, certainly that's been a challenge of the past, and that is also a contributor to this longer-term objective. But, as Dennis said, we think it's the right objective to have in place. We don't have all the answers today, but we have some solid plans in place around the attributes or elements that Dennis indicated. Some of those we're going to be successful on, some of them we may not. And we'll, I'll say, retool and look for further opportunities. But we think it's the right objective for us to focus on.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, and Doug, one additional thing from the broader enterprise, you see some of the results in our Defense business as well coming from our market-based affordability work, and we have our teams sharing those best practices across the enterprise to leverage that. And I think it's also worth noting, as we continue to invest in growing our services business, generally services will be accretive to our margins, and we're very serious about growing top line in service, as you see some of the results there as well. And over time, that will improve our overall enterprise margins.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So should we expect \u2013 I mean, you've talked a little bit about getting to double digit margins next year as a possibility, and then, should we expect this to be a trajectory that moves steadily toward that level over the next four years?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yes. This is a steady climbing trajectory, not one where we're going to be flat for four years and then a sudden step-up. This is a continuous, steady effort.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","And you should expect to see that in the results.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Thanks.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Thanks, Pete.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, Greg, I guess, wanted to ask you what the remaining challenges you see here in the fourth quarter that are in front of you in order to hit that $10 billion in cash from ops guidance? It doesn't look like you have a huge hurdle for the quarter to hit that. You kind of had a blowout quarter last fourth quarter, of 2015. So just curious as to, do we have a chance here maybe to beat guidance? It's going to look like a pretty good free cash per share year if you just hit it. So, I'm just curious as to what the challenges are.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, well, look, as you know, Pete, there's a lot of moving pieces quarter over quarter in this business, whether it's milestone payments or progress payments. So, we're comfortable with what we have in there for the guidance for the balance of the year. Certainly, we did a little better in this quarter than we originally had planned, and that's just again, solid execution and some favorable timing. So again, we're comfortable with what we got in there for the fourth quarter as we look at the delivery profiles and again, some of the progress payments that are planned between now and then. So stay tuned, and we're \u2013 again, it's obviously a big priority for us, key focus item. I think the results are demonstrating that and the focus going forward, you should expect that same discipline.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Right. And then, last follow-up. Can you give us a sense how much you think 787 deferred can come down in 2017?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Well, we expect it to continue to decline, and it's all around the elements that we laid out at the investor conference and a little bit this morning. It's just that day-to-day continued execution on the core \u2013 I'll say core production line, and the stepdown around the supply chain, and making our delivery. So we expect that to continue to go down. Like I said, it's all about cash flow focus on that program, unit by unit improvement, and I would tell you the team out there in Charleston and Everett have done a fantastic job. And they've got a lot of things still, I'll say in the hopper, to go try to mature and get into the production line. But great, great progress. Long way to go still to meet our expectations overall, but good, good progress, and so we should expect that the progress on deferred and overall cash improvement to continue.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Next we go to Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a quick clarification housekeeping for you, Greg, and a question for Dennis. The universe's program difference is about $150 million. Was there anything other than the 87 [787] there? And then usually you mention, Greg, if there's any program margin changes within BCA. I didn't know if you had any of those. And then \u2013 go ahead, sorry.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","No, I was just going to say, program margin, modest program margin change. Nothing really material there, Carter, in the program (38:40].","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","On which program?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Program versus unit was primarily 787, where we had some early build deliveries. I think we had two early build deliveries in the third quarter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then a question for Dennis. It's about that time of year, and I know you don't want to get ahead of the board here, but where you evaluate on capital deployment and make a decision on the dividend. You've clearly bought back a lot of stock over the course of the last couple of quarters, last couple of years. But as you \u2013 what's your thought process around repurchases versus dividends at this point, as you come into that kind of year-end decision? Is there a chance you have a greater emphasis on the dividend as we look forward, or should we expect more of the same? Thanks.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey, Carter, you bet. First of all, it's important again to reiterate the principle that Greg mentioned, and that is, we're very focused on making sure we're returning to cash to shareholders and investing for the future. And that investment for the future, organic investment, continues to be important to us. Along with that, returning roughly 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders. And a balanced approach between share repurchase and dividends continues to be important to us. And as you said, you can see our track record on share repurchase and over the last three years, we've also increased dividends by a composite of 125%.","Now, as we're looking at the balance between both of those as we get into our year-end cycle, I can tell you our intent is to remain balanced in our approach. We understand that there's significant value associated with dividend, and we're going to be taking a hard look at that as part of our normal process. But you can rest assured that we're very committed to returning cash to our shareholders, and we consider dividends to be a very important part of that.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet.","Operator","And next we go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I just wanted to clarify and then ask a separate question. But on the margin, on the double digits by next year, looking at what's implied in the fourth quarter by the guidance, there's a fairly big range there, and I guess it's some of the same things that drive you to double digit next year. So what are the levers between a 4.5% and a 5% for the year, which implies something bigger than that for the quarter? And then separately, Dennis, we've seen some supplier consolidation, and maybe it's partially motivated by some of your efforts in the supply chain, and I wanted to ask how you feel about that, those changes.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","I'll let Greg field the first one.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Sure, yeah. I mean, some of the things in the fourth quarter, Rob, are \u2013 we've got some higher planned period expense. We've got mix I'll say coming into play in the fourth quarter. And then finally, as Dennis indicated, we're watching the wide body market in particularly around 777. So those are really the fundamentals that are taken into consideration for the full year guide and ultimately for fourth quarter.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","And then, hey Rob, to your second question, obviously our supply chain partners are a very important part of our overall enterprise, and so we keep a very close eye on supply chain consolidation in our networks, the health of our supply chain. That is a very important part of our overall partnering for success effort. Obviously in the news this week with Rockwell's acquisition of B\/E, we're taking a close look at that. We don't have any specific comments on that one, but keeping a close eye on it to ensure that we retain a healthy and competitive supply chain.","Some of the consolidation pressures that you're seeing, I think it's signs that our supply chain is working with us to try to be competitive and optimize their operations and continuing to invest for the future. So I see this as a healthy dynamic. There's a lot of interest in the aerospace sector. We continue to think aerospace as an industrial sector will outpace others, much of that driven by the commercial airplane marketplace and growing passenger traffic which is outstripping GDP. So we're not surprised that there's a lot of interest in the aerospace sector. We think that's healthy, and we're going to make sure that we continue to have a robust supply chain for the future and our Partnering for Success effort is designed to do that, to find win-win solutions for Boeing and our supply chain partners.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Dennis, is there a natural tension between having fewer larger suppliers in order to manage that more easily versus having stronger suppliers and maybe unbalancing the competitive leverage between the two, between you and the supply base?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","I think there's always pressures in all of the dimensions of the supply chain. But the number of suppliers is not an area of concern for us right now. We have the ability to span that Commercial and Defense enterprise to suppliers. Our teams are well integrated. So it's not something where we're trying to drive the numbers up or down. This is more about how do we work together, how do we most efficiently work as an integrated enterprise, and sharing best practices. And we're interested in having a healthy supply chain. It makes us healthier as a company. It allows us to do a better job of delivering for our customers. So I think you'll always see some of the natural dynamics in the supply chain networks as businesses evolve, but we're happy with the infrastructure that we have today, and we're very focused on working with our supply chain to achieve our long-term growth objectives.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you for that color.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question's from David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","No problem.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Wanted to follow up on the comment on the 777 sensitivity. So just to clarify, Dennis, you're talking about potentially delivery rates going down to 3.5 a month once you get out to the period where you're transitioning to 777X? I wanted to make sure that that's what you were potentially implying. And even if that does happen that you think cash flow can continue to grow during that period.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet. Yeah, David, let me just paint that even more clearly because I think it's a very important question. So our current plan, as you know, is we're stepping down to seven a month production rate start of 2017, carrying that through the transition, and during 2018 when we're building 777X flight test aircraft, the effective delivery rate of airplanes is 5.5 per month, as you noted. That's our current baseline plan. At that plan, we are currently 85% sold out in 2017 and roughly 60% sold out in 2018. And we've painted a number of scenarios around that baseline for the future. And just to give you a feel for it, one of the scenarios would be to take that baseline plan and drop it by two aircraft a month in 2018 as you noted; and if we were to do that with no additional sales, we're already more than 90% sold out against that profile, that skyline in 2018. So I see that as a bounding case.","Now, we have a number of important campaigns still underway. We are encouraged by the positive result at a recent Qatar Airways decision. Great customer there and that order for ten 777s was one of those significant campaigns that we've been working on. We have others that we are still working on. So as we finalize those over the next couple of months, we'll be able to finalize our decisions for the 2018 production rate. But hopefully that gives you a sense of the bounding cases here, and across all of those scenarios that I just described, all of them, we see cash growing year-over-year in 2017 and then again in 2018. And I think that's an important thing to remember. This is a very robust cash growth business across all of those scenarios.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, can you talk about what kind of impact that might have on the BCA margin profile if you were to drop to 3.5 a month?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah. If we need to reduce the production rate, it would have a negative impact on margins in the BCA business. But remember, we would also if that were a decision that we made, we'd take some offsetting actions. And it's important for us that we make sure that that line continues to be profitable, and we're confident that it will be. And that we also transition efficiently into the 777X. So while a reduced production rate would have a negative impact on margins, that would be somewhat offset by other actions we would take to drive profitability and transition.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet.","Operator","Next we'll go to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much. I wanted to address the matter of risk. I mean, Dennis on one hand, Boeing takes pride in doing hard things. On the other hand, sometimes your optimism proves to be greater than reality. On Commercial Crew as an example, KC46, as another, I mean, both of those in effect this year hurt what could have been really spectacular numbers. So how do you think about managing that risk? And then I have a follow-up. I'll just stop there for a moment.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet. Yeah, Howard, great question. And I appreciate the straightforward points you've made there. And the fixed price development programs have been challenging, and we've been transparent about some of the issues we've had on tanker and Commercial Crew, and confident in the recovery actions we've taken on those. But more broadly, we've learned those lessons about how to do development programs and do them in a way that still delivers breakthrough capability for our customers but deliver them in more incremental risk-managed steps.","And I think a great example of that, you now see some of that process improvement bearing fruit in our commercial developments; 737 MAX for example being delivered on time, actually a little ahead of schedule and on cost; 787-10, again, our ability to now incrementally, in a risk-managed way, bring breakthrough capability to our customers. That's part of our broader deployment of our development program excellence initiative.","Part of our focus on that, and hopefully you see our actions there recently elevating positions on my direct report EXCO (49:59), Scott Fancher with responsibility for development program excellence writ large so that we even more so deliver on some of those initiatives across the enterprise. So I think what you see here is that we're very focused on being world class at development programs. We've learned some tough lessons. We've addressed those. We've made some process improvements. You're seeing those beginning to pay off on programs like 737 MAX. And you can count on the fact that that's going to be our focus going forward. We must be able to deliver breakthrough innovation for our customers but deliver it in a step-wise risk-managed way. And that's how we're going to do business going forward.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","No, I appreciate that. And to follow up, if I back out the R&D and look at core profitability at Commercial, while you've done a lot of good things, it does look like margins have deteriorated a little bit sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. And so, again, the walk from where you are today where margins are a shade under pressure and where you want to go seems like a bit of a challenge. I mean, what else can we see? You talk about the development programs making a difference, and we've talked about that. But where else can we see it so that it translates into your goals?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet. And a bit of this goes back to the comments on Doug's question earlier. But when we look at development programs, a steady consistent performance on those programs translating into a consistent R&D profile over time is important to us. So you'll see that reflected. Whereas in the past we might have had peaks and valleys, we have a much more consistent, steady R&D profile going forward, thinking about the portfolio of development programs and clean execution.","But profitability more broadly is driven by the other actions we've talked about, specifically 787. And now that we've turned the corner as you saw in deferred production inventory as an example, we are driving productivity increases on that line and just spending some time with Ray and the team down there really making some very solid progress on driving profitability into 787. Over time, again that will incrementally increase overall company profitability. The work on partnering for success, the broader application of lean initiatives throughout our enterprise, the list of things I mentioned earlier in response to Doug's question, those are all factors that longer term will drive overall enterprise profitability and create our investment capacity for the future.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You bet. Thanks, Howard.","Operator","And next we'll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Morning.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Dennis, you started talking about things on the horizon and planning things through the decade. And I'm curious on your narrow body lineup as it sits between the 737 and the 787, what do you think about as timing for filling that gap? I mean, Boeing's been open about obviously looking at that space, but in the next couple of years is that a realistic assumption of where your decision would be definitively made, and what would be the triggers to make it?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Myles, we're continuing to have some very productive discussions with our customers in that space, and Ray and his team have been out having a very good dialogue, understanding customer needs and where they'd like to go in the future. And we have a number of options for satisfying those needs. Those include continuing to deliver on our current programs, so getting the 737 MAX and the full family the 7, 8, and 9 delivered and continuing to ramp up the 787 and satisfies customers' future needs with that family. That could be the end outcome here that we simply deliver on those two programs as currently defined.","We're also continuing to look at a potential additional stretch of the MAX. We have some very good options there that could create value for our customers, and we're marching through our assessment of that, making good progress there. That's a decision that's more in the near term that we'll work our way through. And then longer term, we're continuing to look at the so called middle of the market airplane, or options in that space. Again, having very productive dialogue with customer, firming up our opportunities there. If we were to go with that new airplane, that would be more in the 2024, 2025 entry into service range. On the other hand, an additional stretch of the MAX could be done more around the end of this decade just to give you a sense for the timing there. And it's a realistic possibility that we could do both. We have the capacity and the ability to do both and the timeline and phasing of those would allow us to do both. So we're looking across that whole range of solutions, and over the next several months, we'll work through our decision process.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So you laid four pages on the table. Are each of those four able to be absorbed in your plan to grow cash flow through the end of the decade or the first three are and the last one is more of a tossup?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","All four are consistent with that plan. So even if we were to take the upper scenario there, I'll say, and implement a stretch \u2013 an additional stretch of the MAX and launch a new middle of the market airplane, the time phasing of those relative to our current development programs fits with our planned R&D profile. The middle of the market airplane, for example, would be on the backside of the 777X development, so timeline there makes good sense. All of that is consistent with our long-term R&D planning. None of this would be a significant change to our R&D profile over the next five years, so steady from that standpoint. And all of that fully supports our plans to grow cash year-over-year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Our cash growth comments fully contemplate that range of possible development programs.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Troy Jeffrey Lahr - The Boeing Co.","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","And that'll be from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in there. Dennis, earlier you were talking about just dialogue with customers broadly. Can you provide some color just on how dialogue broadly has been going with the airline and the lessors just given what we're seeing around decelerating traffic growth, (57:04), I guess even rising fuel? And then just a quick clarification. As far as the commentary on revenue for next year, I think you said flat to slightly down. Is that consistent with what you said just about a month or two ago?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, let me field that first one. Then Greg and I will tag team on the second one. So first of all, in terms of customer dialogue, as we said, the overall market assessment today is a positive one if you take a long-term view. The 20-year market and the need for 39,600 new aircraft, that's slightly up compared to last year's current market outlook. So a robust long-term market. I'd say right now, in our customer conversations, certainly more positive in the narrow body arena than in wide bodies. As we said, there's hesitation in the wide body marketplace right now as we think through a number of factors around the world. Slow GDP growth around the world, hesitation in cargo traffic, geopolitical questions. There are a number of factors that are causing our customers to be somewhat hesitant in wide bodies in particular. So we're being mindful of that, and working with our customers as we plan for the future.","Narrow bodies, while again it's all in the context of some broad global economic concern, the ordering activity and the robustness of narrow body growth continues to be very clear, fueled by traffic growth. And as we said earlier, as we ramp up the 737 line to 57 a month, we continue to be oversold against that profile. And just as another data point, referrals and cancellations remain at historical lows, at about 1% of backlog. And load factors and utilization rates on aircraft fleets again remain generally very high compared to historical averages.","So that's a composite view of the marketplace. We're staying very close to our customers, making sure they get the support they need, maintaining a balanced view of the future. But there's more upside than downside in the overall marketplace, and we're going to make sure we have a balanced approach to how we run the business. This is a good, steady, long-term growth business.","Now, on your comments about revenue, so, all consistent with what we've talked about before. But Greg, give him a little more.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, yeah. Just keep in mind, yeah, we raised our guide just recently, so that kind of comes into play with our flat to slightly down, Rajeev. And we've still got, obviously, some moving pieces in there, with services and a couple of airplanes moving around. But that's kind of how we see it right now. And obviously, with that, as we talked about, we'll be increasing production rates next year, getting this Dash 10 into the production system. And I think about that in a very, I'll say, de-risked approach, like we did with the Dash 9. So overall, that's kind of how we see next year, and everybody's focused on getting our \u2013 I'll say solidifying our plans to execute to that. And again, we'll give you more color on the next call about some of the moving pieces.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You're welcome.","Presentation","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. . I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Thomas J. Downey - The Boeing Co.","Thank you. We have a few minutes remaining for questions from the media for Dennis and Greg. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002.","Operator, we're ready for the first question and in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Oh, hi. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Good morning.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Julie.","Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP","Hi. Could we just circle back to Commercial Crew, and could you walk me through some of the steps that have been taken to deal with the issues that have popped up with the CST-100? And how confident are you at this point that we won't see additional delays?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Julie, we've taken a very deep look at that with our team. And as we recently announced, that delivery of the program has been delayed by about six months. We built in an additional month of reserve as part of that, and it's a matter of completing the engineering design work and working through a few supply chain issues that we've had on this first article. I think we have got our arms well around it. We still have some hard work to do. These development programs are complex, and it's a fixed-price structure. So we're being mindful of that. But I'm confident that we'll get this to the finish line and we'll deliver for our NASA customer. So this is straightforward work, but engineering and supply chain work that we need to finish up.","Operator","Next we'll go to Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hi, Doug.","Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","(1:02:20) the Defense question. Dennis, the President of your Defense & Space business calls some of the big upcoming contract awards, be it GBDS (sic) [GBSD] (1:02:32) TX, et cetera, et cetera, characterizes them as can-wins rather than must-wins. How would you characterize them, and what happens if they become don't-wins?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, Leanne and I are completely on the same page here, along with our whole team. You know, the future of our Defense business is not dependent on any one program. We have an outstanding portfolio, existing portfolio, strong production lines, strong services lines. Broadly, we see opportunities in commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, space exploration services, all of which are long-term sustained businesses with growth opportunities.","Now, these few near-term key competitions like TX, JSTAR's recapitalization, GBSD, the items you mentioned, are very important to us. And they are things we're investing in. We're approaching them as a total enterprise supporting Leanne and her team. But we're going to be very focused on winning those, but our future is not dependent on any single program. And I think that's the value of the strength of the Boeing enterprise. So we're going to take the right approach. We're going to be appropriately aggressive to pursue winning these opportunities. But we're also going to make sure that we run a good, solid long-term business. And that's how I would frame it up, and very, very consistent with the strategy and approach that Leanne has described.","Operator","Next we go to Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alwyn Scott - Thomson Reuters Corp.","Hi, Dennis and Greg. Thank you for taking my call.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","You're welcome.","Alwyn Scott - Thomson Reuters Corp.","The business jet market is very weak. Should investors be concerned that the slowdown in production there will make it harder for aerospace suppliers to offer further price cuts to Boeing through partnering for success, or does it help Boeing because they need the business? I'm just curious how you think about that part of the supply chain and the weakness there, reading (1:04:37).","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Well, Alwyn, let me take a crack that and Greg, you may want to add in here. But as we look at our supply chain, I'd say, yeah, there's some elements of our supply chain that play both in the RJ and general aviation marketplace, as well as our narrow body and wide body production lines. But we're not seeing a lot of feed-over between that regional jet market or general aviation market and our narrow body market. In our narrow body marketplace, the demand signals remain very strong. As I said, traffic growth looks very positive, sustaining at about 6% a year. The fact that our market is strong, our backlog is built out, that we're oversold against the production rate ramp-up on 737 that I described earlier, that just adds strength to our supply chain in that marketplace. So whether that attracts more participation from suppliers or they're more eager to participate in a robust growing marketplace, I think that's good for Boeing. It's good for our suppliers. But I'm not seeing a lot of ripple effect between those two markets that you're describing.","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, I think the only thing I would add to that is just obviously as you \u2013 as we talked earlier, when you look at just even the backlog and you see \u2013 you can envision out seven years, I think that's a big advantage for us and our supply chain to have that kind of a horizon and make some investments around productivity and capture those as you see kind of, I'll say, a steady production rate or in some cases growing. And I think where we have been spending more time on the Partnering for Success to help the suppliers is taking some of the initiatives that have been proven to be successful on lines like F-18, on the 737, and some of the recent frankly breakthroughs on the 787 and taking those back into the supply chain. And I think as Dennis indicated, that makes the supply chain healthier, which I think we all will all benefit from. And so if there is any tradeoffs or any challenges that they may be having around the business jet, this is a great opportunity to take some of these productivity working capital type initiatives and partner together and really make overall operations more efficient. So that's where we're spending, like I say, more time in the next generation of partnering for success, and we think there's great opportunity there for all parties involved.","Operator","Our next question's from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Please go ahead.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Yeah, hi. Thanks. Greg, could you explain the change in the tax line on your report? You're going from a $783 million expense to a $76 million benefit. And on the call if I heard you correctly, you mentioned a $124 million reversal of some earlier earnings and a $38 million forward loss but that obviously doesn't cover that whole difference, so what am I missing here?","Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, no. I'm happy to clarify, David. What I talked about on the earnings adjustment, the reach-forward loss was on the Commercial Crew program. And then with regards to taxes, we had two benefits within the quarter adjustments, one of which is a settlement we had in our 2011 and 2012 audit that we booked as well as some basis restoration that we have booked within the quarter. So those are the big moving pieces within tax for this quarter. But as you look forward into next year, you're going to see more of a I'll say normalized tax rate of about 31% to 32%.","Operator","Our next question's from Dan Catchpole with The Everett Herald (sic) [The Daily Herald} (1:08:26). Please go ahead.","Dan Catchpole - The Daily Herald Co.","Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question here.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Hey Dan.","Dan Catchpole - The Daily Herald Co.","How are you doing this morning?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Good.","Dan Catchpole - The Daily Herald Co.","I wanted to kind of piggy back on something that Howard Rubel mentioned earlier with some of the skepticism that's around the difference between program outlooks in the past and realities on the ground as they've come up. And looking at the 777X, some of the issues that you've been working through on the Bob \u2013 build process and engineering layoffs, most of the contractors, but directs online for layoffs, minimal layoffs but still layoffs later this year, what can you tell us to reassure us that there's not going to be a difference between your optimistic outlook for developments and the reality of the program as it proceeds? And related to that, where are you guys with head count? Are you good, or do you expect further trends?","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, let me address the first part of your question there. And, Dan, if you take a look at 777X and the FAUB example, the fuselage upright build, this represents exactly the risk mitigation approach that I talked about earlier; the fact that we're not waiting for the 777X production ramp-up to test out the new production automation system. We actually pulled it ahead, implemented it on the existing 777 line to de-risk it. Now, that de-risking process hasn't been completely clean, as you well know. We've had some challenges ramping it up. But our ability to pull it ahead into the existing 777 line has dramatically reduced our risk. It's allowed us to ring out the automation systems, and we've now delivered more than 20 units using that process. So that's a great example of accelerating innovation, de-risking it for the future, and adds to our confidence that 777X will be delivered as planned.","Now, your broader comment about head count and jobs, course we're always very mindful about what we're doing on this front. We put a lot of value into our employees and our team. And we've got a great team, I'd say the best team in the world. At the same time, we're dealing with market realities around competitiveness and challenging market environments. So we'll continue to take the right actions to make sure we're a profitable business that can invest in the future, and we're going to continue to invest in our team. But head count variations are a natural part of our business, and we're very diligent about handling those in a balanced way, in a way that's very respectful of our team.","Troy Jeffrey Lahr - The Boeing Co.","Operator, we have time for one remaining question please.","Operator","And we'll go to Stephen Trimble with Flightglobal. Please go ahead.","Stephen Trimble - Flightglobal","Yeah, hi. I was calling about the \u2013 or wanted to ask about the 777 and what you think might be the ideal production rate to go efficiently into the ramp-up of the 777-9 in 2020 and then how that affects how you make this decision on the production rate in 2018, 2019.","Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.","Yeah, hey Steven, on that front, go back to the scenarios I described to you earlier. Our current baseline plan again is to step down to 7 a month here at the start of 2017. That gives us a very effective transition plan as we go into 2018 and begin building 777X flight test aircraft and also prepare the production lines to slot over to the new aircraft. As we paint through other scenarios, I mentioned earlier a scenario where if we had to come down two per month to keep production and demand in balance, we can also effectively transition at that level. So all of the scenarios we're looking at allow us to transition effectively. And that just adds again confidence to our ability to not only deliver 777 but to ramp up 777X. Keep the line profitable while we do that and makes sure the whole enterprise production line stays healthy.","Troy Jeffrey Lahr - The Boeing Co.","That concludes our earnings call.

This performance has allowed us to continue returning cash to our shareholders through our strong dividend and share repurchase program.","Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 15% to $16 billion and operating margins were strong at 11.2%. We delivered 186 commercial airplanes in the third quarter, including 31 787 Dreamliners and we added net new orders of 501 airplanes. Boeing defense, space and security revenue was $8 billion in the third quarter and operating margins increased to 10.8%.","BDS captured numerous key contract awards in the quarter, including NASA\u2019s commercial crew spaceship program with a potential value of $4.2 billion. And the first order for the 02 Phoenix small satellite.","Significant BDS program milestones include delivery of the first Chinook helicopter under the latest multi-year contract with the U.S. Army, successful launch in orbit of the seventh GPS IIF satellite, and delivery of the first four upgraded Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft for France.","With that, let\u2019s turn to the business environment on slide three. Strong growth in the commercial airplane market continues to drive demand that supports our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade.","Net new orders for the year of 1011 are well above our planned output and our record backlog of more than 5500 aircraft represents more than seven years of production at current rates. Given the 737\u2019s robust backlog of more than 4000 orders, we plan to increase production from the current rate of 42 per month to 47 in 2017 and then increase production again to 52 per month in 2018.","Furthermore, the compelling value proposition of the 787 and its sizeable backlog of more than 850 orders are driving production rate increases from today\u2019s per month to the previously announced rate of 12 per month in 2016 and then up to 14 by the end of the decade.","We also are increasing production on the 767 from the current rate of 1 per month to two per month in 2016. Notwithstanding a somewhat richer mix of global economic and geopolitical developments throughout this year which we are monitoring very carefully, global passenger traffic trends are strong, and air cargo traffic continues to gradually improve, although the latter still remains a watch item for us.","We continue to see replacement demand as an increasingly important market driver with airlines opting to introduce newer more efficient airplanes with compelling economics and a rapid return on investment rather than keeping older less efficient models in service.","Our new technologically advanced airplanes not only have far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs but also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increase residual values, greater range and a better overall passenger experience. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft. When we look at that combination of growth and replacement needs over the next 20 years, we forecast global demand for nearly 37,000 new commercial airplanes.","Near term, the customers continue to demonstrate confidence in their fleet plans with deferral requests still running well below the historical average and we continue to have requests to accelerate deliveries. This ongoing strong demand, coupled with our large and diverse backlog underpins our outlook for sustained growth in the years ahead.","In the Twin-Aisle segment, we continue to see healthy demand for both the 777 and the new 777X which are outselling the competition by a wide margin, giving us confidence in our ability to transition between the two airplanes. We also continue to enhance the value proposition of the 777 for customers with our relentless drive of product improvements that will further increase operating efficiencies.","Year to date, we have 45 orders and commitments for the 777. We expect demand for the 777 to remain healthy through the end of this decade with an anticipated average order capture around 40 to 60 airplanes per year to support the transition to the 777X.","We\u2019ll continue to evaluate our options for the most efficient way to transition from the current 777 to the 777X as the new airplane enters final assembly in the 2018 timeframe. We are also introducing new manufacturing processes and technologies that allow us to further optimize the 777X production system. As we mentioned before, a smooth production transition is a top priority on this program.","On the 787 program, we achieved several noteworthy milestones, including delivering the fifth 787-9 as well as the first 787-9 with GE powered engines. Both the GE and Rolls-Royce engine types are now certified on the 787-9. In addition, our Charleston facility delivered its first 787 at its planned production rate of approximately three per month which supports the overall current production rate of 10 per month. Production performance at Charleston continues to progress nicely.","In the Single-Aisle segment, demand for our new fuel efficient 737 MAX remains high with cumulative orders totaling nearly 2300 airplanes from 47 customers. The production bridge from today\u2019s 737 to the MAX remains solid with the first MAX delivery expected in 2017.","Turning to defense, space and security, we continue to solid support for our major programs in the FY15 budget process. We are encouraged by the actions taken in the both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees with regard to additional Apaches and EA-18G Growlers as well as strong support from both on P-8 and Tanker. Our international business represented 28% of BDS revenues during the quarter and 37% of the BDS backlog as we continue to leverage our unique One Boeing global advantage.","Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and the critical few large scale future programs that are priorities for our customers, like Long Range Strike, space launch system, UCLASS and the T-X trainer.","The relative strength of our defense, space and security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable proven and affordable. We continue to focus on driving further efficiency, quality and productivity gains to improve program profitability and fund investment in future growth. As part of these efforts, BDS continues to make strong progress on our market based affordability initiative as we strive to reduce operating costs by another $2 billion to ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending.","Our announcement in December of plans to consolidate some of our defense service and support work into Oklahoma City and St. Louis is one example of those efforts. Decisions that affect our workforce are never easy, but we are fortunate to have a growing commercial business with employment needs that have helped mitigate some of the impact on our people. In summary, our team is executing on our business strategy by meaningfully growing revenues, generating, solid operating performance on improved execution and capturing strategic new business.","Now, over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg.","Greg Smith","Thanks, Jim and good morning. Let\u2019s turn to slide four to discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue increased 7% to $23.8 billion driven by growth in our commercial airplane business.","Core operating margins increased to 10.2%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses. Third quarter core earnings per share increased 19%, $2.14 on higher volume and continued strong operating performance. Let\u2019s turn now to our commercial airplane business on slide five.","The third quarter our commercial airplane business increased revenue 15% to a record $16.1 billion on a 186 airplane deliveries. The solid BCA operating margin of an 11.2 % reflects strong program execution offset by the impact of higher 787 and 747 deliveries and higher fleet support for new customer introductions. Commercial airplane captured $69 billion of net orders during the quarter and backlog achieved a new record of $430 billion and over 5500 aircraft in seven years of production.","In the third quarter, 787 deferred production cost increased $947 million to $25.2 billion, largely driven by the increase of 787-9 production and the continued inventory pull ahead to efficiently optimize in production and minimize disruption as we introduce the aircraft into our production system.","Similarly, on the 787-10, we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our build plan in early 2015 to mitigate early introduction risk, while preparing to increase the overall 787 production rate to 12 per month in 2016. The team continues to reduce unit cost and improve float time on both the 787-8 and 787-9 through continued focus on optimization of the production and maximizing efficiencies.","Overall, we continue to make solid progress on the 787 program, however, we still have work ahead of us as I said introducing the 787-9 in production preparing for the 12 per month rate and again, introduction the 787-10 while drive efficiencies across all aspects of the program. The team remains focused on solid day-to-day execution, risk mitigation and improving the long-term productivity and profitability and cash flow going forward.","Turning now to defense, space and security results on slide six, third quarter revenue for our defense business was $7.9 billion and operating margins increased to 10.8% due to strong performance across the business. Boeing Military Aircraft third quarter revenue increased 3% to $3.5 billion, reflecting higher volume on our P-8 program. BMA operating margins also increased to 12.4% on continued solid program execution.","Global services and support revenue of $2.3 billion and operating margins were 9.7% largely due to deliver mix in the quarter. Network and space systems reported revenue of $2 billion, reflecting timing of ULA launches and lower government satellite volume.","Operating margins increased to 9.3% in the quarter on strong program execution across the portfolio. Defense, space and security reported a solid backlog of $60 billion with 37% of our current backlog now from international customers.","Turning now to slide seven, Boeing Capital\u2019s net financing portfolio increased slightly to $3.5 billion on some new aircraft volume.","Now, turning to cash flow on slide eight. Third quarter operating cash flow before pension contributions was $1.7 billion driven by higher commercial airplane production rates and solid operating performance somewhat offset by timing, receipts and expenditures in the quarter.","During the quarter, we made a plan to discretionary pension contribution of $750 million. With regard to capital deployment, we paid $525 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 8 million shares for a $1 billion in the third quarter, bringing our year to date repurchase activity to 39 million shares or $5 billion.","The capital deployment to date continues to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and our backlog and our commitment and confidence in the business performance going forward. We expect to complete the remaining $5.8 billion repurchase authorization over approximately next one to two years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains a priority for us.","Let\u2019s move now to cash and debt balances on slide nine. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide sound liquidity and positions us well going forward. Turning now to slide 10, we\u2019ll discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2014.","We are increasing our core earnings per share guidance for 2014 by $0.20 to now be $8.10 to $8.30 on continued solid execution. Based on strong operating performance, combined with the impact of timing of receipts and expenditures, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance before pension contributions for 2015 to now be greater than $7 billion.","In addition, as a result of our continued focus on execution and disciplined cash management, we are lowering our outlook for capital spending by $200 million to now be approximately $2.3 billion for the year. This performance allowed us to further return cash to shareholders as we continue to aggressively repurchase shares and pay dividends. Remain confident in our long term cash generation potential given the focus on execution, our ability to deliver on the unprecedented backlog and our unmatched portfolio of products and services.","We are also increasing our BCA operating margin guidance to be approximately 10.5% on improved operating performance. In the fourth quarter, we expect BCA margins to be impacted by higher deliveries of 747 and 767, some additional planned fleet support costs for new customer introductions, higher R&D on the 787-10 and 777X, as well as additional investments in productivity initiatives.","In summary, third quarter financial performance reflects the strength of our backlog, the strong demand for our products and services and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the enterprise. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim for some closing comments.","W. James McNerney","Thank you, Greg. With three solid quarters behind us, we are focused on closing out the year with continued strong business performance that will allow us to meet our customer commitments and our investments in the future, recognize and reward our team for their work and continue to return cash to shareholders.","Our priorities in 2014 and beyond remain clear, profitably ramp-up in production on our commercial airplane programs, executing on our commercial and defense development programs, driving productivity and affordability throughout the enterprise, continuing to strengthen and position our defense business with targeted investments and further international expansion and all the while providing increasing value to both our customers and our shareholders. Now, Greg and I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will be from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","","Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Yes, good morning.","W. James McNerney","Good morning, Doug.","Greg Smith","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","When you look at the year so far and you\u2019ve had very strong margins in BCA, in this quarter, your unit margin turned significantly positive which is new.","Greg Smith","Yes.","Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","But on the other side, deferred production on the 787 moved slightly above your guidance level and I would say free cash flow for the quarter was low given your guidance even before pension. So I\u2019d like to understand better how you see the operating performance, the strong operating performance we\u2019ve seen turn into cash going forward? And specifically, when do you see the 787-8 and the 787-9 each turning cash positive? And what else drove the high unit margins in the quarter, is that something that we should expect to continue?","Greg Smith","Okay. Well, Doug, let me start with cash flow. Certainly, you are right, I mean strong execution across the business and across the programs and that\u2019s certainly driving our cash flow to date. And as I mentioned before, there\u2019s timing quarter between quarter when you \u2013 relates to advances and milestone payments.","So that \u2013 some of that is what you are seeing \u2013 equate that to timing is what you are seeing on the quarter. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve been pulling forward 787 inventory and particularly around 787-9 to ensure that that program enters into the production system in a very smooth manner of which it is doing. We also got some timing C-17 orders that we\u2019ve talked about.","So those, again, are related to timing throughout the balance of the year. So we still expect to see very strong cash flow through the balance of the year and really coming from the elements we talked about, continuing to execute on the deliveries, on the productivity as well as the 787 unit cost.","Now, when you look forward into 2015, we expect to see continued growth in cash flow, again, through the execution on the production rate, additional productivity, international orders and that will be somewhat offset by our cash taxes and 777X R&D starting to kind of come into play, [but that could] (ph) you\u2019ll see growth. And then, from there forward, as we talked about, you\u2019ll continue to see operating cash flow growth throughout the balance, and again, that\u2019s all executing on our production rates and continuing to drive productivity. I am not sure if I covered all your questions.","Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Well, if you look at the \u2013 you are talking about moving inventory forward related to the 787-9 and I am trying to understand if you \u2013 if it\u2019s possible to put that aside for a moment and think about how the 787-8 and 787-9 are each performing in terms of costs, are those \u2013 is the 787-8 cash positive yet if were to look at it on a standalone basis? Can you give us a sense of where that is today relative to, I would call, more one-time items related to inventory timing?","Greg Smith","Yes, yes, no \u2013 as I said before, we are not cash positive yet. We expect to be cash positive in the 2015 timeframe and that will be a blend obviously of 787-8 and 787-9, but if you step back and look at unit cost on 787-8 and 787-9, they continue to progress well as I\u2019ve talked about on prior calls, as well as I would say the other key indicators that ultimately make into deferred and cash around flow time and overall cost of quality, all of those trending in the right direction on the program.","So obviously we expect that to continue, continue to expect to come down the learning curve on the 787 as well as step down into [prior] (ph) pricing and continuing to work the productivity initiatives, all of that ultimately contributing to cash flow over the long term of the program.","Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, okay. Thank you.","Greg Smith","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning.","W. James McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Greg, just staying on the deferred, so wondering if you could \u2013 if you have a new estimate of where it might take or if we are sticking with [about 25 even though] (ph) we are already a little bit over?","And then just honing into the 787-9, I think the pull forward, you\u2019ve talked about the inventory is a little more than maybe you expected a year ago, could you maybe give a little more concrete \u2013 give us a little more on exactly what\u2019s going on there, is this payments to suppliers that are happening in advance? I guess, quantify it a little bit and help us get a sense as to when maybe flips the other way?","","Greg Smith","Yes, maybe just to kind of help when you look at just over $900 million of growth in deferred in the quarter, there\u2019s about a couple of hundred million dollars in there that\u2019s related to 787-9 pull forward. So, essentially, what they are doing is, as these products become more mature in the production system and the suppliers are performing, we are pulling those components and migrating those into the production system to allow a smooth transition as we are operating it at 10 a month and Ray and the team have a done a fantastic job in doing that and you are seeing that in the results, we are making our \u2013 obviously our deliveries. And so that kind of methodology they are utilizing in the production system is a risk reduction, certainly, impacts deferred on the near term, but as far as the long-term profitability and risk reduction on the program, absolutely the right thing to do.","And as I\u2019ve said to you in the past, the program team out there is focused on unit by unit improvement on all aspects, whether it is quality, unit cost or flow time and ultimately, cash and that\u2019s certainly what they are managing, but there\u2019s some near term, as I said, risk mitigating activities that we\u2019ve taken into account here that do impact near term on deferred, but are absolutely the right thing to do for this program and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen in the quarter and you are going to continue to see some of that as we start to pull forward 787-10 products and get those into the production system, derisk the overall production system and get ready for 12 a month.","On the overall deferred, there\u2019s really no change, I said it would be approximately $25 billion, we are at $25.2 billion, but again, keep in mind, last two or three quarters we pulled forward 787-9 and that wasn\u2019t in the original plan, there\u2019s no question about that, but again, absolutely the right thing to do. So, we are continuing to focus on it, but like I said, Joe, it\u2019s all about making rate and making unit cost improvements unit over unit and that\u2019s what the team continues to focus on.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","If I may, this is violating the one part, one question, but just to keep on the point \u2013","Greg Smith","Yes.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","I understand the 787-9 pull forward is a couple of hundred, and I think maybe it was $300 million or so, $300 million or $400 million last quarter.","Greg Smith","Okay.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","I understand that, but it doesn\u2019t seem like sequentially the other part of deferred really came down. It seems like that was maybe $700 million and change, last quarter, $700 million and change this quarter, so is there any more color on the 787-8?","Greg Smith","Yes, no \u2013 787-8 continues to make progress. So we are continuing to make progress there and as we have. So there\u2019s really, I would say, they are continuing on the trajectory of reducing unit cost as we\u2019ve been on.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Greg Smith","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company","Yes, thanks so much. ","Greg Smith","Hi, Cai.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company","Not to beat a dead horse, but if we take out the pull forwards which is not execution, it doesn\u2019t look like the 787 deferreds are coming down that much. Hence, it is pretty \u2013 I am confused as to why you got a $1 billion positive swing in unit cost or about $500 million profit, which were the programs that were profitable or more profitable in the third quarter versus in the second quarter and how does that all [square] (ph) with the trend in 787 deferreds? Thanks","Greg Smith","Yes, I mean, on overall unit, we saw improvement on the 777 quarter over quarter and about flat on the 777. Now I\u2019d give you some perspective, on the 777, we also had a block extension, 200 units that included the investment [to go up to 52] (ph) but also most of that, those 200 units were MAX airplanes. So I think it really gives you a sense of the value this airplane is bringing to the marketplace and at the same time, the focus on productivity that you are seeing on not just that program, obviously on the other program. So good performance I would say on the core programs and continuing to make progress on the 787, but when you look at unit versus program, Cai, you also go to take into the account, as I\u2019ve talked before, mix.","So you\u2019ve got more early build on the Charleston and more 787-9s in there in Q3 and even with that, you\u2019ve seen improvement when you compare unit to program. So continuing to make progress, still got a long way to go, but I think they got good plans in place, they are monitoring them, we\u2019ve got the enterprise engaged on how to capture more productivity and then going forward, obviously, partnering for success and supplier step-down as we introduce new blocks into the production system. So all of that adding to the improvement in unit costs going forward.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thank you.","Greg Smith","You are welcome.","Operator","And next go to Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. ","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","W. James McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Just a quick clarification on the 777, your comment about near versus program, did the 777 program margin change in the quarter? And then as a follow-on, the period expenses and fleet support that called up both in the release and in your prepared remarks.","Greg Smith","Yes.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Greg, can you help us understand, maybe how impactful that is to the full year margin and then maybe help us understand the cadence of those expenses, quarter over quarter, have those been growing sequentially each quarter or were they high one quarter versus the others, any help there will be much appreciated?","Greg Smith","Sure. Our 777 margin did improve slightly in the quarter and again a lot other things I talked about on the 787 are obviously embedded into the 777. So we are continuing to try to reduce the unit cost overall on that program. So, you are seeing some of the results of that. On the period expense, I would say, the moving pieces within there are fleet support and as you know, we are introducing more new 787s to customers this year than we have in the prior years and we want to ensure that that is a very smooth transition. So we are making investments in fleet support to ensure that they do have \u2013 able to introduce those airplanes very smoothly into their operating system.","And then R&D, so you are starting to see in the back half here, you\u2019ll see 787-10 really starting to ramp up and you all see early introduction of the 777X R&D. So those are primarily the moving pieces. You also got a little bit of mix in the fourth quarter BCA margin where we will have a couple of more 747s that\u2019ll be dilutive on the margin basis. But again, we are going to continue to manage that as we have. And if we see an opportunity to improve that margin in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll certainly capture those gains.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you for taking my question.","W. James McNerney","Good morning.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Greg, I wanted to ask a bit about the buyback activity year to date and what the right way to interpret it? In the prepared remarks, I heard you sort of reaffirm that you\u2019ll finish the rest of the authorization over the next one to two years.","Greg Smith","Yes.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I am curious when we think about the buyback year to date and the fact that it\u2019s been at an elevated rate, is that a disagreement with the market on the price of the stock, is that the expectation of continued strong execution going forward? What is driving the decision to buy back at an elevated rate?","Greg Smith","I\u2019ll [say the latter] (ph), that\u2019s the","John Godyn \u2013Morgan Stanley","Okay. ","Greg Smith","I mean when you step back, just think about, and I\u2019ve talked about this a lot, because there is a lot of big moving pieces in here, as I\u2019ve talked before on advances or milestone, you step back and you think about last year and this year combined, over $16 billion of cash generation coming from the core operation and you look at that and then you look at the production rates, you look at the record backlog and the fact is I think we\u2019ve got maybe three or four production rate increases going forward that we need to execute, we\u2019ve already been through almost $17 billion to date. And that\u2019s what\u2019s giving us the confidence.","The risk profile obviously has changed dramatically and the continued focus on execution and repurchasing $5 billion of stock this year really, again, looking forward, looking at the strength of the backlog, looking at our ability to execute on that backlog and capture additional productivity and that\u2019s what\u2019s really driven us to buy back the shares at the pace we have been buying back. And we put the authorization in place obviously to utilize it and we are going to continue to do that as we fit, but it gets back to just the fundamentals and I think the competitive differentiator in the marketplace, in the marketplace where you are looking at 5500 airplanes in backlog and we know where they are, we are very happy with the quality of that backlog, [gets to] (ph) execute on that and executing on that flawlessly and I think the team has done a great job and I think we are going to continue to do a great job going forward.","John Godyn \u2013Morgan Stanley","And is there a potential to revisit or even increase the authorization going forward?","Greg Smith","Yes, we certainly will do that as we [fit] (ph)","John Godyn \u2013Morgan Stanley","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And next move to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Good morning.","W. James McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","I wanted to follow up on the question about some of those period expenses which is that if you look at the BCA [tied-ins] (ph) that would imply something like a mid-8% margin than the fourth quarter and I would think a lot of those things like R&D the [mix to 787-8, 787-7] (ph), etcetera really don\u2019t change going into next year, so is that how we should be thinking about BCA into next year as well?","Greg Smith","Yes. I think as you think about next year, obviously, we\u2019ll see strong growth coming out of BCA going into next year, again, executing on the production rates and we\u2019re also expecting a little bit higher services revenue going into next year. Now, on the margin front, we\u2019re going to have a little bit more R&D than we had this year and again, that\u2019s a ramp-down obviously of the 787-9, ramp-up of the 777X and the 787-10 and then again, improvements on 787 margin expected into next year and then we\u2019re going to continue to make investments in 777X automation as we\u2019ve talked about I think in the past.","So, those are kinds of moving pieces if you think about going into next year and then of course, we\u2019re continuing to focus on the productivity initiatives I discussed. That\u2019s generally I think the best way to look at it for next year and again, on the top line, we know we need to do and on the bottom line, we\u2019re going to continue doing what we\u2019ve \u2013 what we have been doing this year and last year on productivity.","Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thanks.","Greg Smith","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning.","W. James McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Greg, just on something you said a couple of questions ago about the importance of execution and also volumes, rate increases, and we\u2019re all sitting here waiting for free cash flow per share to get into the double digits and into the mid-teens perhaps, what\u2019s the timeframe, when do you have the confluence of this rising execution and at the same time, the volumes that will drive \u2013 that long awaited steeper slope in the cash flow, is this 2017 when you hit the next rate on the narrow body, because the 787 component of it seems to be moving a little bit to the right here when you said earlier, sometime in the 2015 time frame 787-8 goes breakeven \u2013","Greg Smith","Yes.","Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","So when should we be thinking about a change in the slope on the free cash flow curve?","Greg Smith","Well, as I say, you are going to\u2013 we\u2019re going to see growth next year and expect to see growth thereafter and it\u2019s really again executing on the production rates. Now, once you get to a peak rate, I would say that\u2019s where you really maximize the cash flow of just the basis of the elements of driving the cash flow between progress payments and delivery payments. So, once we get to peak rate is really where you should see the real potential or peak potential from the company and then again the partnering for success and the other initiatives more mature out in that time frame.","But, again, the top line is pretty solid, when you look, we know the rates, we know we need to do execute on far fewer than what we\u2019ve had to, but \u2013 and we\u2019re making investments today. We\u2019re making investments in that growth whether it\u2019s 787-10 or whether that\u2019s MAX or 777X. So, obviously those investments will peak in as they get, I\u2019ll take kind of the [key minus] (ph) entry into service and so there\u2019ll be some offset there. But, again we continue to see a strong cash flow profile going forward driven on those elements of the business.","Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right. But, Greg, how do we factor in the fact that your peak rates keep moving to the right and not because they are delayed, they just keep getting higher?","Greg Smith","Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that rates have moved to the right, they moved up.","Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","That\u2019s what I mean getting higher. So, you have new peaks further out at higher levels?","Greg Smith","Right.","Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","And continued investment to get there. So, it\u2019s a little \u2013 when you\u2019re talking about maturing at a peak rate, are we talking about the 10 per month on the 787, the 12, the 14, the 42, the 47, or the 52 on the narrow body, how do we think about, what\u2019s a peak rate, what\u2019s a mature rate?","Greg Smith","I think all of those are going to come into play, and as you know, they\u2019re all pretty much staggered throughout that next five-year period, but when you talk about investments as an example, we\u2019ve already made the investments, [these are] (ph) accounted for the investments that go into 52 a month on the 737. So, again I think this is a demonstration of the strength of the market and the strength of the portfolio and again, I wouldn\u2019t call it moving investments or moving rate to the right, it\u2019s more moving rates up.","Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes. I wasn\u2019t trying to suggest they are delayed, I meant going higher. Just a quick one for Jim. Jim, we\u2019ve seen a lot of movement in the price of oil here, and I know that airlines\u2019 fleet plan on a long-term basis, but at what price of Brent crude might we see some demand destruction?","W. James McNerney","Well, the airlines \u2013 first of all, airlines tend to buy on the sort of the distribution around a mean. So, and above to all, that distribution is pretty wide. So, their behavior tends to be driven by that more than a point (indiscernible). Having said that, our analysis shows the price of oil could still fall a long way before our planes are anything other than compelling economically.","I mean, this generation of new planes that we\u2019re introducing anywhere from 16% to 24% more efficient than the planes they are replacing, this replacement generation is it has more compelling numbers associated with than any generation I\u2019ve seen since the 707. So, our analysis \u2013 we (indiscernible) on both interest rates and price of oil and you got to go a long way from where we are now before you begin to see even incremental impact.","Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you. Thank you both.","Greg Smith","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi","Yes. Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi","Greg, just a clarification question for you and then one for Jim as well. On the clarification, can you just talk about or clarify the cadence of cash and deferred on the 787, is it the case that the 787-8, 787-9 move into a profitable state as the 787-10 is ramping up and therefore, things kind of stabilize, is that the right way to think about things on the 787?","Greg Smith","I think it\u2019s a combination or certainly getting to 12 a month, getting the 787-9 rate up are really the stabilizing factors obviously and continue to come down the learning curve internally and then the step down pricing on the supply chain are really the big drivers in there.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi","Yes. But then offsetting that will be some deferred build on the 787-10, is that right?","Greg Smith","Correct. Yes. Like I said, you know, if there\u2019s opportunities to pull some of this forward and I\u2019ll say verified in the production system, we\u2019re certainly going to do that as we have with the 787-9 and as you\u2019ve seen it has been very successful. But, that\u2019s kind of a quarter-by-quarter, month-by-month decision that we\u2019ll make as we get closer to those products moving into the production system, but 12 a month is a big milestone on deferred production.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi","Right. And, Jim, the question for you is just the phrase productivity gains and partnering for success (indiscernible) throughout this call, give us an update on where we are with partnering for success and what you at this point knowing what you know about the success of that program to date and the productivity gains that you\u2019re seeing \u2013 what kind of margin expansion opportunity do we have here for the commercial business in particular?","W. James McNerney","Well, you\u2019re seeing the beginnings of the impact now in the margins you\u2019re seeing in our businesses. So, pretty robust margins, we have plans to keep them in that neighborhood at least and I would say we\u2019re still in the first 25% of this initiative. We\u2019ve probably matured deals with somewhat over a third of our supply base, there is discussions with another third and then there\u2019s another third that we\u2019re jousting with a little bit. So, seeing the beginning of the impact now, still a lot more in front of us than behind us and I think it is going to be fundamental not only to our profitability but also the profitability of the people we work with.","I mean, we\u2019re taking cost out of our mutual business activities and those that are working with us are getting in many cases more volume from us part of the arrangement. So, this all gives us more flexibility on either taking it in margin or using it in price of the marketplace when we face those situations, and if we hadn\u2019t have had this program, we wouldn\u2019t be able to respond properly and so we\u2019re going to keep pushing this one.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi","Okay. Thank you.","W. James McNerney","Yes.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning.","W. James McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, maybe Greg, the advances, they were as a use of cash in the quarter \u2013","Greg Smith","Yes.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And I\u2019m coupling that with, I think the best commercial BCA bookings quarter in your history and certainly, I would imagine relative, in your prepared remarks said that orders are coming in well ahead of your expectations for the full year, so can you play out why advances aren\u2019t more of a source to your original benchmark for cash flow and [what\u2019s offsetting it] (ph)","Greg Smith","Yeah. No, absolutely, I mean, as you know, on initial order, there is no lot of cash that comes with that initial order, most of the cash associated that\u2019s with progress payment. So, that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing an offset and it\u2019s purely just timing of progress payments one quarter to another. So, there\u2019s nothing else to read into that other than timing on progress payments.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","In other words, there is no help that you\u2019re getting from the outside sort of activity for your guidance on cash flow?","Greg Smith","Yeah. No, I wouldn\u2019t say and you\u2019ll see more strength in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s where you\u2019ll definitely see some timing in there. And then as we talked about, you got a little bit of inventory when you look at it on a net basis, inventory build up on 737 and 787 that are also offsetting that. But, again I would \u2013 I just equate that to purely timing.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And one clarification, the C17, is that a cash headwind to this year on [white tails] (ph) or is it all virtually into 2015 that we have to think about?","Greg Smith ","No. It\u2019s this year.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank"," Okay.","Greg Smith ","Yeah. It\u2019s this year.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","All right, thanks.","Greg Smith ","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee"," Yes. Good morning, Jim and Greg.","W. James McNerney","Hi, Peter.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee","Jim, you\u2019ve mentioned the last couple of years that the majority deliveries having gone for replacement versus growth, I wonder if we can just put a finer point on that about how long do you think that this window continues to exist where we are seeing the majority of deliveries go for replacement before we tread back to kind of the historical growth estimates that have been associated with deliveries?","Greg Smith","Yes. I mean, if you look back in history, history is sort of 75% growth, 20% to 25% replacement and starting with really the 787, it\u2019s the replacement has been double that. Okay. So, a real (indiscernible) has changed. So, about half replacement, half growth. I think you\u2019re going to see it continue for a while as the new technology we\u2019ve developed rolls through our model families. ","For example, you\u2019re seeing it on the 787 today as it replaces the older medium sized wide-bodies and you\u2019re beginning to see it on the 777 as we spiral the number of those technologies now into the 777, you are beginning to see it on the MAX and so I think that\u2019s going to continue probably for another decade or so with a more robust mix of replacement versus growth which is the good thing about us in the sense that it will keep us disconnected from over all GDP trends. This is what gives us a multiplier on GDP.","And I think it\u2019s, and it all stems from the inventiveness of our people and staying out in front of the marketplace and our competition in that regard.","Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee","Yes. And just, if I could just follow up to that, one of the things that\u2019s been driver this has been the elevated fuel prices. So, I know to Rob\u2019s question about you would have to go a lot lower, but someone analysis kind of indicate that you saw oil at $70 for an extended period, you see some destruction, is that the only thing number materially below that?","Greg Smith","Yes. I mean, we would not see much impact at $70, okay. And it would have to be much difference than $70.","Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Greg Smith","Based on our analysis.","Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thank you.","W. James McNerney","Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.","Operator","And that will be from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning, everyone.","W. James McNerney","Hi, Noah.","Greg Smith","Good morning","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Maybe since I am last, I\u2019ll do one more deferred question, I guess I\u2019m wondering, now that you\u2019re at $25 billion, is it possible to more precisely pin down what the word approximate means in the approximately $25 billion and I know that\u2019s maybe [splitting] (ph) but I think a lot of your stakeholders really care if it is going to really kind of hover around $25 billion while it\u2019s flat before coming down or if it needed to be $26 billion or $27 billion before it comes back down. ","And in that answer, if you could also address since the inventory pull forward that you\u2019re doing which makes sense was unanticipated and not in the original plan, are there any other potential new strategies that could come about that you could tell us about that we could in front of?","Greg Smith","Yes. I mean that\u2019s certainly the 787-10. I mean, if we have an opportunity to do that for all the reasons I talked about on the 787-9, we\u2019ll absolutely do it and that\u2019s supporting profitable growth going forward and it\u2019s a risk reduction and it is absolutely the right thing to do and again, I think the 787-9 performance demonstrates that. And so, that\u2019s probably the one that comes to mind where we \u2013 if we have opportunities, we will. It could impact near term deffered, but I\u2019ll say a long-term productivity and profitability for the program will benefit as a result of that and ultimately cash flow. You know, on the deffered, a year ago, I said approximately $25 billion, there is obviously been a lot of moving pieces within that number and the 787-9 performance on a unit cost basis and I think try to give you some color on the progress that\u2019s being made there, they are making good progress, so expect to make more absolutely.","We would like it happen faster absolutely, seems very focused on it and then making rate, and the team has done a good job on making rate and then the suppliers step down. So, all of those sentiments within deffered are being managed all around profitability and cash flow. Quarter to quarter, they are going to change. There is no question about that depending on what\u2019s taking place in the production or where we can pull forward certain elements even if 787-8 inventory if we compose (indiscernible) we pull that in at the same time. So it\u2019s going to more around, Noah, but as we enter into more 787-9 and we have the opportunity again to risk mitigate.","We\u2019ll do that as well, but we\u2019re managing it obviously with a weighted focus mindset on cash generation and long term profitability and cash generation for the program over the long term. So, yes, there is near term decisions that you\u2019re going to see but they are absolutely the right thing to do to drive again solid growth on both top line and bottom line for the program.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. I guess given we\u2019re over \u2013 a little over $25 billion, we\u2019re not breakeven yet on 787-8. We\u2019re pulling forward a little more on 787-9. We have yet pulled forward on 10 each of those being a couple of hundred million dollars. It sounds like the approximate could translate to $1 to $2 billion rather than $100 million to $200 million. Is that a fair assessment or is that too large?","Greg Smith","Well, I think it\u2019s certainly, we\u2019re going to continue to do this quarter over quarter, I mean I certainly don\u2019t see a profile to get to $2 billion, but it\u2019ll depend on the decisions we make on pull forward and if we decide to do that and our continued focus on unit costs, so obviously it\u2019s about making rate and coming down on the unit cost and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on that. But like I said, is all about making investments now that have \u2013 ensure that we have long-term profitable growth on the program.","We hope next year on a cash flow basis on the program, it certainly will be much better than what it was this year and again, it\u2019s all those things that we\u2019ve talked about and during 2015 we expect to be cash positive on the program. So we\u2019re going to continue to execute on that and I would say kind of continue the productivity enhancements that the team has developed on the program that again really benefit not as much today, but definitely next year or next month or next quarter and following years to stabilize the production system and maximize the efficiency.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks very much.","Greg Smith","You are welcome.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that completes the analyst question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) I will now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.","Thomas J. Downey","Thank you. We will continue with the questions for Jim and Greg. If you have any other questions after the session ends, please call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question. And in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question please.","Operator","And first go to Doug Cameron with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron \u2013 Wall Street Journal","Hi. Good morning, Jim and Greg.","W. James McNerney","Good morning","Greg Smith"," Good morning, Doug.","Doug Cameron \u2013 Wall Street Journal","On the defense side, actually this bridges both parts of the business, you previously indicated in regulatory filings that you may make a decision on [a big chunk] (ph) in St. Louis in the sort of first, second quarter of 2013 time frame, given the transfer or upon transfer of some commercial work there in Wichita as well, I wonder if that sort of decision-making time frame is still valid, or in fact, bringing the commercial work in fact may change your mind, regardless of what happens on the military side?","W. James McNerney","Well, the key factors around any significant decision around St. Louis eventually gets to F-15 and F-18 production. We are pleased to see in the current budget proposal that F-15s are supported in the FY-15 budget which takes us out through the end of 2017, the international orders on F-15 take us beyond that. Now, that\u2019s not yet etched in stone with our government, so could there be a significant decision first part of 2015?","Yes. Does it look if we may be able to navigate through that? Yes. But I wouldn\u2019t want to say categorically that a decision wouldn\u2019t have to be made at that time. Obviously, longer term, Long Range Strike is a program that we think we are well positioned to win which would certainly St. Louis over the longer term perturbation we would have face into shorter term.","Operator","Our next question from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.","Julie Johnsson \u2013 Bloomberg News","","Hi, a quick question on 747-8, just wondering if there are any plans to reconsider the 1.5 per month rate this year, given what we\u2019re seeing with sales and the dwindling backlog?","","W. James McNerney","Well, we were pleased to see that the cargo market growth has accelerated and in this last quarter is up. Our best analysis as we sit here today says that the marketplace will support the rates that we have in place. The macro picture is improving, we\u2019ll just to have to look at it every quarter and make a decision for the Boeing Company. But for right now, we see \u2013 we think we are in the right spot.","Operator","","And next go to Dominic Gates with the Seattle Times. Please go ahead.","Dominic Gates \u2013 Seattle Times","Good morning.","W. James McNerney","Good morning, Dominic.","","Dominic Gates \u2013 Seattle Times","","I wanted to ask about the 737 market share, obviously the MAX is doing extremely well, but you started a year behind the Neo, the expectation was that basically sales of the Neo would tapper off and sales of the MAX would catch up, but looking at market share now, the Neo is showing no signs of wining, just to say that huge order from Indigo and it looks like 737s, is that like 40% market share. We\u2019ve also got news that Airbus maybe looking at a longer range version of A321 which may make it even more attractive. So, you\u2019ve always insisted you end up with 50-50 or approximately that, can you elaborate on where that\u2019s going and how you see that happening?","W. James McNerney","Dominic, you are breaking up a little bit. I think I got the question. Our view of where it will end up based on our discussions with customers based on our pipeline hasn\u2019t changed. I mean, you are right, we started a year-and-a-half behind the other guys. If you look at the trajectory of where we are at a similar point in time where they were, we are right, we are in a similar place. So the market share will be what market share will be, but our view hasn\u2019t changed on that at all.","Operator ","Our next question is from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Alwyn Scott \u2013 Reuters","Hi, good morning.","","W. James McNerney","Good morning.","Greg Smith","Good morning.","Alwyn Scott \u2013 Reuters","","Jim, it seems as though the partnering for success percentages that you stated a little earlier on the call haven\u2019t really changed much in the last few quarters. We keep hearing it\u2019s roughly a third are engaged, a third are sort of in the converting stage and a third, [you have] (ph) yet to engage. Can you explain why that \u2013 that\u2019s not \u2013 we are not yet seeing any real shift in getting more suppliers into the tent?","","W. James McNerney","Well, I didn\u2019t mean to leave the impression that we are not making progress, because we are. I think if you take a granular look, a number of partners have \u2013 are working with us on our partnering for success basis. So I didn\u2019t want to leave the impression we are not making progress, we are. And I think it would be fair to say that over the last three to four months that another 10% of our partners have started working with us a concrete basis. Maybe that\u2019s a better way to answer that question.","Greg Smith","Operator, we have one last question in the queue and we will take that now.","Operator","That\u2019ll be Steve Wilhelm with the Puget Sound Business Journal.

James McNerney","Well, I mean, it certainly is, we had a strong quarter, it really went across all the production programs. I mean, I haven\u2019t gone back and looked at whether it was a record or not, but it certainly goes to the focus that team has on driving the productivity and even to Jim\u2019s question prior on partnering for success and we are starting to see the benefit of that. So just solid execution across the board.","That concludes our earnings call. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002.
