Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations.","Robin Wilkey","Good morning and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO, Aflac Incorporated and President of Aflac US; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also joining us from Tokyo are Paul Amos, President of Aflac; and Tohru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan.","Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although, we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they\u2019re prospective in nature; actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter, as well as our operations in both the U.S. and Japan. And then I\u2019ll follow-up with a few financial highlights for the quarter and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Dan?","Dan Amos","Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am pleased that we met and in many cases exceeded our financial targets for the first quarter. Let me begin today with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. Pre-tax earnings in yen were up 4.6% on a reported basis and 1.5% on a currency neutral basis.","Sales of our third sector products in the first quarter were up 1.8%. This result is just slightly below our annual sales target and somewhat disappointing. Our focus this year remains on growing the sales of the third sector products.","Last quarter, we communicated our expectations that sales of first sector products would be down significantly, 60% in fact in the first quarter of 2014. This was based on difficult impact in the first quarter of 2014. This was based on difficult comparisons to prior year for sector sales, which climbed considerably ahead of the premium rate increase in April of 2013.","This quarter Aflac Japan\u2019s first quarter product sales of first sector products were down 67.6%, which significantly contributed to our overall and new annualized premium sales decline of 48.7%. However, we continue to expect that for the second through the fourth quarters of this year, the sales of the first sector products will be down slightly compared to last year and we still believe that will be the case.","Looking at the long-term sales growth opportunities, we remain encouraged as we continue to expand and develop distribution channels. This includes an agreement between Aflac Japan and Japan Post Holdings, which I believe will gradually but steadily benefit our cancer insurance sales in the coming years. As we ramp up the sales representatives at the 3,000 post offices that sale our products, I believe our 2014 expectations for Aflac Japan third sector sales to increase in the range of 2% to 7% is still reasonable.","Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. In the first quarter, Aflac U.S. pre-tax profit margin was 20.8% and pre-tax operating earnings were up 7.9% for the quarter. Aflac U.S. sales declined 4.4%, which was discouraging considering our results last year, uncertainty around healthcare reform implementation has prompted many business and consumer to postpone the decision related to healthcare coverage specially with the groups 50 or less.","However, amid this doubt and uncertainty, we believe the need for our products is just as compelling if not more than ever before. That\u2019s the message, we will continue to convey to businesses and to their employees. Additionally, I believe we have also executed -- we have not executed as well as we should have. This year we\u2019re taking several steps we think will help sales overtime, this includes a focus on recruiting and training in addition to performance management and improvement of our sales coordinators.","At the end of the [launch], we completed the initial test works of Aflac\u2019s exchange called Everwell. We are analyzing the first phase of the pilot program and are making adjustments to the platform based on those insights and field sales input.","Taking into account the strategic initiatives along with the challenging economic environment I continue to believe that Aflac U.S. sales will increase in the range of flat to up by a percent for the full year for 2014.","Turning to investments; I am pleased with the progress in the multi-year strategy to build out our investment division. Additionally we are on track to complete this build-out by the end of this year as we continue to make strides with the infrastructure, the people, the processes and the technology we are putting into place.","Now I\u2019m going to provide you an update on the consolidated financial performance which was strong for the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, operating earnings per diluted share rose 5.9% for the quarter. This result puts us slightly ahead of our annual target of 2% to 5% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency. However as the year progresses, we expect to see increased spending and higher benefit ratios than we experienced in the first quarter. As a result, we continued to believe we\u2019ll generate operating earnings per diluted share in the range of 2% to 5% on a currency neutral basis.","On an operating basis, our first quarter annualized ROE was 22.7%. Keep in mind, Aflac\u2019s ROE is sensitive to currency fluctuations because we are largely hedged our equity into dollars, but not all of our earnings. That means when the yen weakens, our ROE declines. Had the yen remained unchanged since the end of December, operating ROE would have been 26% in the first quarter. Based on our year-to-date returns, we expect to meet our ROE target range of 20% to 25% excluding the impact of foreign currency for the full year.","We remained committed to generating strong capital ratios, both RBC and SMR on behalf of our policyholders and our bondholders. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that first quarter 2014 RBC ratio will exceed 775%. Additionally we expect that Aflac Japan\u2019s estimated first quarter SMR will be above 750%.","You will recall we anticipated repatriating approximately a \u00a5100 billion in 2014. Given our strong capital ratios and risk mitigation strategies, we now anticipate repatriating \u00a5127 billion yen this year. This increase in repatriation bolsters our liquidity and flexibility and gives us the utmost confidence in this year\u2019s plan to repurchase $800 million to $1 billion for our common stock. It also allows us to focus more on positioning the SMR repatriation and repurchase for 2015.","For nearly six decades, Aflac has been delivering on our promise we made to be there for our policyholders when they need us most by paying clients fairly and promptly. We continue to believe we\u2019re well positioned in the two best insurance markets in the world. Our success in these markets has presented us with the privilege and the responsibility of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people who count on us to be there when they need us most and we have delivered on that promise.","Now I\u2019ll turn the program back over to Robin. Robin?","Robin Wilkey","Thank you, Dan. I\u2019d like to go over some first quarter numbers this morning, especially those related to the yen impact which was notable. I will start first with Aflac Japan beginning with the currency impact for the quarter. During the quarter the yen weakened against the dollar 9.8%. In reference to the top-line in the yen terms, revenues as reported were up 2.2%, while excluding the impact of currency; revenues were up 1.5% for the quarter.","Investment income, as reported, increased 9.4%. Excluding the weaker yen in the quarter on Aflac Japan\u2019s dollar denominated investment income, net income rose 4.5%.","In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to total revenues declined over last year going from 61.4% to 59.9% in the first quarter. Reinsurance impacted the benefit ratio by a negative 0.5% in the quarter. The improvement in the benefit ratio reflects typical seasonality, as it easily increases as the year progresses. Excluding the impact of the weaker yen, the benefit ratio for the quarter would have been 60.3%.","The expense ratio increased in the quarter to 18.1%, up from 17.1% in the first quarter of 2013. Reflecting the improvement in the benefit ratio, the pre-tax margin increased going from 21.5% to 22.0%. Excluding the impact of currency, the pre-tax profit margin for the quarter would have been 21.5%. With the expansion of the margin, pre-tax earnings increased 4.6% in yen terms. ","Excluding the impact of the yen, pre-tax earnings in the quarter increased 1.5%","Now let me turn to some numbers for Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 1.2% for the quarter and persistency was 73.8% compared to 74.7% a year ago. And looking at the other operating ratios, the benefit ratio for the quarter was 47.1% compared to 48.0% last year.","The operating expense ratio improved slightly going from 32.5% to 32.1%. The profit margin was 20.8% compared to 19.5% a year ago. Primarily reflecting the improvement in the benefit and expense ratio, pre-tax operating earnings increased from 3.6% last year to 7.9% this year in the quarter.","Now turning to some investment activity for the quarter, let me first start with Aflac Japan. Approximately 74% of new cash flow was invested in JGBs for a weighted-average yield of 1.51%. During the quarter, 26% or $1.1 billion of new cash flow was invested in U.S. securities for a weighted-average yield of 3.37%. As a result, the total new money yield in Japan for the quarter was 1.99%, up 47 bps from December 31 and down 104 bps from a year ago. The portfolio yield was 2.86% at the end of March, up 6 basis points from the end of December and 15 bps lower than a year ago. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 4.33%, up 1 basis point from December 31.","Turning to few other items in the quarter, non-insurance interest expense was $50 million compared with $48 million a year ago; parent company and other expenses $16 million compared to $17 million in the first quarter of last year. On an operating basis, the tax rate was 33.8% compared with 34.4% a year ago.","As reported, operating earnings per diluted share were $1.69, in line with a year ago. The significantly weaker yen decreased our operating earnings per diluted share by $0.10 in the quarter. Excluding the yen impact, operating earnings per diluted share would have increased 5.9%.","Lastly, let me remind you as Dan said, we\u2019re reaffirming our objective for 2014 of a 2% to 5% increase in operating earnings per diluted share excluding the impact of the yen. In this year, we estimate that 1 yen move on the average annual exchange rate will equal approximately $0.031 to $0.037 per diluted share. So, if the yen averages a 100 to a 105 for the full year, we would expect operating EPS of $6.06 to $6.40 per diluted share this year. For the second quarter using the same currency assumptions, we would expect operating earnings to be somewhere in the range of $1.54 to $1.68 per share.","I\u2019d also like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that our Annual Financial Analyst Briefing Meeting will be held in New York on May the 22nd, and we hope to see you all there.","Now we are ready to take your questions, but first let me remind you that to be fair to everybody, limit yourself to one initial question and only one follow-up that relates to that initial question.","Now we\u2019re ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan Chase","Hi, good morning. I had a question on Japan third sector sales, so obviously they slowed a lot from the roughly 16% growth you had in the fourth quarter and the big part of that is the slowdown in the medical products. So maybe if you could discuss what\u2019s going on there? And then related to that, how do you feel about the Post relationship and how that\u2019s taken off and that just what your expectations are for how fast you can ramp up cancer sales by the Post?","Dan Amos","","Tohru?","Tohru Tonoike","","Yes, let me begin with our sales of the medical products. We started, we offered the new medical product in the August last year and have been selling pretty well for basically the full year. And it continues to sell well, even in the early part of this year.","It is true that it does not sell as much as it used to be, but it\u2019s just still maintaining the momentum. And the first quarter is always a little bit slow quarter, because every year our agents tend to slowdown a little bit after that busy fourth quarter. And so, but we are feeling pretty confident with the expectation of our medical sales going forward.","And also that you asked about our expectation about the JP, Japan Post cancer product build up. And I can tell you that since October last year, when we expanded our operation with Japan Post, Japan Post and Aflac have been trying to build up the new level of the cancer business and we did it together and we have talked to each other and made an agreement how to do it and both Japan Post and Aflac are doing exactly what we have agreed.","So the basis is building up as we have planned. But because of the magnitude of the organization of the Japan Post, the rollout has been slower than we had expected but we are working on that. And now that April is the first month of their financial year, so they have entered into new stage in which the new things are started. For example, sale of the cancer product, Aflac cancer product now clearly defined as an important part of the Japan Post as business plan, so they have more clear vision of the importance of that cancer product among the Japan Post.","And also we expect that in addition to the Japan Post and the [compositions] company, will start working for us, as soon as their application for the new arrangement with Aflac is approved. So we are -- many good things, we\u2019re expecting many good things in the near future. But I can\u2019t tell you how soon we can do it, but we\u2019re feeling pretty comfortable about the way it\u2019s going.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan Chase","","Thank you.","Operator","John Nadel, Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Hey good morning everybody. Really a question for Kriss. Kriss you\u2019ve been, if I\u2019ve been following this correctly, I think you\u2019ve been trying to shift our focus on repatriation from Japan from what used to be more of an earnings driven level of repatriations to one that\u2019s more of a function of the capital ratios or SMR. So I guess the question is this, with the increase in your expected repatriation how should we think about what you guys are targeting for an SMR ratio if you allow for some stress and maybe more specifically the incremental \u00a527 billion how do we think about that in terms of the impact on the SMR in points?","Kriss Cloninger","Okay. So you\u2019re correct. I am trying to refocus the orientation of repatriation from FSA earnings toward the absolute level of the SMR. It\u2019s not to say that we ignore FSA earnings at all, John, but\u2026.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Yes, understood.","Kriss Cloninger","In making the decision to target a higher repatriation then originally projected, specifically a \u00a5127 billion instead of about a \u00a5100 billion house in Japan week before last and looking at projected SMRs as of the end of the first quarter and alike and concluded that if we kept about the same SMR that we had at December 31st, which was around 777 specifically not in the 750 to 775 range we could bring back about 25% more than we expected or the \u00a5127 billion number and still achieve that level of SMR.","Now you made the observation that what\u2019s our kind of risk adjusted SMR target I forget what the exact words you used were but it\u2019s not the 775 is our target SMR and that\u2019s got a cushion in it to allow for the fact that unrealized gains are substantial at the moment, what would the impact on the SMR be if interest rates went up some, what happens if we have some currency changes, what happens if credit spreads increase. And so we can absorb fairly a significant change in those factors and still stay above the what I\u2019ve called the core target which is going to be closer to 600%.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Perfect.","Kriss Cloninger","It might be even a bit below that. Now we\u2019re going to build out some of that John at the FAB meeting with the presentations Todd Daniels our Chief Risk Officer is going to make and Ken and I\u2019ll offer additional comments. But you\u2019re right on, we\u2019re trying to produce an appropriate level of repatriation, primarily in relation to where our capital ratios are.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Very helpful. Thank you Kriss. And then just one quick follow-up on the level of investment spending in the quarter and for the year. If memory serves you had expected about $0.12 or $0.13 of incremental investment spending in 2014 over \u201813 can you give us some sense for how much of that was in the 1Q numbers, it doesn\u2019t seem like much?","Kriss Cloninger","Well let me start and Eric may want to follow-up the $0.12 you mentioned was what I categorized as our headwind to increase in operating earnings per share on account of several investment related matters. One was lower yields than we started with at the beginning of last year because at the beginning of last year we put a lot of money into U.S. corporates in the first half of the year so we had a very good start on yield. This year we pulled back the second half of the year to invest more in JGBs, we restarted the U.S. corporates in the first quarter and I want Eric to comment on that.","But a combination of lower investment yields in the first part of the calendar year 2014 compared to 2013, of somewhat lower level of new cash flow because of the decline in the first sector sales also impacted that $0.12 estimate and a very little of it related to investment operating expenses.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","I appreciate that. I was actually referring more to this modernization type project you\u2019ve got underway particularly in Japan I\u2019m sorry.","Kriss Cloninger","","All right. The so called CVP project, yes I had estimated about $0.12 a share for that one also. So that\u2019s where I got confused, but\u2026","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Yes sorry. And my only point is it, it doesn\u2019t look like expenses really picked up very much at all in 1Q and just wondering if there was any portion of that $0.12 already incurred in 1Q?","Kriss Cloninger","","Yes, there was. What we budgeted in estimating the $0.12 for CVP was in fact incurred in the first quarter of 2014. So, our spending is inline with the budgets that underlie the financial estimates.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay. But is that more back half of the year loaded like is it $0.03 a quarter, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s $0.03 a quarter?","Kriss Cloninger","","I think it ramped up some, I don't specifically remember what it was by quarter. But I believe spending was scheduled to ramp up some throughout the year of 2014, but it was going to level out in 2015. So, it was like zero in the first quarter and $0.04 in the second third and fourth.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay.","Kriss Cloninger","We have some in the first.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Kriss.","Kriss Cloninger","","Okay.","Operator","Tom Gallagher, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Thanks. Hey Kriss one quick follow-up for you and then I had one on U.S. margins. So, the increase repatriation amount, can you just talk about planned uses of that? Is there the opportunity potentially upsizing the buyback for this year or should we think about that more for paying an upcoming debt maturity?","Kriss Cloninger","No, we\u2019ve already provided for the upcoming debt maturity. We took care of that with the bond issue last year. This additional repatriation increases our financial flexibility, I thank it gives us more confidence; we\u2019re likely to hit the high-end of the target on the share repurchase this year. But quite frankly, we just decided it last week and I really hadn\u2019t had a chance to simulate it with treasury team here.","But it increases our confidence; we can hit the upper-end of the share repurchase target. We already did for $15 million worth of $800 million to $1 billion target for the year. And we could have done more in the first quarter, but we want to keep some dry powder in case of market developments later in the year. So, I don\u2019t know, Ken do you have any\u2026","Ken Janke","The only thing I\u2019d add to that it\u2019s more likely that the additional repatriation will be warehoused in Columbus in the U.S. segment, but we have more than adequate dividend capacity if we elected later to send it to the parent company.","Dan Amos","","And the only other comment that I want to make is that we\u2019re well aware of how much shareholders feel about additional capital and that they\u2019d like to see it in the share repurchase. So, balancing that with what we\u2019ve always said about the dividend will be continued the way we operate going forward.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Okay, got it. And then my question on the U.S. is margins are strong there, looks like it was coming from the reduction in the size of future policy benefit reserves meaning there were some kind of reserve drawdown. Was that related to lapses or can you provide some color on what happened there?","Ken Janke","Yes, this is Ken. It was related to the change in persistency that\u2019s what largely drove it and you saw that also reflected in higher debt amortization. We also had lower operating expenses particularly general operating expenses and you know we\u2019ve commentated last year in the third quarter that we\u2019re undertaking some initiatives here to enhance our operations particularly in an enrollment initiative right now. And we haven't seen a lot of expenses associated with that yet. So, you will see that increase as the year progresses.","And the other thing that I\u2019d note in there is, you may remember last year we made some changes to our retiring medical and to moving from a defined benefit to a defined contribution plan for new hires. And as a result a lot of that savings flows through the U.S. segment and it\u2019s actually those savings that we had anticipated using this funding, the initiatives that we are working on the U.S. So again our expectation would be that we would see higher benefits in the next several quarters which is typically our seasonal pattern and we would also see greater spending on some of the strategic initiatives that we have outlined. The two highest priorities within those initiatives, I would say other than the enrollment that I mentioned are the Everwell exchange platform and then building out the sales distribution at Aflac group, so that we can better penetrate the large case market.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Thanks, Ken. And just one last follow up is the expectation that the higher [lapse], is that some you view that is a one off or are you seeing any evidence that that\u2019s going to remain alleviated for a while?","Ken Janke","So we always see at a bit, its always a bit lower in the first quarter but it\u2019s something that we are carefully monitoring. We continue to see some mixed economic data, and we don\u2019t know to what degree that maybe driving, but it\u2019s something that we are watching very closely.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks.","Operator","(Inaudible), I am sorry Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thank you. You may begin.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. I have a question on, excuse me the U.S. sales data and the change in recruiting agents and producing agents. So I believe this is the first quarter and about a year and half you\u2019ve got an increasing recruiting agents but the producing agent count continues to decrease rather sharply. Could you just comment a little bit on the dynamics of the producing and recruiting agents, thank you?","Kriss Cloninger","Let me start, and I am sure Dan is going to want to add something to this as well. We have really been focusing the carrier side of our sales force meaning our sales management throughout the country to focus on the recruiting activity and the 3% increase that we saw in the first quarter I think is just the reflection of really our redoubled effort on recruiting. What we need to do is the process is to bring new recruits in and then have them convert to producing agents then you get that through training and mentoring through the coordinator system. And that\u2019s the number that we are really focusing on turn. And we haven\u2019t seen it yet but we have seen other activities, for instance improvements in the number of new payroll accounts that we think will lead to better our producers as we go forward.","Dan Amos","Yes. I have been now watching the U.S. and getting very actively involved for the last nine months or so. And we have created some short term disruption for what I believe will be long term growth. The segmentation of the why we do business to where our field force is concentrating on a 100 or less our core broker which is more brokers to deal with what I call community brokers and then national brokers. And our ability to pay higher commissions to the management team for 100 or less, I think it is going to be very positive now. The way we do it is not on first year commission and some renewal commission. So they actually won\u2019t see the benefits until January of next year, I mean you just call out me telling I am going to give you $100 versus hand it to you. And so it has a little slower impact even though we are (inaudible) statements of whether it will be and things of that nature.","It takes a little while, but I do believe that there is great opportunity there for us. And I think the second quarter will still be down slightly, I want to be clear on that. But I think the second half, I am expecting it to be up. All that being said, we have got to execute well, we have got some problems on our own that we are working on, but I am encouraged because I believe with change comes disruptions but it also offers opportunity. And I believe there is lot of opportunities for us and we are working hard on doing that. And I believe ultimately we will prevail and see stronger growth, especially in the larger than 50 accounts because I think our individuals will continue to grow that business for us, but it would be actually easier to grow accounts 50 or more if we didn't have the field force, but I\u2019ve got to deal with the field force who are so important to us and they are key to our growth. But I have to work that through and it\u2019s just taking sometime. But I have been in talk to the vast majority of our field force, I\u2019d say 80% to 90% of the field force I have been in front of, talked to and I\u2019m encouraged by what I\u2019m seeing, but it\u2019s slower than I wanted to be. I\u2019m frustrated that it\u2019s taking longer than it is. But I do believe the fundamentals are there. And I could talk on and we\u2019ll cover it in more detail at the FAB Meeting, but just because of a lot of financial questions you want, I\u2019ll limit to that, but if you want to ask more, I\u2019ll be glad to answer.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks Dan. And I appreciate that commentary. If I could just ask one follow-up, maybe just on Japan and Japan Post. And I believe this quarter in terms of talking about the Japan Post ramp up, this is the first time that just in your prepared script you\u2019ve linked the 2% to 7% increase in sales with the ramp up of sales representatives in the 3,000 Japan Post offices. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile those comments with Tohru\u2019s comments that the roll out was slightly slower than expected. So, maybe if you could comment on that and if there is actually specific number of Japan Post cancer sales that\u2019s built into that 2% to 7% guidance number? Thanks.","Dan Amos","Absolutely, there is a number built in to the 2% to 7% with Japan Post, but they have specifically asked us not to discuss that and we have to hear to their request. But most definitely and I believe they will achieve what they\u2019ve told us. I generally found that to be true with all Japanese corporations. I saw it with [Daechi Life], I saw it with the bank channels I\u2019ve seen with all the groups that we\u2019ve dealt with that they come very close to meeting or exceeding the objectives that they set forth.","Saying that, remember all the new objectives were reset effective April the 1st with it being New Year for them. And so, I do expect them to make those numbers, because they are committed to it. They see it as a positive for them not just for us as they make decisions on what they are going to do in terms of going public or whatever. It\u2019s a big benefit to both us and to them. So, go ahead.","Robin Wilkey","And I would also remind you that the number of post offices almost doubled in March. So that\u2019s just occurred where we went from 1,500 post offices to 2,980.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Good morning everybody. Going back to that last discussion about the cancer product sales in the Japan Post, I guess I\u2019m still having a little difficulty reconciling a few of the previous statements where on the one hand we have the 2% to 7% growth guidance sale impact. On the other hand I think what was there in the past was that the Ever product and the impact from the August launch would bring by the second half of this year. And I believe Dan you also said that the cancer sale roll out would be gradual. I just, I have a very difficult time getting to the midpoint of it 2% to 7% growth range without much more substantial growth in cancer products. And I would be thankful for any additional color you could provide there?","Dan Amos","Well, what I would say is the actual number of counts or post office does not totally give you a number, because one office in (inaudible) is bigger than a 100 offices in other location. So, total number of offices won\u2019t directly tell you, but symbolically it begins to set the pattern for what we're talking about that we have doubled and that we\u2019re on the road to do this.","So, the other thing that Tohru mentioned is, it is not just the post office, but also the sales organization of the post office eventually selling with us. And when it will come online and how they will do it. They\u2019ve got which is compo; they have any normal sales force that is very, very strong in dealing with the consumers and exactly how that will come on. And all I can really tell you is that what I\u2019ve said in the fourth quarter is, is that we absolutely expect to achieve that number. And I wish I could give you more color on it, but that\u2019s part of doing business in Japan. As you may know or not know, one time people of other companies discuss something that was told not to do and it created enormous problems between the two companies.","So, we don\u2019t want any problems because we are working so well with them and appreciate. But we let me be clear, we don\u2019t get to go at our pace, we have to go with their pace, but their pace and our pace are the numbers reflected in the sales target that I gave you.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And then one follow-up on U.S. sales and persistency, usually when I look at persistency coming down it\u2019s some indicative of more of your shopping around in the turnover and you got sales hoping to be a bit lower, because you\u2019re not benefiting from lower persistency on the other hand. Could you maybe add some color there on what\u2019s hindering sales at this point?","Dan Amos","","Say that one more time?","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","","Sure. In the U.S., I\u2019m looking at persistency rates come down a bit even one year just for seasonality. Usually when you see some lower persistency, it often comes hand in hand with a bit more sales just because you see more turnover in accounts and more shopping around and we haven\u2019t really seen that in the sales number this quarter. So, I was curious maybe you could give us a little more color on what\u2019s been holding back sales?","Dan Amos","","Well, part of it is recruiting from the year before. There is no doubt in my mind that the recruiting has hurt us to a great degree, because there is enormous correlation between the number of new accounts, I mean the number of new recruits and the number of new accounts they open. And so, Tom, our Director of Sales has really been concentrating on ramping up the number of people that we hire.","Also one of the things is simply putting in these new programs in the separation; we\u2019ve had meetings that have disrupted us to a degree in terms of just short-term sales. But putting excuses aside, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a good enough job and we got to do better. I\u2019m not going to go blame a bunch of stuff except us. And we\u2019re going to pick it up and we\u2019ve got little problems here and there on everything, but I believe the economy is no worse than it was if not a little bit better. I believe the accounts over 50, they\u2019ve adjusted pretty much and there is no major change there.","It seems to be a little bit of a problem with the accounts of 50 and less because they are uncertain to some degree and of course that\u2019s where we write the majority of the business. But overall, I think we should be doing better and I\u2019m going to be expecting more in the second half.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. So, there is 0% to 5% growth target or guidance you\u2019re selling to?","Dan Amos","","I\u2019m still believing that. And as I said, I\u2019ll live for the fourth quarter; I mean second quarter to be down slightly. So, I don\u2019t want to mislead you. But I will be hard lived with it and end up saying, I warn you now, you don\u2019t have to tell them, they know it.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Bass, Citigroup. Your line is open.","Eric Bass - Citigroup","Hi, thank you. Just had a couple of follow-ups on sales in Japan, I guess first could you talk a little bit about the product cycle in Japan and if that\u2019s shortening at all? And I guess I was surprised a little bit by the sharp sequential drop off in medical sales, I would have thought this product in many ways is opening a new market for you, you still might have had a little bit of a longer sales cycle? And then secondly just on Japan Post, do you get any sense that agents maybe waiting to push the cancer product until the post exclusive product is rolled out later in the year?","Dan Amos","I can answer these, but I\u2019m going to let Japan answer, whoever wants to.","Tohru Tonoike","Yes. So first about the medical products of U.S. instead the product cycle is shortening in Japan. And yes that doesn\u2019t, but might be true to some extent, but we don\u2019t see the big difference in the paired which the new product continues to be successful though. I think we are still within a period in which the sale is still good. Like I said, we see some decline from the fourth quarter last year to the first quarter of this year, but still close to 20% of the growth is a good number and we will be maintaining that growth rate as long as possible. The competition is very hard. That is true. But I think we are very competitive in that and we will be able to maintain our share in that. And those are the -- Japan Post, if it\u2019s true that Japan Post wants to see the special product for them, but that doesn\u2019t hold them back from selling the existing products now. They now as I told you before that from the April 1st, the sale of the cancer product is included in their annual business plan. So they have a good reason to say make efforts to the sales of cancer plant today. So if we can offer them the new product specific to them that will be nice. But even now they\u2019re working very hard to expand their cancer business within their network.","Paul Amos","Yes. And one thing, this is Paul, one thing I\u2019d like to chime in and say, we\u2019re spending a good bit of time and resources on helping Japan Post get up to speed. As you remember back when we did the bank channel years ago, they took extended effort and that was for a smaller roll out in terms of total number of branches in the initial roll out. Here we\u2019re rolling out a massive number of larger offices in a short period of time. In fact, as of April 1st, we\u2019ve shifted 52 people over to work full-time on helping the post offices get up to speed. Now we know that\u2019s going to be a gradual ramp up. We\u2019re continuing to stay in front of each of the post offices and their sales staff to make sure it\u2019s most effective process.","In terms of product development, the reality is that we continue to keep our product development cycle moving as fast as possible. As you think about we\u2019ve launched our medical plan last year, we planned to launch another third sector plan this year if at all possible and we continue to negotiate with the government and other people to make sure that happens potentially in the latter half of this year.","Eric Bass - Citigroup","Great. Thank you for the color there. And if I could just ask one quick one on the investment portfolio, just what are you targeting now as a percentage of Japan cash flows to invest in U.S. dollar securities for 2014? And then should we still assume that that\u2019s primarily corporates at this point, or are you expecting to broaden asset classes over the course of the year?","Dan Amos","Before Eric says that, this is Dan, I want to make one other comment. With products changing so fast which they are faster that\u2019s the reason we need these additional funds for the computer update because things are changing new builds and whistles on products, new ways of doing things. So I just want to reiterate as you talk about these changing products and moving faster that\u2019s one reason the expenses have gone up in our IT systems to be able to do that. So, now Eric sorry.","Eric Kirsch","Thank you Dan. No problem. Relative to 2014, looking at the entire year and primarily focused on the Japan portfolio, we would expect as a percent of all Japan cash flows, the U.S. dollar allocation to be in the 35% to 40% range. It could go higher depending on market conditions and our tactical decisions but we would expect that and the remainder to be in JGBs. Relative to new asset classes, we are ramping up those efforts. That\u2019s always been part of our plan. I would acknowledge because of the volatility last year particularly with interest rates, we focused most of our resources and attention there. So the concept of the outsourcing in new asset classes did get slowdown but we\u2019re ramping up those efforts again this year. Having said, it takes much of research of different asset classes, the ones that did our risk appetite. it takes working with our partners and accounting and finance to get prepared for that.","So in terms of actual implementation in new assets, something could happen but it would be more likely to be towards the end of the year but I would certainly expect in \u201815 you\u2019ll hear more about that with respect to new asset classes.","And finally on the U.S. dollar allocation, and I think last quarter we talked about this and certainly at FAB I\u2019ll talk about this, no it\u2019s not going to be all in corporate securities. We\u2019ve broadened out our investment capability and we\u2019re thinking more tactically around markets. So when we think of the U.S. allocation, corporates fundamentally are very sound as you all I think would appreciate and agree from a credit standpoint. However, from a spread standpoint, technically speaking they\u2019re at all-time lows and continue to get tighter because demand in the market for yieldy assets is very, very high but because of that, we're actually using a mix of U.S. treasury securities and corporates in our U.S. dollar allocation with the thought being we\u2019d rather leave some dry powder for a later day. Now we\u2019re going to meet our NII budgets, which we have an eye on as well. But within that, we\u2019re going to use our discretion in terms of where markets are, spreads are, yield levels are to make tactical decisions within the asset class of U.S. dollars or frankly between U.S. dollars and JGBs as well. So that will develop through the year. But I think I\u2019d give you a good roadmap of our expectations absent any big volatility in the market that could change that.","Eric Bass - Citigroup","Great. Thank you.","Eric Kirsch","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Schwartz, Raymond James. Your line is open.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Hey, good morning everybody. Looking at U.S. sales some follow-ups. Dan, can you pin point maybe what territories or what areas of the country that you found to be most disappointing when looking at the sales in the quarter?","Dan Amos","I was -- I'm sitting here trying in my mind break it down. I think four are up and four down. I know the Southeast is down and I know that the North is up, the way we do it. I can\u2019t remember any of the specifics. But I do know those two particular ones. I know the Pacific, the number of recruits is way up and we're expecting that to continue. We\u2019ve had a couple of management changes, so that impacts us too, but I'm trying to think of anything else. But it's more this -- I look at more of the states than I do the territory itself and what's going on from that perspective. And the place we've got to see growth is got to be California, New York, Florida, Texas. The same states you think of in terms of winning of Presidential election is the big states with the population. It's not going to be the Georgia. I mean house penetration and population as South Dakota, they are not going to carry us over. They're great state and they\u2019re good example whereby to look to and that area of the country is doing very well. So I can mention them when I think about it. But it's got to be these metropolitan areas that have got to pull us for future growth. So, I\u2019ll give you more detail about at the Analyst Meeting. I\u2019ll break that out, getting broken out for you where you know more but I don\u2019t know more than that.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","That's okay. Just I know you don't want to lay blame anywhere but you\u2019ve got to wonder about, I got wonder about whether. Also on the number of agents, so one thing I noticed, maybe you could talk about this and I realize license sales agents isn\u2019t a key parameter, but they did fall dramatically despite the increase new including. And I'm wondering if there was a change there, if there was a calling or anything like that going on.","Ken Janke","Steven, this is Ken. We did have a calling, we periodically do parts our agent records for non-producers, we also had some that failed to take required training and those are naturally purged as well. So it would kind of a -- it was a clean up if you will of the ranks. And we don't do it annually, but we do periodically and because that it does get noticeable.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay. I'll stick to my two. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Finkelstein, Evercore. Your line is open.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","Hi, good morning. Kriss, if you said it, I missed it, I apologize, but what is the ratio of repatriation to expected year-end FSA earnings with the 127 billion of repatriation?","Kriss Cloninger","We had a gain on the reinsurance transaction during the FSA fiscal year ending March 31, 2014, that will be included in FSA earnings. The repatriation of a 127 billion lets\u2019 say it's probably going to end up being around 80% again including the reinsurance gain, but it will be close to a 100% excluding the reinsurance gain. Again, I want to reiterate that are more focused on SMR than FSA earnings, but those are the order of magnitudes of the repatriation relative to earnings.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","","I guess the question then becomes and maybe this is early and you\u2019ll talk about it more in a few weeks, but I mean are we heading upon a new normal or a higher kind of standardized level for repatriation that we should be thinking about?","Dan Amos","Well I hope so, its my intend to continue to decrease the difference between the FSA reported earnings and say U.S. statutory earnings, or U.S. statutory earnings are increasing at a more rapid pace than FSA earnings. I talk someone on the road about the difference between FSA and staff to reserves and how the more conservative assumptions and the like underlying the FSA reserves and factor we have to post full strength net level reserves on an FSA basis, drags down our FSA earnings in the year, we write a lot of new business and statutory gives us a little bit of breakthrough than actual technique call pulmonary term.","We\u2019ve just seeing significant increases in FSA reserves, our stab reserves and I think the stab reserves, we are satisfy with those adequate from an economic point of view, and probably more than adequate from an economic point of view. So I am working toward reducing the difference between stab and FSA reserves which improves, will improve our ability to repatriate.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","","Okay. And then just finally any additional updates or progress on I guess release reducing of statutory stream potentially through internal or external reinsurance agreement?","Dan Amos","Well, we will probably have reinsurance as a significant tool to help us reduce the change in the difference between FSA and stab. I am going to give you some additional information on FAB about that what progressions are, but roughly the projected increase would be about 60 billion yen next year and the difference, I think I can use some techniques to manage that difference down and to allow more of that to follow FSA earnings.","But again I am focused on the SMR more than earnings, but I am trying to manage our ability to repatriate up by creating a stronger and a more stable solvency margin, one that\u2019s less subject to volatility and I think the reinsurance agreement we did this year, the other actions we took to minimize volatility and SMR give you an indicator as to why we were comfortable increasing repatriation this year and that is one of our management objectives.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","","Okay, thank you.","Robin Wilkey","I think we are coming to the top of the hour. So we have time for one more question.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath, UBS. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to go back to one of the responses to previous question, Dan I think in describing the U.S. sales force and all the dynamics. You may have comment I will try to pair phrase it, something like it would be easier to grow in the 15 over market without the field force. And I didn\u2019t quite understand what you meant by that, can you describe that in a little bit more detail?","Dan Amos","Sure I would be glad to, what I am saying is that our field force is key to our business and as we deal with larger accounts broker don\u2019t like to necessarily deal with our field force, but our field force is what build our company we have to keep them. So there is conflict between brokers and field force, so m to constantly keep the field force writing the accounts of 100 or less especially new people that are getting into business.","And I can give you this is example, it\u2019s kind corny but it\u2019s a true story, I mean true example, if I have said to you, I am going to take you fishing and I am going to take you and you can fish in this lake and you will catch all the fish you want. But none of them will be bigger than a pound, but you\u2019ll leave with all you want or I\u2019ll take you over here and you can fish in this lake and you can catch a few, but there is a 10 pounder in there, almost everybody wants to go to the lake and try to catch the 10 pounder. That\u2019s true with the sales force you hire a new person, they all want to go land the big account, but the fact is they will make a live in and they will be able to eat and do what they need to do on writing the one pounders or the small accounts. And trying to create that wage creates conflict and trying to keep them to do that.","Because most of the time, our associates are going to do great with a 50 or less or 100 or less. But they are going to land the big ones, but brokers tend to land the bigger ones. So, is a disruption, before we just say go out and call on anything you want do whatever you want to do. And now we try to move them to the younger through call me smaller accounts through compensation. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. ","Suneet Kamath - UBS","","Got it, okay. And then my follow up, is just if I think back to the history of Aflac U.S. when you had these sort of issues in terms of managing the field force. My recollection is it always seems to take a little bit longer to correct than maybe some of us think. Do you think that is potentially the case this time? Or do you think that, you could really get on top of this and really get to that 0% to 5% for this year?","Dan Amos","Well, I wouldn\u2019t say it, if I didn't think it. I think it\u2019s going to be top. But I\u2019ve always found a way to win and my age makes no difference, I\u2019d say I\u2019m working harder and actually I\u2019m enjoying it. There is lot of the strategies we\u2019re putting in place are doing were carry over for things that have been going on in the past. It\u2019s just the changing environment, it\u2019s not that our strategies were wrong, it\u2019s just things are changing.","So, I still believe that I tell you I mean that\u2019s why I said the second quarter is going to be down slightly. So, I\u2019ll give you more inside into that at the FAB Meeting. But again, I believe with change comes opportunity. And I wouldn\u2019t swap our U.S. market in our potential for anybody else out there. I mean I don\u2019t want to be in the life insurance, I don\u2019t want to be in a property casually. I still think our markets got the biggest potential. And I think we\u2019re in the right place.","And final thing I would say is we\u2019re ending this call is we are a written trashy business either. The one thing that\u2019s the undercurrent of everything we\u2019re doing right now is look at the margins, look at the business we\u2019re riding, we\u2019re making sure that what we put on the books is good business and you don\u2019t have to come back three years from now and say yes, you wrote all those sales increases. But they didn't end up being profitable and we\u2019re not doing that.","So, we\u2019re being cautious and making sure as we take on new markets and new things, that we ultimately protect the shareholders and make sure we give a good value to the policyholders.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","","Understood. Thanks Dan.","Dan Amos","","Alright.","Robin Wilkey","","Thank you everybody for joining us. If you have further questions (inaudible) and we have to see you all at our Analyst Meeting on May 22nd. Thanks so much. Bye, bye. ","Operator","","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations.","Robin Y. Wilkey","Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of U.S. Operations; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President, Chief Global and Investment Officer; and Toru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan, is joining us today from Tokyo.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some statements in the teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of the federal securities law. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discussed today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.","Now, I'll turn to program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter in our operations in Japan and the United States. I will then follow up with a few financial highlights for the quarter in the first 9 months, and then we will be glad to take your questions. Dan?","Daniel P. Amos","Thank you, Robin. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a review of AFLAC Japan, our largest earnings contributor. We were again pleased with AFLAC Japan's strong financial performance and phenomenal sales momentum that continued into the third quarter. Following 2 years of tremendous sales growth, new annualized premiums, sales rose 31.7% to JPY 55.7 billion in the third quarter. These results significantly surpassed our expectations again, and marked the fifth straight quarter of record sales production. For the first 9 months of the year, AFLAC Japan's total annualized premium sales in yen rose 43.4%.","Record sales growth, combined with continued strong persistency, contributed to AFLAC Japan's double-digit increase in premium income for the third quarter. Premium income increased 10.7% to JPY 346 billion. Revenue growth was also strong in the quarter, rising 10% to JPY 404 billion. Pretax earnings were JPY 78 billion, down 1.4%; and for the 9 months, pretax earnings were JPY 238 billion, up 1.4%.","The bank channel generated JPY 26.9 billion in sales, which represented an increase of 85.3% over the third quarter of 2011. The bank channel accounted for 48.6% of AFLAC Japan's total new sales in the quarter.","From a product perspective, WAYS, our unique hybrid whole-life product, continued as our top seller in the third quarter, generating an increase of 108% over 2011, and accounted for 50% of the total third quarter sales.  Our sales management team has done an excellent job ensuring the transition from 5-pay WAYS to 10-pay WAYS has gone smoothly through all distribution channels. Additionally, sales of 10-pay WAYS in the quarter was much stronger than we originally anticipated.","Sales for the medical category was also strong, rising 11.7% in the third quarter and benefiting from July's introduction of the revised nonstandard medical product.","Given the current low interest rate environment, we continue to employ strategies to enhance the profitability of our child endowments and WAYS products. In the third quarter, all distribution channels stopped selling 5-pay WAYS. Beginning this week, we lowered the interest rate credit from  0.5% -- from 1% to 0.5% for discounted advance premium or DAP. This credit essentially increases the total premium paid.  The profitability of WAYS and child endowment will be enhanced in April of 2013 when we lower the assumed interest rate for new product pricing.","Considering AFLAC Japan's very strong sales results for the 9 months, we think sales could be challenged for the remainder of the year. We anticipate the additional sales growth hurdles in the fourth quarter will come from consumers' response to the lower credit given for the DAP. And as a result, we expect sales to be in the range of flat to up 15% for the quarter. Taking all that into account, we now expect 2012 Aflac Japan sales to rise 30% to 35% year-over-year.","But let me say that even before the fourth quarter began, my mind had already shifted to 2013, and the challenges we faced following 5 straight quarters of record-breaking sales results. I want to point out that the bank channel represents a larger portion of our business, so projecting future sales results becomes more challenging. Also, we won't gain insight into 2013 bank sales strategies until closer to the start of AFLAC -- of Japan's fiscal year, which starts April 1.","Although marketing plans for Aflac Japan are being finalized for 2013, we already see some challenges on the horizon. We know that Aflac's brand is strong throughout Japan, and this enhances the appeal for our products. For the last 2 years, as all of you know, our sales has been spectacular due to the WAYS and child endowment products, particularly through banks. During that time, investment yields have been lower, thus putting pressure on the profitability of these products. As I've said earlier, we started implementing adjustments to improve profitability, including the reduction in DAP that went into effect early this week. More importantly, in 2013 with the rate increase going into effect on new policies due to lower assumed interest rates, I think you're likely to see sales slow down, but generate higher profitability, which would create higher profit margins for Aflac Japan going forward.","Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. continued to perform very well this year. Although new sales growth has been constrained, our top line growth has been consistently strong through the year, and large part reflecting an improved persistency with each quarter. We believe there are a couple of reasons for this improvement. First, with the economic uncertainty over the last several years, workers have been reluctant to switch jobs and people are more likely to keep the benefits they currently have. Secondly, we've enhanced communication with the policyholders at important touch points, and we know this has resulted in better policy retention. I also think we've done a good job in managing the U.S. operation, including budgets and people resources. Our benefit and expense ratios are lower than a year ago, resulting in stronger pretax operating earnings. Aflac U.S. revenues grew 5.2% for the quarter and 5.2% for the first 9 months. Pretax earnings were up 21.5% for the quarter and 11.5% for the first 9 months. Premium income increased 5.2% for the quarter and 5.3% for the first 9 months. Aflac U.S. annualized premium sales declined 1.5% for the quarter; however, for the 9 months of the year, sales growth was positive with total new annualized premium sales rising 1.5%.","We continue to see the economic landscape in the U.S. as challenging, especially for small business segment, where more than 90% of our products are sold. Although the most recent government data shows that unemployment rates improved slightly, small business continue to hold back on hiring. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, which focuses on small business owners, reported this month that fewer jobs were created in September than in the 2 previous months. Additionally, the percentage of small business owners, who plan to create new jobs in the future, is historically at weak level.","We have continued to make structural changes to our marketing and sales area to maximize our future growth. While these changes have been more disruptive in the short term than we originally anticipated, we believe this will enhance our long-term results.","With the election less than 2 weeks away, many business owners are reluctant to make changes in their benefit programs until there is greater clarity in the U.S. economy outlook. With the uncertainty in 9 months of results, I think it's likely that Aflac sales for 2012 will be roughly flat.","Having updated you on our operations, let me give you some details related to our Global Investment division. For the last several years, our primary focus has been on investment risk management while investing our significant cash flows in assets of relatively higher quality and liquidity. As you know, we made considerable progress in proactively derisking our portfolio over the last 4 years to enhance the strength of our balance sheet. In the process, we've significantly reduced our exposure to perpetual securities, peripheral European sovereign debt and financials, especially in Europe. In fact, we reduced our exposure in these categories by $1.4 billion during the quarter, and $3.8 billion year-to-date, which further improved the overall quality of the portfolio.  Impairments were relatively small in the quarter; however, the European market still represents an area of potential risk and we remain cautious. But I am convinced we are much better positioned to accommodate that volatility as a result of the derisking efforts.","As we have stated for many years, our greatest investment challenge has been to invest Aflac's significant cash flows at reasonable investment yields. Our recently employed U.S. corporate bond program has been effective means of enhancing our new money yields in Japan. You'll recall that our initial objective was to invest JPY 200 billion, or about $2.5 billion, in U.S. dollar denominated, publicly-traded corporate bonds and unhedged currency risk.  We completed that pilot program in the third quarter and are very pleased with the results it generated. In the third quarter, the new money yield on the corporate bond program was 3.6%. Aflac Japan's total new money yield for the quarter was 2.76%. These yields do not reflect hedging cost for the program, which was 41 basis points.","Based on the success of this program and market conditions, we plan to invest 2\/3 of Aflac Japan's fourth quarter cash flow. This successful investment program allows Aflac Japan to surpass our budget in new money yield for 2012 of 2.05%. It also enhances the profitability of our more interest-sensitive products and benefits next year's investment income growth.","Finally, I'm pleased with the continued progress in the transformation of our Global Investment division. We continue to grow our investment team, build new infrastructure support, develop new investment strategies with the elements of our recently completed strategic asset allocation projects. We believe these efforts will improve the risk return profile for our balance sheet and further our objective as a world-class investment operation.","Now, I'll turn to Aflac's consolidated financial performance.  Operating earnings per diluted share were better than expected, rising 7.3% to $1.77 for the quarter. There was no impact from foreign currency in the third quarter. It's important to note that even without a lower effective tax rate, operating earnings per share would have been right in line with our objective and guidance.  For the 9 months, operating earnings per diluted share rose 5% before the effect of the yen. Net earnings in the third quarter of 2012 included after-tax realized investment gains of $186 million or $0.39 per diluted share compared with after-tax losses of $34 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011.  I am pleased the investment strategies we've implemented have improved the quality of investment portfolio and benefited the bottom line.","I'm also pleased that our capital ratios remain strong, which demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength and flexibility. Although we've not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that the RBC ratio was between 575 and 600 at the end of September. We expect Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio remain at the high-end or above our 500 to 600 target.","Given the strength of our capital ratios and our parent company's liquidity, we believe we can allocate up to $100 million toward the purchase of our shares in the fourth quarter. Purchasing shares later this quarter won't have much impact on 2012 earnings per share growth, but it will benefit us in 2013. I'll also stress that we've been prudent. In any decision we make, we'll certainly taking into account challenges within the macroeconomic environment, especially as it relates to Europe.","As we have frequently discussed, profit repatriation went into primary source for funding share repurchase. You may remember from our second quarter call in the Tokyo Analyst Meeting that we expect profit repatriation to be around JPY 65 billion for 2013. We still believe that's a reasonable estimate assuming that we have no additional investment losses that would reduce Aflac Japan's operating income. Next year's profit repatriation could provide us with significant amount of capital that could be deployed with share repurchase.","I was very pleased that the Board of Directors approved the 6.1% increase in the quarterly cash dividend effective with the fourth quarter payment. This marks the 30th consecutive year we've increased cash dividend to the shareholders. We continue to believe that we are well-positioned to achieve our stated earnings objectives of 3% to 6% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign currency.","In the second quarter, we have guided toward the low end of the range. However, reflecting the lower annual effective tax rate, we now expect operating earnings for 2012 to be better. If the yen average is JPY 80 to the $1 for the last 3 months of the year, we expect reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.51 per diluted share.","Under the same exchange rate assumptions, we expect the full year operating earnings to be $6.58 to $6.63 per diluted share, which would be roughly a 4% to 5% increase on a currency-neutral basis. We believe this is reasonable and achievable. Importantly, we continue to believe that 2013's operating earnings per share will increase 4% to 7% on a currency-neutral basis.","In addition to operating earnings growth, we also focused on producing industry-leading return on equities. On an operating basis, the third quarter ROE was 25.2%. For 2012 and 2013, we continue to believe it's reasonable to see operating ROE in the area of 22% to 26%. We remain focused on our vision of being the leading provider of voluntary insurance in the United States and the #1 provider of supplemental insurance in Japan. In both segments, I am confident in our brand, the fundamental needs of our products, and more importantly, the success of Aflac. Overall, I believe we had the best quarter since 2008.","Robin?","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thank you, Dan. Now let me start with a few financial highlights. First with Japan. Beginning with the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 10.0% for the quarter, which is the first time we've had double-digit growth in revenues since 1997. Investment income was up 3.7%, and the persistency rate improved in the quarter. The annualized rate including annuities for the first 9 months of 2011 was 94.8% compared with 94.4% a year ago.","In terms of operating ratios for the quarter, the benefit ratio to total premiums increased over last year as a result of the impact of first sector products, primarily the WAYS product. It was 73.1% in the quarter compared to 70.0% a year ago. The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.1%, down from 18.8% in the third quarter of 2011, reflecting the lower commission cost associated with strong sales of first-sector products, primarily WAYS. Reflecting the higher benefit ratio, the pretax profit margin decreased from 21.6% to 19.3% in the quarter. Pretax earnings decreased 1.4% in yen terms for the quarter.","Now let me turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 5.2% for the quarter. The persistency rate continued to improve in the quarter. Annualized rate for the 9 months was a record 76.9%, up from 75.9% a year ago. In looking at the operating ratios for the quarter, the benefit ratio to total premiums decreased over the last year, going from 56.8% in the quarter, compared to 59.1% a year ago.","The lower benefit ratio for the quarter is largely the result of lower paid and incurred claims experienced during the quarter. The operating expense ratio decreased slightly going from 31.5% a year ago to 31.2%.","Benefiting from lower benefits and expense ratios, the profit margin expanded to 18.4% compared to 16.0% a year ago. As a result, pretax operating margins increased 21.5% for the quarter.","Now, let me turn to investment activity for the quarter, starting with Aflac Japan. For the third quarter, approximately $2.5 billion of new cash flow was invested in the corporate bond program for a gross yield of 3.6%, and a hedge cost of 41 basis points. The yield, net of hedge cost, was 3.19%. For the quarter, total new money cash flow invested in Japan was $5.2 billion. The gross total new money yield for that cash flow was 2.76%. The yield for the total new money, net of hedging, was 2.56%. That gives you the hedging cost for the total portfolio of 20 basis points.","The weighted average duration of the forward contracts executed this quarter is 5 months and range from 3 to 6 months. During the quarter, approximately 55% of the corporate bond purchases have a maturity of 8 to 10 years, and 45% have a maturity of 18 to 30 years.","Approximately 44% of new cash flow was invested in JGBs in the quarter for an average yield of 1.72%.","The portfolio yield at the end of the quarter was 2.8%, down 26 basis points from the end of June, and 58 basis points lower than a year ago. According to Bloomberg, 20-year JGBs during the quarter were 78 basis points, a 6-basis points decrease from June.","Additionally, to enhance our investment income, this quarter we executed on a 6-month securities lending program, involving approximately $6.5 billion of assets from the Japan portfolio. All of these assets were JGBs.","Now let me turn to U.S. investments. The new money yields for the quarter was 3.94%, a decline of 43 basis points from June 30, and 183 basis points from a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of September was 6.51%, down 8 basis points from the second quarter, and 21 basis points from a year ago.","Turning to some other items in the quarter. Noninsurance interest expense in the third quarter was $45 million compared to $44 million a year ago. Total company pretax operating margins decreased, reflecting the increase of the benefit ratio in Japan caused by the increased sales of the ordinary line of business. Parent company and other expenses increased only slightly from $14 million to $15 million in the third quarter.","Also in this quarter, the company revised its estimate of the full year effective tax rate, resulting in an increase of operating earnings of $17.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share. The company also recognized a tax benefit of $29.5 million or $0.06 per share, primarily from a favorable outcome of a routine tax exam for the years 2008 and '09. The total impact of these items was $47 or $0.10 per diluted share.","Going forward, we expect the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year and 2013 to be somewhere between the range of 34.0% to 34.5%, assuming FSA earned premium is flat year-over-year.  The pretax margin went from 19.4% to 18.2%, and on an operating basis, the tax rate was 31.3% compared to 32.6% a year ago.  Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $2.16 compared to $1.57 in 2011.","Lastly, let me comment on our earnings outlook for '12. As you heard, we raised our outlook for '12 to increase operating earnings per diluted share. If operating earnings per share increased between 3% and 6% in the fourth quarter and the yen average is 80% for the remainder of the year, we would expect operating EPS to be between $1.46 and $1.51. That compares with current first-call estimates of $1.53. This estimate reflects our plans to substantially increase IT expenses and expenditures related to marketing and advertising in the fourth quarter. Additionally, if you back out the $0.10 operating earnings benefited from the tax items during the quarter, reported operating earnings per diluted share were at $1.67, which would be right in line with our guidance, as Dan said. Using the same foreign currency as such and we would expect full year operating earnings to be somewhere in the range of $6.58 to $6.63 per diluted share.","Now, we're going to be glad to take your questions. To be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to one question, and only one follow-up that relates to your initial question. We're ready to begin, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is on capital. With the JPY 65 billion repatriation estimate, are you expecting to retain any of that capital in your U.S. sub or should all of that make its way to the parent? Also, you discussed an initiative to monetize some of the deferred tax assets in the U.S. that you may have invested out, [ph] can we also get an update as to where you stand on that initiative?","Kenneth S. Janke","Nigel, this is Ken. Right now, as we've mentioned, the JPY 65 billion, we still believe, is a reasonable estimate for next year's profit repatriation. We currently anticipate returning to our normal dividend policy for Aflac U.S. up to the parent company to support the quarterly cash dividend payment and other parent company obligations. In terms of funding the share repurchase activities that we've anticipate for 2013, I think the combination of, and our ability to further dividend upstream, plus the liquidity that we have on hand, would enable us to do that. We were sitting at approximately $950 million of cash at the parent company level at the end of September after dividend payments and $100 million of repatriations in the fourth quarter -- or excuse me, repurchase in the fourth quarter, will probably around $785 million of cash at the end of the year. As far as the DTAs  go, we have generated gains this year. Unfortunately, the gains that we've generated have gone against the taxable losses that we've incurred as part of the derisking activities and selling assets at a loss. We're still looking at, actually, a couple strategies that we think will help address the DTA issue going forward, but we still have a little more work to do on those.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Schuman of KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could update us on the current marginal profitability of WAYS, because you changed the rate on DAP. You've implemented the new money strategy. You discontinued 5-pay WAYS. There's several things going under that should enhance the marginal profitability, but I was wondering if you could give us a read there, please.","Daniel P. Amos","It definitely has. I'm going to get Kriss to cover that.","Kriss Cloninger","Okay. Jeff, I'd kind of lead you back to what we reviewed at the Analyst Meeting in September in Tokyo, the information we laid out on the presentation at that time showed what the impact on profitability would be on the current core products, with current core pricing -- current core product pricing, if we were able to achieve an increase in, say, interest assumption on investment assets from, say, 2% to -- 2% to 2.25% or 2.5%. And those charts showed that at 2% interest new money, we'd have a profit margin on WAYS that range from 8 to 12. If we achieved an increase to 2.25%, then I think we'd expect that margin to go up to 13 to 17. And if we could get 2.5%, we'd go up to 17 to 21 expected profit as a percent of premium over the life of the contract. So with the new investment program, we've had some real positive impact on our ability to enhance new money yields. That being said, for the short term, some of that increase in new money yields is going to be offset. And I mentioned this in Tokyo again to try moderate the excitement a little bit, some of that increase in new money yields is going to fund the increase in investment expenses for personnel and infrastructure, et cetera, associated with the new investment team, and that'll dampen things for, say, 6 months to a year a bit. But it is a long-term improvement in profitability, and that will be important. Now, we did, October 22, decrease the credit and interest rate on the discounted advance premium from 1% to 0.5%. That basically gives us an extra 50 basis points on the funds held under that program. And the funds held under that program basically represent half the total premium ever collected on the contract, because we collect total premiums due during the contract on day 1. And just for example, on the 10-pay WAYS, we'd collect first full 10 premiums.  We would apply the first premium to the policy the day we collected it. So on balance, we'd have 9 premiums on deposit for the next 9 years; on average, we'd have 4.5 premiums on deposit and an extra 50 basis points, which gives us roughly an extra 2.25% of premium profit over the life of that particular contract. So things are headed in the right direction is all I can tell you.","Daniel P. Amos","And then in April, we'll have the --","Kriss Cloninger","You'll have the potential repricing when the standard interest rates decline to 1%, and we'll definitely have repricing activity. At that time, we'll try to watch what competition is doing. We don't want to give ourselves a competitive disadvantage in the market. But I believe that clearly, the premium rate changes associated with the decline and the assumed valuation interest rate in Japan for reserves will tend to increase premium rates, and that will take effect on April 1, 2013.","Daniel P. Amos","And I want to make one comment about our sales force. I am so impressed with Aflac Japan's sales force to -- especially the bank channel, to adapt to these things. To say, \"Nu-uh, we're not going to take profit margins at these ranges. We want higher profit margins. And we're stopping 5-pay WAYS. We're doing discount advance premiums. \" And of course, the sidebar is, what a great job our investment team has come up with the higher interest rates. And then also in April, we're going to see these things. It has been a wonderful job, on Toru's part and that management team, for what they've done to adapt. Because this is a change. We never used to have to do it like this, and now  we're going to vary to make sure we make our profits and do the things we need to do.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's all helpful and obviously, the new money re-piece [ph] is kind of a moving target, dynamically. But kind of all in at this point, it sounds like maybe current margins are more kind of mid-teens up from more like 10% earlier, is that just kind of a fair return [ph]?","Kriss Cloninger","They are [indiscernible].","Daniel P. Amos","They are there before the investment expenses, they're there now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMC.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a question on the Japan new money yield. Obviously, it picked up a decent amount. I think it was around 1.97 last quarter, 2.76 in Japan this quarter. Assuming a stable environment from here, what's your expectation for the new money yield? Obviously, you're still shifting your investment allocation and that should help, but credit spreads have come in as well over the past few months. So just, like either more specific, or just directionally, do you expect it to improve from here or decline a little bit?","Eric M. Kirsch","If the...","Daniel P. Amos","This is Eric.","Eric M. Kirsch","If the market stays stable in terms of current interest rates in the U.S. and Japan, spread levels around where they are, on an absolute basis, we would expect our yields to go up. Because as we disclosed, our plans right now, subject to market conditions, are to invest about 2\/3 of fourth quarter cash flow in a similarly-structured corporate bond program hedged back to yen. So because the proportion of our new money would go to that program, based on current market conditions, the yield would go up versus last quarter whose, of course, yields had gone up from the prior quarter because we're investing 1\/3 in that corporate program. So by and large, we would expect it to go up. Current forecast would be about, and this after a hedging cost of around 2 60  or so. But again, market rates can change, spreads change. So that's just a rough estimate based on what we know today.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Finkelstein of Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I want to talk about just the core kind of Cancer and medical sales in Japan. Sales were down about 3% to 4% year-over-year, flattish sequentially. You did have the product introduction of Gentle EVER, which usually does provide some form of a sales surge. And I guess I'm just curious about what is the outlook for sales in those products? And can you give some background or color on the competitive landscape?","Daniel P. Amos","Toru, do you want to take that? Do you want me to? How do you want to do this?","Toru Tonoike","Yes, I'll take that. Yes, you're right. The sales of the Cancer and the medical combined is -- has declined during the third quarter a little bit. But this is better than the second quarter, you may have noticed. The second quarter, it was down by 8.7%. Now, the third quarter was down by 3.6%. This increase is because of the good -- very good sales of the new Gentle EVER, which we introduced this quarter. So with that very strong sales of this new product, and also that we are planning to introduce some promotion majors in the coming fourth quarter to enhance the sales of the both Cancer and medical. So we are rather hopeful that we would see the better sales of these 2 products combined in the fourth quarter.","Daniel P. Amos","And Gentle EVER accounted for 30% of EVER sales in the quarter.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess my follow-up would be, you're expecting sales to be flat to 15% in Japan. Is there any color you can give specifically on kind of the Cancer medical component? And whether you expect that to be up, flattish -- what's the outlook?","Daniel P. Amos","Toru?","Toru Tonoike","Yes. I think I cannot give you the specific numbers as to the -- our expected sales of the Cancer and the medical combined. But we are trying to move that sales up to the flat, or hopefully, positive into the fourth quarter, but it depends on how successful our promotion will be.","Daniel P. Amos","Yes. I want to remind you that one thing that gives you a harder picture to follow is just remembering that WAYS is 9x more than the price of the medical product -- than the medical products, and even endowment is 3x more. So the number of policy sales look better. And remember that our Cancer product is 20% cheaper than it was because the changes we had in it. So actual policy sales look a little better than the premium sales numbers do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath of UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just had a question, I guess for Eric, on the new investment strategy. I think the way that you described it in Tokyo was -- I'll simplify, to a bit of a trade-off between greater liquidity versus a higher rollover risk in terms of the hedges. So I guess I'm just curious, given that you're investing so far, 10 years plus, are you worried about this rollover risk on these currency forwards that are much shorter in duration?","Eric M. Kirsch","The way I would phrase it is it's a matter of risk management and a matter of having a macro view of the economy, short-term interest rates. So it is something that we have to look at very carefully, and there are variety of different hedging strategies we can employ over time. So today, am I worried? No. I don't think -- I think there is very little risk from a macro perspective, that U.S. interest rates go up any time or that Japan short-term interest rates change. Over the long term, those dynamics will change, and we will adjust our hedging strategies appropriately. And as you recollect in Japan, we talked about over time using forwards, cross-currency swaps.  We could use longer rolling forwards. I'd also keep in mind that when we employ these strategies, we stress test them against our capital ratios and take a number of factors into account. I'd also say over time, we may not always buy in corporate hedge, we may buy other asset classes that are yen-denominated, et cetera. So it is absolutely something that's important, but it's another risk factor amongst many, and you'll see our program continue to develop and become more sophisticated as the amount of assets we deploy, and it continued to grow.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then, I guess my follow-up is just in terms of the accounting for this, I think you're taking the mark-to-market of the hedge through net income, so presumably, we might see some more volatility in realized investment gains and losses. So I just want to make sure that that is an accurate statement. And then I guess related, how does this impact your statutory results in terms of cash flow testing? Again, you're getting this cash, it's in dollars, and you have -- you're hedging the yen. But when you do your cash flow testing, how are you sort of factoring in potential changes and cost of hedges and those sorts of things?","Kriss Cloninger","I'll start out with it. The accounting that we will be utilizing, consistent with GAAP, will take the change in the fair value of the hedges through net realized gains and losses. And the cost of the hedging will be reflected in that line item of the financial statement. That being said, that will be the accounting presentation. The economic evaluation of the profitability of the business, in my mind, will have to be  a net of the anticipated cost and the actual cost of the hedging. So I don't want you to get confused to say, \"Well, these guys aren't looking at the economics or looking at the accounting. \" Because I'm not going to worry about geography when I'm evaluating economic profitability, and I'll just say that. Now, we'll have to reflect the potential implication of the hedging activities and our cash flow analysis that we use for both the actuarial evaluation of reserve adequacy on both U.S. statutory and on an FSA reporting basis. And that will involve using the same type of stochastic processes that we currently use in evaluating cash flows, cash flow adequacy and the like. So all that will be baked into the normal cash flow testing process we go through, effective this year end.","Kenneth S. Janke","Suneet, I'd add just a couple of things.  This is Ken. First, I think one of the ways you can think about this, in the way that we're hedging using forwards as opposed to cross-currency swaps is that the system looks similar to the reversible currency securities, you'll recall, that we had purchased for many years, meaning that we're not hedging the coupon. We're collecting the coupons in dollars and we'll have the flexibility to either reinvest in dollars, or convert those coupons to yen and reinvest in yen. What we're really hedging is the balance sheet risk. So that the securities, the book value of those securities, their marked value don't fluctuate with currency changes. They'll fluctuate with credit changes, interest rate changes, but we're protecting it from currency changes. And the reason we're doing that is really because of the solvency margin ratio in Japan. And interestingly enough, the treatment of these securities, on an FSA basis, is actually favorable compared with buying straight yen-denominated, privately-issued securities that we used to buy.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Understood. I get the focus on the economics. But just based on what Kriss was saying about the cost of the hedges being below the line, I mean, aren't you effectively overstating your operating earnings if you're getting the benefit of the strategy through net investment income, but you're carrying the cost of the hedge below the line?","Kenneth S. Janke","Well again, we're not hedging the coupons. We are hedging the balance sheet, really, not the coupons. But again, to your point, and as we discussed when we think about value -- to the extent that these securities are going to support policy liabilities -- in particular, WAYS -- we think economically. And when we run our cash flow test internally, we're going to consider the cost of the hedge.","Kriss Cloninger","Let me just say, we recognize what the GAAP reporting requirements are, but we are also recognizing the operating earnings as we define them are a non-GAAP financial measure. And we may have some internal discussions about what the most appropriate presentation of hedging cost in relation to operating earnings is. For the current year, we've chosen not to change anything. But we may have some internal discussions, and we'll let you know what our conclusions are.","Robin Y. Wilkey","And Suneet, as we talked last night, we are looking -- with next quarter, the amount was not very meaningful this quarter, but breaking out those different derivatives by line item also seems to be  exactly what the number was.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel of Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I'm curious for a little bit more detail, perhaps, on the securities lending program that you've initiated. I understand you guys mentioned this $6.5 billion program, and you're lending entirely JGBs. I was just wondering what you're buying with the cash collateral. Any duration mismatch you might be taking since it's such a short-term program, I think you mentioned 6 months, and what tick up in yield that's providing?","Eric M. Kirsch","Yes. The collateral is actually matched from a maturity standpoint. So it's very short duration, it's also back at JGBs. It's a very small pickup. My recollection is around maybe 10 basis points or so -- 30 or so? I'm sorry, 30 or so on the whole program. So this is an opportunity for us. As you know, we've got a lot of JGBs, and a good portion of those sit in ultra [ph] maturity. So when we have opportunities to enhance income, by not really taking on much more risk, that's just extra gravy, if you will, for us. So this was a good opportunity and we're able utilize of those HTM JGBs in this fashion.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So just a quick follow-up, I'm not sure if I followed. What are you buying with the proceeds, Eric?","Eric M. Kirsch","Basically, short-term JGBs, with the collateral.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then just -- I don't want to belabor the point too much on the currency hedging.  Just a quick question as to how much capacity do you think is out there. How big can your U.S. corporates investing, swapping into yen, how big can that program get over time?","Eric M. Kirsch","Sure. Well, let me take that from 2 ways. As you recollect -- and I went over this in Japan -- we did a strategic asset allocation program with Goldman Sachs. And from an asset allocation perspective, and this program looked over a 3-year rolling period. So for the next 3 years, we could see the U.S. corporate program being -- and this includes growth of our -- assumes growth of our balance sheet -- being up to about 20% or 25% of total assets. From the standpoint of capacity of the forwards markets, that's really not an issue. The currency forwards market is the most liquid, largest market, one of the largest markets in the world. So there's more than adequate capacity. Of course, we also have to manage our counterparty risk. And in that regard, as you may recollect, we've initiated this program with 3 Japan mega banks as counterparties, but we're expanding our use of iz-biz [ph] so we can expand the list of counterparties as the program grows. So if there would be any limit, it would just be the credit quality of our counterparties. But we don't see that as being a problem over the next 3 years as the program grows, as long as we continue to grow all list of counterparties.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then if I could just sneak one last one in and real quick.  Any interest in allocating investment dollars into high-yield or below investment grade securities? I noticed the impact, the pickup in below-investment grade this quarter, but it seems like that was all downgrade-driven. Anything you can provide there?","Eric M. Kirsch","Sure. A couple of things on that. That's correct. Anything that lead -- that shows up as an increase in date was because of downgrades. Again, tying back to the asset allocation strategy, high-yield would be an asset class; that is part of our asset allocation strategy. So that would be buying the true high-yield asset class as opposed to downgrades. In the short-term, we're not planning on allocating to that asset class. As you recollect, we're still building our team and capability. We anticipate having that capability mid-year next year, but then we'll still have to make the decision tactically.  We'll look at spreads in that market, whether or not it's a good time to allocate money to high-yield. So over time, the answer is yes. When exactly we would do it? That will be based on market conditions. And one other thing, just to mention for clarity, going back to the hedging. The cost, right now, of our hedging, which, as Dan mentioned, it was 41 basis points. That is a very, very low cost, which has primarily been driven by the low U.S. interest rates and the low Japan interest rates. We don't expect that cost to stay that low forever. We know historically it's been higher, so we're in the low point in cost, but it also makes it attractive to use these types of forwards at the same time. So over time, these costs will increase from an investment perspective. We're always going to look at all of our investment alternatives and we'll look at them net of hedging cost versus JGBs, versus high-yield or other asset classes. So it'll be a dynamic position over time based on market conditions, but I think it's worth pointing out that those hedging costs most likely will increase versus decrease over time, given that they're all at all time lows.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to say that in historical periods, when those hedging costs are higher, that new money yields are also higher?","Eric M. Kirsch","Not necessarily, because the hedging cost per forwards is based on short-term rate differentials. And we don't go out and buy short-term paper; we but longer-term paper, 10 to 30 years. So it really depends on the shape of the yield curve. So we could be in an environment where short-term rates in the U.S. go up; that would cause the cost of the hedges to go up, but the long end of yield curve may not go up. So there's not necessarily a correlation between those 2 things.","Daniel P. Amos","But I think it's reasonable to say that we've been looking at hedging cost being 1% versus 41%. And if it doesn't make sense at 1%, then we're not looking at it at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger of Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","I was curious, now that you've successfully completed the initial dollar-denominated program, have you given any further consideration to extending this to some of your existing, available for sale JGB holdings? Because it seems, Eric, that you're not all that concerned about the capacity for hedges. And correct me if I'm wrong, but if seems like if you were to do this, it would create a number of desired outcomes, which I think would include increasing returns on the existing portfolio, as well as creating some gains in Japan, that I would think would increase your profit repatriation potential. So I was just curious if you had some update or thoughts on that?","Eric M. Kirsch","Sure. Over time, yes. We would consider all of our assets that are available for sale and say, is there a better opportunity for them, whether it's JGBs or something else. Of course, we have to consider liquidity and duration and capital ratios when we do that. Relative to gains, we did, as you already know, manage during the quarter, because when we're sitting on large gains in our FSA JGBs, we did realize some of those gains as we tried to proactively manage our gains and losses. Nevertheless, we reinvested it to JGBs, primarily because during the quarter, we had put a cap in the third quarter on how much we were going to put into the corporate bond program. So we were already targeted to be at that cap. As we look at the fourth quarter, we have a pretty good target for the amount of corporates, and that's a healthy target and a healthy dose of higher yields for the program. So we don't feel compelled right now that we need to make that swap. But that's available to us, depending on market conditions, which we could do at some point in time, and that'll be a relative value decision. But right now, we're pretty happy with the amount of money we're going to target in the fourth quarter, so we don't see a need to target even more.","Kriss Cloninger","I don't know if Eric would totally agree with this, but let me just throw it out.  And that is, from my perspective, we wouldn't allocate 75% of the cash flow of any quarter to this corporate bond program on a long-term basis. And the way I look at it is, we're repositioning a part of the current portfolio as part of that 75%, and even though we're not liquidating it, but let's just say, new money-wise, we're putting 30% in to the new program, and another 45% we're converting to corporates as kind of in lieu doing gains and losses, et cetera, and putting it in there. So as we just build the blocks, in my mind, I kind of look at it like we are repositioning a part of the current portfolio away from JGBs, even though it's all new money.","Eric M. Kirsch","Yes. No, I think that's an excellent point, because as you all know, prior to the initiation of this program, if I could put in these terms, we overallocated to JGBs because we didn't really have many alternatives based on our old investment strategy, since we had stopped buying private placements almost entirely. So in essence, we overallocated to JGBs at the beginning of the year, but now that we have the flexibility to do the corporate program, there's just the higher percentage going in there as a way to fine tune the overall allocations. To Kriss's point as well, as we continue to build out our capabilities -- again, go back to the Japan presentation -- I've put on the board different asset classes we will buy over time. So you should expect to see, and I think it will probably start to even out second part of next year, certainly into 2014, where we'll be buying some JGBs, some investment-grade corporates hedge, some emerging markets high-yield, including some alternatives on the Board. So you'll see it even out over time, but right now, you're seeing those adjustments be disproportionate, in essence, because of the high amount to JGBs earlier this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Something  completely different, if Paul is still around. U.S., probably the guidance that Dan alluded to for the fourth quarter, which was just flat. Dan also referenced some disruption in distribution. I'm assuming that Dan is talking about what you're trying to do in the large group market. I was hoping maybe you could fill that out and tell us what's going on there?","Paul S. Amos","Sure. As Dan mentioned and as I've mentioned, my goal is to manage this business for the long-term, not just for the short term. So while 13 weeks of business is important, I'm really trying to manage our growth for not only 2012, but '13, '14 and beyond. So in this past summer, the disruption that Dan is talking about is the combination of our sales and marketing strategy departments all into one, bringing in external leadership to help run sales, and then making sure our field force understands exactly what we're trying to do. Less so, about any disruption from the broker market and what specifically is happening in the broker market. And in terms of sales, we have seen, as we've stepped in the fourth quarter enrollments, specifically with our smaller accounts, more of a decline in sentiment and purchasing than we originally expected. When we came out in a recent release, and even Kriss's comments, at the mini FAB in Tokyo, we commented that we thought we would be still within the range. The reason decline has to do with what we expect sales to be based on what we're seeing come out of our small-business enrollments that Dan directly highlighted between small-business sentiment, as well as what we believe is apprehension around the election, taxes and a multitude of other items by small business owners. As I've said all along, we continue to build on our broker strategy to be a hedge against the small business, any negative downturn in small business and our ability to write business in there. While that market continues to grow and grow well for us, we are seeing -- still seeing great success with our broker market and broker growth. At this point, the size of our field force in our core market, which continues to be our key focus, is so grossly proportionately larger than just any downturn in that small-business market -- especially in the fourth quarter -- will have a negative effect on our ability to produce sales increases. So overall, I'm very optimistic for the long-term. We're putting in an incredible training program beginning in January. I think we're doing all the right things, from a management standpoint, to make sure that long-term sales go well. But in the short-term, we are seeing the adverse effect of both the economy, as well as apprehension in the small-business market.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if I may, when we see fourth quarter results, while we're going to see small -- your basic business down, we will see large group up year-over-year?","Paul S. Amos","I'm not focusing it on group versus individual, I'm focusing in on broker versus our core field [ph] [indiscernible]","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, [indiscernible]. Corporate versus [indiscernible].","Paul S. Amos","And the reason I do that is, I'm platform-agnostic. Whether an account chooses group products or individual products makes no difference to me. But what I am trying to do is manage our distinct distribution channels. And one thing I do want to point out too is we've seen great success with our field force partnering with brokers actually help them enroll their accounts. So I am very happy with our ability to succeed there, and yes, I do expect to see continued growth in the broker market. I expect to see some struggles with our career market. But as I said, based on the training program and the things we're putting in place, I expect us to be able to move forward in a positive manner throughout '13 and beyond.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Are you guys looking -- and this is -- I've heard some things. Are you guys looking at the individual market performance, and I'm talking about the true individual market you're selling to individuals as individuals. There has been some thought that supplemental health products could really, really shoot up in 2014 and beyond due to ObamaCare. I'm wondering if that's something you might look at?","Paul S. Amos","Yes. We've always had direct products. In fact, that's -- we've offered direct pricing in the United States for many years. Our agents have always found that the ability to sell at the worksite not only provides us a better actuarial risk, but it provide the ability for the agent to be more productive because they can sell to a larger volume of people in a shorter period of time. And as well, as I think Americans in general, are used to purchasing their products at the worksite. That said, we do expect the combination of both ObamaCare PAC or whatever you want to call it, as well as the millennial generation being 50% of the workforce by 2016, to have some impact on how people choose to purchase insurance. Yes, it's my job, as well as our sales and marketing teams to make sure that we're staying ahead and looking at all possible alternatives. But we still believe, Steven, that the best market for us is the worksite businesses with 100 employees or less. And all of the other alternatives, including the broker market as well as the direct market, represent places for us to get incremental growth. But again, for us, we are going to focus in on America's smallest businesses and the opportunity for us to be successful there.","Robin Y. Wilkey","We're at the top of the hour, so we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Our final question comes from Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Ken, I just wanted to come back to you on something you had mentioned before, I think, in response to Nigel's question. The -- so, if the plan for -- going forward here, is that dividends from the U.S. is going to fund the common dividend, is it safe to assume -- and you're still on track with $800 million or so in terms of U.S. dollars repatriation coming from Japan -- is it fair to say all or the vast majority of that would go toward the buyback?  Is that the right way to think about that for '13?","Kenneth S. Janke","Well, I think we -- a couple of things. Number one, we've said that we anticipate funding our share repurchase activities with profit repatriation so that JPY 65 billion translates into a little over $800 million. We would expect to have more dividend capacity on a U.S. statutory basis next year than we had this year, just given where we are with realized investment losses on a statutory basis. So as we think about next year, again, we want to maintain some prudence and we're going to be very cognizant of the world around us if additional losses emerge. But assuming that we have a relatively benign environment, thinking that we can buy somewhere within that -- we've indicated $300 million to $900 million in Kriss's speech in May -- we'd be at the high-end of the range if we felt comfortable deploying all of that. But yes, that would be available if we felt that was the right thing to do. And again, in the meantime, we have ample liquidity at the parent company. You'll recall that we did not dividend from the life company to the parent company all this year. We really relied on parent company liquidity to meet our corporate needs.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's very clear. And then just a follow-up for Kriss on the Japan margins. So 17% to 20% -- 21% pretax margins on WAYS, if you get it 2.5% new money yield. And Kriss, those are without the price increases, either the October or the planned one for next year?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes, that's right. They'd be, in order of magnitude, 8% to 10% higher under repricing.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So, okay. And then I know you had mentioned the 6 month -- or 6 to 12 months negative impact of the spend on the new investment structure. But if I think about that range that you've given out, and I look at the 19 3 margin that you had this quarter -- fair to say that if Eric keeps getting what he is getting, that we're actually going to see start to see a reversal and margins go up here. Or certainly, not going down. I just want to get some context. And then as a follow-up, the -- why is it only a 6 to 12-months spend? I thought most of the costs were going to be ongoing? Or is there some big onetime elements to those...","Kriss Cloninger","No, the cost will be ongoing, Tom. What I'm saying is that if I look at the incremental yield on the amount we invested, say, for the first 6 months of the program.  Say, I get an extra 100 basis points on $5 billion to $6 billion, that's $50 million to $60 million. That probably meets or exceeds the cost of the build out. So the $50 million to $60 million of additional investment income on the investments we made over the last 3 months and the next 3 months are probably sufficient to fund the going forward, the extra infrastructure, personnel cost, et cetera, et cetera. So in my mind, the way I'm compartmentalizing it, I'm saying, \"Well, if I don't count any in additional profit associated with the first 6 months of investment. Now, we're going forward, then I've covered the total cost of the program in the P&L, and any incremental yield I'd get after the first 6 months is going to go to the bottom line, et cetera, et cetera. \" That may not be the way you or anybody else thinks about it, but that's the way I've compartmentalized it. I will point out though that the current margin is right in the middle of the range that I gave you at FAB in May. All the ratios are in line with those numbers I gave you. I'll say that the expense ratio for the third quarter was at the low-end of the range, the benefit ratio was at the high-end of the range, but we had a lot of WAYS sales in the third quarter or in the second quarter. So I might anticipate that those would have been a little higher. Year-to-date, we're right in the middle of things. 2012 year-to-date, the margin's 20.1, and I had estimated a range in margin of 18.5 to 20.5, so actually that's way above the middle of the range of 19.5. So I'm comfortable with the numbers we've quoted you, and the margins are moving in the right direction. I'm just trying to be conservative in saying, \"Don't get too excited, overly excited.\" I've got some additional cost to cover out of these additional incremental yields. So don't just expect the EPS to explode in the next 3 months. But over the next year, yes, I think it's going to really help us and going forward is going to help us a lot. That, plus the repricing, plus the other marketing adjustments we've made in our profits, our product strategy. Dan, did you want to comment?","Daniel P. Amos","Yes. The only thing I would say is that if you take where we are today and look at where we were a year ago, it's a totally different -- a way of looking at what's going on. I mean, we are in a position where every day, profits -- margins and profits are going up. And I think we're well-positioned to have a great fourth quarter and 2013, and I couldn't be more excited about the future and what's really been an ability our company to withstanding what went on with the financial crisis and now move look forward and really see some growth going ahead.","Robin Y. Wilkey","Okay, thank you. And we're going to close it down now.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would like -- I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations.","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of U.S. Operations; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO; Eric Kirsch, First Senior Vice President, Chief Global Investment Officer. And joining us remotely this morning is Toru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan, who joins us from Tokyo.","Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some of the statements in the teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities law. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discussed today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly reports for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.","Now I'll turn to program over this morning to Dan who will begin with some comments about the quarter and our operations in Japan and the United States. I'll then follow up with a few financial highlights for the second quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dan?","Daniel P. Amos","Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.","Let me begin this morning with a review of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. We were again pleased with Aflac Japan's strong financial performance and sales momentum that continued in the second quarter. Following 2 tremendous years and an impressive first quarter, new annualized premium sales rose 47.4% to JPY 53.2 billion in the second quarter. These results, again, greatly surpassed our expectations and set a production record for the fourth straight quarter. For the first half of the year, Aflac Japan's totaled new annualized premiums in yen rose 50.5%. Aflac Japan's revenues grew by 9.2% for the quarter and 8.5% for the first 6 months. Pretax earnings for the quarter were JPY 77 billion, up 2.4%; and for the 6 months, pretax earnings were JPY 160 billion, up 2.8%. Premium income increased 9.7% for the quarter and 8.8% for the 6 months, benefiting from the stronger sales of our WAYS product. I would also note that persistency remained strong. The bank channel generated JPY 24.7 billion in sales, which represents an increase of 224% over the second quarter of 2011. The bank channel accounted for 46.5% of Aflac Japan's total sales and the traditional accounted for 51.9%.","From a product perspective, WAYS, our unique hybrid whole-life product, continued as the top seller in the second quarter, generating an increase of 259% over 2011 and accounting for 45% of the total second quarter sales. Our cancer and medical insurance accounted for 13.4% and 16.9% of total sales in the quarter, respectively.","I would point out that we expect our new nonstandard medical product introduced this week to benefit medical sales in the second half of the year. You may recall that we started selling the 5-pay version of WAYS product through the banks in June of 2011. As we've previously discussed, we have taken action to limit the production of the 5-pay version of WAYS to address the possibility of disintermediation risk in the event of interest rates increase significantly. Now, virtually all banks have reached their sales cap by 5-pay WAYS for the year. Our traditional sales channels will stop sales of all 5-pay WAYS on August 1. Except for a little spillover business, we don't expect the contribution of 5-pay WAYS to impact third quarter sales.","Banks have a very strong distribution outlook for Aflac Japan. Compared with the U.S. banks, Japanese banks interact with the customers and consumers through more touch points offering a broader scope of transaction. As such, consumers in Japan tend to have more face-to-face interaction with the banks, often developing strong loyalties. This is true from the smallest villages to the largest cities. The bank channel networks of about 20,000 branches gives us a far-reaching access to consumers we've never had the chance to do business with otherwise. The bank channel helps expand our customer base. Today about 80% of the bank channel sales are new customers.","Over the past 6 years, we've invested significant efforts in the developing relationship with banks. I will remind you that we secured agreements with more than 90% of the banks in Japan, a number we believe is significantly greater than any of our competitors.","Selling WAYS appeals to banks because this product, is significantly higher premium, generates attractive commissions. Consumers like the WAYS product because it provides a safe and more appealing alternative to bank accounts that pay less than 10 basis points. From Aflac's view, as I've said before, WAYS gave us the opportunity to generate about a 10% profit margin for life insurance while providing a new distribution channel. If there was a choice, I'd prefer to sell more profitable third-sector products over the first-sector products like WAYS. But let me remind you, swapping out first-sector sales with third-sector sales simply isn't an option. However, we have tremendous access through the bank channel and that gives us an opportunity to cross-sell our more profitable medical and cancer products.","We're also employing our strategies to enhance the profitability of child endowment in WAYS product. This is especially important in the current low interest-rate environment. Starting in October, the discounted advance premium rate, or DAP purchase option, available for both products will be reduced. While we're in the process of communicating with the FSA, our plan is to reduce the rate by 50%, going from 1% to 0.5% credit. You'll recall that the DAP is the interest we credit to the policyholders when they choose to pay their premium upfront. Additionally, as we told you at the Analyst Meeting, we will lower the assumed interest rate on pricing for the sales of WAYS in child endowment products starting in April of 2013.","I would add that the second half of 2012 sales results will be impacted by several factors: first, we will stop the sale of 5-pay WAYS, which, of course, will hurt sales; second, the tough sales comparison from the second half of 2011 will make the latter half of 2012 challenging; and third, it's important to note that even with the headwinds I've just mentioned, the popularity of the products and the broad selection, especially with WAYS, continues to appeal to consumers. As such, we believe new annualized premium sales in the second half of the year will be flat to up 5%. However, combining the second half sales expectation with the tremendous sales growth we produced in the first half of the year, we are revising our numbers upward in terms of the sales target to 22% to 25%.","Now let me turn to the U.S. operation. Aflac U.S. revenues grew by 5.2%, both for the quarter and for the 6 months. Pretax earnings were up 6.3% for the quarter and 7.2% for the 6 months. Premium income increased 5.5% for the quarter and 5.3% for the 6 months.","I would also note that policy persistency remained very strong. We believe there are several reasons for this including some factors that we have control over and some we don't. One, with the economic uncertainty over the last several years, workers have been more reluctant to switch jobs. Additionally, we enhanced communication with our policyholders at critical decision-making times, which we believe has contributed to make an improvement in the policyholder retention rate. We believe these efforts have contributed to better persistency both for the policyholders and the payroll accounts.","Aflac U.S. new annualized premium rose 1.5% for the quarter. For the first half of the year, total new sales rose 3%, which is in line with the annual sales target of 3% to 8% increase.","Keep in mind with the majority of the enrollments occurring in the fourth quarter, we expect sales results to improve.","Sales for our group products remained strong. Our veteran associates continue to benefit from the ability to offer group and individual products.","While some aspects of the U.S. economy have shown slight signs of improvement this year, we continue to see the economic landscape is challenging. Given that our products are primarily sold at small businesses, gains in employment increased our universe of potential policyholders. Until we see sustained growth in employment levels, we remain cautious.","While we can't control the challenging economic climate in the U.S., we certainly can position our business to maximize the potential for success in the current environment. That's exactly what we've done over the last several years and we are closely monitoring the proposed changes in the U.S. health care delivery system. Health care reform was never intended to address voluntary or supplemental insurance. Therefore, the Supreme Court's decision last month does not directly impact our business or the need for our products. However, we believe that it can have an indirect impact. It could present with opportunities for continued growth in this market. For Aflac, voluntary insurance sold at the work site, large and small, remains our primary focus.","As we've seen in Japan, a system of national health care, actually enhances the awareness in the need of our product such as ours. Our competitive advantage as the market leader in the U.S. gives us new opportunities. For example, many brokers are looking to Aflac's supplemental of voluntary insurance for solutions for a couple of levels: first, we're seeking to replace lost commissions from declining major medical business; second, employers that are subject to Affordable Care Act have been asking brokers for ways to help control their health care costs. Whether the answer is to shift more costs to the employees, reduce benefits or both, we believe Aflac can be a big part of the solution for employers and their employees.","With our strong brand, we believe consumers will be more receptive to hearing how Aflac products can help. This opens up greater possibilities for traditional sales force and the broker channel alike.","Having updated you on the operational side of the business, let me give you some details about our Global Investment division. For the last several years, our primary focus has been on investment risk management while investing our significant cash flows and assets that are relatively higher quality and liquidity. As you know, we have made significant progress into proactively derisking our portfolio over the last 3 years to enhance the strength of our balance sheet. In the process, we've been reducing our exposure to riskier asset classes including perpetual, [indiscernible] and financials especially in Europe. You've heard us say many times before that we expect to see volatility in Europe, and that's exactly what we've seen in the second quarter. Our second quarter net after-tax realized investment losses were $272 million. These losses are primarily attributable to the decision to impair 2 Spanish holdings. In addition, we experienced further declines in the value of several securities we've previously impaired in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the intent to sell.","Although our total realized losses in the second quarter were higher than the first quarter of this year, they are significantly lower than the second quarter of last year. We still view Europe as an area of potential risk. As always, we closely monitor and reevaluate our portfolio with the eye for credit issues that may emerge. However, I believe our portfolio is better positioned now to accommodate market volatility.","Now I'd like to share with you the progress that we've made on various initiatives related to transforming our investment management organization. As you'll recall, we engaged McKinsey to conduct a strategic global review of our people, infrastructure, technology and processes. We are in the process of implementing some of those recommendations in the second quarter. One recommendation relates to the organizational structure. Our new framework encompasses the Global Investment group led by executive management team of seasoned professionals and key investment functions. Recruiting talented investment and business professionals is a top priority we've made significant progress on. We hired a global chief operating officer for investments along with the chief operating officer for U.S. investments, a head of global credit and a head of trading. We also hired a number of other professionals in various support roles in both Japan and the United States. We will continue to build out our staff with talent and expertise to complement our investment strategy going forward. But let me just say that I am extremely impressed with the caliber of investment veterans Eric Kirsch has hired. They represent an enormous amount of Wall Street's experience and [indiscernible].","As we move into the third quarter, we will be addressing traditional recommend -- additional recommendations such as work stream and technology. We also engaged Goldman Sachs Asset Management, or GSAM, to conduct a comprehensive asset allocation review. This review identified asset allocations that allow us to improve our overall risk return profile by maximizing diversification while accommodating the various constraints to our portfolio such as the RBC and SMR ratios. GSAM is wrapping up phase 1 of the project this month, making it too early to discuss specific asset allocation details today.","However, I can highlight several of the findings. Currently about 99% of the holdings are fixed maturity category, primarily invested in JGBs and privately issued securities. As I've suggested prior to the GSAM engagement, we will be looking to invest in a more liquid public securities while still supporting our yen liability. This week, we began investing in dollar-denominated public fixed income securities diversified by the sector and we'll purchase currency hedged to the yen. This strategy will provide greater liquidity over flexibility of the portfolio. Further, it will help provide opportunities to diversify the investment of significant cash flows beyond JGBs with the objective of producing higher returns.","Our strategic asset allocation will be reviewed on an annual basis, and we will make tactical asset allocations continually to reflect current market and business conditions.","Now, I'll turn to Aflac's consolidated financial performance. Operating earnings per share rose 3.9% to $1.61 for the quarter. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 3.2% for the quarter.","We had another strong quarter with respect to capital position. The strength of our capital ratio demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of our policyholders and bondholders, as well as shareholders.","As we've communicated over the past several years, a strong risk-based capital ratio remains a priority to us. Although we have not finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate our RBC ratio was between 560% and 600% at the end of June, which is up from the year-end number of 493%. The significant increase in the ratio from year end is due to the first quarter 2012 implementation of the new statutory accounting standards for income taxes. As you know, our capital adequacy in Japan is principally measured by the solvency margin ratio. We expect that Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio will remain at the high end of the 500% to 600% target.","As we've indicated, given our capital structure, our ability to repurchase shares is largely tied to profit repatriation. Our 2012 profit repatriation was a bit higher than our estimates at JPY 37 billion, but we continue to be cautious about deploying capital. I'll remind you that we don't need to repurchase any shares to achieve our 2012 operating earnings objective. Given the ongoing European debt and related market volatility, we believe it's prudent to be cautious about deploying capital. However, it's still possible that we will repurchase shares in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, we still expect to have significant capacity for profit repatriation and share repurchase in 2013 if we incur no material losses between now and the end of the FSA fiscal year.","I believe we've done a good job in protecting our policyholders' interests while also being mindful of shareholders' needs. We increased our cash dividend to shareholders in 2011 for the 29th consecutive year. Our objective is to grow the dividend at the rate in line with the earnings per share growth before the impact of the yen. I believe dividends are an important component for the value we provide investors. I am confident that the fourth quarter, we will extend the consecutive annual dividend increases to 30 years.","I also believe we've done a very good job in managing our operation including expense control. However, with investments as one of the highest priorities, we remain committed to building a world-class investment function. This transformation requires additional financial resources, primarily for personnel, improved processes and investment systems. Fortunately, because the first quarter receipt of the deferred coupon, we were able to accelerate the funding of this critical global initiative while still achieving our operating earnings per share objectives.","I want to affirm that even with the historically low interest rates, excluding currency, we expect to achieve our 2012 operating earnings per share of a 3% to 6% increase although toward the end of the low range. We believe it is reasonable.","Looking ahead, I also want to reaffirm 2013 target we gave you at the analyst meeting. We expect operating per diluted share to increase 4% to 7% in 2013 on a currency-neutral basis. This earnings objective assumes no significant impact on investment income from losses and no further meaningful decline in interest rates. We remain focused on our vision to be the leading provider of voluntary insurance in the United States and the #1 provider of supplemental insurance in Japan. I have confidence in our business model, the fundamental need for our products, and most importantly, the future success of Aflac. Robin?","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thanks, Dan. Let me get through some second quarter numbers, starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the top line in yen terms, revenues were up strongly at 9.2% for the quarter and investment income was up 6.9%. The annualized persistency rate, excluding annuities for the first half of the year, was 94.7% compared with 94.3% a year ago. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to total premiums increased over the last year, going from 69.9% a year ago to 72.2% in the second quarter. This was caused primarily by the growth of the net benefit reserves for our ordinary life line of products, most notably our WAYS product. The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.4%, down from 19.4% a year ago. The expense ratio was primarily impacted by the lower net commissions associated with the increase in sales of our life products. As a result, the higher benefit ratio with the pretax profit margin declining from 20.9% to 19.6% in the quarter.","For investments for the quarter, our cash flows were invested in yen securities at 1.80%, and including dollars, the blended rate was 1.97%. The portfolio yield was 3.1% at the end of June, which is 8 basis points lower than the end of March and 41 basis points lower than a year ago. 10-year JGBs at the end of June 30 were 0.84%, a 15 basis points decrease from March 31. 20-year JGB yields as of June 30 were 1.67%, a 9 basis points decrease from March 31. And 30-year JGB yields as of June 30 were 1.89%, a 5 basis points decrease from March 31.","Now turning to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 5.2% in the second quarter. The benefit ratio to total premiums increased slightly to 57.5% compared with 57.0% a year ago. The operating expense ratio decreased from 31.3% to 30.6%. Reflecting the decrease in the operating expense ratio, the profit margin for the quarter was 18.3% compared to 18.1% a year ago.","In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 4.37% versus 5.72% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of June was 6.59%, down 7 basis points from the first quarter and 17 basis points from the year ago.","Turning to some other items in the quarter. Noninsurance interest expense in the second quarter was $45 million compared to $41 million a year ago. The increase in interest expense was primarily impacted by the increased borrowings during 2011 and in the first quarter of this year.","Parent company and other expenses increased to $18 million compared to $16 million in the second quarter of 2011. This increase was caused by several items, primarily general operating expenses increase with personnel projects and also other special projects. Total company operating margins decreased, reflecting the increase of the benefit ratio in Japan. Also our pretax operating margin decreased from 19.3% to 18.3%. After-tax operating margin decreased from 12.6% to 11.9%.","On an operating basis, the tax rate remained relatively unchanged at 34.8%.","Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.03  -- $1.03 compared with $0.58 in 2011. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 3.9% to $1.61. The stronger yen increased earnings by $0.01 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen's impact, our operating earnings per share increased 3.2% for the quarter.","Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for the remainder of 2012. As we mentioned at our analyst meeting and also as Dan reiterated a while ago, given the continued low interest rate environment especially in Japan along with the ongoing volatility seen in Europe in the second quarter, we expect to see an increase in operating earnings per diluted share excluding the impact of the yen this year toward the low end of the range of 3% to 6%. Assuming the low end of 3% to 6% range in operating earnings growth, we would expect to earn $6.45 to $6.52 if the yen averages JPY 80 for the year. With the same exchange rate assumption of JPY 80 to the dollar for the third quarter, we would therefore expect operating earnings to be $1.64 to $1.69 per diluted share.","Now I'll be glad to take your questions. And to be fair to everybody, please make sure you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. We're now ready for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","With the strategy of investing in the U.S. and swapping back to Japan, can you discuss how much incremental yield you expect to pick up from that strategy? And if rates remain unchanged from current levels, what type of Japan new money yields do you expect to achieve in the back half of the year?","Eric M. Kirsch","Sure. It's Eric Kirsch, and I can give you a range of estimates. I can't give you a precise number just because yields and spreads and different types of purchases could be different depending on market conditions. But by way of example, with this new program that we've initiated that Dan mentioned today, we're buying publicly available U.S. corporate bonds focused in A, BBB type of credits. This strategy will give us greater liquidity, greater portfolio flexibility in the future, and we're looking at maturities anywhere from 10 to 30 years across the curve. So ultimately, as we build this new portfolio, it'll be a combination of those things. But after taking into account the cost of currency hedges, because our strategy is to have this hedged back into our yen liabilities, you could be looking at anywhere from, again let me emphasize based on current market yields and spreads, anywhere from 2.5% to 3.25%. So if yields and spreads stay where they are today, which isn't likely, they move, as you all know, we'd probably be building a portfolio that, on average, had that kind of yield after the currency hedging costs. As you know, year-to-date, because we've been cautious and conservative, not buying private placements, being much more stringent on our credit standards, a majority of our new money was going into JGBs, which, as Robin mentioned, overall, year-to-date new money yields is somewhere around 1.85%, but on our whole portfolio new money at about 2%. You could see, based on my comments, we'll be able to increase the returns fairly significantly while at the same time improving the overall quality, diversification and investment opportunities for the portfolio. The program just got initiated, so we will start off in a modest sense as the team is coming together, as we work very closely on a global basis. But I'm confident as each month goes by, the impact to that new money yield and our overall investment results will continue to be a great contributor from this new investment program.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Eric had mentioned potentially invested 2.5% to 3.25%, so curious what that would do to the margin for the WAYS product versus where you're investing today at 2%?","Kriss Cloninger","I'll take that one. This is Kriss. At the FAB meeting, we reported that at a 2% new money rate, the WAYS profit would range from 8% to 12% of premium. If that increases at 2.25%, the range of profit goes up to 13% to 17% of premium. And at 2.5%, we get up to 17% to 21%. So I'm looking at this as an opportunity to $1 average up our net investment yield by pursuing this new strategy compared to what we've done over the last 6 to 12 months.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then with this investment strategy in place, would you guys consider sort of reallowing the 5 WAYS product to be sold in the back half of the year if these are the type of margins you can be generating with a higher investment return?","Kriss Cloninger","I think that what's more likely to happen is that we'll move to a 10-pay WAYS. I think that's what the bank channel is going to do.","Daniel P. Amos","They're already doing it.","Kriss Cloninger","They're already doing it. The difference there is that the policy is not paid up as quickly. The full cash values aren't available to the policyholders quite as quickly, and therefore, it stretches out the period associated with becoming fully paid up and having access to full cash values and what that does is it reduces the risk of potential disintermediation by stretching out the period between the issue date and the paid-up date. Not that disintermediation is going to occur necessarily in the event of a spike in interest rates, but it is a possibility and so we're comfortable that we're doing the right thing, and we will probably not reintroduce 5-pay WAYS.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Dan, you'd mentioned the opportunity to cross-sell the cancer and medical products via the bank distribution. So curious when you expect that this could take hold just given sales are essentially flat or down for those products despite the robust sales in the bank.","Daniel P. Amos","Well, actually, it's taking place now. Our sales of medical and cancer are the same number as WAYS. The difference is, is the premium is so high. So it's actually been taking place. I think what will drive our increase in sales immediately is going to be the introduction of this new -- what do we call the cancer product, the one that -- I mean the medical product -- Gentle EVER, which is a higher risk but higher premium. It's a substandard. And I think that's going to drive in the second half of the year's sales. But actually, the bank channel's doing quite well on medical and cancer sales. It's just one night the premium is the problem.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on the new money rate and the effect of WAYS. So if I understand this correctly, in October, you're going to reduce the discount on the advance, is that correct?","Daniel P. Amos","That is correct.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then beginning next fiscal year, you're going to raise the price of WAYS?","Daniel P. Amos","That is correct.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So both of those things are going on. So I guess the question is, if you're doing that, and Eric could get you 2.50% to 3.25%, are we looking at much higher margins than we've seen in the past on this product?","Daniel P. Amos","Absolutely. Assuming there's no change from where we are at this moment in interest rates and what's going on, that is correct.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then if I may just stick with Japan as a follow-up. I know your -- I guess this is a revision of Gentle EVER. I mean Gentle EVER's been out there, right?","Daniel P. Amos","It's a revision of Gentle EVER.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Are you happy, Dan, with the second quarter in traditional? The way I figure it, traditional was probably flat quarter-over-quarter.","Daniel P. Amos","No. I'd like stronger sales and certainly it's something that we're looking at and trying to concentrate on in the second half to have our traditional channel pick up. So I would say that no, it's not where I'd like it to be. But Japan's economy has not been the greatest in the world either. So not where I want it, but we're working on it and I think we'll see improvement going forward.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Is it just a stale product issue, or do you think there's something else?","Daniel P. Amos","No, I think a little bit of our salespeople are selling some of the life insurance that's moved them a little bit; we're moving them back. And I think they need new products occasionally and I think this Gentle EVER introduction will help them as well.","Operator","And our next question will come from Randy Binner of FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I had a question on the SMR. I guess from our perspective, it seemed surprisingly good considering a few headwinds and still maybe we're wrong in identifying those as headwinds, but the repatriation  number, I'm assuming, is out of the SMR you referenced. I assume the credit loss is out of there too. The yen was a little bit stronger. And so those would be headwinds and then a tailwind would be a lower JGB yield. So just trying to look for clarification and kind of the moving parts that kept the SMR favorable in the quarter?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes, you're essentially correct. The repatriation is, in fact, out of the SMR number. The investment losses for the quarter are in there. But again, we had strong operating earnings and there wasn't that much change in the yen, it was 1% and 1.5%, something like that. So there wasn't much of an impact on converting the dollar portfolio to yen compared to what it was at the end of the first quarter.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So then, I guess 2 kind of related follow-ups. So one, the FSA standard reserving rate, is that -- is there any update on that and would that materially impact the SMR? And then with this level of SMR, would it be fair to say this is an adequate level that would enable kind of the larger repatriation looking to 2013?","Kriss Cloninger","Let me think about the first part of that question again. Let's see, what was the first part?","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just the standard reserving rate, is there any update on that from the FAB?","Kriss Cloninger","The JGB yields -- within your JGB yields still remain well below what would be required to change the notion that the standard interest rate will be lowered effective April 1, 2013. I think it has to go up to something like 1.2% or more for the remaining period between now and the determination date. So it's highly likely that the standard reserve rate will come down. That only affects us going forward for new business, so there's no immediate impact on the SMR of a change in the -- of the rate. And as far as -- we've got a pretty strong SMR, future repatriations will primarily be a function of our Japan net after-tax income that reflects both operating earnings and investment losses after tax. And historically, we've repatriated about 80% of that number and we have to look at the level of solvency margin ratio to make sure we're taking care of the policyholders in Japan before we repatriate funds. But historically, we've been able to repatriate about 80% of the after-tax net income and still build our capital level in Japan. So that's what I expect next year.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMC.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a -- just a follow-up on profit repatriation. Given that the losses in the second quarter were relatively high, at least higher than they were in the first quarter, what do you -- what's your sort of range for profit repatriation from Japan that you expect for 2013 assuming that you don't have material losses from here on out? And then on U.S. sales, they've been weak for the past few quarters. Just wondering how much of this is because of the economy versus not having the capacity or the infrastructure to be able to train recruits?","Kenneth S. Janke","Jimmy, this is Ken. Let me address the proper repatriation question. The current estimate based on losses that we've incurred so far in Japan's fiscal year would put it likely around JPY 65 billion next year, which is down from about JPY 90 billion that we had expected earlier. Remember, when we talked about the JPY 90 billion, we assumed there were no additional losses. So updating that number, that's a little over $800 million to $810 million.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that would assume nothing major for the next 3 quarters?","Kenneth S. Janke","Correct, correct.","Daniel P. Amos","U.S.?","Kenneth S. Janke","Second part of the question?","Daniel P. Amos","U.S. sales.","Eric M. Kirsch","I would say that when we put out the original range for 2012, the range of 3% to 8% was based upon some improvement in both the U.S. economy, and more specifically, on employment itself. The 3% range, as I've said previously, represented a poor economy. The 8% of the range represented an improved economy with an average execution on our part. I would tell you at this point I think you've seen nationally with GDP, with unemployment across-the-board, with the Fed considering taking action this morning that the economy has not improved. And therefore, we continue to see slightly weaker results. That said, as Dan mentioned in his speech earlier, I believe that we will have a strong second half of the year with specific increase in the fourth quarter as the group business continues to drive success as well as the broker business. Our broker sales continue to be strong. And I feel like the changes that we've made recently in our sales and marketing structure to realign ourselves to better improve our training and to make our recruits more effective by recruiting and turning them into average weekly producers will set us up better for internal execution. All that being said, I feel confident and reaffirm the range of 3% to 8% with hope that we will continue to move up within that range from where we are today.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Nigel (sic) [Nadel] of Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have a question on the new asset allocation strategy. Is this something where we should expect you will only be investing new cash flows? For instance, into these -- into U.S. public corporate securities and swapping or hedging into yen. Or might you be willing to sell some of your more recent JGB investments and reinvest proceeds from that as well into the strategy?","Eric M. Kirsch","It's Eric again. First, for sure, the majority of new cash flows will be used to invest per our new asset allocation strategies that are still being finalized, but you've heard a lot about with the GSAM project. Having said that, we will certainly look at opportunities for current assets in our portfolio to swap them in essence where it makes sense to do so. Having said that, that's not a conclusion we can make today. We're still finalizing the asset allocation results. Secondly, we always have to consider liquidity needs in our portfolio, other types of market events. But to the extent we have assets and JGBs are certainly one example if they're in AFS, where that possibility exists, and we would certainly look at that. As you know, the majority of our non-JGB assets are primarily in private placements. So those opportunities are limited just because of the liquidity constraints on those type of assets. So we'll explore those opportunities and report -- if we see good investment opportunities to make that type of swap, we would certainly entertain doing those. But nothing is planned for it at this early stage of the new asset allocation strategy.","Kenneth S. Janke","John, this is Ken. Just as a reminder, we came into the year thinking that we've have about JPY 800 billion of investable cash for the year. It's now at about JPY 1.3 trillion primarily because of the much better sales that we've had, coupled with very strong persistencies. So the big -- there may be swap opportunities, but the big challenge remains to putting that significant cash flow to work.","Daniel P. Amos","We're talking about JPY 15 billion in new money this year.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I understand. I was thinking about it from the perspective of your JGB investments given the direction of rates are probably capital gains that might be helpful for your capture of some of the NOLs.","Kenneth S. Janke","That's on our mind, too.","Daniel P. Amos","That's on our mind.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then the second question I have is another one maybe for Eric and it's just recognizing how much conditions in Europe have deteriorated here in at least the recent several weeks, if not little a bit longer, thinking about, for instance, Spanish sovereign debt as one example. I'm just wondering what your watch list looks like. How that's perhaps changed over the past few months.","Eric M. Kirsch","Yes, actually, in terms of our watch list, it hasn't necessarily increased in total because our watch least has a number of parameters that factor in price movement, ratings agency actions and a few other variables. So things like Spain and sovereign debt were on our radar screen. However, within the watch list, of course, we have different grades of sort of how much we're concerned about it or not. So that part has changed within the watch list. And as I have said earlier in the year, certainly at our FAB, there's no doubt you all understand what our European exposures are, so we will be impacted by the volatility in Europe and actions by the rating agencies. And as I've said, I certainly expect it on  our holdings ratings migration. I think that was fairly well forecasted by the agencies and therefore would impact our holdings. But with respect to the volatility, in the first quarter, as we know, Europe calmed down; second quarter, extremely high volatility, similar to what we've seen last year. And I said if that volatility was high, then the financial impact to our holdings would be greater. If that volatility stayed lower, then the financial impact would be lower while we had some ratings migration. And the second quarter is just, unfortunately, an example of that volatility going very high and having some impact to our holdings, particularly in Spain with the 2 bonds we decided to impair.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joanne Smith of Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Okay. So I just want to go back to the sales guidance or sales objective for Japan for a minute because you said that you expect 0% to 5% growth in the second half in Japan. You're expecting the sale of this 5-pay WAYS to go away basically. I know that they've reached the cap in the banks. With sales, excluding WAYS in the second quarter relatively flat, what are you doing to offset what you're going to see in terms of that huge decline in the sale of WAYS?","Daniel P. Amos","Well, I think, first of all, I think this low interest rate environment is going to drive people to look at the 10-pay or 15 or even 20-pay WAYS that we have. So I think there'll be some shift from the 5 to the 10 and 15. I think even the discounted advance premium cut in half from 1% to 0.5% is great for us, but it's still the best buy out there for consumers that are spending money. So I think, although it will slow down some, I still think you're going to see that it's still the best -- one of the best buys out there in the market. And then finally, I think the introduction of the new Gentle EVER is going to impact sales and so all of those things, together, I think, will make us fall in that 0% to 5%. And you'll remember that fourth quarter is a monster of a quarter. So I think third quarter will be up slightly, but fourth quarter's the one we're going against the really big numbers.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","And Dan, what is it about the cancer product right now that's causing sales to be weak? Is it that you need a refresher for that product? Is it the tax benefit that went away? Do you have anything planned in terms of new introductions on cancer?","Daniel P. Amos","Yes, we have plans to reengage the field force and our marketing guys are working on that. We believe that we'll engage them in the medic -- they take path of least resistance. So whatever the new product is, they move to. So right now we just expect them to move to Gentle EVER. It's not they won't be interested in cancer. It's just that Gentle EVER is the path of least resistance, so they'll start selling that. But we will look at more advertising to encourage the sale of the cancer products. We'll look at more advertising in regard to the medical sales as well. Contest, we basically give now no -- we cut the commissions in half on the sales of our endowment and so they'll shift from that because there's no convention credit or any credit whatsoever and it's half the commissions. So that'll move them back to the other products. So it's just several things that tie together that, I think, will push it that way.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mark Finkelstein of Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just one clarification, please, I think for Eric. Should we be assuming that the majority of cash in the back half of the year will be invested in this new strategy? I mean I know you're still finalizing the allocation, but how should we think about this 2.5% to 3.25% yield?","Eric M. Kirsch","Yes, I would think of it as a gradual walk that'll become a power walk that'll become even stronger. So we've just initiated the program. Our intent is as market conditions allow and investment teams find good opportunities, to increase that allocation to the investment grade corporate space. So over the third quarter, at least, my current expectation is approximately 2\/3 of our new money that comes in up to that could go into this investment program. But it will be dependent on market conditions and investment opportunities that we see. As we gain more confidence in the workings of this program and assuming market conditions remain favorable, towards the end of the third quarter we'll reexamine the fourth quarter and decide on the asset allocation there. So if things go well, I would expect this program to continue to gain momentum and be a more significant portion of our new money cash flows.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up. At the May Investor Day, you talked a little bit about strategies and structures to maybe accelerate monetization of the deferred tax asset. Is there any there any update on that?","Kenneth S. Janke","Yes, Mark, this is Ken. There are actually a -- there's a couple of strategies that we're pursuing. I still can't get into a lot of details, but we remain pretty optimistic that we'll be able to generate some gains and hopefully address the combination of taking care of some current period losses and also the carryforwards in future periods. But it involves a lot of market work, legal work. There's -- we want to make sure we -- that the regulators are aware of it, for instance. So we're continuing to work at it and it's a pretty high priority here, but I just can't give a lot of detail at this time.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Do you think it could be a 2012 event?","Kenneth S. Janke","Yes, yes. Remember, though, that when you generate gains, those gains first go to current -- to offset current period losses. And with the LME exercise that we had largely completed, the program, in the first part of the year, we had generated significant losses, about $0.5 billion. So the first $0.5 billion of gains will go towards offsetting that. So we've got to think a little bit strategically about when we would pull the trigger to take care of some of the losses this year while also keeping some of the powder dry to try and address some of the carryforwards over the next few years.","Operator","And our next question will come from Suneet Kamath of UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question, I guess, is a bigger question for Dan. As you think about the Japan business and the mix of new products coming on the books, as you look beyond this year and even next year, just kind of looking further out, do you ever think we'll get back to a period of time where the third-sector products are a larger or the dominant contributor in terms of mix or the contributions to growth, or has the market changed so much where kind of going forward you're still going to be focusing on the these investment-oriented types of products?","Daniel P. Amos","No, I think there'll be a shift back more toward third sector. I still believe there's the potential for the co-pays and deductibles to go up again. I mean, we're at 30%. I've seen it go from 0% to 10% to 20% to 30%. I still believe there's the potential for it to go to 50%. If there is, there'll be more demand for our products than ever before. That isn't to say that it'll happen, but I never thought it would get to 30%. One of the things that's driving the market right now and the sale of the life products is low interest rate environment. If interest rates move up, that's positive for us in many ways. I think that if the interest rates move up, we won't see as much life insurance sold through WAYS, so that'll move down. So I think it's a balance. But I think, it's been a surprise how much life insurance we've written and I'm excited to see the profit margin, the opportunity for expansion in that. But I don't see that as our main thrust going forward.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up question is again on the Japan business and the banks. Obviously, you're preparing for the potential for disintermediation if rates spike. But I guess my question is even if rates don't spike and we get 5 years out and the surrender charges go away, I mean why wouldn't the banks just churn the product anyway to get another commission? And I guess the example I'm thinking about is like the U.S. variable annuity business where once the surrender charges are up, the advisor sort of churn the product through 1035s or whatever, get a new commission and obviously that has an impact, adverse impact, on the underlying company that's offering the product. Why wouldn't the banks do that?","Kriss Cloninger","This is Kriss. I'm going to just speculate that the FSA does watch agent behavior in Japan. And if the agents did something not in the interest of policyholders, then there are potential problems associated with that. There was a lot of agent training that went to preparing the banks to sell the WAYS products. And keep in mind that even though surrender charges go away, there are still significant benefits in the optionality associated with the WAYS product at the maturity age. So I think that we would argue with the banks that they would be doing a disservice to their policyholders to rewrite things, almost even in the event of change in interest rates.","Daniel P. Amos","And Toru, do you  have any comments you'd like to make on that? You were a banker before you were an insurance man, how about you?","Toru Tonoike","I think that Kriss is absolutely right. In the eyes of the Japanese regulator, the thought of the action is probably will look like something very inappropriate from the viewpoint of the consumer's interest. Banks are very, very ultrasensitive to their reputation. So I don't think that any bank would like to do that just simply because they wish to increase the commissions. The reputation is more important for them. Just a small -- it's a relatively small portion of that profit for the banks anyway. So I don't think that, that's going to happen in Japan.","Daniel P. Amos","And remember, we've only been selling it a year and we'll be out of it.","Operator","And our last question will come from Ed Spehar of Bank of America.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The question I have is on the WAYS profit margin. Kriss, I think the examples you gave that FAB with the 2.5% new money was based on the current product, is that correct? So it wasn't taking into account lower assumed interest rate or a change in the discount advance premium?","Kriss Cloninger","You are absolutely correct, Ed. It was a current product priced at 1.65% interest. If the standard interest rate goes down to 1%, which we expect it will, we will reprice at a lower yield and achieve a greater spread, which would improve the profitability of the revised product. The competitors would have to do similar pricing action. So we wouldn't be at a disadvantage competitively.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess my question is what's the risk that you're overshooting now? If the new money yields are going to be 2.5% at the low end and you're making 2 pricing changes, it would seem like the margin you're going to be getting as you look out into next year on this product could be 30%. I mean that's -- I think the margin was pretty close to the internal rate of return on the product, at least that's how you described, I believe, in the past. I mean, is the 30% internal rate of return really a -- I mean are you going to the point where the sales are going to go away?","Daniel P. Amos","Well, let me just make a comment about that. I think the real question becomes how competitors will view this. If we move with a herd mentality as we always have, and I'm really not talking about the discounted advance premium; that's kind of a no-brainer and won't be any trouble. It would be the rate decrease -- I mean the interest rate decrease or the rate increase in April. We would view it at that time according to what was going on. And we would move with everybody else. So -- but I think the trend that you're seeing is a very strong trend in the right direction of what we want to see. And the way things have moved in today's world, I think we've just got to wait a little closer and watch it, but I think that there is that upside for that happening.","Kriss Cloninger","Let me just add that this life insurance stuff is a long-term business. It's not just a quarter-to-quarter business and you need to have a bit of a long-term perspective on it. We've suffered low margins here recently over the last year, 1.5 years. And I think we would like to have opportunity to restore some of those margins and to help fund some of the realized losses we've taken due to the weak investment environment. So a concern about making too much money is not at the top of my list right now, Ed.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess I'm not worried about making too much money. I'm just worried about the idea that the WAYS, which is a big contributor to sales, go to 0.","Daniel P. Amos","Well, don't worry. We're not going to let that happen. I'm worried about that. I meet on that all the time. There's a balance in everything we do. Just like everybody is panicked when they saw interest rates heading down and worried about WAYS becoming unprofitable. I said, calm down, we'll have it fixed. And we have and got the thing -- we can't let it get too high either. You're absolutely right. Everything is about moderation, nothing in excess. And that's the way we look at this.","Robin Y. Wilkey","All right. Finally, I would like to remind everybody that we're going to be holding our Tokyo Analyst Meeting on Monday, September 10. And hopefully, we'll able to update you on many of the things that we discussed today. So please, make sure that you call us or register online if you would like to attend. Also, I want to thank you for joining us today. And if you'd like to follow up on any of the items, please feel free to call Tom or myself, and we'll be glad to follow up with anything.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Young, Vice President of Aflac Investor & Rating Agency Relations.","David Young","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter call. This morning, we will be hearing remarks from Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated, about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Then, Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated, will follow with more details about our financial results.","In addition, joining us this morning during the Q&A portion are members of our management team in the United States. Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; Eric Kirsch, Global Chief Investment Officer; Rich Williams, Chief Distribution Officer; Al Riggieri, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary; and Max Brod\u00e9n, Deputy CFO and Treasurer.","We are also joined by members of our executive management team in Tokyo at Aflac Life Insurance Japan; Charles Lake, Chairman and Representative Director; President of Aflac International, Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director; Todd Daniels, Director and Principal Financial Officer; Koji Ariyoshi, Director and Head of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature.","Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our Annual Report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. The earnings release is available on the Investors page of Aflac\u2019s website at investors.aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures.","I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Dan. Dan?","Dan Amos","Thank you, David, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin, I would like to briefly address news reports regarding sales practices at Japan Post Insurance.","As CEO, let me start out by saying that we are not aware of any compliance issues related to the sale of Aflac\u2019s cancer insurance by Japan Post or Japan Post Insurance at this time nor have we found any issue today. Aflac has an extremely strong compliance culture in Japan and The United States.","In Japan specifically, we have compliance processes in place with all of our alliance partners, including Japan Post. I am fully committed to upholding the strong compliance culture as it is essential to maintaining the strength of our brand, reputation and franchise. Under our 2013 alliance agreement with Japan Post Group, the alliance Compliance Committee meets quarterly to review compliance trends and issues relating to cancer insurance sales within the postal\u2019s channel and take action as appropriate.","In addition, in response to this recent development, we are conducting a voluntary review of whether there are market conduct problems similar to those being reported regarding Japan Post Insurance products and the Japan Post channel.","As I mentioned, at this time, we are not aware of any such problems related to the sale of Aflac cancer insurance by Japan Post or Japan Post Insurance, but we\u2019ll work closely with them to ensure that our strong compliance practices are upheld. Should we become aware of any practices that are inconsistent with our compliance standards, we will take the necessary action and steps to address it immediately.","In the interim, we will continue to offer Aflac cancer insurance as part of our strategic alliance, and we do not believe that this impacts Japan Post Holdings investment in Aflac Incorporated stuff.","Now let me begin by talking about the second quarter of 2019, which rounded out a strong first half of the year for Aflac in terms of earnings, capital generation and financial strength. We are facing certain short-term headwinds on the sales front and the results are trending slightly below our expectations.","I will touch on sales dynamics in a moment. But in terms of driving long-term value as we remain confident in hitting our important earned premium targets for the year. Let me give you more details, starting with our Japan operations. Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor, generated strong financial results. Brad will provide more details. But let me just say that in the end terms, the results on adjusted basis were better than expected for the quarter, posting near-record pretax profit margins.","As you know, we take a longer-term perspective when it comes to our business. Our focus remains on maintaining our leadership in the third sector insurance products that are less interest rate sensitive and have strong and stable margins. At the same time, we complement this core business with similarly profitable first sector protection products. To that end, we will continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduce innovative new products that our policyholders want and need.","We are also continuing to fully engage a wide-reaching distribution network. Our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success as do our alliance partners. We continue to be Japan\u2019s No. 01 provider of cancer and medical insurance.","Consistent with our outlook comments in the first quarter, sales results in terms of year-over-year comparisons were heavily influenced by the successful launch of our breast cancer product in the second quarter of 2018. As a reminder, that was a quarter where we enjoyed a whopping 47% increase in cancer sales and a 16% increase in third sector sales. In addition, the approach to refreshment of our medical product in 2019 takes a rider versus a whole policy approach.","This is designed for improved economics that naturally results in lower reported sales. Recognizing this change in approach, we are pleased with the increase in medical sales as well as the overall cancer insurance and sales production in our associate channel.","Taking everything into consideration, we believe it\u2019s prudent to assume that there is a risk in achieving our 2019 guidance of the low-to mid-single-digit decline in the third sector and first sector product sales. However, we remain on track to hit our first sector protection and third sector earned premium growth of 1% to 2% increase for 2019.","Turning to Aflac U.S. We are pleased with the financial performance. The pretax profit margin exceeded our expectations both for the quarter and for the first half of the year, which is significant because these results also reflect ongoing investments in our platform, distribution and customer experience. With respect to Aflac U.S. sales, our broker strategies have paid off, and that business continues to grow bolstered by healthy pipeline of business.","We have also been encouraged by the progress on the direct-to-consumer platform and associates alliance, which are still in the early stage. Our main challenge within our career distribution is recruiting and retaining associates and then translating into average weekly producers.","As you know, recruiting commissioned-only associates in a strong economy has always been a headwind. Setting aside economic conditions, there are also a couple of tactical issues that have impacted sales results in the first half of 2019, yet we believe are positive for the long-term and profitable earned premium growth. These tactical issues have resulted in essentially flat sales year-to-date, which makes it harder to reach the low end of the guidance range.","To put this in perspective and despite these headwinds, we still anticipate marginal growth over last year\u2019s record level of sales. Ultimately, we seek to grow profitable earned premium and continue to anticipate achieving a 2% to 3% earned premium growth target in 2019.","Looking to the long term, as you may have seen, a few weeks ago, when we announced an agreement to acquire Argus Dental & Vision, Argus is a high-quality respected provider of turnkey administrative services supporting Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Network Dental and Vision products on behalf of large health care providers. This is very important strategic move for Aflac U.S. and that it provides a platform to build Aflac\u2019s network dental and vision products. And most importantly, it places our naming on the front page of the benefit enrollment process.","Along with supporting the growth of Argus administrative franchise, we see Argus as providing Aflac with an opportunity for greater penetration into the approximately 460,000 businesses we currently serve. We also believe it opens the door to new clients that respect our brand and strong customer service model. We expect our dental and vision strategy will serve to improve recruiting and retention of agents and drives sales growth through broker and direct to consumer.","Argus announcement is consistent with our approach to balancing our financial strength with reinvesting in our business, increasing the dividend and repurchasing shares. While Aflac has been more than an organic growth story, we recognize that prudent investment is critical to our growth strategy and driving efficiencies that will impact the bottom line for the long-term. With this in mind, we look for opportunities to accelerate growth through measured bolt-on transactions that build upon our core competency of supplemental insurance and leverage our brand and distribution strengths without requiring extensive amounts of capital.","At the same time, we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of the bondholder, the shareholder and the policyholder. Finally, this does not impact our plan to repurchase in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion of our shares in 2019, with this range allowing us to be more tactical. This gives you an overview of the quarter and the first six months of the year.","As you can see, we remain focused on the initiatives designed to drive growth both in the U.S. and in Japan. Looking ahead, we believe our strong earnings growth will reflect the underlying earnings power of our insurance operations in Japan and The United States. It will also reflect our prudent approach to deploying excess capital in a way that balances the interest of all stakeholders. As always, we are working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objective, while also ensuring we deliver our promise to the policyholders. I\u2019ll conclude by saying that I continue to be excited about Aflac\u2019s future growth.","Now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Fred to cover the financial results. Fred?","Fred Crawford","Thank you, Dan. Results for the second quarter extended our strong start to the year on the earnings front, exceeding our forecasted expectations. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.13 represent a 5.6% increase over the 2018 quarter. Earnings benefited from continued strong margins both in Japan and in the U.S. Our reported results were modestly impacted by weakening of the yen as compared to the 2018 period, reducing our earnings by $0.01 per share in the quarter.","With respect to adjusted earnings, we are gradually building an alternative investment portfolio, which includes private equity and real estate equity investments. On a consolidated basis, we have committed $1.3 billion to our alternative investment portfolio. Of this amount, approximately $460 million has actually been called and invested to-date. In the quarter, variable investment income generated from this building portfolio contributed approximately $0.01 to adjusted earnings per share when compared to our expectations.","Turning to our Japan segment. Earned premium for our first quarter protection type and third sector products increased 1.7% and in line with expectations. As noted in my first quarter comments, a portion of our medical sales in 2017 was a newly introduced two-pay product, which will modestly impact third sector earned premium turns. Again, it\u2019s important to note that earned premium strain from paid-up policies does not impact profitability.","Our total benefit ratio came in at 68.9% and slightly below our annual guidance range. We continue to enjoy favorable third sector benefit ratios and associated reserve adjustments as well as the continued shift in business mix from our first sector towards third sector, which carries a lower benefit ratio. Our expense ratio in Japan was 20.5%, consistent with our projected range.","We expect our expense ratio will rise in the second half of the year, as we accelerate product development expenses readying for 2020, along with natural timing of sales and marketing spend. Net investment income in our Japan segment contributed to our strong results. As mentioned earlier, variable investment income contributed, along with build in our floating rate loan portfolio. The low rate environment is certainly a headwind in terms of new money rates.","Recognizing market expectations for a Fed rate cut, it\u2019s important to recall that we have locked in approximately 75% of Japan\u2019s floating rate income and 90% of our hedge cost for 2019. Thus, we anticipate very little impact to investment income. Overall, in Japan, we recorded a very strong pretax profit margin of 21.9%, consistent with our first quarter results and coming in higher than our forecasted range.","Turning to the U.S. results. Despite weakness in year-to-date sales, earned premium was up a steady 2.3%. Our total benefit ratio came in at 50.2% and at the lower end of our annual guidance range and generally consistent with recent claims trends in our mix of business.","Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 34.8%. While higher than 2018 levels, year-to-date, our expense ratio was traveling at the lower end of our 2019 outlook range of 35% to 37%. This favorable year-to-date results are attributed to timing issues and the pace of investment in our distribution platform, promotional spend and investment in digital initiatives. Much like Japan, we expect our expense ratio to increase throughout the remainder of the year.","Net investment income in the U.S. is running a bit ahead of our plan, due in part to modest increase in allocation to corporates and variable investment income. Note also that we start pulling excess capital out of the U.S. in the second half of the year, which has an impact on segment investment income. Overall, in the U.S., we recorded a strong pretax profit margin of 20.6%, consistent with our first quarter results and at the high end of our forecasted range.","In our corporate segment, the main driver of improved earnings year-over-year is the amortized hedge income driven by our corporate hedging program. The program reduces our economic exposure to the yen while lowering enterprise-wide hedge cost. Amortized hedge income contributed $20 million on the pretax basis to the quarter\u2019s earnings with a notional position at the end of the quarter of $3 billion.","Turning to capital. Japan\u2019s solvency margin ratio has increased with the drop in rates, now exceeding 1,000%. If you remove the impact of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, our SMR ratio stands at roughly 900%. Our estimated U.S. risk-based capital ratio at quarter end is in the 700% range. RBC is a bit elevated as we have planned increases in operating dividends and the drawdown of $500 million of excess capital scheduled for later this year. We continue to target an RBC ratio of 500% for year-end 2019.","We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion of capital and liquidity at the holding company. This is a bit reduced from traditional levels, but simply due to timing, with material subsidiary dividends paid in the second half of the year. Asset quality remains strong with very little in the way of impairments. In the quarter, we repurchased 6.9 million shares of Aflac common stock for approximately $357 million. We are maintaining our current range for repurchase of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion in 2019.","I\u2019d like to follow-up on Dan\u2019s comments and make a few brief remarks on our definitive agreement to acquire Argus Dental & Vision. The transaction represents a commitment of $75 million in capital at closing and an additional $21 million in consideration paid over three years based on achieving certain performance targets.","As noted in our announcement, we do not see the transaction impacting 2019 financial guidance for Aflac U.S., and there is no material impact to our capital deployment plans. We anticipate only a modest impact in 2020 results as it will be a natural integration and building year. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions, and we expect to close in the fourth quarter.","Stepping back, the Argus announcement is consistent with our broader approach to tactical M&A. We seek to acquire respected platforms with knowledgeable executive teams for a measured amount of capital at risk. In this case, our return on investment is driven by continued growth in the administrative services business of Argus, the build of profitable Aflac network dental and vision premium and the indirect benefit of further lift in our overall supplemental worksite franchise.","In terms of our annual EPS outlook for the year, we are guiding to the high end of our currency neutral range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share. We are certainly tracking year-to-date at a pace that exceeds the range. However, we are only halfway through 2019. And as mentioned, timing of expenses has contributed to our year-to-date results, and we have important growth and platform investments scheduled in the second half of the year.","In closing, the second quarter represents a continuation of our strong earnings and margins, both in Japan and the U.S. Capital generation remains robust. And our Argus announcement represents a sound tactical move to drive growth in the U.S.","I\u2019ll now hand the call back to David to begin our Q&A session. David?","David Young","Thank you, Fred. Now we are ready to take your questions. But first, let me ask that you please limit yourself to one initial question and one related follow-up, to allow other participants an opportunity to their questions. We will now take the first question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Your may now ask your question.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. Good morning. So I had a question on sales and specifically first on U.S. sales. Teresa, if you could talk about what drove the weakness this quarter? And I think you haven\u2019t had weak \u2013 negative sales in the U.S. for several years. And are you still confident in results improving and you being able to achieve sales close to, I think, previously you said they\u2019d be stable for the year versus 2018?","Teresa White","Jimmy, I\u2019ll let Rich speak to the sales question. I\u2019ll just make a strategic comment. One of the things that we\u2019re really focusing on is earned premium growth. And some of the tactical things that Rich will talk about, some of the decisions that we made have impacted the sales side from an earned premium growth, profitable earned premium growth perspective. So I\u2019ll let Rich speak specifically to the sales.","Rich Williams","Thank you, Teresa. As Dan had mentioned, there were couple of tactical issues that created some headwinds in the quarter alone that we actually believe will be long-term favorable for sales and for earned premium growth. The first issue that we speak to, which occurs from time to time is simply large case volatility, and this also can create a little bit of noise and persistency, but we are actually comfortable with those decisions and confident it\u2019s favorable to the company.","Second, we consistently evaluate our partnerships to ensure they are profitable. And in the quarter, we made a decision to no longer move forward with a particular partnership, which impacts sales in the short term, but in terms of profitable earned premium growth will actually be positive to the company.","And then, I think, the third part of your question, again, Dan alluded to the fact they were essentially flat year-to-date. We realized it would take a favorable second half of the year. We performed like that in prior years, but we know it\u2019ll take a good finish to the second half of the year, which is why I think Dan mentioned we anticipate seeing growth for the year. We\u2019ll leave it at that.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And if I could just ask one more on Japan sales, have you seen any impact from \u2013 on your sales via the Post because of all the commotion and sort of publicity about sales practices at the Post? And do you feel that this could affect sort of the long \u2013 the Post and sales via the channel longer term, even though it\u2019s not related directly to your sales?","Dan Amos","I\u2019ll start with that and then if Japan wants to step in, they can say something. But what I would say is, is our projection is, as anytime something of this magnitude is brought up with \u2013 in this particular case Japan Post, it\u2019s taken everyone\u2019s attention over there. And so with that means there\u2019s less attention on sales. So I do \u2013 we do expect some impact. We\u2019re in July. So we don\u2019t have numbers that we know that are representative of what the quarter will turn out to be. So it\u2019s too hard to tell.","But certainly, in my earlier comments, we are expecting some softness, and we\u2019ll just have to watch it and see. And accordingly, we\u2019ll \u2013 the one thing I will say is we\u2019re having a better than what we had anticipated with our existing distribution channel. So they are doing quite well. So we will continue to push there as well, and then we\u2019ll just take it and see what happens.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. You may now ask your question.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. A question for Teresa about Argus. Can you talk about your expectation for the integration and the rollout of Aflac-branded network products? I think one of the main key appeal for the Argus acquisition is to move into the network\u2019s dental products as opposed to the indemnity products that you offer. So maybe you can talk about some of the opportunities that you see and kind of where you see the sales can get to?","Teresa White","So I\u2019ll start out. And Rich Williams, I have to give him credit. This is one of the properties that he brought on to the Aflac platform. One of the things that really we feel good about, as it relates to Argus, is that it will accelerate our earned premium growth beginning 2020, and we believe that, and places Aflac on the first page of the benefits enrollment. We believe that that\u2019s good for us from an access standpoint, but we also feel that it will be great from a persistency perspective as well. Specifically to the tactical pieces and the integration, I\u2019ll let Rich speak to that. Rich?","Rich Williams","All right. Thank you, Teresa, and I\u2019ll just echo your comments. Obviously, the demand for network dental and vision continues to be very high. It is very consistent with our growth strategy in accessing all the markets that we know we want to serve. And it actually allows us to reach through all three of the distribution approaches that Dan mentioned our career agents, our brokers and direct-to-consumer. Again, just echoing the comments, I think, Fred mentioned it, we will in 2020 will have a measured rollout. And then in 2021, going forward, we\u2019ll have a national rollout, and we\u2019re very excited about this.","Dan Amos","The one thing I would note is, this dental and vision is predominantly for small- to medium-size accounts. The large accounts are much more aggressive and less profitable, and so we see this \u2013 it\u2019s that correct space\u2026","Teresa White","We say it as a primary play. It\u2019s a small business, and that\u2019s where we see the greatest need. However, because of the Aflac brand and our partnerships with larger businesses, our larger brokers houses, we see an opportunity there as well.","Humphrey Lee","So just looking at dental and vision sales right now, they\u2019re kind of probably running a little less than $80 million a year or so. Do you expect that to kind of maybe becoming multiples of that kind of in a few years? How should we think about the sales growth trajectory?","Rich Williams","So obviously we have projections that we\u2019ve looked at over the long term for the network dental and vision. And I think what we would like to do is lay it out in more detail the entire business plan at the Financial Analyst Briefing in September.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Andrew Kligerman of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Andrew Kligerman","Great. Thank you. Good morning. First question just back to Japan Post. It was my sense that you were considering rolling out a new medical product in the second half of the year. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s probably on hold. And any color around that?","Fred Crawford","Well, let me make sure that you understand the record \u2013 and this is Fred. There\u2019s been no announcement or official plan to rollout any medical or additional third sector product within the Japan Post system. What is true is that one of the pillars of the alliance is to explore product extension, and it\u2019s only natural that it would likely involve \u2013 to the degree we rollout additional product, it would likely involve third sector products. I wouldn\u2019t be as specific as to say medical products per se. But those discussions are under development. As we\u2019ve said before, this year 2019, is much more of a building out plans and looking for those opportunities that makes sense.","What I\u2019d also say is that it is very important. It\u2019s always been very important that when we think about product, any new product in the Japan Post system that there\u2019s really three parties involved. Obviously, Aflac and obviously the Japan Post postal system where we currently distribute cancer product. But we also are mindful of Japan Post Insurance and the type of product development activities they have underway. And so it\u2019s really the three parties that need to come together and understand those dynamics when it comes to expanded product. But right now, there really are no official plans that are prepared for any type of announcement. It\u2019s really more a planning year on that front.","Dan Amos","Ariyoshi or Koji, would you \u2013 I mean, Koide, would you like to make any comment?","Masatoshi Koide","This is Koide from Aflac Japan. So let\u2019s comment [indiscernible].","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. Should I follow up with the second question?","David Young","Go ahead please.","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. Thank you. So the Japan benefits ratio was superb at 68.9% versus your guided 69% to 71% for the year, and it was clearly led by the third sector products. Do you think this is the new normal? Can we expect to see either low end or even below low end of that guidance that you had laid out?","Fred Crawford","I think one thing is for sure is that, the benefit ratio thus far year-to-date in Japan is traveling at the low end of our expected range. It is based on fundamentals in terms of the claims dynamics and associated reserve adjustments.","Interesting, last year, you may recall the benefit ratio was somewhat brought down by lapse in reissue activity where you\u2019d see naturally a lower benefit ratio and a higher expense ratio, as you release reserves on products and then write down DAC, et cetera. So you had a number of moving parts that were influencing ratios last year. So I think there is some stability in that favorable level of benefit ratios. I think you have to be careful because claims activity can move around. But given the size of our product set and the amount of in-force we have, they tend to be fairly stable.","One thing I would note though is you have really more of an influence from mix than you do downward trends in third sector benefit ratio. If you look at third sector benefit ratio over the years, over the last two, three years, you\u2019ve certainly seen that downward pressure and that\u2019s helping results. And I would say, it\u2019s stabilizing around the current levels. But what you see in terms of our reported benefit ratios on a consolidated basis is largely attributed to the mix shift from first sector to third sector. But the answer to your question, Andrew, is yes, there\u2019s nothing that tells us that we would see certainly any deterioration. Material improvement, I think that\u2019s a bit speculative at this point, but it\u2019s certainly favorable.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Scott","Good morning. First question I had also on Japan Post. I just wanted to revisit it because I guess when I look at what Japan Post disclosed, I mean it sounded like a fair amount of the concern was specifically around lapse and reissue. And I know that you guys have had a fair amount of lapse and reissue in the couple of years as you\u2019ve expanded into additional Japan Post offices. So I guess what gives you comfort that the lapse and reissue activity that you saw is somehow different from the lapse and reissue activity that Japan Post is concerned about?","Fred Crawford","I\u2019ll start. This is Fred. I\u2019ll start by answering and then certainly welcome any commentary from our Japan colleagues. But let me start by saying that it\u2019s very difficult for us to make any assumptions around what the dynamics are as it relates to lapse and replacement or any sort of redundancy of policy dynamics that are being investigated on the Japan Post and Japan Post Insurance side. So I don\u2019t want to speculate on the nature of those products other than to say it\u2019s very different than a cancer product.","In the case of our cancer products, remember, a great portion, if not all of the lapse and reissue activity, is really related to the fact that it is a greatly improved product. When you go four years between the improvement of an old cancer product and a new cancer product, you\u2019re talking about fairly substantial advancements in the quality of coverage because there\u2019s been substantial advancements in the quality of care treatment that has developed in the cancer space.","The other dynamic that we added this year is we have a rider feature on the cancer product that allows for a premium waiver feature while you\u2019re on claim, and that was new and also very attractive to the client and when you do a lapse, and so for starters, there\u2019s really strong dynamics around the improvement for the client to move into a new cancer product. Now when you do, do a lapse and reissue, one of the things that you have to be very careful about is we\u2019re reunderwriting the individual, okay? So there\u2019s a new underwriting process. And our policies have essentiality a delay, if you will, coverage doesn\u2019t kick in for about three months or so. That\u2019s a natural feature of cancer products.","So when you buy the cancer product, you go for a period, a wait period, so to speak, of about three months. And one of the things that we\u2019re very, very careful about in our compliance standards and it\u2019s all with the customer focus is we do not want any of our customers to go through any period of time where they have inadvertently gone naked on coverage or have no coverage, particularly with something that can be a severe and impactful as cancer diagnosis. So we take great strides to ensure that there is that level of consistency and coverage throughout, and that naturally will have a bit of an overlapping period for lapse and reissue, but it\u2019s in the spirit of protecting the client.","So I just want to make sure you understand. It\u2019s a very different product dynamic. It requires a different type of attention to compliance to look out for the customers\u2019 interest, and that makes it a very different dynamic than what we understand to be the situation in the broader level of investigation in products.","Dan Amos","Any comments, Koide.","Masatoshi Koide","We do not have any additional comments.","Dan Amos","Okay.","Alex Scott","So maybe my follow-up, just switching over, I guess, to reserves, rate assumptions, I mean can you comment at all on sort of what you guys assume in terms of ultimate rate assumptions? And I know a lot of your products dissects these. So I think there\u2019s plenty of margin there. I wouldn\u2019t expect any kind of impact as we go through actuarial review process, et cetera. But any impact on DAC or anything else we should be thinking about as we kind of head into that?","Fred Crawford","No. I would say, in general, our products, particularly as it relates to reserve adequacy and reserve reviews are not very sensitive to rate estimates. You will naturally \u2013 if you are resetting your long-term rate assumptions in your gross premium valuation work, you will naturally see that as a net negative to the margins you have. But it\u2019s so overwhelmed by morbidity margin that we have in our products that it tends simply not to be a mover. We disclose, as you know, our gross premium valuation margins. And I\u2019ve said this to my team here coming from companies that are in the retirement space, the type of GPV margins we have on our actuarial analysis, I\u2019ve never seen before in my career.","So you have very large actuarial margins up into the mid-teens and higher, and that\u2019s driven by morbidity. So even when you take a downdraft of margin compression related to low prolonged interest rates, we just simply have a comfortable position. It\u2019s not true across all product categories. Certainly, first sector more savings oriented products can be a bit more pressured, but they\u2019re, again, because of our investment strategies backing those products, we have healthy margins. So I don\u2019t have any concern on that front. But it is, of course, is a headwind to net investment income. That\u2019s really more on earnings and GAAP issue, but it\u2019s certainly not keeping me awake on the reserve front.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. You may now ask your question.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. One more question on the Japan Post. They announced that they\u2019re going \u2013 they plan to eliminate sales targets. Does that also apply to their sale of Aflac\u2019s products or just their own?","Dan Amos","Koide, take that, please?","Masatoshi Koide","Yes. We agreed with Japan Post that our sales targets will continue.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. So they will continue to have them for your product. Thanks. And then, Fred, on short-term interest rates, I know you mentioned there wouldn\u2019t be much impact in 2019. As you move into 2020, how would you expect impact from the floaters relative to hedging costs to come through? Should they mostly offset or would you see some impact?","A \u2013 Fred Crawford","Yes, you have it right. Because we have hedged the majority, if not all of our floating rate portfolio in Japan, as you roll off the locked in LIBOR rates and the locked in hedge costs and you roll into 2020, all things held equal, you end up rolling into, yes, lower LIBOR rates but also lower associated hedge cost. And therefore, the net effect of those issues on net investment income end up being muted. Now there can be some dislocation in the market between hedge costs coming down and LIBOR rates coming down. It tends to generally be a rule of thumb that they\u2019re aligned and correlated, but there can be dislocation. But absent any sort of minor dislocation, we think net investment income is somewhat protected because of the just the nature of the fact that we have a hedge dynamic on the floating rate instruments.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. You may now ask your question.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. Maybe a follow-up on that line on just the investment income. And Eric, if you could comment about where you\u2019re investing new money? And if there\u2019s any change sort of strategically in terms of where you\u2019re investing? And if the kind of the floating rate portfolio still makes the most sense and is getting attractive yields at this point?","Eric Kirsch","Sure. Our investment plan and where we\u2019re investing is consistent with our investment plans. No major left or right turns. And it\u2019s also consistent with the strategic asset allocation work that we do with the portfolio. On the margin, as you\u2019re looking forward, there is a point or two of additional U.S. dollar investing relative to yen investing, but that\u2019s consistent with our long-term plans. Within the U.S. allocation, the floaters continue to be attractive for us. But I would emphasize, our criteria is strong, strong underwriting. It is equally why we like the asset class because we get preferred terms and conditions.","But even within those asset classes of middle market loans and transitional real estate, we see some spread compression because they\u2019re attractive in the market. But when I compare those to, say, investment-grade corporates where we have a healthy portfolio and spreads are so tight, we still like the relative value of loans. And one other aspect that I\u2019ll mention. As you look at our new money investments, particularly for the loan portfolio, which are typically three to five to seven years in maturity, a number of those loans has a natural prepayment. Some business plans end up getting completed sooner. Some projects just want to get refinanced. So some of the new investments are simply rolling over from prepayments and finding new loans to replace those. So that\u2019s at a high level some of the things we\u2019re seeing and where we\u2019re investing.","Erik Bass","Thank you. And then one follow-up on the dental acquisition. Just thinking more strategically, I mean, how do you see having that capability changing your competitive position? And does it open doors with either new brokers or new employers that you haven\u2019t been able to access historically?","A \u2013 Fred Crawford","I think yes is certainly the first answer. Dan mentioned in his comments with our existing client base of 460,000 businesses, that\u2019s a great opportunity for cross-sell. But we also know, as Teresa alluded to us getting in the first page the benefits menu that this is going to open new accounts for us especially in that small business marketplace, which also has the halo effect on additional voluntary and supplemental sales.","Dan Amos","The one thing in respect to Japan \u2013 I mean to U.S. group business was we were overwhelmed with the business when we first took it on. And Teresa is making absolutely sure that, that doesn\u2019t happen in this case because we went backwards, before we took one step back \u2013 we took two steps forward. Teresa wants to make sure we take two steps forward. So we\u2019re rolling this out in a more effective manner, and so that\u2019s going to be very important. But everyone is excited about the potential for what it can do long term. Not \u2013 certainly not this year and not even next year because we\u2019re just rolling this out.","Teresa White","We have a limited rollout in 22.","Dan Amos","2021 is the year.","Teresa White","2021 is the year. Absolutely.","Operator","Next question is from the line of John Barnidge of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is now open.","John Barnidge","My questions on U.S. persistency. The last couple of years ticked up in 2Q sequentially, but this year ticked down. I understand it\u2019s modest. But is there any color whether related to the partnership that you stopped dealing what that drove it?","Teresa White","The answer is yes. Consistent with Dan\u2019s remark, we knew we were going to have a little bit of noise as it relates to persistency as we\u2019ve started looking at some of partnerships. And again, the goal is generating high-quality sales with good persistency. And so we\u2019re really trying to drive the earned premium \u2013 profitable earned premium growth perspective. So you\u2019ve got it out in life","John Barnidge","Okay. My follow-up question sticking with the U.S. and that acquisition. I know getting on the first page is really important. I know the penetration of supplemental insurance products in the U.S. is much lower than it is in Japan. Have you thought through like kind of where you think persistency could go in the intermediate and long term because of now having a broader dental and vision and first page product for the broader suite of products that you have?","Fred Crawford","So a couple of things. First of all, network dental and vision does have an element of employer paid. And so consequently, the persistency is certainly higher than we see on our supplemental products. So that\u2019s favorable. But we also know that as they value the network dental and vision product, that can have a halo effect on our sort of our core supplemental benefits. It\u2019s also a different wallet, so that\u2019s another thing that we\u2019re excited about. So less likely for cannibalization of our core supplemental benefit sales. So the combination of those things is what gives us optimism.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","Back to Japan Post, if I could. Dan, can you help us \u2013 I know it\u2019s early days, but can you help us maybe frame the size of this issue in terms of the impact on consumers? I mean, if we go back little over 10 years ago\u2026","Dan Amos","I can\u2019t hear you.","Suneet Kamath","Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?","Dan Amos","Yes.","Suneet Kamath","Perfect. Sorry about that. So what I was trying to get at is if you could help us frame the size of this Japan Post issue, given I acknowledge that it\u2019s early days. We went through that whole claims payment issue little over 10 years ago, and I just want to get a sense of what it\u2019s doing in the competitive dynamics or the consumer in Japan to the extent you can comment?","Dan Amos","I wish I knew. I don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be tremendous, and we certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s long term because we believe Japan Post will fix whatever problems they\u2019ve got as soon and as quickly as they can. I can give you more color on it at the end of the next quarter. But I\u2019ve got to get a quarter under our belt to see. We never had an issue like this where another distribution channel has had a situation like this. And frankly, we don\u2019t know all the inner workings nor should we expect to know what\u2019s going on with Japan Post. We do know that they\u2019re continuing to sell our product, and we know that consumers want and need cancer insurance and will be buying it, and it\u2019s a top line issue in Japan to make sure they are covered. So other than that, I really do not know. But the claims review was an industry issue not specific to one insurer. So other than that, that\u2019s my only comment.","Suneet Kamath","Yes. That\u2019s fair. And I guess Masatoshi","Masatoshi Koide","This is Koide again, Aflac Japan. Let me explain supplementally in Japanese. [Foreign Language] Well, what is actually happening in Japan and the issues faced in Japan is related to Japan Post, but particularly the Japan Post Insurance product. [Foreign Language] So it\u2019s not insurance industry overall issue as we had with the claims issue before. [Foreign Language] That\u2019s it.","Suneet Kamath","That\u2019s helpful. And then my follow-up is, we have been reading in the press, and I don\u2019t know if this is true, but a couple of the other product providers to Japan Post have suspended sales in that channel. Is that what you\u2019re hearing as well? And is that something that you considered?","Dan Amos","No. We did not consider suspending sales. We are licensed in 20-something thousand different post offices. I think other insurers are in much smaller amounts. And we feel our products are too important to suspend with no issue out there concerning us. So absolutely not.","Masatoshi Koide","This is Koide again. Let me explain in Japanese. [Foreign Language] Japan Post and Japan Post Insurance have announced the discontinuance of sales of product of just Japan Post Insurance\u2019s. [Foreign Language] They have not formally announced to not sell products other than their own, including Aflac and other insurers or other providers. [Foreign Language] That\u2019s all from me.","Operator","Thank you. Next question from the line of John Nadel of UBS. Your line is now open.","John Nadel","Thanks. Good morning. May I have one on Japan and one on the U.S. You reiterated the 1% to 2% growth target for net earned premium in Japan. But in the first half of the year, I believe if I got the numbers right, you\u2019re down almost 1% year-over-year. What gets you there in the back half of the year?","Fred Crawford","John, just a clarification. The 1% to 2% increase is really third sector and first sector protection earned premium. What you see in the way of a broader decline in overall premium is really related to predominantly first sector, which by design is coming down in premium. So really our guidance is again specific to third sector and first sector protection premium.","John Nadel","Oh, gotcha. Okay. And so where are you tracking on that particular owning through the first half of the year then?","Fred Crawford","Right on. We had an increase of 1.7%, and so right on our guidance. As I mentioned, John, something to make sure to understand is that, the only reason why it\u2019s a tick below 2%, which was our original outlook is simply because we\u2019ve had to account for the recognition of paid-up policies actually on the third sector side. We issued a medical policy that became very popular in the bank channel back two years ago in 2017. And so we\u2019re seeing some of those paid-up policies come through. But realize that\u2019s really a paid-up issue. So it has no implications for profitability and it\u2019ll work its way through the system","John Nadel","Gotcha. Okay. And the a question on U.S. on the sales side. Teresa, any chance you can help us understand this distributor that you guys have sort of canceled working through? What sort of contribution to your 2018 sales that single distributor accounted for?","Teresa White","So, what we\u2019re really doing is we\u2019re assessing all of our contracts. Some of them are distributors; some of them are accounts, just the type of accounts that we sell. But at the end of the day, what we\u2019re looking at is the overall persistency of the book of business that we have. And with that, we\u2019re making assessments to say whether those folks make sense for us, whether those distributors that sell in specific areas make sense for us, and we\u2019re making those decisions.","Now as to the timing, I\u2019m looking at the full year and making those assessments. And we believe, I think, our persistency is a 12-month rolling persistency. So we see it as working itself out in 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from the line of Thomas Gallagher of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Dan, just a few follow-ups on the Japan Post situation. So just curious, when did Aflac begin its review of the situation? And when would you expect to complete it? And then just a related question. I assume this is going to be probably a longer review by the regulators of Japan Post itself. If it does take a while, was that going to delay its intention to purchase the 7% stake in Aflac at all? Does that come into play? I know you commented a little bit on that before and you didn\u2019t think it would impact it, but just from a timing standpoint, would that potentially impact it?","Fred Crawford","So first, regarding the acquiring of the stock, we have no indication. And maybe, Max why don\u2019t remind everybody of \u2013 Max negotiated that deal together with myself and folks in Japan. So just again remind investors of the agreement related to buying stock.","Max Broden","Yes. So, Japan Post has \u2013 they began \u2013 they announced to the market that they began purchasing our stock in May and they have a 12-month period to purchase our stake in Aflac Incorporated. They will make an announcement to \u2013 through the \u2013 through an SEC registration when they reach 5%. And after that, they will also make announcements as they have another 1% increments. To date, we have no indication of them changing their view in terms of buying Aflac stock. So that\u2019s all I would say about that.","Dan Amos","Okay. And what was your first part of the question?","Thomas Gallagher","Dan, the first part of the question is, when did Aflac begin its review of the sales practices? And when would you expect to complete your \u2013 that review? Do you think it will be done by the time you report 3Q?","Dan Amos","Well, let me point out that the quarterly, the alliance compliance committee meets to discuss any issues, and they\u2019ve been doing it since 2013. So from that standpoint, it\u2019s always been \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t just cover compliance issues. They also relate to just cancer sales and what\u2019s going on in that regard. But as far as our review, we\u2019re just continuing to ask more questions and we will cover in greater detail at the FAB. But right now, we don\u2019t have any drop-dead dates. We\u2019re just monitoring what\u2019s taking place because again we\u2019ve had not a single complaint about it. And so from that standpoint, we\u2019re just going out and making sure that we\u2019re not seeing any other things. But at this time, we just don\u2019t see it as a problem and are moving on by selling our products with that distribution channel.","Thomas Gallagher","Got it. So, you\u2019re not \u2013 you\u2019re actually not doing a formal investigation or review. You\u2019re more monitoring the situation. Is that a fair way to describe it?","Masatoshi Koide","Let me make supplement comment on Aflac Japan.","Thomas Gallagher","Go ahead.","Masatoshi Koide","[Foreign Language]","As Dan has mentioned, ever since 2013, where we have assigned a comprehensive business alliance agreement, we are having this compliance meeting and reviewing compliance on a quarterly basis. And the review that Aflac is conducting on our own is to make sure that that there is no similar example that is being covered in the media in regards to Japan Post Insurance product sales through Japan Post channel. So from that perspective, the scope of that review that we are \u2013 that we conduct is very limited. And since this review is conducted by the company ourselves, so it\u2019s not an investigation, it\u2019s a review.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, got it. Thank you.","David Young","All right. Thank you, Koide-san. And I believe, operator, that was our last call. We are now past the hour.

Joining me this morning from the U.S. are Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer; and Todd Daniels, Executive Vice President, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary.","Joining us from Tokyo are Masatoshi Koide, President and COO of Aflac Japan and Koji Ariyoshi, Executive Vice President and Director of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal security laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate, because they're prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our Annual Report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. The earnings release is available on the Investors page of aflac.com and also includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures.","Now, I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Dan?","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Thank you, David. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let me begin by saying that the third quarter concluded a great first nine months for Aflac and well positioned us to achieve the goals we set out to achieve for the year. As you likely saw from yesterday's press release, these strong results gave us confidence to upwardly revise our operating earnings per share outlook for the year to the range of $6.75 to $6.95. Fred will provide more context on earnings and our outlook during his comments.","Let me now provide an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. Despite the persistent low interest rate environment, Aflac Japan generated solid financial results for both the quarter and the first nine months of the year. In yen terms, the results on an operating basis were ahead of expectations for the year. Aflac Japan's third sector sales increased 2% in the quarter, rounding out a solid increase of 5% for the year.","Quarterly sales results continue to benefit from the February launch of our revised medical product, EVER. Additionally, as you may be aware, our Income Support Insurance is conceptually a new product not just for Aflac, but also for Japan. As with any new concept, it takes time to catch on, but I believe our sales force will continue to embrace it. We have high expectations that this product will continue to grow over the long term.","Within the low interest rate environment, you'll recall that we have de-emphasized first sector savings products like WAYS and child endowment by only selling them in select channels and aggressively repricing these products. Aflac Japan continued to make significant progress controlling the sale of first sector savings-type products down materially in the quarter.","Additionally, we are renewing our focus on developing competitive first sector protection products to round out our product lineup. Regarding distribution, we had meaningful production across all channels, which further establishes our leading position in the third sector market. Our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success. Our alliance partners also made significant contributions to our sales results.","With such an extensive distribution network that includes Japan Post 20,000-plus postal outlets selling our cancer insurance, we are solidifying our goal to be where people want buy insurance. Looking ahead, Aflac Japan's focus will remain on selling our third sector products, along with first sector protection products, both of which are less interest rate sensitive and have strong and stable margins. We will continue to develop new third sector products specifically designed to enhance our strong market share, provided they meet the risk management standards we set forth.","Our new medical product has done well and we will continue our pattern of repricing our cancer and medical products to defend and build upon our leading position. As discussed at the Financial Analyst Briefing, near-term growth rates for the third sector products face challenging comparisons, which we expect strong results for the year, we anticipate the fourth quarter will be relatively flat in comparison to 2016.","Strong sales in 2017 were largely due to the launch of our EVER medical product early in the first quarter 2017. In 2018, we scheduled our product launches to follow Aflac Japan's conversion to a subsidiary to avoid any unnecessary rework or policy disruption post conversions. Taking these factors into account, we expect the first half of 2018 to be down, then recovering in the second half of 2018.","We continue to target a long-term growth rate in the range of 4% to 6% through 2019 and will update as to our forecast what firms up. Don't lose sight that over the past four years, we've taken our third sector new sales from \u00a570 billion to about \u00a585 billion and that's good business with strong margins. It's also meaningful, given our leading market share.","Turning to Aflac U.S. operations, we are pleased with the financial performance and continued strength in the profitability of Aflac U.S. Like Aflac Japan, our financial results for Aflac U.S. on an operating basis were ahead of expectations, which is particularly notable, and that they also reflect ongoing investment in our platform.","A definite highlight of the third quarter was Aflac U.S. new sales increase of 7.5%, which brings our nine-month sales increase to 3.8%. This outstanding quarterly sales results confirms our focus on the U.S. growth strategy. However, keep in mind that the timing of sales can vary from quarter-to-quarter, but I've continued to be encouraged by what I'm seeing with U.S. sales growth.","It is exciting to see our platform investment pay off not just in sales, but also in customer satisfaction. It's also energizing to see surveys that indicate that 95% of our policyholders have used One Day Pay or likely to refer other people to Aflac. This demonstrates that One Day Pay is not only a fast claims initiative, it's a way of doing business that helps set our brand apart.","Independent research continues to show that there is no doubt American consumers need cash quickly and paying claims fast and fairly distinguishes us from the competition. With respect to career agent activity, we continue to focus agents on groups with fewer than 100 employees. I believe this market has Aflac's to grow, because our career sales agents are best positioned within the industry to access and therefore succeed with smaller employers.","Turning to the broker activity, given the positive results we've seen within our efforts in our large-case broker space, we continue to expand our broker sales team with new roles designed to focus on the mid-case broker space. I am pleased with the progress we've made. The sales accomplishments we've seen in the quarter only further our determination to enhance our sales channel and further sales results.","We will continue to make tactical adjustments to meet our long-term growth objectives. We continue to anticipate a long-term sales growth of 3% to 5% in new annualized premium through 2019. With respect to capital deployment, Fred will provide more details shortly, but let me just say that we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our stakeholders.","We continue to anticipate that we will repurchase in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of shares in 2017. As is always the case, this assumes stable capital conditions and an absence of compelling alternatives.","I'm very pleased with the Board of Directors action to increase the quarterly dividend by 4.7%. This marks the 35th consecutive year of increasing our cash dividend and demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders. Our dividend policy is guided by growth and operating earnings per share along with free cash flow generations and capital quality.","I'll conclude by reiterating how proud I am of the management team, the employees and our sales organization in Japan and the United States as they have worked incredibly hard to generate the results we'd shared. Quarters like this only fuel my excitement for Aflac's future and what we can accomplish.","Now, I'll turn the program over to Fred. Fred?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Thank you, Dan. Our earnings result for the third quarter came in above our expectations, but consistent with the strong margins we have experienced throughout the year, both in Japan and in the U.S. We reported operating earnings of $1.70 per diluted share. Following a particularly volatile period last year, the yen weakened nearly 8% as compared to the average for last year's quarter, which impacted our comparable performance negatively by $0.07 a share.","We concluded as part of our annual actuarial review process that it was appropriate to reduce specific IBNR reserves for our Japan cancer business by \u00a52.4 billion, contributing roughly $0.04 a share to the quarter's EPS. This adjustment is similar to the actions taken in the third quarter last year and reflects continued strong cancer claims experienced.","We booked approximately $10 million in pre-tax costs associated with our Japan branch conversion. The conversion remains on track for a mid-2018 closing with most of the heavy lift and expenses expected over the next nine months. There is no change to our guidance on total conversion cost of $120 million to $130 million pre-tax.","In our Japan segment, premium growth continues to be pressured by our first sector savings product, WAYS, and a portion of our block reaching paid-up status. This contributed to a \u00a519 billion decline in first sector earned premium as compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, continued growth in third sector sales drove earned premium up approximately \u00a56 billion in the quarter.","Our Japan segment profitability was strong in the quarter with pre-tax margins of nearly 20%. Our total benefit ratio in Japan continues to trend favorably in 2017, driven in part by a shift in earned premium mix from first sector towards third sector. The shift in the premium mix has reduced our year-to-date reported benefit ratio by approximately 100 basis points as compared to the previous year.","Importantly, our third sector benefit ratio, while favorable, performed consistent with recent experience on a normalized basis. Our expense ratio in Japan remained stable, but we expect will increase to the midpoint of our range provided at this year's FAB conference as we move through 2018.","Drivers include first sector premium declines along with the same premium mix dynamic that is positively impacting our benefit ratio, but naturally pressures our reported expense ratio. In addition, we plan to step up our investment in product development, digital and IT initiatives, designed to drive future growth and operating efficiencies.","While down year-to-date, Japan's investment income has performed favorable to our original outlook call expectations. Investment income has been pressured by lower reinvestment yields and higher hedge costs versus prior year. We continue to make progress on the build-out of the floating rate portfolio in Japan and have invested approximately $625 million through September with a building pipeline of commitments.","Our U.S. dollar floating rate portfolio includes bank loans, middle market loans and transitional real estate and stands at $2.6 billion or approximately 11% of our U.S. dollar portfolio at quarter end.","In terms of hedge costs, we are on pace to come in below our full-year guidance range. We have benefited from favorable pricing and modestly lower hedge ratio. As a result, we are now forecasting hedge costs in the $230 million to $240 million range for the full-year 2017.","Turning to the U.S., Dan commented on our sales results, which together, with improved persistency, drove premium growth to just over 2% in the quarter. Benefit ratios show continued strength relative to our 2017 guidance range. Our expense ratio was favorable in the quarter with year-to-date performance of approximately 34%, more in line with our guidance for the year.","Our expense ratio reflects progress on certain platform investments, including our group administrative platform, enrollment platform and related technology. Overall, U.S. pre-tax profit margin at 20% remains strong by historical standards. Our overall capital condition and associated metrics remain healthy at healthy levels. Japan SMR and ESR, U.S. RBC and overall excess capital conditions are consistent with the updates provided at our FAB conference.","Overall credit conditions and asset quality remained strong with only a modest level of impairments in the quarter. Of note, this month, we issued \u00a560 billion of subordinated debt priced at 2%. I mentioned at our conference, our focus on optimizing our capital structure and the proceeds from the offering will ultimately refinance a callable $500 million subordinated debt security with a 5.5% coupon.","We repurchased $219 million of stock in the third quarter and remain comfortably on track to repurchase between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion worth of our stock for the year. As we discussed at our FAB conference, we remain tactical in our approach to repurchase.","As Dan noted in his comments, earnings growth, cash flow and capital strength, all support our board's decision to increase the quarterly common stock dividend by 4.7%, marking our 35th consecutive year of increase.","Bolstered by sustained strong margins in both Japan and the U.S., we are increasing our 2017 earnings guidance to $6.75 to $6.95 per share on a currency-neutral basis. Our normalized outperformance has been driven by a combination of strong pre-tax margins in Japan, favorable investment income and hedge costs as compared to our original expectations. Overall, stability in U.S. margins and modestly lower effective tax rate for the year also contributed.","Looking ahead, we remain well positioned in terms of our core margins and capital strength, recognizing our desire to invest in the platform for future growth. We'll provide greater detail on our December outlook call.","I'll now hand it over to David to take us to Q&A. David?","David Young - Aflac, Inc.","Thank you, Fred. Now, we are ready to take your questions, but first let me remind you that to be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to one initial question and one follow-up that relates to that question.","Operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question is coming from the line of Mr. Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, hoping to get some additional data behind the U.S. sales increase, perhaps some detail on how that increase broke down between the brokerage and agency channels and also with the brokerage channel as to how the pipeline is building for the fourth quarter, given that it tends to be back-end loaded.","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Nigel, thank you for the question. So, as it relates to U.S. sales for the third quarter, I'll give you three observations.","The first is we saw positive results in all of the areas of focus that I've been talking about in 2017, career agent; veteran engagement; new associate conversion to producer; middle market broker sales; and public sector business. So, all of those areas are working well for us in the third quarter.","Second thing that I'll mention is, Dan talked about a shift of the sales that \u2013 how they compare it from quarter-to-quarter. Well, in the third quarter, we saw higher-than-expected growth in the large broker markets, which normally, as you know, skews toward the fourth quarter. However, as we looked at the data, without that large case \u2013 without those large cases, our sales team still has strong performance around 5% for the quarter.","The third thing I'll mention is that I'm very encouraged about the growth that we're seeing through the successful execution of our initiatives without changes in the fundamental business practices that we've set forth. So, we're building confidence in our strategy, we're building confidence in our sales leadership and we're building confidence in their ability to execute.","As to the attribution question, as we look at the broker sales versus the career agent sales, first, the Aflac is seeing the same rate of growth from brokers as the market is seeing. So, market growth had seen some increase on the broker side, while Aflac is experiencing the same thing and we saw that more pronounced in the third quarter.","The second thing I'll say is that, as we're executing on the strategies, both channels are performing. We believe that the bonus programs that we've introduced in 2016 allowed the career agents to focus on growing career producers and on sales in the small business market. We believe that's working. And on the broker side, we're seeing that the broker expansion strategies discussed earlier in the year are coming to fruition, translating into better market growth in that channel. So, I hope that answers your question.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just a question on the Japan sales, it softened a little bit in the quarter, but at the same time, on a year-to-date basis, seems to be remaining on track. Would you say (22:03) a sign of the product cycle, the products are kind of reaching some level of saturation? And then kind of thinking ahead, will we expect a similar a refreshing cycle as you did in 2017?","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Koide?","Masatoshi Koide - Aflac Japan Co., Ltd.","This is Koide from Aflac Japan. I would like to explain about new product cycle. And in terms of medical insurance, competitive environment is becoming much more fierce. And so, the product that we have seen has a coverage or benefit changes and the premiums are going down.","So, what we need to do is always watch out for what competitors are doing and then perhaps follow up on other companies' product or we may want to take a step ahead in the competition. So, as a result, we have been able to secure \u2013 we have been trying to secure our share by revising our product in a relatively short cycle between a year or two in medical insurance. And by following the cycle that I have mentioned, we have been able to revise our new medical product in February this year and as a result, we have had good sales of this product.","Now, let me touch upon the cancer insurance. Since we have an overwhelming position in the Japanese cancer insurance market and with advancement of a treatment technology and also taking into account of the environmental changes of cancer insurance or cancer itself and so our policy is to develop product that customer really needs.","So, therefore, compared with the medical insurance, the product development cycle is longer, which is three to four years. And we have been able to maintain a leading position in the cancer insurance under this policy with a new product development and we have been continuing with this policy. And that's all from me.","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","I'd like to make one other comment about it. When Koide mentioned aggressive competitive environment, that really had changed. It's been aggressive for years and we constantly are on top of it, but the pattern that I have seen in sales is no real change. The only change that I really see \u2013 and we basically told you that the second half were tough comparisons. So, the third quarter and the fourth quarter should be no shock to anybody what we've said. We are ending up in the range we told you.","And then, for next year, it's simply because of the shift of that product that will be one of the reasons, but let's be clear, the hardest part is not the competition, it's the comparables of growing from \u00a570 billion of new sales to \u00a585 billion of new sales and just the law of numbers becoming tougher, but all-in-all, I'm very pleased with the results of what's going on in our sales department.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","So, in terms of the current product suite, do you think there's still some lag underneath it for another year or so or do you feel like you may have to refresh a little bit in 2018?","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","I think you are going to see a new \u2013 a revised product in 2018 in the second half.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. And then, just a quick follow-up on U.S. sales, and I believe there is some hurricane-related impact in the quarter, but still delivers very strong sales results. How should we think about these kind of hurricane-related impacts in the third quarter, and do you anticipate any kind of further impact in the fourth quarter as you go through the beef of the renewal cycle?","Teresa L. White - Aflac, Inc.","So, thank you for the question. Three things as it relates to hurricane impact. From a sales perspective, we anticipate the impact of hurricanes to be about 1% of U.S. 2017 sales, and so that includes the third and fourth quarter.","From a persistency perspective, the figures in the FAB supp are slightly elevated due to the emergency orders that were following the hurricanes in September. So, those orders, as you know, mandate that the affected counties we don't lapse policies in those affected counties for about 60 days. Now \u2013 so, we estimate the impact of that to be about 20 basis points from a persistency perspective.","While we don't see any material increase in the loss ratios due to claims, we are monitoring the benefit ratio due to the impact of last account \u2013 the potential impact of last account.","And, Fred, is there anything else you want to add?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Yeah, I think it might be informative just how do you deal with these types of natural disasters from the standpoint of our financial statements and benefit ratios. Look, the punch line is that you should not expect and we do not anticipate any material financial movement in our core margins as a bottom line impact. So, I would not worry about that, we are not worried about that, but it is interesting.","You obviously have the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, really the entire State of Florida and then sections of Texas that were affected. And what we do is, because there is basically a blackout, if you will, of paid premium and submitted claims as people are dislocated from their homes and away from work and so forth, we have a way in which we can estimate what we would have expected the premium levels to be and the submitted claims level to be, and we adjust our due premium assumptions as well as our IBNR to take that into account. And that's done through an estimation process.","When it comes time to \u2013 as you may know, the states actually put what amounts to a stay in place that requires keeping policies in-force while people are dislocated. And so, we have to make these estimates as to how the business would have performed had that stay not been in place.","When it comes off of that dynamic, which is typically about a year long, it can be shorter at times depending on the nature of the disaster, there'll be some movement in policies, such as policy lapsation, which is what Teresa talked about. And in that case, what you will have under a lapsation dynamic is you'll have a natural release of reserves on the product, which could actually benefit your benefit ratio, but that's offset by DAC amortization, accelerated DAC amortization, which weighs on your expense ratio.","From a bottom line perspective, you're not impacted, but you'll see those moving parts. In any particular quarter, it may be noticeable, and we'll point that out if it takes place, but I would tell you over a year's timeframe, it's a rounding error and does not adjust our outlook.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","That is helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mr. Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. The first question I had was just on buybacks. I think you mentioned you're still committed to your $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion range for \u2013 or $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion range for 2017. That implies a significant pickup in buybacks from what you've been doing in the last few quarters, and I think roughly for $300 million to $500 million in the fourth quarter based on your range. So, what's going to \u2013 like how do we think about where you're going to come out in that range and what's really going to be the deciding factor from your standpoint? Is it the stock price or is it something else you're watching to see whether you are higher-end or lower-end of that range?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Yeah, I made the comment, Jimmy, in my script comments, if you will, that we're being tactical, but quite honestly, it's substantially similar to the tone and discussion we had at our conference, and that is we've got to start weighing alternatives for our excess capital, including reinvesting back into our business and that it's not just going to be automatically repurchased, particularly as we trade up towards our view of intrinsic value. And so, we're going to be more tactical.","Having said that, I'm comfortable that we'll be within the range, but I think when looking at the fourth quarter and just a practical approach to repurchase, it's likely the case that we'll be at the midpoint or lower than the midpoint of that range as we are tracking.","And again, that really has more to do with paying careful attention to the expected returns on our excess capital. So, we continue to repurchase, we'll continue to that pace, but I think from a practical perspective, I would not anticipate the mid to high-end of that range all in the fourth quarter.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I had a follow-up on the question on Japan sales. Specifically, on the Income Support product, your sales were down from last year. They've been flat the last few quarters. So, what's your expectation of the ramp-up in sales of that product over time? And have the results over the past few quarters affected your view of the potential for that product? Do you think it's more limited than you might have thought initially?","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","I'm going to go ahead and answer that. I still believe it's a strong product. Sales agents take the path of least resistance. And when the medical product came out, they jumped back on it and moved away from this other product. As we've experienced, if you go back years to introduction of accident or other things, it took a while to get to sales force into it. You need to pay some clients. You need to be able to use those as examples. It's just going to take time. It isn't going as fast as I would like, but I still am very encouraged. And I've been in Japan twice since August and had a lot of discussions with this and we've got some contests that are small that are coming up that we'll do in the first quarter and continue to try to push it.","But anytime you're doing something brand new, especially when it's never been out there at all for the industry, the good news is they have enormous potential. The bad news is that it's new and people don't know exactly what to do with it yet. But time will tell, but I'm convinced it's going to be a winner. It's just going to take a little while.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mr. Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Sir, your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Dan, just a question on the comments you made about the first half 2018 sales in Japan that you expected them to be down based on \u2013 was that the delay of new products because of the subsidiary conversion or can you elaborate a bit on that?","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Yeah. Well, first of all, it's tough comparison in the first quarter. Let me be clear. Our strongest quarter was the first quarter in terms of percentage increase. So, that's the first thing I'll tell you and the first quarter will be much harder than the second quarter. But in addition to that, it's because the first quarter we won't have a new product, we believe that with all we've got going on with the conversion, and we expect it to be on time, we don't want to have anything going on with the systems that will separate us from any issues that might occur.","So, we just decided to delay the product introduction until the second half of the year or certainly in late second quarter after the conversion is done. So, it's just the delay time on it. So, I look for a stronger second half versus a stronger first half, which we saw this year.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Got you. And then, Fred, I just wanted to make sure I understood the comments that you made about Japan. Did you say that you thought margins heading into 2018 would be more midpoint of guide versus sort of the high-end of the guide that they've been running out more recently? Was that where you saw things going into 2018?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","That comment was specific to the expense ratio in Japan. And so, what I'm referring to there is that our conference, we talked about the expense ratio in Japan for a three-year period being in the range of 19% to 21% and so my comment was, when looking at that long-term range, as we proceed to 2018, we would expect to be in the midpoint of that range.","As you can see, we are traveling just a touch above 19% expense ratio in Japan. And note that, that expense ratio is really not an expense issue as much as it is a revenue issue and that we are fighting both the combination of paid-up policies driving premium down in the first sector space as well as the natural decline in net investment income year-over-year based on the rate environment.","So, that's what we've been fighting. It's really been a revenue fight, not an expense issue. That continues to be with us as we go into 2018. The difference being though we are, in fact, stepping up some of our investment on digital and technology really with the idea of driving long-term efficiencies and driving growth. So, my comments, Tom, are really more specific to the expense ratio.","Meanwhile, our benefit ratio is doing much better in Japan and is doing much better mainly because of the mix-related issues. So, as we do pull back on first sector and continue to grow our third sector business, we're seeing a shift in earned premium towards third sector, which naturally carries a more favorable benefit ratio. As I've mentioned, year-over-year, that's contributed 100 basis points to our benefit ratio. And as a result, we actually lowered our long-term guidance for benefit ratio range over the next three years.","So, bottom line, i.e., pre-tax profit margin, we would expect to continue at a relatively stable level with what we've experienced in 2017.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Got it. So, Fred, the two of those things largely offset each other, would you say, the elevated expense ratio and then the move down in benefit ratio?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Yes, in general. In general, Tom, obviously, there's a lot of moving parts as you can imagine, but in general, when it comes to pre-tax profit margin, we end up holding to a stable margin with those two elements offsetting.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you. Could you just provide an update on the, I guess, the switch trade and what portion is still left to reinvest in U.S. denominated assets in Japan?","Eric M. Kirsch - Aflac, Inc.","Sure. This is Eric, Alex. As Fred mentioned, year-to-date, about $625 million, $626 million in new floating rate assets, primarily focused on transitional real estate and middle market loans. When you look at the total floating rate portfolio, about $2.6 billion currently, we're continuing to focus on private debt, transitional real estate, middle market loans and we would expect that by the end of next year, we will fully replenish that switch trade of $2.5 billion. The exact timing is a little hard to give you. It could probably be in the first half of the year, but remember, these are private loans. So, they have to be negotiated, they have to be sourced and then funded.","So, we would expect the switch trade of that $2.5 billion to ultimately be close some time next year and then we'll continue to allocate more to the floating rate bucket within the dollar strategy and back at the FAB Analyst Meeting, I put up a number of charts with some estimates in terms of percentages.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. And one other quick one, when you guys talked about the economic solvency ratio in Japan, has that impacted at all just by the branch conversion or is that sort of isolating? What will be the Japan piece following the separation?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","It doesn't. The ESR comments that we've made at the FAB Meeting in kind of where we're following are not impacted by the branch conversion. It's really a uniquely ESR calculation and whether a branch or subsidiary, it doesn't adjust our calculations.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mr. John Barnidge of Sandle O'Neill (sic) [Sandler O'Neill] (40:55). Sir, your line is open.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you. About first sector sales in Japan, I know there has been an extraordinary amount of reduction. What do you believe is the minimum level of first sector sales required to maintain distribution relationships and how quickly do you think you'll be able to get there? Thank you.","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Koide?","Masatoshi Koide - Aflac Japan Co., Ltd.","Well, first of all, in terms of the first sector products, I think we need to divide the first sector products into two types. One is savings-type first sector products and the other is protection-type first sector products. And what we think is needed as a first sector product to maintain our relationship with our agencies is the protection-type first sector products. And we will continue to strategically sell this product going forward as well. And we revised our product, GIFT, in February this year and even after the rate change, this product is selling very well.","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Is that it, Koide?","Masatoshi Koide - Aflac Japan Co., Ltd.","Yes.","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Plus what the question that he is really asking is at what level do we need to hold? And the answer is, we're getting very close to that level. So, I would say somewhere in this range within 20% kind of gives you a range to note, but we are very close now.","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","I think a helpful comment is that obviously Aflac is not unique in its strategy as it relates to the rate environment in Japan, and we've seen all the peer companies really start pulling back on yen-based first sector savings products. And so, where we're really in the pack, if you will, in terms of our approach to doing that, what makes us different is that we've got such a robust and wide-ranging third sector product dynamic, but this is what makes things like the income product so important and a renewed focus on first sector protection product where you'll see more product development coming out on that front.","Those are going to be important products for us to build for the very purpose of your question, and that is making sure that our agencies can make a living and generate income.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mr. Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Just turning to Aflac Japan, if we look at the annualized premiums in-force down, I guess, 3.7% in the quarter. I think it's still down if I adjust for that paid-up phenomenon. So, my first question is, is that right or are you still down adjusting for that? And then, second, when do you think we can start to see some growth in that in-force premium number?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Yes, I think the answer is, yes, although accelerated by the paid-up policies, you're naturally seeing a little bit of additional runoff, although it's predominantly the paid-up dynamic. I say that because earned premium on the third sector side has been growing at a decent rate, low-single-digit type growth rates of third sector premium.","So, I would say it's predominantly the paid-up premium dynamic, and that will start to slow. As I mentioned, I think, at FAB, we're running at around \u00a555 billion, \u00a560 billion estimate of paid-up premium in 2017. That will be cut effectively in half in 2018, and then again, cut in half in 2019. So, that pressure, if you will, starts to taper. And as a result, we'll start to see more of an offset between third sector premium growth and first sector premium decline.","But realize, in addition to the paid-up policies, we have in fact, obviously, pulled back substantially from just the outright sale of first sector savings, and that certainly doesn't \u2013 weighs on your growth rate. Lapse rates are very low on first sector savings products. They tend to hover around 1%, sometimes a bit above 1%, this is excluding paid-up policy dynamics, it's just pure lapse.","So, you have a very, very slow runoff, but when you're not selling any savings-related products of any magnitude, that will catch up to your premium, but remember, this is an economic decision that we made. You need to sort of wrap your head around the idea of what is the economic value of the relative premium between third sector and first sector.","So, while it is affecting negatively our GAAP results, we are seeing FSA earnings or said differently, cash flow pick up, because we're allocating much less in the way of capital towards that product, and it's a product that is very capital heavy and we think the relative economic value of third sector we don't think we know is substantially better than first sector savings products and some of the tail risk and interest rate risk that comes with it. So, even though it's a headwind on GAAP-type results, it's a tailwind on economic value development.","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","I'd like to add too, if you adjust for the year-to-date paid-up products on an in-force premium basis, we're about flat with where we were at third quarter last year.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then, separately, just on the tax rate, it was low in the quarter. I know some of that was due to stock compensation, and then I think there was also, I guess, a moratorium on a tax-related item related to the ACA. So, as we think about kind of going forward, do you think you get back to the 34.5%, which is about where you've been tracking, or are we going to be below that because of that ACA dynamic?","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Yeah, I would tell you that there would be perhaps some benefit, although I believe that ACA benefit starts to fade a bit here as we move forward. I will tell you from a financial planning perspective, and we're in the midst of our financial planning work right now, of which we'll then talk more about that obviously on our outlook call, first week of December. We're not going to necessarily assume this type of effective tax rate going forward. The main driver of the lower effective tax rate, as you mentioned, is really specifically the treatment of option related \u2013 stock option related compensation. And really, what it is, is that essentially the expensing of it for tax purposes is dealt with using a fair market value of the options as they're exercised.","And so, when your stock price has been doing as well as it has throughout the year and you see naturally a level of stock-option exercising, you then will see this benefit run through your effective tax rate. This actually has always been part of the accounting. It's just that previously to January, when the new accounting came into place, it was run through equity and not through your earnings.","And so, companies now are seeing this affect their tax rate. And so, that's a very difficult thing to project and predict. In general, one could say, if your stock price is traveling at these high levels and you expect there to be a natural level of continued option exercising, you should see a natural benefit. But internally, I would tell you, we're not planning for that, because it can be quite variable.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mr. Sean Dargan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Since the FAB, there's been an election in Japan. Just was wondering if you give your thoughts on if that played out the way you thought it would and if there are going to be any changes in policy that would affect your business.","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Koide, is somebody over there? Is Charles on the line or you want to take it? How are you going to do it?","Masatoshi Koide - Aflac Japan Co., Ltd.","This is Koide again from Aflac Japan. The fact that LDP that Prime Minster Abe is leading, we were expecting that his party will win. So, as a result, since Abe administration will continue and his economic policy is not likely to change significantly, as a result, we are not seeing any material impact to our business.

Please be advised today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to, Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma\u2019am you may begin.","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thank you, and good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of U.S. Operations; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President, Global Chief Investment Officer; Tohru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan who is joining us from Tokyo.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who\u2019ll begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and year as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. I will then follow-up with a few financial highlights for the quarter and the year and then we will be glad to take your questions. Dan?","Daniel P. Amos","Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. The final quarter of 2012 concluded another great year for Aflac. Let me start in more detail about the accomplishments in 2012 and our outlook for 2013 beginning with Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor.","Following five straight quarters of record breaking production, Aflac Japan\u2019s new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter were up slightly. Sales were \u00a549.3 billion, an increase of 1.5% over the fourth quarter of 2011. For the third consecutive year, Aflac Japan generated record sales results. Our full year sales results rose 30.8% to \u00a5210.6 billion. You\u2019ll recall that in the third quarter we said that Aflac Japan sales would be challenging for the remainder of the year and that\u2019s exactly what we saw three primary factors affected our results, two of which we discussed in the third quarter.","The first and foremost factor was difficult comparisons to a year ago, which primarily reflected our expansion into the bank channel. Bank distribution has been a great benefit to us, because about 70% of the bank customers are new to Aflac. However, after selling through the banks for over last several years, we\u2019ve already cycled through the first major pass, it selling products to a large portion of the bank customers particularly our higher premium WAYS product.","Second, you\u2019ll recall, we expected that the consumers interest in WAYS would decline in the fourth quarter as we lower the rate for the discount advanced premium from 1% to 0.5% in October. We believe the impact from the lower DAP which was essentially a premium increase was much larger than we originally anticipated.","Third, over the last several months, we\u2019re seeing some insurance companies and financial institutions are being more investment type products that compete with WAYS. We believe competition amongst various companies selling investment type products will not only continue, but we\u2019ll actually intensifies we get closer to April 1, and the repricing of these type of products will be implemented. We anticipate repricing will suppress sales, however, it\u2019s important to note that the pricing revisions will benefit us overall from a profitability standpoint.","When thanking of repricing for our first sector products like WAYS, our objective is to balance profitability and competitiveness. Our profitability will be enhanced by higher premiums we will be charging. However, to remain competitive, we just announced that we will rise the DAP from the current 0.5% back up to the 1% effective April 1. After reprising the DAP change, we estimate the profitability of our WAYS product will range between 15% and 20%, which is an acceptable margin to us.","We know the Aflac brand is strong throughout Japan and this enhances the appeal of our products, in particular our third sector cancer and medical had been and will continue to be our pillar products in the foundation of the product portfolio. In 2012, we maintained our position as the number one seller of third sector medical and cancer products in Japan. This number one status confirms the popularity of these products and also helps drive sales because consumers want to buy from the leading [flatter].","Let me be clear, remaining the number one seller of cancer and medical sales in Japan, is a top priority for me. We mentioned in May at the Analyst Briefing that we are currently underpenetrated with the consumers who are in their 20s to 40s, that\u2019s the segment where we are going to focus our efforts on to increase sales of the third sector products.","As you may know, banks have relationships with multiple insurance providers. This combined with the changes in the competitive product landscape make it more challenging than ever to accurately project future Aflac Japan sales through the banks. Clearly, bank channel sales will be challenging following fast rate quarters of record-breaking sales results.","Keep in mind, we won\u2019t gain insight into the bank strategies or 2013 product offerings until closer to the start of Japan\u2019s fiscal year which is April 1. Hopefully, by that time, we release first quarter results we\u2019ll be able to provide you with an update of what we\u2019ve learned about bank plan to sell our products.","On the other hand, we continue to have good visibility into the sales of our third sector cancer and medical products. Our traditional channels has historically been the primary driver of third sector sales. For 2013, we expect Aflac Japan sales of third sector cancer and medical products to be flat to up 5%. Achieving this target is a top priority for me and our management in Japan and it affects Aflac Japan\u2019s bonus, as well as those in the corporate management.","Now, let me turn to the U.S. operation. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. performed very well in 2012. I think we\u2019ve done a good job in managing our U.S. operations, including budgets, people resources. Although new sales growth continued to be constraining our top line results had been consistently strong throughout the year, in part, reflecting an improved persistency.","Aflac U.S. new annualized premium sales were in line with our most recent guidance flat for the year. We believe persistency has improved for a couple of reasons. First, we\u2019ve enhanced our customer experience at critical touch points, which has resulted in better payroll retention.","And second, with the economic uncertainty, we\u2019ve seen over the last several years, many employees are less likely to switch [stops] and therefore are more likely to keep their current benefits. While there are external factors we can\u2019t control, we are driven to improve the factors we can influence.","First, we continue to improve the structure of our marketing and sales area to maximize our future growth and focus on our distribution channels. Within this new structure, we are working on new training initiatives, we believe will benefit our sales force and help them be more productive in the evolving environment.","Second, with the brand recognition of 94%, we continue to leverage the strength to capture the attention of consumers with the ultimate goal of driving sales. We want to continue to educate consumers on our products while at the same time entertaining them.","Third, we evaluate and enhance our products to ensure we are in staff with the needs of consumers, particularly on the economic landscape. In 2013, we are planning aggressive new individual and group product launches. With our strong brand recognition and reputation for paying clients quickly and fairly, we believe consumers are more receptive to our products and this can only benefit us in the future.","Additionally, we will continue to evaluate other opportunities as it relates to the change in the current healthcare environment, specifically the Affordable Care Act. We do expect the changing healthcare environment to have an impact on how people choose to purchase insurance going forward.","As such we are looking at ways that we can effectively operate within the environment of state and federal healthcare delivery system. One thing we note from our nearly four decades in Japan is that, even with the national healthcare system, consumers have significant out-of-pocket expenses and our products continue to be relevant to consumers.","We believe the national healthcare actually present that life with opportunities as consumers become better aware of the financial protection at life\u2019s products. However, there are still external factors in the microenvironment that affect our business, while some aspects of the U.S. economy has shown slight signs of improvement in 2012, we can continue to see the economic landscape and the U.S. is challenging, that\u2019s especially true for small business segment, where more than 90% of our products are sold.","In fact, the National Federal of Independent Businesses which focuses on small business owners reported this month that the small business optimism index in December was the second lowest since March of 2010. This means more small employers are still very guarded with respect to their business outlook, including their hiring plans. This is important, because gains or losses in employment impact our universe of potential policyholders.","Before we can say we are optimistic about our sales opportunities, we need to seek sustained optimism particularly surrounding the employment level to smaller businesses. Taking all that into account for 2013, we expect Aflac U.S. sales through the traditional and broker channel to be flat to up 5%. I\u2019ll point out that for the first quarter we won\u2019t be surprised if sales down considering the first quarter of 2012 was our biggest percentage increase for the year.","Having discussed our operations let me give you an update on the investment function. I remain pleased with continued progress in our global investment transformation. We continue to grow our investment team and we\u2019ve made excellent progress in the build out that\u2019s ultimately designed to improve the risk adjustment returns and the profile of our balance sheet.","As we\u2019ve stated for many years, our greatest investment challenge has been to invest Aflac Japan significant cash flows at reasonable investment yields. The U.S. corporate bond program was initiated in the third quarter continues to be an effective means for enhancing our new money yields in Japan.","You\u2019ll recall that our fourth quarter objective was to invest roughly two-thirds of our invested cash flow in U.S. dollar denominated publicly traded corporate bonds and then hedged the currency risk. This successful investment program enabled us to surpass our budgeted new money yield for 2012. It\u2019s also provided greater liquidity, enhanced flexibility of our portfolio, and increased the opportunities to diversify beyond JGBs.","At December 31, this program represented 6.2% of the total portfolio, which is well below our asset allocation target. In light of the success of the bond program with strong credit fundamentals of investment grade corporate credits, we intend to continue the program in 2013. Consistent with our asset allocation program, we will valid these investments with JGBs for diversification and liquidity as well as other investment opportunities as it may arise.","As I mentioned, Aflac consolidated financial performance was strong for the quarter and for the year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, operating earnings per diluted share rose 4.8% for the quarter and 5.1% for the year. As the program progressed, operating earnings per diluted share were better-than-expected and we finish the year towards a high-end of the objective of the 3% to 6% increase before the impact of currency.","I\u2019m also very pleased with the strength of the capital ratios, which demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength and flexibility on behalf of the policyholders to shareholders and bondholders through strong surplus growth and improved portfolio risk profile and a weaker yen, our capital ratios improved significantly in 2012. We previously conveyed that our goal in 2012 with an RBC in the range of 400 to 500.","While we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements, we believe the RBC ratio at the year-end was significantly higher than our targets. Additionally, we expect that Aflac Japan\u2019s solvency margin at the end improved over the solvency margin ratio at September 30 for 628%. That would put the year-end SMR well above our target range of 500% to 600%.","As we have indicated, given our capital structure, our ability to repurchase shares is largely tied to profit repatriation. Contemplating profit repatriation, our first consideration is protection of the policyholders as measured by the SMR. Next, we give consideration to the needs of the parent company and consult with Japan\u2019s management in making the determination. We now expect profit repatriation to be around \u00a550 billion for 2013, which is a reasonable estimate assuming that we have no additional investment losses that would reduce Aflac Japan\u2019s operating income.","Profit repatriation in 2013 could provide us with the significant amount of capital that could be deployed for share repurchase. As we\u2019ve said for many years, when it comes to deploying capital for the benefit of our shareholders, we still believe that growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares are the most attractive means and that is something that we will continue to pursue.","Our capital strength enables us to increase cash dividend to the shareholders in the fourth quarter for the 30 consecutive year. Our objective is to grow the dividend and a rate that is in line with our earnings per share growth before the impact of the yen. Given the strength of our capital ratios and the parent company liquidity, we resume our share repurchase activities by buying approximately a $100 million for the shares in the fourth quarter of 2012.","At our current plan to purchase 400 million to 600 million of our shares in 2013, understand unless there is extraordinary then occurs, we intend to purchase at least $400 million of our shares.","Remember, we are driving the company for increased profitability, not sales. Sales are important in that, our management is bonused on them, but there is still just one component of earnings. Let me also say that we haven\u2019t missed an earnings target because of lower sales nor do we expect that to happen. This year the other components that need into the profitability include persistency, investment income, claims management and expense controls.","It\u2019s often difficult to foresee the specifics of how these factors ultimately produce our earnings. Sometimes one aspect of the business might be a little stronger, and one might prove to be a little more challenging, but we anticipate these type of things in the budgeting process. Ultimately, the accomplishments of the fundamental facets of our business align and create another year in which we deliver on our financial growth objectives.","I want to reiterate that objectives for 2013 have not changed. The increased operating earnings per diluted share 4% to 7%, this range reflects the impact of the portfolio of derisking and investing significant cash flows at low interest rates.","I would also point out that we had a better year in 2012 than expected in large part due to the receipts of the deferred coupon in the first quarter and lower annual effective tax rate. This will make it a more challenging comparison to 2013, but we will achieve it.","In addition to operating earnings growth, we\u2019ve also focused on producing industry leading return on equity. On an operating basis, 2012 ROE was 24.6% and as we conveyed at our financial analyst briefing for 2013, we believe that it\u2019s reasonable to see our operating ROE in the range of 22% to 26%. Overall, I am pleased with Aflac\u2019s position in Japan and the U.S., the two largest insurance markets in the world.","First and foremost, we are focused on protecting our policyholders in providing value to our investors. We are fortunate within the process of doing so; we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide. Robin?","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thank you, Dan. Let me go through some fourth quarter numbers starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with top line, in the interim revenues were up 10.5% for the quarter, investment income was up 5.2%. Excluding the effect of the weaker yen in the quarter on Aflac Japan\u2019s dollar denominated investment income, net investment income rose 3.6%. The persistency rate improved in the quarter and the annualized rate excluding annuities for the year was 94.9% compared with 94.4% a year ago.","In terms of quarterly operating ratio, the benefit ratio, the total premium increased over last year going from 72.9% a year go to 74.5% in this quarter. This is primarily due to the growth of the net benefit reserves for our ordinary line of business most notably our WAYS product. The expense ratio was 18.4%, down from 19.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease reflected tight general expense control as well as lower commission cost associated with the sales of our first sector products, primarily the WAYS again.","Pretax profit margin declined during the quarter going from 18.8% to 17.7%, with the contraction of the margin pretax earnings increased 4.1% in yen terms.","Now, let me turn to Aflac U.S., total revenues rose 5.8% for the quarter, the annualized persistency rate for the year improved from 76.2% a year ago to 77.1%, and looking at the operating ratios for the quarter as the benefit ratio to total premium declined slightly from 57.7% a year ago to 57.4% in the quarter.","The operating expense ratio increased slightly going from 34.2% a year ago to 34.6%. The profit margin for the quarter was unchanged from a year ago at 14.6%. Pretax operating earnings increased 5.9% for the quarter.","Turning to the investment activity for the quarter starting with Aflac Japan for the quarter approximately $3.1 billion of Aflac Japan\u2019s new cash flow was invested in the corporate bond program for the growth yield of 3.22% at an annualized hedge cost 41 bips, the yield net of hedge cost was 2.81%.","Additionally, we invested $1.4 billion from the proceeds generated as the result of the booking activity. This brings the total cash flow invested in the corporate bond program for the year to approximately $7 billion with a total yield on the corporate bond program of 3.3%. Approximately, 35% of our new cash flow was invested in JGBs in the fourth quarter for an average yield of 1.77%. In Japan, the total new money yields for the quarter was 2.73%, down three basis points from September 30, and up 65 basis points from a year ago. The portfolio yield was 2.87% at the end of December or 3 basis points from end of September and 42 basis points lower than year ago.","JGC yield saw some increase towards the end of December, as December the 31 full year JGB yield were 1.75%, 11 basis points increase from September 30. Ten-year JGB yield as of December 31 were 0.79%, a one dip increase from September 30.","In terms of U.S. investments to new money yield for the quarter was 3.52%, a decline of 42 basis points from September 30 and 183 points from a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of December was 6.35%, down 16 basis points from September 30 and 37 basis points from a year ago.","Turning to some other items in the quarter, non-insurance interest expense in the quarter was $50 million compared with $42 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflected increased borrowing during the year compared to a year ago. Total company pre-tax operating margins declined reflecting the increase of the benefit ratio in Japan caused by strong sales of ordinary line of business.","Parent company and other expenses decreased from $20 million a year ago to $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. On operating basis, the tax rate is 34.1% compared with 34.6% a year ago. Consistent with what we said last quarter, going forward, we expect the effective tax rate throughout 2013 to be between 34% and 34.5%, excluding tax benefits recognized in 2012 and assuming FSA earned premiums on year-over-year, which is in line with Dan\u2019s comments earlier.","As Dan mentioned, we\u2019ve taken several actions during the year to utilize capital loss that will expire in 2013 and only significantly reduce the losses that are scheduled to expire in 2014.","We expect to continue the actions we have initiated to utilize the remaining capital loss carryforwards in managing our investment portfolio. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 2.1% to $1.48 in the quarter, which again decreased operating earnings by $0.04 per diluted share, excluding the yen impact operating earnings per share increased 4.8% for the quarter.","Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for 2013. As you\u2019ve heard Dan say, we\u2019ve affirmed our guidance for 2013 of 4% to 7% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. To understand the significant our 2013 EPS objective over 2012 actual results winning to this perspective for you.","In 2012, we received tax benefit from our tax exempt for the years 2008 and 2009, and we\u2019ve made a revision for the full year impact of tax effective tax rate. The unusual benefits received in 2012 totaled approximately $38 or $0.08 per share. We also recovered a previously written-off coupon as part of the sales transaction executed during the year that resulted in a one-time benefit to operating earnings of $23 million, or $0.05 per share. If you exclude the impact of these benefits from the 2012 operating earnings note, operating earnings per diluted share in sale would have been $6.47.","This year we estimate that a \u00a51 move on the average annual exchange rate will equal approximately $4.3 for diluted share. Considering the weakening of the yen in recent months, if we achieve our objective of 47% increase in operating earnings per diluted share for the year at yen averages 90% for the full year, we would expect operating EPS to be in the range of $6.37 to $6.57 per diluted share.","Now, we\u2019re ready to take your questions. To be fair to everybody, please remember to limit yourselves to one initial question and only one follow-up that relates to the initial question.","Now, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Dally \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. Good morning, everyone. So we see Japan benefit ratio, clearly quite a large increase this quarter on a sequential basis. But at least historically, fourth quarter \u2013 did we have some reserve recalibrations? I\u2019m hoping to get some color on how much reserve recalibrations impacted the ratio this quarter and with around back of the trends we\u2019ve seen emerge whether we should be expecting a somewhat higher benefit ratio in 2013 than your previous year guidance back in Investor day? Thanks.","Kriss Cloninger III","Hey Nigel, it\u2019s Kriss Cloninger, bit of a scratchy voice this time. But you\u2019re correct that the fourth quarter benefit ratio was higher than those we experienced in the first three quarters partly because of (inaudible) reserve recalibrations. And we typically do in conjunction with reviews of primarily closed lots of business in Japan and U.S., where we look at the reserve balances that we forecasted. Relative to the interest rates you used in valuing those blocks in the prior year, our SOX procedure is required that we do this and the fourth quarter is kind of a routine thing.","And this year we increased the benefit reserves on a Japanese block of business that we call Dementia. You\u2019ve probably heard of it before. It\u2019s similar to long-term care in the U.S. and that was approximately \u00a53 billion reserve increase in the fourth quarter.","I believe we had a similar adjustment in the fourth quarter of the prior year. And actually the fourth quarter of the prior year was up even more than the first three quarters. But that doesn\u2019t indicate that that\u2019s going to have a trend going forward, Nigel. The ratios excluding that reserve adjustment were right in the middle of the trends I\u2019ve shown at the FAB meeting last May, or work out what the expected benefit expense ratios and profit margins were for the core health and other block and the ordinary block separately and then I aggregated on the total.","And all of our ratios fell within those ranges that I guided to last May, and I believe that those ranges will continue to prevail throughout 2013. As I indicated last May, there are two year weighted-average ratio expected for 2012 and 2013, and so we\u2019re still in good shape in that regard.","As a matter of fact, our 2012 experienced profit margin came in right in the middle of the range 19.5%. Benefit ratio was a little bit higher. Expense ratio was a little bit lower. In the aggregate, because we produced more WAYS than we produced health benefits and so that affected the weighted-average.","The final thing I\u2019ll say is that I do caveat things last May saying okay, these are ratios that will prevail over the course of the two year period, but you\u2019re going to see some seasonal fluctuations and I was thinking primarily of the fourth quarter adjustments that we made that you saw and pointed out. So I\u2019ll conclude just by saying I believe everything is in line with what we had expected.","Nigel Dally \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Very helpful. Thanks, Kriss.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. I had question on capital repatriation, just wondering how you think about or actually capital deployment? How do you think about the pick-up in RBC and the solvency margin given the weaker yen? Would you be willing to deploy the extra points for buybacks or something else or is that unlikely given that the currency can move around. And then related to that just maybe Dan if you could comment on or Kriss just the pace of buybacks expected for 2013, should it be more front-end loaded or would you do it either later through the year?","Kenneth S. Janke Jr.","Jimmy, this is Ken. Let me start out with the RBC SMR question. Clearly, we are benefitting from a weaker yen. \u00a51 move probably adds about 3 to 4 points in the SMR, about 4, 5 points on the RBC. But what we\u2019ll do is, we\u2019ll have to evaluate it as we get a little bit closer especially with respect to repatriation. We\u2019ve always discussed our RBC and SMR in terms of the yen sensitivity, so we do want to make sure that we provide for some kind of buffer if we see a reversal in the yen weakening, because strengthening the yen would penalize a little bit.","Daniel P. Amos","What was the other question I\u2019ve got?","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan","just the pace of buybacks?","Daniel P. Amos","I think, if there is an opportunity in the first quarter we\u2019ll take advantage of it a little bit more so than we would in the second half, because it just ensures earnings growth and it benefits us.","Kenneth S. Janke Jr.","And I add to that Jimmy, we do have pretty good liquidity at the parent company. Our operating cash balance was about $770 million at the end of 2012. And clearly buying earlier in the year has a greater benefit to EPS for the year.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan","And you mentioned the $400 million at a minimum on buybacks, but the top end of your range is $600 million. How likely is $600 million given that, if you look at current exchange rates, your repatriation amounts actually implies some $500 million at current exchange rate?","Daniel P. Amos","Well, we have no problem with that additional capital at the corporate level if we need it to being able to do that. So, we are going to take it as it evolves, but I think the way you should do this is that, 400 million where we\u2019re trying to, unless some cataclysmic event guarantee and we like to do more than that, and we\u2019ll watch it as the year goes on and make a decision accordingly.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Berg, RBC Capital Markets.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much. I apologize for the background noise. I\u2019ll go on mute if necessary after asking my question. So you have your discounted advance premium and with a greater boom to sales, but then it sort of profitability, so you took it away. But that hurt sales terribly, so now you are bringing it back.","Two questions, one, where does it leave you from a profitability point of view? In other words, you did you do this and where does this lead, why was this great decision to take it away and then bring it back. And don\u2019t you on the risk of confusing customers and distributors by well flip flopping right a bit? Thank you.","Daniel P. Amos","Well, it\u2019s actually not so much flip flopping, because we are only putting it in effect when the rate increase goes into effect. So in essence, we didn\u2019t want to double rate increase to them. So what we\u2019ve done is we put the rate increase in effect although the DAP going from 1 to 0.5 and then we are bringing it back because we\u2019ve got another rate increase on top of that, and Kriss can talk about that, but the actual rate increase was more appropriate last year at this time with the declining interest rate and an increasing interest rate that we\u2019re moving into right now. Kriss?","Kriss Cloninger III","Well, I just say Eric as we saw declining interest rates throughout 2012, we felt like we will be in pressure to own profitability from the MEMS popularity of the 1% DAP rate and the significant impact on production of WAYS. I mean we were getting extraordinary volumes and WAYS production and we felt like may be we were selling dollar bills for $0.50 kind of thing. So we felt like in order to project the margins going forward, we needed to diminish some of the perhaps above average appeal for the WAYS product by cutting the DAP rate to the level that most other companies were crediting, which was in the neighborhood of 0.5%.","So we implemented that in October. We did several other things during the same period of time when interest rates were declining during 2012. We with some production caps on child endowment and we revisit the five WAYS and things like that. So we were trying to protect the profitability that the analyst community and we were concerned about. And so we try to protect our core profitability when we made those changes.","Now, from April 1, we are going to reprise products given the change in the standard valuation interest rate down to 1% premium rates and the WAYS products are going to go up 15% to 20%, the margins are going to go up towards 20% as a percent of premium and we felt like we needed to restore some of the market appeal of the discount advanced premium rate, so we decided we could easily afford to change it back from 0.5% to 1% in order to better foster us competitively in the industry. So it\u2019s not a flip-flop, it\u2019s a reaction to changes and market conditions is how I will characterize it.","Daniel P. Amos","Let me say this Eric, we knew when we introduced cutting the DAP that this was a possibility we might do in April. So we told the bank that was always a possibility that it could happen.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So here then is my follow-up. Let\u2019s not call a foot path, that\u2019s too harsh a word, it is what it is, you make one decision and as you\u2019ve changed of course. By taking the tax as you have, I get some interest, it sounds like you will not be as well off from a profitability point of view, or March in point of view as would have been the case if you kept this DAP in place. But net-net where will all these actions leave you once you have and the outline is total dollar profit, not margins, right. It\u2019s about total dollar profits and up-sell, not up margins but total dollar profit. So net-net, when you have the price increase in April, but you restore the full DAP, where will that leave you relative to what would have been the case if you were kept the DAP in place? Thank you.","Daniel P. Amos","Well, you are exactly right, Eric. It\u2019s a question of the trade-off and volume versus margin. And that\u2019s what I said when we went into WAYS in the first place relative to the third sector of health. We are going to ride a higher volume of products with a lower margin. We finally decided, okay, the margins got too low given the interest rate environment.","So we took the repricing action of lowering the DAP in order to restore some margin. When we do that we knew we were going to loose some volume that which we did here in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s \u2013 but if you say the impact of total profitability, you can get as much profit with a lower volume of higher margin products and you end with a higher volume of lower margin products. That come April 1, we\u2019re being forced by market changes to increase the base policy premium rates on the WAYS. But in order to stay competitive, we believe it is necessary to go ahead and increase the DAP rate, so that we don\u2019t lose so much volume associated with being uncompetitive that we don\u2019t achieve the margin.","So you are right, if we maintain DAP at 0.5%, our margin would have been higher, but it would have been closer to 25% then say the high-teens to 20% that we expect after we rise the DAP back to 1%. And we think that, that will pass us in the market to be competitive, and will achieve a higher volume of production at a reasonable margin and enhance the overall profitability of company.","Daniel P. Amos","Yeah, I want to say one thing, this is not uncommon in the life insurance area when you are dealing with these type of issues. We knew it going in, we knew that when we decreased the DAP, we could raise it back, because of the other depending on what was happening. If we had been an environment where between October and now, we saw interest rates going down, we certainly would have kept it enforce. But it gives us flexibility to monitor and adjust, but there is nothing that our competitors are not doing too, and we are totally aware of it. Now from your standpoint, its new \u2013 in the third sector products we never had these issues. But we are very aware of it, we are on top of it, and we understand what we\u2019re doing.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you for your very complete answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Giovanni, Goldman Sachs.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks so much. I guess first question around the independent agency count in Japan, which showed a significant decline quarter-over-quarter and now down to I think levels seen in 2008. So just want to be curious, what\u2019s going on there, is that really what you are kind of playing for and focusing on with the focus now on cancer and typical third sector product sales?","Daniel P. Amos","Tohru, you want to answer that?","Tohru Tonoike","Yes, thank you. Yes, let me say that the decline in the number of the recruits of the individual agents is something we intended to do, because we found that, in the past couple of years we found that recruiting too many agents and training them are not effective \u2013 efficient enough for us to do it. So instead we decided to shift some of our resources used for that purpose to other more productive areas including the bank channel development.","So we shifted the people and money from that to other areas. And that as a result, as you may see, the number of the recruits dropped substantially. But we\u2019ve made more efforts in training them \u2013 training the smaller number of the new ridicules, so that we can be productive in short period of time. So even though the number of recruits declined over more than 30% the rate of \u2013 I would say the success rate of the first year recruits, the ratio of the newly recruited agents becoming productive within the year increased by 13%. So net-net the annual premium, our sales produced by these first year recruits were down around, more than 20%. But in subsequent of the yen, the growing was somewhat less than \u00a5600 million. Let\u2019s put it in the perspective that is on the \u2013 less than 0.3% of our total annual premium.","So we believe that decline was made up or more than made up by the growth in other areas to which we shifted our resources. If don\u2019t tell how much will be increased by them. But we are confident that was \u2013 we did it on purpose and we are confident that we did the things right.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just my follow-up question, you obviously talked about rising the DAP now. You didn\u2019t make a number of other changes to kind of restrict some sales in the bank channel. So curious if, now that Eric\u2019s getting better new money ratio over there if you guys would consider loosening up any of those other changes as well if sales don\u2019t come true?","Daniel P. Amos","We have loosened up the restrictions on the Charles Dalmon. We have put some production limits, employees that we\u2019ve loosened up. We\u2019re not changing the 5-pay WAYS decision. We feel like that was a good decision to put the emphasis more on the 10-pay WAYS. It has 10 years of inter-charge, so we\u2019re not changing that, but we are staying with the whole life WAYS and making changes to the discounted advanced premium rate and of course, premium levels or WAYS in general. We\u2019re also looking at sales incentives to certain banks and to address competitive situation for other companies that come in and given incentives and the like.","So, the market response to competitive conditions is multifaceted should I say and we\u2019re trying to stay on top of it all, because we have relationships with virtually all the banks in Japan. So we get feedbacks (inaudible) and we\u2019re continuing to emphasis staying competitive.","Daniel P. Amos","But I think the message that I would give you is that the foundation that it build out life Japan which is cancer. And now medical is what we are concentrating on, because it was a somewhat of an anomaly the way it happened with the banks and our ability to write that first sector product specifically WAYS. We took it, because it was there and it was a great profit for us. But we\u2019re now shifting money and resources back to the traditional channel, which where is we believe is, we want to stay number one in both medical and cancer. And that\u2019s what we plan on doing going forward and that\u2019s where the bonuses are tied and now we just get back to hit. But it was a strategic decision we\u2019ve made at that time. We told you that we didn\u2019t know how long it would last. We now see it coming more to an end and we see us concentrating on bank and the profit margins we discussed in the past and going back to doing that on the third sector.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Randy Binner, FBR.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Great, thanks. Just want to pick up on the repatriation conversation from a different angle. I think Jimmy was asking about how the currency impacts, but I was more curious to kind of understand what the methodology was that led to these impairments this quarter on Tunisia and UniCredit. And just to clarify if those were impaired or sold, I guess what I\u2019m trying to get to is to understand if there is other bonds that are still kind of in low mark-to-market positions if those could be at risk in the next couple of quarters and if that would work against potential repatriation.","Daniel P. Amos","Let me start by reminding everybody that the strategy throughout 2012 particularly after the first quarter when we did a very specific derisking program was to look at our portfolio throughout the year and be opportunistic with respect to when good opportunities presented themselves to improve the quality of the balance sheet that we would do that, but only do that but it represented good value for our policy and shareholders.","We did not sell anything in a panic throughout the year. We\u2019re very careful and we had a very successful year altogether reducing about $4.6 billion of multiple positions throughout Europe and the financial and we do not have a specific derisking strategy going forward. Having said that, we will always look for opportunities to improve the risk return profile this balance sheet for the long-term, and if we see something of value then of course we\u2019ll take advantage of that.","With respect to your two specific questions, with respect to UniCredit that\u2019s a good example. That\u2019s an example of a credit, it could have been comfortable holding but amongst our holdings we felt there were some respect to UniCredit itself and it\u2019s not going to affect our particular holdings. I can tell you early in 2012, we saw values for those particular assets that did not represent good value for our shareholders or policyholders and we said thanks, but no thanks. In an improved market as we\u2019ve had, we saw particularly good value and in fact that (inaudible) is associated with the sale of those securities.","To measure on the other hand, it\u2019s slightly different in terms of the risk that we see. As you may know in December I got downgraded by one of the agencies and in our view, the risk with Tunisia is more geopolitical risk as opposed to credit risk, but nevertheless because of the situation in the Middle East, the risk will cognizant enough.","With those things in mind, we did decide to take an impairment reflecting our current views on Tunisia, which we thought that was the conservative thing to do. On a forward-looking basis, there is no specific derisking program. But of course, we will always look at our holdings, we will react to credit ratings, we will react to market conditions and take appropriate actions when we feel necessary.","I think as you look over the next 12 months, Europe is still of course a concern, prior authorizations in Europe have decreased. As you look at that as a percentage of portfolio, it\u2019s down from about a year ago 30% to 20%. And I have said as that bucket of assets continue to decrease, the quality of what we hold in Europe is actually increasing vis-\u00e0-vis the total bucket of what we had in Europe.","I don\u2019t expect Europe to become volatile as it did during 2011 and 2012, but you can\u2019t rule that out. So assuming anything from a stable environment, we won\u2019t expect much activity or impact to our holdings. Of course, Europe should become more volatile that would create for our holdings perhaps some rating pressures, but again the size of our assets in Europe, the financials have all been reduced substantially. So it\u2019s much lower risk than we faced when I arrived a little over a year ago.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Thank you for that. Those were very comprehensive. One quick follow-up just kind of from me \u2013 there is a little bit of overlap or timing issues with FSA year and then the way we look at the company. But just to clarify the risk to the repatriation would be whatever credit losses could happen in the first and second quarter of 2013. Is that correct?","Kenneth S. Janke, Jr.","This is Ken, Randy. Yeah, that\u2019s correct. It\u2019s really until we file our FSA financial statements, which is typically done at early mid-June.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Perfect, thanks.","Kenneth S. Janke, Jr.","All the losses that we incurred through the fourth quarter of 2012 are reflected in our current outlook for FSA results.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Gallagher, Credit Suisse.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. I guess for Dan or Kriss, if you are not able to give us WAYS sales guidance for 2013, how confident are you for 2013 EPS guidance? And just asking that obviously, because WAYS were about 45% of your sales in Japan last year.","Daniel P. Amos","I\u2019m extremely confident. I\u2019ve never missed earnings guidance since I\u2019ve been CEO on 23 years. Saying that, it\u2019s harder now that it used to be, but in my mind I have a number for what I think bank sales will be. But I will remind you that last year I told you would be down 10% on this call and we were up 30%. So to make a projection when there was that most volatility last year just seeing some \u2013 it would not be a realistic number.","So I just want to wait, so I get a little closer and see what\u2019s going to happen. But with all the things we have and going on in terms of persistency, the controls we\u2019ve had over the budget, the claims and how they track exactly where we said we would, the new money rate on an upward trajectory, all those things made me confident that we will achieve it. But again it\u2019s a little harder because of different things.","Kenneth S. Janke, Jr.","Yeah, Tom, this is Ken, let me add one thing, because you\u2019ve seen this story before. You recall in early 2000s, we had sales pressures in Japan following the liberalization of their market. We had sales pressures in the United States following our duck bubble and sales hit done so well for a period of a few years. In all of those times, we didn\u2019t miss earnings and largely that\u2019s because the vast majority of our revenues and earnings come from a renewable source.","When you consider the persistency rates, about 90% of Japan\u2019s premium income comes from renewals and investment income is largely from a renewal source. So we have a pretty good idea right now what about 80% to 85% of our revenues are going to look like for 2013, and with the stability of the and predictability of the benefit and expense ratios, that\u2019s what gives us visibility into earnings. So the bottom line is we have more visibility into the income statement than we do right now for the sales to the bank channel.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","That\u2019s helpful. And just my follow-up is the 15% to 20% acceptable margin, I just want to make sure I understand the parameters of that and Kriss, that\u2019s 15% to 20% versus premium or is that total revenues?","Kriss Cloninger III","It\u2019s like present value profits to present value premiums, it\u2019s kind of an actuarial thing, but it\u2019s really representative of the GAAP profit margin as a percent of well it be revenues.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","And when you say present value, is there \u2013 are we going to see any accounting disconnect from that in the first year or two that those products come on the books, meaning, is it lower in the initial years, or where we see that level of profitability emerge from a GAAP accounting standpoint kind of right out of the gate?","Daniel P. Amos","Well, for all of our business we\u2019ve got several calls at a non-referable that we expensed in the first year. But other than those non-referable expenses, the margins tend to be level for each year of the product life as a percent of revenue.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. So for a year or two that\u2019s when you see emerge year one the same.","Daniel P. Amos","Right, right.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks.","Daniel P. Amos","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Bass, Citigroup.","Eric Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Hi, good morning. Robin touched a little bit on the deferred tax assets, and I was just hoping if you could provide a little bit more color on what you are doing and kind of what the cash tax benefit is to the company? And then I guess related if there is any potential to accelerate some of the tax assets that are maturing in future years?","Kenneth S. Janke","So Eric, this is Ken. We entered into series of transactions last year without getting a great detail, but that allowed us to offset all of the tax base losses that we incurred for 2012, as well as to eliminate the carryforwards, all of the carryforwards to 2013, which amounted to $214 million. In a substantial portion about 60% of the tax loss carryforwards that expire in 2014, about 60%.","So we feel like we\u2019re in pretty good shape. We\u2019re going to continue to explore transactions like economic sense to the company first and foremost then that would benefit our operations and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to address those in the process.","Eric Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And just remind that\u2019s kind of what the aggregate amount of future potential deferred tax assets you have remaining?","Kriss Cloninger III","We\u2019ve got about $2 billion remaining, little less than $2 billion. The most significant portion of which is $1.3 billion of losses that were generated in 2011 that would expire in 2016.","Eric Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thank you.","Robin Y. Wilkey","","Thank you, Eric. And we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your last question comes from John Nadel, Sterne, Agee.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee","Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe I\u2019ll follow-up a little bit on WAYS. In the second half of 2012, your new money investment rate in Japan was considerably above the 2.50% level where I think in the past you\u2019ve indicated, you need that level of investment rate to be able to hit that 17% to 21% targeted margin on your prior WAYS design. So we ignore Kriss the impact of those non-deferrable costs that you mentioned in the response to Tom, would you say that your WAYS sales in the second half of 2012 were achieving those targeted margins?","Kriss Cloninger III","Yes, I believe they were John, particularly with the higher investment yield and the like combined with the reduction in the discounted advance premium rate. Actually, if we could continue say the 2.5% that investment yield on new money, I wish we didn\u2019t have to change anything as far as discounted advance premium and gross premium rates, which we didn\u2019t have to go through this re-pricing activity. We\u2019ve got to go through on April 1.","So margins were good in my mind, so we have no choice relative to re-pricing April 1, because if we don\u2019t re-price there is going to be significant regulatory surplus associated with the higher reserves associated with the 1% standard valuation rate. I was comfortable with the fourth quarter margin given the higher net investment yield and that\u2019s why we feel confident that we can restore discounted advance premium rate from April 1.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee","And then just a quick follow-up. So if we then, if we are thinking about that hitting that targeted margin with the 2.5% or better investment yield, new money investment yield, in your one with taking into account to non-deferrable cost, how much does that cut into that margin in year one. I mean I\u2019m thinking about it this way, you had massive WAYS sales in 2011, they more than doubled in 2012, I mean is it possible that with those non-deferrable cost behind you at least on those two big years of sales that the margin jumps in 2013?","Kriss Cloninger III","Certainly well on that block of business that\u2019s for sure.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee","And I mean order of magnitude, Kriss, can you give us a sense for how much those non-deferrable cost drag that margin in year one?","Kriss Cloninger III","","Yeah let me think for just a second. I would say they could train at 20% to 30% of premium. So, we might be looking at flat virtually zero to slightly negative margin. In the actual reported in the first 12 months of the businesses in effect, actually it pretty much a course of the issue at the time of issue, because when the business goes on the books, we first put up the deferred acquisition cost and that\u2019s an offset to the expenses incurred. But the asset we established is not as high as the actual expenses that we incur particularly into the new DAC standard that we have to implement recently.","So that\u2019s a bit of a drain, but it happens all the time and so we got a mixed year of second year business coming in with a higher margin and new business going on the books with lower. But you are right, the big volume of WAYS we put on the books depress the margin in particularly the third and fourth quarter.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee","And I\u2019m sorry if I could sneak one more follow-up on it, because I think it\u2019s important. I mean it sort of comes back to the question around expectation for sales of this product in 2013 if the year one margin is zero to slightly negative, but the year two margin can be mid-teens or higher, then it seems pretty important to understand, or to have some expectation as to whether WAYS sales are going to be down, up, or flat in 2013 versus 2012?","Kenneth S. Janke, Jr.","Yeah. Well, you are right. And then we will relieve some of that strain associated with non-deferrable acquisition cost and the new business will come on in a higher margin. That\u2019s what I was trying to get to back in Eric Bird\u2019s question. If you ride up higher volume and lower margin business, you achieve one level of profit. Then subsequently if you ride a lower volume and higher margin business, you can be similar and in total profitability, I think that\u2019s what you are getting at is that, even though sales are going to be down, profits are going to be down nearly as much and may impact the up.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee","Well, I mean in fact it seems based on your answers around the non-deferrable cost for instance, if we have sales R&D down year-over-year in 2013, that profits has to be up or else equal\u2026","Kenneth S. Janke, Jr.","If you get to Ken\u2019s point about, 90% of the profits being associated with renewal business. So\u2026","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee","Plus the lack of the non-deferrable costs?","Kenneth S. Janke, Jr.","Yeah. For all the margin, you are correct.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee","All right. Thank you very much.","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thanks. All right. Thank you very much.

Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Robin Y. Wilkey - Senior Vice President-Investor and Rating Agency Relations","Good morning and welcome to our third quarter call. Joining me this morning in the U.S. is Dan Amos, our Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Inc.; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S. and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also from Tokyo joining us is Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan.","Now before we start, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ martially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.","Now, I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin with some comments about the quarter, as well as our operations in both the U.S. and Japan. Following Dan's comments, Fred will follow up with some brief comments about our financial performance for the quarter.","Dan?","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Robin, and good morning. And thank you for joining us.","Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I'm extremely pleased that sales of the third sector products were up an astonishing 34.5% for the third quarter and 27.1% year-to-date. Aflac Japan generated strong sales results from all of our sales channels, which confirms that we focused on the right facets of our business.","We also continue to work closely with Japan Post to enhance our partnership as demonstrated by the recently announced initiative to foster enhanced communications with the growing elderly population in Japan. Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions and our quarterly and year-to-date results reflect our success in broadening our reach and our sales opportunities.","I want to remind you that Aflac Japan's 2014 fourth quarter sales of third sector products were up 28.5%, thus making this year's fourth quarter a tough comparison. However given the very strong sales results in the first nine months and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are upwardly revising our sales growth target for the third sector products from the range of 7% to 10% to 10% to 13% for the full year.","Now, let me turn to the U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. also performed very well in the quarter. Additionally we have continued to receive phenomenal feedback from our distribution channels, our policyholders, and accounts on One Day Pay, our industry leading claims initiative. One Day Pay allows us to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day.","In particular, we're hearing from policyholders and consumers that our commitment to paying claims fast through One Day Pay underscores Aflac's integrity and commitment delivering on our promise. Thus enhancing our brand reputation and ultimately opening even more doors for Aflac. We continue to estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their claims. In 2015 we expect the number of claims processed within the One Day Pay will reach over 2 million people. Along with the strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to drive home the value of Aflac's products and most importantly, it will help our sales long term.","Although our U.S. segments generated a slight increase in sales, I believe 2015 has been a year of building our business through our career and broker channels. Taking into account our results for the first nine months and our expectations for sales for the quarter, we anticipate Aflac U.S. will generate sales growth at the lower end of the 3% to 7% range for the year. While it's been a year of building, I am not satisfied with these results. In fact, I won't be satisfied until we see our sales growth more in the range of the mid-single digits, which I believe is reasonable and achievable.","It is very difficult for us to make sales projections for the quarter or even for the year because around half of our sales will come in the last five weeks of the year. But I can tell you that the changes we've made to our management infrastructure over the last year are laying the groundwork for better, long-term sales prospects. And we continue to invest in our platform to position us for growth. As we look to 2016, I think the groundwork we laid in 2015 has put us in a better position for 2016.","Shortly, Fred will comment on the financial and capital deployment, but let me just say that I am pleased with the actions by the board of directors to increase the quarterly cash dividend by 5.1%. This marks the 33rd consecutive year of increasing cash dividend. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation.","Let me leave you with this thought; you've already heard me say that my job is to balance the interest of all stakeholders. I think we did a good job of that this year just as we have in the past. And I believe that we're going to do it again next year by delivering on our promise to our policyholders and returning significant capital to our owners.","Now, I'll turn it over to Fred. Fred?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Dan. You've all had a chance to review our earnings release. I'll focus my brief comments on a few earnings items worthy of note in the quarter, adding color on key earnings drivers, capital conditions and deployment as we enter the fourth quarter. Our third quarter results came in at the high end of our earnings guidance. Along with solid overall results, there are two earnings items that contributed to our better-than-expected performance.","The first item was in Japan where we continue to see overall favorable claims trends. While we review our IBNR every quarter, we take a more comprehensive annual look at trends and claims studies in the third and fourth quarter.","Reflecting on our favorable claims experience this year and as a result of this review, we concluded it was appropriate to reduce the IBNR reserves for our cancer insurance block of business by approximately \u00a54.2 billion or roughly $35 million before taxes. We have not completed our yearend actuarial reviews, but at this point we do not see or anticipate any material fourth quarter adjustments.","The second driver was in our U.S. business where we have been steadily improving our customer billing and collection procedures. These improvements have resulted in better collection experience and allowed us to refine our uncollected premium allowance estimate. The catch-up portion of this adjustment helped improve our rate of earned premium growth in the quarter and contributed approximately $8 million to pre-tax earnings.","While these items contributed approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share to the quarter's results, overall our Japan and U.S. operations enjoyed solid margins with adjusted benefit ratios favorable to our expectations and as compared with last year's quarter. As we expected, expense ratios were modestly elevated as we continue to invest in our platforms to generate growth, namely IT and new product introduction in Japan and our distribution model in the U.S.","Turning to investments, while we have been successful in defending net investment income, the overall low-rate environment remains a clear headwind and shows no signs of abating. We have natural maturities and higher coupon investments that are running off with proceeds reinvested at lower yields. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher returns compared to low yields in Japan and the U.S.","We took a larger-than-normal impairment in the quarter involving our investment in Navient Corp. Navient is a publicly traded student loan administrator formerly part of Sallie Mae. While we don't believe there are any near-term risk of default, the majority of these holdings are long-dated and yen denominated with poor liquidity. As a result these holdings trade at a deep discount. At roughly $0.50 on the dollar we felt it prudent to take impairment.","Note that the majority of these securities are held in our Japan portfolio and are rated below investment grade. As a result any decline in value has been reflected for Japan SMR purposes for several quarters. The impairment has no material impact on our overall capital position and deployment plans.","Turning to capital, we expect SMR and RBC ratios to remain strong. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned just over $400 million to our shareholders in the quarter and expect to fulfill our guidance of $1.3 billion in repurchases for the year.","Our dividend increase is in line with our expectation for full year 2015 operating earnings per share growth, excluding the impact of currency. I would note that despite continuing weakness in the yen, our excess capital position and stable view of capital generation supports the increase.","Before I turn the call back over to Rob and for Q&A, I'd like to comment on our earnings guidance. Our fourth quarter guidance simply solves for our full year 2015 EPS guidance range of $5.96 a share to $6.16 a share given our year-to-date results.","As we look to the fourth quarter and proceed through our financial planning process, we see the following dynamics influencing our performance. Recognizing the effect of our past reinsurance transactions in Japan, we see earned premium in Japan and the U.S. increasing in the low single-digit range with stable persistency. We see core Japan and U.S. benefit ratios holding strong around current levels after normalizing for the Japan IBNR reduction in the quarter. The maturity of high yielding investments reinvested at lower new money rates will continue to pressure net investment income, although modestly offset by a strategic asset allocation and recognizing a bias towards higher quality.","The growth we are experiencing in Japan required disciplined investment in customer care, product, and distribution expansion. We see the same dynamic evolving in the U.S. in order to drive more robust growth rates. Our strong capital position and deployment efforts will continue to provide support for EPS growth. Our capital generation is strong and we continue to explore the potential to release additional excess capital. Absent attractive alternatives, we expect to drive long-term value in repurchasing our stock. These dynamics are generally consistent with our performance in 2015. We look forward to providing more details on our December third outlook call.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Robin to begin Q&A.","Robin Y. Wilkey - Senior Vice President-Investor and Rating Agency Relations","Thank you, Fred. Now we're ready to take your questions. But first let me remind you that to be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to one initial question and only one follow up that relates to that initial question. All right, we're now ready to take the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. First, I just had a question on your relationship with the Japan Post and how do you think it will be affected by the IPO like, do you expect them to be a little bit more proactive in selling Aflac's policies? And what's the risk that down the road as the Post looks to maximize its profits that they could try to get more commissions out of the companies that they sell products for, or maybe do away with exclusive distribution relationships. So just if you could address how the relationship with the Post could change post the IPO.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Paul?","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","This is Paul. First of all, we see our overall relationship with Japan Post continuing to be very strong. I'll ask Yamauchi-san to weigh in on the recent announcement of the two different points that are very different between the United States and Japan of that partnership. But overall, I do believe that our partnership through the IPO is something that has been very consistent. They are very proud of the work that has happened in the partnership between Aflac and Japan Post and we have no reason to believe that there will be any pressuring on margins or change in commissions. I think at this point, we are focused highly on continuing to grow the distribution through the now fully expanded 20,000 post offices and we continue to focus on executing through the new cancer plan that both \u2013 was specifically developed for Japan Post as well as the regular product that they're also selling.","Hiroshi Yamauchi - President & Chief Operating Officer, Aflac Japan Co., Ltd.","Thank you, Paul. Well, let me add a few comments in Japanese. [Foreign Language] (15:00-15:10). Well, in terms of the business alliance of JP that he just referred to, this may be something very specific to Japan. As you know, Japan is an aging society. [Foreign Language] (15:20-15:22). And the families are becoming more nuclearized. [Foreign Language] (15:25-15:37). So what the FSA or the society overall is really demanding for an insurance company is that we really need to check up on whether the policyholders, these older policyholders are still alive or not.","[Foreign Language] (15:51-16:04). And since, as you know, Japan Post has its mail delivery network across Japan, what we like to do is to use their network to check up on our policyholders. [Foreign Language] (16:15-16:30). And if we try to do everything on our own within Aflac, it is going to require a lot of work. However with the cooperation with JP, we will be able to achieve the same purpose in a relatively easier manner.","[Foreign Language] (16:44-16:52). And one other point, this is probably more specific to Japan as well, is that any notice that needs to be sent from an insurance company to policyholder has to be done by mail. [Foreign Language] (17:03-17:12). However, when the policyholder changes their addresses, we will not know the new address until our policyholders tells us so.","[Foreign Language] (17:22-17:38). So in overall it will lead to increasing the services to our customers because the JP, the post offices will know that our customers' address has changed because they are delivering the postal mails to them and that will make it easier for us to know where the policyholders are.","[Foreign Language] (17: 56-18:11). We do believe this is a great alliance because we are using the strength and what the JP does best in their way and we are making leverage out of what JP is doing and that will also benefit us and serve our policyholders as well. That is it from me.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me say, Jimmy, you can tell Yamauchi is very encouraged about this new announcement with the elderly, but the answer to your question is just simply, it's going as well or better than we expected and we see nothing but good things ahead in the future.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. And they've been through their IPO process. I think they have been talking up the potential opportunity to sell more products for companies such as yours. I was just concerned about the long-term risk if they try to, given their distribution breadth, maybe go after the underwriters and ask them for more commissions or try to open up the distribution to additional underwriters. But I guess we'll see how that evolves over time.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, at this particular point, we are very happy with the arrangements and they are too.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And maybe if I could ask just one more. On U.S. sales, given your results, I was a little surprised that you didn't actually end up lowering your guidance. So to what extent do you see that goal as achievable for this year versus it being somewhat of a stretch?","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","This is Teresa. From a U.S. perspective, we have a lot of moving parts going on. As Dan said in his talk, we are rebuilding that distribution and restructuring. We feel good about some things that we are seeing. We have looked at all of the markets. We're assessing market book of business, how they're managing those markets, training programs, recruiting practices and we're driving consistency and collaboration across the broker and career channels. So we feel good about what we're doing. It's taken a little bit longer for us to get there, longer obviously than we would like. But we are seeing more markets that are achieving the 5% increase in year-over-year sales.","There's been a tremendous amount of change in the way our business is coming in. And I think Dan spoke a little bit about that. We know that we're going to get a tremendous amount of business in the fourth quarter and I think we've been saying that from the beginning. So we're reviewing a lot of our modeling to project that. So we feel pretty good about the low end of the range and we see a lot of activities within the markets that look positive to us at this point.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jimmy, we've got to have an 8% increase in the fourth quarter. The real change here is the way this broker business comes in, it all now comes in, in the fourth quarter. And it makes me nervous and Teresa and everybody else nervous, will it come through. And we've got a pipeline that we know what's out there and we know there's more business out in the pipeline this year than in previous years, because this really started a year ago as you saw we were up 14% in the fourth quarter of last year.","So we're not sure how good that pipeline is, but our gut tells us that it should be and that we're expecting a good fourth quarter, but we'll have to monitor it and see. And as I said in the call, the last five weeks of the fourth quarter will bring in as much business, or close to as much as \u2013 probably 45\/55 as it did in the first eight weeks. So we won't know till the end of the quarter. But we do like what we're seeing in the pipeline from a broker perspective and what will take place. And then also, our 100 or less that we're writing in our Columbus, in career, is really working well and Teresa is doing a good job in that area and I'm very pleased with that.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much. With regard to the Japan margin, I believe it was mentioned that we should expect the margin to stay mostly unchanged and excluding the benefit that we saw in 3Q from the reserve release. Can you walk us through that a bit more?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks Jay. This is Fred. So where my comments were coming from, first, the adjustment in the quarter, let's make sure we understand that. So this was an adjustment to IBNR reserves related to our cancer business in Japan. And more specifically it was related to a subset of our IBNR that relates to what we characterize as tail related claims. So these would be longer duration claims or estimate of claims emerging typically longer than three years out. It's a relatively small portion of the total IBNR that we hold for cancer, but it's one that periodically, as in at least once a year, we do a more thorough examination of and test based on the trends we've been seeing in recent years.","And so as you can see, our trends have been very good on the overall claims front. And so when we put these reserves, these particular tail reserves under review, we comfortably determine that there was margin in those reserves and we should take them down. So that's the \u00a54.2 billion reduction that I referenced. And then I'm asking you to pull out, if you will, to think about the benefit ratios going forward. So my comments on the stability of benefit ratios is to first recognize that we have multiple businesses as you know in Japan, that have different benefit ratios and different benefit ratio and claims trends. But overall, when we pile them altogether and look at the overall Japan benefit ratio dynamic, we expect stability, but stability in third sector, particularly as you pull out that IBNR on the cancer side.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate that. The fourth quarter guidance seemed to show roughly the same trend as those in 3Q from an earnings power basis, even including that $0.06 to $0.07 you called out. Do you expect any one-timers in 4Q? Or is the run rate of earnings power just getting better as we continue through the year?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I think, first of all, we have a relatively wide margin, EPS margin, for the fourth quarter, and that's really the result of two things: one somewhat solving for the full year guidance range, which creates a larger fourth quarter range. The second is, of course, we have a range naturally based on our assumption for what the yen may do. We think in terms of the range being dictated by yen between \u00a5120 and \u00a5125. So that creates a wider range. But part of the reason we wanted to walk you through a couple of the normalizing items in the quarter was so that you could really roll forward our results in a fairly consistent way.","So, at the moment, our expectation is for stability in the key earnings drivers as we roll forward, and we would leave it at that. At this point in time, I don't know enough to know what I would characterize as one-timers. The only comment I made is that we do do more thorough actuarial reviews in the third and fourth quarter, and as we sit here today we don't see any material adjustments coming from those reviews, but it's still early in the process.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So the fourth quarter guidance range, obviously, it's reflective of the range in the yen, like you've talked about before, but it's essentially solving for the full year guidance range.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right. That's right.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...which hasn't changed. I got the sense that it had pointed higher, but I guess I was wrong on that. All right, thank you.","Robin Y. Wilkey - Senior Vice President-Investor and Rating Agency Relations","Jay, you need to look at last fourth quarter, too, and that will give you some sense of really where it's going.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, just to make a comment. So year-to-date we have grown \u2013 holding constant the yen, we've grown our operating earnings per share by about 2.9%. We've got guidance out there, full year guidance of 4% to 7%. Realize the fourth quarter last year, though, was a somewhat reduced earnings per share by virtue of accelerated expenses or accelerated spend. So it had a disproportionate weighing down on that EPS.","So, again, my view is, as we sit here today, my comments were rolling forward and really consistency and stability in the earnings drivers as we sit here today and roll forward into the fourth quarter, and I don't see, at the moment, don't see any sharp moves, but again, it's very early in the quarter and I'm really talking specifically to the actuarial work, not so much other items that may appear naturally in a quarter.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks and good morning. With Japan sales, the strength in third sector was certainly very encouraging, but the growth in first sector was perhaps a little surprising. Back at Investor Day you talked about those being down 25% to 40% and how you had very limited appetite for those products, given the very low-rate environment. But still seems like you're writing a fair amount of it. Sales this quarter were up 6%. So just hoping you can discuss what's going on there.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know...","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","Let me...","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Go ahead, Paul.","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","Go ahead, Fred.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'll just make a couple comments and then Paul can provide more of the strategic color on it. But, first, we monitor the sale of these products, first sector products very carefully, because the returns on those products can be very sensitive to the interest rate environment, as you point out, but also your investment strategy backing these products. And so even though the interest rate environment is very low, it's always possible that our investment strategies, and you've seen recently that, particularly in the third quarter, we've been able to descend our new money rates and put money to work at relatively attractive levels, albeit headwinds are definitely in the marketplace. And so they're very sensitive to that type of investment strategy.","But more importantly, we've really made moves to really focus the type of product that we're selling to deemphasize lump-sum premium, or so called dump-in premium-type product and also product that is sold particularly in the bank channel where it's more of a spread-sheeted environment and a competitive landscape. Those things coupled with the interest rate and investment market could make for volatile returns or challenging returns, and so we want to deemphasize that.","Where we're emphasizing is the longer pay products, which gives us more possibility of putting money to work at attractive levels. It also tends to attract more of a protection orientation versus investment orientation. And most importantly, it's being driven through the traditional channels, which support cross-sale activity. And again recognizing once you're into cross-sale activity, you're trying to look at the overall blended return on a household, which includes the returns on these products plus third sector products.","So we're monitoring it very carefully. You're absolutely right, there was a rise in our sales, but it's largely coming through the traditional channel, largely coming through longer pay premium products and involving cross-sale. So, Paul, you can maybe expand or add?","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","You nailed it.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's one reason our cancer sales are up so much in the traditional channel, too. It's not limited to just the Post. We've also seen a big movement in our traditional channel in terms of sales. So they're tied together.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Erik Bass from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Can you comment on how sales of the new medical product in Japan have compared to your expectations? I think typically we've seen with the new product introductions, there tends to be a little bit bigger jump in sales. So if you could just comment on how this feature has been received and how you would expect sales to ramp from here?","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","This is Paul. The sales do meet our expectations. What we didn't expect, in all likelihood, was the continued success of our cancer plan. But Ariyoshi-san, who is the head of sales and marketing in Japan, directed our sales force to continue to push hard on the overall cancer sales, while also focusing, to some extent, on the medical sales. So within our range of expectations, we are happy with how it turned out. We do believe the medical product will continue to grow in its sales. But right now we're very happy with how long the cancer product has continued to sell at such strong increases.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And then following up on your comments earlier about moving the sales guidance up for Japan third sector sales. Was that driven more by the strength that you've seen in year-to-date sales or are you now expecting fourth quarter sales to be stronger, hold up better than you had initially expected?","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","Well, I think we put out a 15% expectation for the first three quarters of the year, and we came in considerable higher than that, almost double that. And so it is in part driven by the success in the first half of the year and the 34.5% sales that we had in the third quarter. That said, we are also seeing somewhat better trends in the fourth quarter. We're mindful of where those are going so far, but we're happy and I think that the 10% to 13% is reflective of improvement on both.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, I can't remember. I've been around here a long time. I can't remember 12 months of a 28% increase in sales in Japan in a long, long time. And that's what we've got from October 1 through September 30 here. So we're just so proud of the job they're doing at Aflac Japan with that.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I know you can't give any specific numbers on this, but in regards to the Japan Post, have you seen much of a sales contribution from the second 10,000 post offices at this point that were rolled out in July, or is that really all future benefit to come going forward?","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","This is Paul. I very much appreciate what you're trying to get at, but just based on our partnership deal, we do not continue to give out those numbers. We did communicate to you at the FAB, Dan specifically talked about the fact that the first 10,000 post offices represented a much larger proportion of the potential sales than did the second 10,000 post offices. But what I can just tell you is right now we're very much in line with what we want to see in the Japan Post partnership and we're very happy with how things are progressing.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Understood. And then on the U.S. can you give some more color on the U.S. claim trends? I think generally they've been running somewhat favorably. But Fred, you commented that you believe that margins can be sustained there. Can you just comment a little on the underlying drivers there?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Essentially there's really nothing notable to speak to in the U.S. claims patterns. And I say that not to avoid the answer to the question, but we're just seeing decent stability there in claims. And overall, while there are pockets of up and down and pockets of persistency up and down, persistency has also been on overall hanging in there pretty well.","So as has been the case at Aflac for many years, it's been a relatively stable platform from that perspective, benefit ratio and earnings drivers. It's been gradually favorable in recent years, but we see it as being a relatively stable outlook and nothing really notable in the patterns.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","One thing I would comment on, Ryan, just in this quarter to be mindful of from a math perspective, as I mentioned the premium collection \u2013 reduction in the allowance for uncollectable premium. Obviously realize that that pumps up the numerator, if you will. And so that helps benefit the \u2013 optically it benefits both your benefit ratio and your expense ratio because your premium is pumped up a little bit when you make that adjustment. So be mindful of that this quarter. There is actually a really, really slight amount of normalization that you'd want to do on benefit ratios, but it's actually not related to claims. It's related to just premium being up a little bit.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks, Fred.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Next question is from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning. Just want to follow up on the Japan sales outlook. So the third sector sales in your outlook is 10% to 13% sales growth. That, based on my math, that would imply the fourth quarter third sector sales would be somewhere between \u00a519 billion to \u00a521 billion. And I know you talked about the tough year-over-year comparison, but at the same time based on Paul's comment earlier, medical sales expect to grow further in the fourth quarter. So to me that suggests the cancer sales would be kind of more like a \u00a510 billion to \u00a512 billion range in the fourth quarter. That would be a decline from the third quarter level. Maybe a little bit comments on if my interpretation is correct, and maybe if you could elaborate a little bit more detail for the 10% to 13% expectation on a more broader level?","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","As Dan said, the large fourth quarter we had last year was representative of the very strong launch to our new cancer plan. And so the previous three quarters this year have been going up against no cancer plan to previous year, and so we'll be going up again for the first time that strong cancer sales in the fourth quarter of last year. And so I think it is reflective of what we expect to be a progressive increase of the medical plan, while at the same time having to go up against the very strong numbers from the launch of the cancer plan in 2014.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. But still if we were to assume the medical sales were to stay flat that would imply cancer sales would decline sequentially. Any reason why that would be the case or there could be potentially upside to your sales guidance?","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think...","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","My only comment...","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Paul.","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","Go ahead, Dan.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I was just going to say, we're just looking at overall that we've just finished 12 months with a 28% increase. And I think to try to break it down into 13 weeks is just getting too much into the minutia of how we see it. Overall, let me just say that we're extremely pleased with what's going on, and we will be excited if we finish in the 10% to 13% range, which we totally expect to do. And so how it breaks out by product? Remember, the profitability are close to the same, so we don't care how the agents write it. So we don't look to say, oh, please don't sell cancer, please sell medical. Or please sell cancer, don't sell medical, one or the other. It doesn't matter to us. So we don't break it out that way in terms of looking at it. Now we do look at life insurance where we've been on it, watching it, staying very close. But on cancer and medical, we really don't care how it comes in.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","I guess my question is more kind of like, with the Japan Post continuing to be performing, that is a little bit surprising to see cancer sales may potentially trend down. But I guess we will just have to wait for the fourth quarter to see what the results are.","Shifting gear to maybe on WAYS, I understand you talked about kind of using it to entice the traditional channel to do more cross-sell and you can closely monitor from an interest rate perspective. Is there kind of a rule of thumbs in terms of thinking where the 10-year JGB will move to \u2013 prompt you to dial back or even go or have stronger appetites for the WAYS sales?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Humphrey, it's not that simple. Certainly, as you watch JGBs grind down, that doesn't make the job any easier in terms of generating yield, but realize we've got a portfolio approach to backing these products, which includes among other things the dollar program, Eric's strategic asset allocation, and so we take somewhat of a blended strategic asset allocation portfolio yield approach, if you will, to the expected investment horizon. So, for example, recently we've seen treasuries and JGBs go down but spreads widen out to where new money could be put to work actually at even net more attractive levels as long as you're being careful in where you go with the money.","So it's not quite as simple as pegging to a JGB. But certainly as you see JGB going down, you've got to keep in mind two things: one, obviously, more of a challenge to reinvest that money, but the other is you're having to gradually move towards lower assumptions for ongoing interest rates as it relates to pricing of the product, and so you end up having a gradually less competitive product in the marketplace. This is really an industry thing, not an Aflac issue. And so do you reach a point where it's just not as much a value proposition for the client as you'd hope and does the overall market start to get soft? So I think those are some of the dynamics, but it's not a one-for-one tied to JGB. It's not quite that simple, although directionally certainly doesn't help.","One other thing I would say on third sector and some of the commentary around Japan Post. Be mindful of the difference between growth rates and just having a much larger engine now as we start January 1 versus January 1 of last year. The fact of the matter is we're just selling a more volume of product. Even though the comparables may be challenging, we have a net larger distribution engine that's driving simply more sales overall.","So that growth rate really benefits you as you move forward and look particularly at premium growth rates and your in-force growth rates and the overall economic value that you've driven. So there will continue to be growth in my view in terms of value, even though you may occasionally look at comparable sales periods that don't look as attractive. Particularly when you know the dynamic with this is that it jumped out at a very strong level, which is not unusual when you build up all the advertising and marketing investment to really launch it, and that was the story in the fourth quarter of last year.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for the color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James & Associates. Your line is now open.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Question for Teresa. This may be a little nebulous, but you and Dan were talking about pipeline. Could you give us a sense of how you measure that if there is some particular metric you're using?","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","Certainly. We basically look at the pipeline from the perspective of groups that have agreed to offer Aflac policies. And that pipeline is weighed based on where they are, and so this is mostly the large group. It's mostly the large group segment and it's weighed based on where we are in the process. So there is a piece of the process that looks at commitment to offer the product, and then as you go further down the pipeline, we basically have \u2013 have they submitted all of the enrollment materials, have we set them up for enrollment, and so there are varying places in the pipeline up to the enrollment. And what we do is we look at the percent increase year-over-year to assess whether we have the constructive increase in that pipeline and today what we see is a double-digit increase in the pipeline from last year to this year apples-to-apples compare. And group insurance, it's usually group insurance and not individual insurance when we're talking about that.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, sure. Teresa, what would stop I guess the process from commitment to offer to actually getting it done?","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","Couple of things. It may be that they decide to move the date of enrollments. And so it may migrate down the pipeline, so \u2013 not down the pipeline, but they would change the date of the enrollment. So it will move it from one quarter to the next. Couple of other things that may change it are that they decide that they're not going to adjust their benefit packages for that year and they hold with the current benefit offering that they have. Or they decide not to offer any voluntary benefits at all. But we don't think that they will, but we never know.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then one more. I think you answered it in the first question. But assuming you get that kind of 8% number for the fourth quarter, my assumption here is it's going to be driven by plus 100 cases.","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","Yeah. Yeah. That's our assumption as well. Although we will have some, the natural sales that we have with our career agents, we do believe that we will skew towards the greater than 100 cases in the fourth quarter.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It will probably be even greater than 1,000 cases.","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","Yeah.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Really. Now that's always in the fourth quarter. It's not during the year. But the fundamental growth of less than 100, Teresa and her team are doing a great job in stabilizing that and continuing to have that grow, especially through Everwell and the 50 or less. So we are encouraged about that. But it's this fourth quarter that's an anomaly because of the way the group presentations come in, and we specifically work to where each case might have a different product. So it's tailored to them, and that's what causes the issues.","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","Right.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. All right, thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Maybe, Fred, I just wanted to follow up on the comment and make sure I understand exactly what you're trying to tell us about the relative stability of the margin in both the U.S. and Japan. I haven't done the math perfectly for the adjustments, the one-timers this quarter. But it seems to me adjusting for that, that Japan margin's 21% or slightly above 21% year-to-date, and the U.S. margin is 18% or slightly above 18% year-to-date. In both cases, that's the upper end of the outlook for 2015 through 2017. So I guess in short, are you telling us that we should expect both operations to maintain margins at or even maybe slightly above the upper end of the guidance range?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. First let me just say that my comments were not meant to preempt the December outlook call. And so when we get to December 3, we'll give you a little more context and color around these earnings drivers and margins. But if you were to adjust both the benefit ratios, so adjust the Japan benefit ratio for the IBNR adjustment and adjust the U.S. benefit ratio really just modestly for the premium kick-up related to the premium collection allowance, we're seeing relative stability in those margins. Certainly as we enter into the fourth quarter, as we get into 2016, we don't see things at the moment that would disrupt that. Realize that the mix of business can play a little bit with your benefit ratios. And so we'd want to understand the mix of business in Japan, particularly third sector versus first sector. And we'd want to understand some of the mix of business dynamics in the U.S. a little bit better. But we're not seeing things that suggest to us significant movement in those benefit ratios going forward.","So we'll provide a little more color on this in the outlook call. I would also note that expense ratios, obviously in the recent year, have been slightly more elevated as we reinvest back in our platforms. I mentioned that in my comment. We also see stability there too, meaning we see a need to continue to reinvest in our platform to support the kind of growth you're seeing in Japan and to position ourselves for better growth in the U.S. So that stability comment I made \u2013 yeah, that stability comment I made goes both ways, so.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah, you sort of took my follow-up question which was I think that's what you were hinting at. And just specifically around expenses and investments into the business, I can't remember exactly when it was, but a year or two ago Aflac announced a pretty significant couple of year investment program in Japan that was I think at the time expected to run its course and then tail off. It sounds to me like the message here is that, that elevated level of investment will maintain itself.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So, I mean I would say in general, this is the type of topic that we would also give a little bit more color on, on the outlook call. Right now our investment has been oriented around \u2013 in the U.S. has been oriented around what you know and that is the investment we've made to reconfigure the sales platform and drive better growth. We're going to have to look at the same sorts of things in the U.S. that we've been successful in achieving in Japan and that is keeping pace with the modernization and digitizing of our platform in the U.S. And those involve incremental investment.","We have been making some of those investments along the way. So it doesn't necessarily suggest big deltas in things like expense ratios and so forth because we have been investing. But the pace of that investment is going to have to react to the market opportunity. And that's how we will approach it. When we see there's opportunity to go after that requires a level of investment and argues for our capital, then we'll want to do that for our shareholders. And that's the type of color and we'll give you more context for that when we get to the outlook call.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But let me just say something about our sales and what we've done there. I don't like sales at the level where they are, but I will say this, our organization is such that people are making less money if we don't achieve our objectives. And that's what it's all about, which means we make a little bit more, but that isn't the idea. We want the sales to be up and pay more. But we have corrected that and it is having an impact that I think ultimately will drive sales higher. But we're making sure that everyone shares in the pain. If we don't achieve our objectives, then they're going to feel it too. And if we do well, they can too.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","And then if \u2013 and my real quick follow-up is just on the EPS guidance for the year. Should we be holding you against that constant currency growth rate excluding the benefit of $0.06 or $0.07 this quarter that was unusual? Or should that be part of the growth?","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the range we have out there attempts to accommodate some of these unusual items. But when we talk about carving positives out of our numbers, we typically mean that to carve it out for the purposes of guidance and going forward.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Next question is from Suneet Kamath from UBS. Your line is now open.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. So I just wanted to come back to I think, Fred, your comment about the cross-sell initiative between WAYS and I think cancer in Japan. And I was sort of interested in how you characterized it. I believe you used the term household and where I'm going with this is, is I would have thought that given the sizeable premium differential between WAYS and third-sector products that to neutralize sort of the impact of the margin differential, you'd need to sell more than just one for one. You'd probably need to sell three, four, third sector products to neutralize the lower margin from the first sector. So I just want to \u2013 the question I guess is, is am I thinking about that correctly?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, I think \u2013 I'll ask Paul to expand on this, but I think you're thinking about it correctly in the sense of when I say driving households, I mean it from a couple of perspectives. One, the actual consolidated return on what we have provided to that household to your point, but the other is what value you see in that household and that agent relationship going forward as you continue to develop new product to sell to your existing block of business and clients and new clients.","The other thing to consider is that you have agents making a living off of the building out of these households and the sale or potential sale of new product. And so it supports the growth of your agency force and stability and even retention and development of your agency force. And these are things that are difficult to put economics behind, but we all know they drive embedded value. So that's where I come from when I use the term household, is the support for the agency, the agency build-out, the ability to cross-sell and what might be the future, present value future sales dynamics related to having developed more households. One of the things we tend to lead within Japan is that we're in one in four households. And when you start the conversation with that, that suggests there to be a lot of opportunity you can develop by simply being in that position. And so it really benefits us.","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","The other thing I would say is, is when we first started selling WAYS, we just picked up as much business as we could, based \u2013 and a lot of people bought it just on the yield and that was it. We've now moved away from that totally, in telling our field force they want an overall arching program that they can offer to a consumer that will cover their life insurance needs, their health insurance needs, and any aspect that they might have. So that's what we're trying to do is to cover them in their entirety. But we are definitely continuing to de-emphasize these type products and we will continue to going forward until we see changes in the interest rate environment going forward.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then I guess my second question is, and I don't want to front run your December event, but as we think about 2016 Japan sales, do you guys have plans for any new product launches next year that can help us stimulate sales in what I guess is going to be a pretty difficult comp for most of the quarters in 2015?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we will have to wait until our December call to give you an update on that type stuff. We want something to be able to talk about in December, so don't take it all away from us.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's fine. Thanks.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Robin Y. Wilkey - Senior Vice President-Investor and Rating Agency Relations","I think we have time for one remaining call.","Operator","All right. Thank you, speakers. Our last question is from Mr. Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open, sir.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. The question I had is when I look at, and Paul, you had mentioned that cancer sales through the non-Japan Post, your traditional distribution system have continued to remain robust. It sounds like better than you would have expected and in medical, the ramp up of the new medical product has been more slow. Do you expect that trend to continue or do you think we're going to see a bigger shift into medical? And, I guess, Fred can you remind us how the margins stack up in terms of the cancer product versus medical?","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","I'll start, this is Paul. To your question, we have continued to see the overall cancer sales be stronger than we originally anticipated. That is even pushing through into this quarter. Therefore, we have not put as strong an emphasis on selling the medical plan at this time and selling its new riders.","So do I expect the medical plan to be strong and to grow over time? I expect it to grow over time but to have a slower launch than we might have expected, when we do a product and the previous product has already run its course. We really want to see this cancer product sell for as long and as well as we can sell it, especially through our traditional channels who are very invigorated by this cancer plan and the ability to speak to not only our existing customers, but to new customers that they've never had access to before.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And Paul, sorry, just one quick follow up. Is that because the medical space is increasingly more crowded, or is that because you think more of your \u2013 is it more of just a focus on one product at a time through much of your distribution?","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","I do not think it's because of the competitiveness of medical, otherwise we would be pushing that much harder right now. It has much more to do with the excitement around the cancer plan and the continued success that our sales force is having.","As you've seen, there is such a strong cross-sell between the cancer plan and the 15-pay ways and longer, that's eating up a lot of the premium that we're selling to those individual customers. But we will be going back to them with the medical plan in the future.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then, Fred, on the margins?","Kriss Cloninger III - President","Tom, let me handle that, this is Kriss. The margins on the cancer and medical are approximately the same. And let me also add a comment on Suneet's question about neutralizing the margin on the cross-sell between WAYS and then cancer or medical. It's not meant to be a complete neutralization because of the premium difference that Suneet mentioned, but it does move us in the direction of additional value to shareholders in terms of adding additional business with significant value by having these cross-sells. So I think that would about wrap it up on that question.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Robin Y. Wilkey - Senior Vice President-Investor and Rating Agency Relations","Okay. Thank you, Kriss. And before we go, I want to share with all of you what's been mentioned before, that on December 3 at 9 a.m., we will have our scheduled earnings outlook call for 2016 to discuss our expectations for 2016. So I hope you'll all join us. We will be sending out a reminder as we always do, but again, that is December 3 at 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Sir, you may begin.","David Young","Good morning and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me this morning from the US are Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S., Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer and Todd Daniels, Executive Vice President, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary.

Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our Annual Report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. The earnings release is available on the Investors Page of aflac.com and also includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Dan?","Dan Amos","Thank you, David. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let me begin by saying that the second quarter concluded a strong first half of the year for Aflac. So now, let me provide an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. Despite the low persistent interest rate environment, Aflac Japan generated solid financial results for both the quarter and first half of the year. In yen terms, the results on an operating basis were ahead of expectations for the quarter. ","I'm also very pleased with Aflac Japan\u2019s robust third quarter sales increase of 5.8% increase in the quarter, rounding out a strong increase of 6.6 for the year. Sales in the quarter continued to benefit from the launch of the revised core [ph] medical product, EVER, continued strong cancer results fueled by our alliance with Japan Post and sales of income support insurance, our third sector product offering that we introduced in July of 2016.","Turning to first sector savings products, you'll recall that we've been focused on pulling products from select channels and have aggressively reprised our ways [indiscernible] factoring in the recognition of a prolonged low interest rate environment. Aflac Japan continued to make significant progress, controlling the sales of the first sector savings type products, which is reported by decrease of about 78% of the total first sector sales in the quarter. ","Regarding distribution channels, we had meaningful production across all channels, which further affirms our leading position in the third sector market. Our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success and our alliance partners have also made contributions to our sales results.","Last week, I had the pleasure of travelling to Tokyo to provide my full support of Aflac\u2019s new management team. It was an excellent trip and while I met with key stakeholders, including Aflac Japan associates, the employees, our alliance partners of Daiichi Life in Japan Post and others. With respect to Japan Post, in 2013, when we first announced our strategic alliance, I noted that the partnership would provide an important source of growth for the company today and value our customers. I've said at the time that it would be a game changer. ","Today, I'm pleased to say that the second quarter of 2017 exceeded our expectations and was the largest producing quarter today through the Japan Post alliance. Against that backdrop, during my time in Tokyo, I reaffirmed with Japan Post CEO, [indiscernible] the importance of strategic alliance and was pleased to hear that he was in agreement to further strengthen our win-win cancer insurance partnership. With such an extensive distribution network that includes Japan Post, 20,000 postal outlet selling our cancer insurance, we were furthering our goal to be where people want to buy insurance.","Looking ahead, Aflac Japan\u2019s focus will remain on selling our third sector profits along with first sector protection products, both of which are less interest rate sensitive and have strong stable margins. We will continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduce innovative new third sector products to maintain our market leading position. As we communicate, we view Aflac Japan\u2019s long-term compound annual growth rate in the third sector as being a range of 4% to 6%.","Turning to our US operations, we're pleased with the financial performance, continued strength and the profitability of Aflac US. Like Japan, our financial results for Aflac US on an operating basis were ahead of our expectations, which is particularly notable and that they reflect ongoing investment in our platform. We're continuing to see our platform investments pay off in the form of improved persistency and customer satisfaction. Customer feedback shows that a whopping 95% of our policyholders who use one day pays that they are likely to refer other people to Aflac, which will continue to differentiate and bolster our powerful brand and policyholder trust. Independent research continues to show that there is no doubt American consumers need cash quickly and paying claims fast and fairly distinguishes us from the competition.","With respect to the career agent activity, we continue to focus agents on groups with fewer than 100 hundred employees. I believe this market is Aflac\u2019s to grow because our career sales agents are best positioned within the industry to access and therefore succeed with smaller employers. We've also increased our career sales adoption of our Everwell enrolment platform, which in turn has increased account penetration in the accounts with less than 100 workers.","Turning to broker activity, great progress has been made by our team of broker sales professionals in strengthening Aflac\u2019s relationships with large broker community. Given the positive results we've seen with our efforts with large broker space, we\u2019ve continued to expand our broker sales team with new sales designed to focus on the mid-broker space. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in that space and expect to gain traction in the second half of the year.","With new annualized premium sales increase of 2.4% in the quarter and 2.1% for the first half of the year, it\u2019s below our target of our long term CAGR increase of 3% to 5%. We believe though we're in the right track with the strategy for growth we implemented in both our career and our broker channels. We will continue to make tactical adjustments to meet our long term sales growth objectives.","Turning to capital deployment, Fred will provide more details shortly, but let me just say that we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our stakeholders. We continue to anticipate that we will repurchase in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of our shares in 2017. As is always the case, this is in stable capital conditions and the absence of any compelling alternatives.","Before I turn the call over to Fred, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reiterate that Aflac\u2019s people have always been our greatest assets and we place high priority on ensuring we have the right people in the right roles at the right time. As you all know, Paul left Aflac during the quarter to become a partner in a private equity firm. As CEO, I want you to know that we have a tremendous management team currently in place and no matter how strong our team is, we are continually striving to strengthen our bench to ensure that we are prepared for the future. This entails balancing the knowledge and skillset inside the organization with the expertise and fresh ideas of new people who join our business. I am excited about our management team and I look forward to telling you more about their strengths at the FAB meeting in September.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Fred to cover the financial results. Fred?","Fred Crawford","Thank you, Dan. Our earnings results for the second quarter came in above our expectations, driven primarily by strong insurance margins, both in Japan and the US. We reported operating EPS of $1.83 per diluted share, which included a favorable tax item in the quarter that contributed approximately $0.05 per share. The tax item represents the release of certain tax reserves associated with prior tax years that closed in the second quarter. Offsetting this somewhat was a weaker yen impacting the quarter's results negatively by $0.02 a share when compared to last year's quarter. ","Even after adjusting for the tax item, our earnings per share were up over 9% on a currency neutral basis. We booked approximately 8 million in pretax costs associated with our Japan branch conversion, coming in below our estimates, but largely timing related. The conversion remains on track for a mid-2018 closing and there is no change to our original guidance on conversion costs of 120 million to 130 million pretax. Conversion costs will pick up in the second half of the year and into the first half of 2018 as we approach closing. ","In our Japan segment, premium weakness in the period was largely attributed to our first sector savings product WAYS and a portion of our block reaching paid up status. This alone contributed to a JPY14.5 billion decline in first sector premium in the quarter. We are in the peak year of savings policies reaching paid up status and our estimate -- and we estimate for 2017, the premium impact will be approximately JPY55 billion to JPY60 billion. Third sector earned premium continues to grow, up approximately 2% or JPY5.5 billion in the quarter. ","Our Japan segment profitability was strong in the second quarter with pretax margins approaching 21%. Benefit ratios in Japan were favorable and partially the result of a premium mix and the shift from first sector towards third sector, which carries a lower benefit ratio. There's an opposite impact on the expense ratio, modestly increasing in the quarter and pressured by an overall decline in revenue. As a reminder, while the paid up product impacts revenue, we have booked a deferred profit liability that amortizes into earnings and serves to largely mitigate any bottom line impact. ","Setting aside the paid up policy dynamic, we continue to experience favorable loss ratios and are focused on managing expenses in the face of revenue weakness. Japan's investment income decreased consistent with our guidance, reflecting lower reinvestment yields in Japan, increased hedge costs versus prior year and the fourth quarter 2016\u2019s switch trade, selling higher yielding bonds and investing proceeds in JGBs as we build out our floating rate portfolio during 2017. ","We continue to make progress on the build out of the floating rate portfolio and have invested approximately $415 million through June with a building pipeline of commitments through year end. We have locked in over 90% of our anticipated hedge cost in 2017 and are on pace to come in at or modestly below our full year guidance range of 250 million to 270 million. While we have benefited modestly from favorable pricing, we are building out a fully hedged floating rate portfolio throughout the year and reserve the flexibility in our forecast to lock in more of our 2018 costs as the year proceeds. ","We therefore are forecasting run rate hedge cost to increase in the second half of the year. Executing on our refreshed hedging strategy is beginning to yield results in the way of less volatile net investment income. Eric will expand on our investment strategy, optimizing our US dollar portfolio in Japan and related hedging strategy at this year's financial analyst briefing in September.","Turning to the US, Dan commented on our sales results, which together with persistency up nearly 1% over the prior year, drove premium growth of approximately 2%. Benefit ratios were strong, both in the quarter and year to date. We are currently running favorable to our outlook call guidance range of 52% to 53%. Our expense ratio calmed down from the first quarter levels with year-to-date performance within our guidance range of 34% to 35%. Our expense ratio reflects progress on certain platform investments, including our group administrative platform, enrollment platform and related technology. Overall, our US pretax profit margin of 21% is very strong by historical standards and sets us up for a solid result in 2017. ","Our capital ratios remain strong, SMR in the 985% range and RBC estimated in the mid-800% range at quarter end. We ended the quarter with 1.8 billion of excess liquidity at the holding company, which includes 500 million of contingent capital. Leverage remains at the low end of our policy range of 20% to 25%, consistent with securing our strong ratings. Overall credit conditions and asset quality remained strong with only a modest level of impairments in the quarter. ","We repurchased $200 million of stock in the second quarter and remain comfortably on track to repurchase 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion for the year. Our repurchase slowed in the second quarter, a result of stepping out of the market, pending certain executive announcements. When we entered back into the market, we tactically elected not to pressure our trading volume and are spreading repurchase out over the course of the year. Including our dividend, we are reaffirming our guidance of deploying 2 billion to 2.2 billion to shareholders in 2017.","Finally, I want to reiterate our 2017 earnings guidance of $6.40 to $6.65 per share on a currency neutral basis. While affirming our operating EPS guidance, we are certainly tracking to the high side of our range, but we are only midway through the year and we'll update accordingly.","Looking ahead, we remain well positioned in terms of our core margins and capital strength, consistent or tracking favorable to our December outlook call guidance.","I\u2019ll now hand off to David to take us to Q&A. David?","David Young","Thank you, Fred. Now, we are ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We will now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","I had a question for Teresa. US sales obviously is still modest, but seem like they're getting a little bit better. To what extent are you confident that this is the beginning of a turnaround or do you still have to wait and see how things progress in the second half of the year and in the fourth quarter to be comfortable that you'll be able to meet or exceed your guidance?","Teresa White","Jimmy, thank you for the question. I feel good about -- feel there are some positive results, underlying metrics that we're seeing right now. I do however and I've said in previous conference calls I want to see the last half of the year, I want to see how that materializes. I believe that we've seen traction with regard to the career agent side where we've improved our veteran engagement. They are generally the salesforce that's riding in our existing accounts, but we're seeing that underlying metric move in positive direction. We talked about the conversion of new associates to producers in 2015. ","If you recall, we adjusted the compensation to ensure that we were paying for a producer versus a recruit and we're seeing some positive traction there. But then I think I talked about two other things, the broker channel, that mid-market channel, we called out as an area that we needed to work on. We've increased staff there by 25%. Those folks are on boarded. They've been trained. They're now in the market, working with those market directors. That needs to materialize and I feel good about what I'm seeing so far and then the last thing was public sector. ","That was an area that we needed to ensure that we defended that part of our in force and continued to grow. We have hired a department head for public sector. We've developed a strategy that we believe is going to be competitive in that market space and we're already starting to see some traction as it relates to new RFPs or quotes in that sector. So again, I think that we're going in the right direction. I feel pretty good about that, but I do -- I would like to see how all of this materializes in the fourth quarter, in the third and fourth quarter.","Jimmy Bhullar","And on the sales reps that you added for midsize brokers, did that contribute at all to second quarter results or were they not on boarded for most of the quarter?","Teresa White","They were not on boarded for most of the quarter, but I will say that the focus on mid-market brokerage did help us with a lift. But I would not say that they contributed terribly in the second half, in the second quarter.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then lastly just on all the talk about healthcare reform, have you seen or do you expect to see a situation where that causes sort of disruption in the market or causes businesses to defer adding new benefits?","Teresa White","I think at this point in time, what we're seeing is that businesses are continuing to move forward as they\u2019ve moved forward in the past. There's not a lot of new activity except for as we've all seen, there's not been a decision made, no repeal, no reply. So we're moving forward, we're not seeing anything that we feel at this point in time will impede our sales activities and impede us from being in the range that we've already quoted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Dally","Question on the loss ratios in both the US and Japan. We're seeing those ratios coming well below your original guidance. So hoping to get some color on what's driving that and the sustainability looking forward.","Fred Crawford","Sure. Nigel, it\u2019s Fred. We did indeed experience favorable benefit ratios in the quarter. Let me just start with the US. We are tracking a bit below our 52% to 53% range as I mentioned and that's really related to favorable claims trends, but also coupled with a natural slowing of IBNR build as those favorable claims trends play out. I would say that it's not uncommon in any particular quarter that things may break to the positive or break to the negative when it comes to the various IBNR adjustments in particular that you make and claims trends in this particular quarter certainly we experienced trends breaking to the positive. But having said that, we have had a sustained period of benefit ratio performance really at that low end of the range I mentioned and that would be our expectation as we go through the year. So we are expecting to see benefit ratios climb back towards our range guidance for the US, but should end the year at the favorable side of that range of 52% to 53%.","In Japan, we've got a different dynamic going on and that is yes, we have continued favorable trends and related claims and IBNR related activity. And certainly, you saw it actually dipped down a little bit in the quarter. But what we really have going on right now is a bit of a business mix issue and as we see the premium levels come down in first sector, particularly related to the WAYS paid up product and a outperformance on the sales side and really a continuous level of outperformance building the earned premium on third sector, that shift in mix is causing there to be downward pressure on the benefit ratio. ","We would estimate for example in the quarter roughly 100 basis points perhaps 100 to 120 basis points or so of benefit ratio improvement just related to that shift in mix between third sector and first sector premium. Because we're in this peak period of paid up policies throughout 2017, that favorable pressure on our benefit ratio may continue for a period throughout this year. And so that's why we're suggesting that we are probably going to end up at the low side of our benefit ratio range in Japan as well that outlook call range was 71% to 73%.","Now having said that, third sector benefit ratios were effectively flat. So we are seeing favorable claim activity, but this had really more to do with the mix issue than necessarily materially improved claims trend in the quarter itself.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","I want to start first with guidance and reiterating guidance. Considering the strong beats in both the first quarter and the second quarter, reiteration of guidance, even if we look at the very high end of the range, so just probably a slower pace in the back half of the year than I think most of us were modeling. Just curious if this is a matter of call it prudence, not changing guidance midway through the year or is this a reflection of a much heavier ramp up in investment spend than perhaps we originally anticipated?","Fred Crawford","Yeah. What you should not read into our holding to guidance or what I said the high side of our guidance, what you should not read into it is some sort of a sharp right or left turn in our strategy or pace of investment in the second half of the year. Really what you have going on is a few things. One as mentioned, we've kicked off in the first half of the year at a relatively lower rate of hedge costs. ","We would expect that to naturally build up as we go throughout the year. Now granted we're running at or maybe slightly below our guidance range of 250 to 270, but we would expect that to build naturally and that has a lot to do with the pace of build-out of our floating rate portfolio, which we would expect to be 100% hedged. We also have been gradually locking in more of our long-term hedge costs, which is a bit more expensive and while we are experiencing favorable pricing, that will pressure a little bit of your expenses as you go throughout the year. ","So that will be in front of us on the back half as I mentioned in my comments. In our press release and in my comments, we've talked about the fact that there will be a gradual pick up in the level of expenses in the business. This is not really abnormal. We tend to see this every year. Some of it is related to promotional spend, new product launch spend in Japan in particular, but also the natural progress of various initiatives across the company related to IT and operations, particularly in the US. So we'll see that climb and pressure a bit as we go.","But to your question of conservatism, when your outperformance is largely on the back of strong benefit ratios in the US and Japan, it stands to reason that you're going to be somewhat cautious in your expectation for reverting back to your long term views of benefit ratios. And so, we absolutely are assuming that there will be a migration back to probably the low end of our benefit ratios in Japan and the US and that will be different than what we experienced in the second quarter. So that's within our numbers, but we'll do what we always do. It is midway through the year and as we continue to see the business progress and we see more permanency in the numbers, particularly around benefit ratios, we\u2019ll update accordingly.","Seth Weiss","That's very helpful. And then Fred, if I could just follow-up on the last question on Japan margins and the commentary about the 100 to 120 basis points improvement due to the mix is really helpful. Is that sort of rebase that becomes permanently part of the earnings stream or is there some dynamic in terms of how that deferred profit liability amortizes in where that flows in the benefit ratio kind of naturally rises if we\u2019re looking outer years.","Fred Crawford","Eventually, the numerator and denominator dynamics of premium falling off with paid up status and the amortization of the deferred profit liability will eventually slow and pace in accordance with the - with policies reaching paid up. I might note that even though it's far off in the distance we have not only five pay ways, but ten pay ways and so we'll come back to this equation down the road as ten pay products starts to reach paid up status albeit I don't think as pronounced as the five pay product. What I would say is in our future is that as time goes on, we would expect to see a fundamental change in the mix of earned premium if you will between third sector and first sector and that will influence and be more a permanent part if you will of our benefit ratios.","I do want to remind you that while first sector product carried higher benefit ratios that also carried lower expense ratios. And so you will see that dynamic play out. In my mind and what we're doing as a management team is in the face of obviously some slowed revenue increase related to our first sector strategy, we have to be attentive overtime to our expense structure and continue to manage that. And we certainly are paying attention to that. The team in Japan is actively working and engaged. We\u2019ll expel more of that out as we move forward, but that's something we have to be careful about and are paying attention to. But overall profit margins are expected to remain strong and we're very pleased with the results. And we also think this shift is very much in the best interest of shareholders. One thing you don't see in our results is the gradual lifting cash flow and FSA earnings which comes from shifting our mix to a lower capital intensive product and better profitability and that will pay dividends as this time goes on.","Operator","And our next question is from John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open sir.","John Nadel","So two questions, one I just wanted to talk about the US dollar denominated investments hedged in Aflac Japan. Could you just give us an update on what the total dollar amount of the hedge program was in 2Q and where you expect that to end the year as you continue to work on the floating rate portion and I assume that dollar amount will grow?","Dan Amos","It will grow, I'll ask Eric to comment on the trajectory of the build in the portfolio.","Eric Kirsch","John, current side is about $22.8 billion. By year end, based on current projections, we\u2019ll probably get to about 24.5 or so in the majority of new assets that will go in will be floating rate assets between transitional real estate and middle market loans.","John Nadel","Just as a real quick follow up on that one, Eric, that's the total size of the US dollar denominated program but that's not the hedged piece is it?","Eric Kirsch","Well that's correct, I apologize. So currently about 52% is hedged and 49% is unhedged.","John Nadel","And that ratio should increase I assume?","Dan Amos","It should because what we are building in the floating rate portfolio is by definition intended to be 100% hedged. The only thing that would change that is if we were to make any tactical decisions around the hedge ratio. But if you just roll the ball forward or play the ball forward, the portfolio grows to 24.5 billion because it's growing on the back of a couple billion growth rate in the floating rate portfolio and that is 100% hedged. You'll see that notional climb from its roughly 11 billion range up towards 12.5ish plus.","Eric Kirsch","Those changes are already contemplated and forecast in our full-year hedge forecast which Fred mentioned earlier.","John Nadel","And then back to Japan and the margins, Fred, just a quick one thinking about that sort of the natural shift. So certainly seeing the impact on the benefit ratio that\u2019s come down and I think you mentioned maybe 100 or 120 basis points. So the lion share of that improvement in the benefit ratio really driven by shift as opposed to favorable claims activity. What I guess we're really not seeing and I'm wondering if you expect that we should see more of it is the expense ratio is up a little bit on a year over year basis if I think first half versus first half. Should we expect that the expense ratio is going to increase a little bit more, again driven by that shift.","Fred Crawford","The way I would think about expense ratio, now remember, expense ratio is up against total revenue. So you also have debt investment income playing into that, which also includes hedge cost now. So, with the switch rate for example and sort of a slowing down of debt investment income to then build back up you'll see some natural short-term pressure to that expense ratio. But as we see premium levels pressured because of the paid up status throughout this year and continues on a bit into next year and net investment income while recovering still being down from historical standards, we would expect the expense ratio to still be pressured and remain in that range that we've forecasted of 19% to 20% range. So it may climb before it comes down. What we're busy working on is IT and operational investments that we would expect over time to start to pay off in the way of yielding expense benefits. And we're going to need to be attentive to the overall expense structure we have that surrounded in particular first sector savings product as that starts to ratchet back.","Now we continue to launch new product, the income product that Dan mentioned, we continue to refresh our core medical and cancer product and we're always exploring where there may be new avenues of growth rate on the third sector side. And so we may have some reallocation of expenses over time. But we have to be attentive to the revenue realities and that will mean managing expenses. So right now I would stick to this notion of 19% to 20%, we're traveling a bit on the low side of that. But I would expect it to probably pick up a bit as we go throughout the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Just to follow on the benefit ratios dynamic in Japan. So I appreciate the comment about the ways, the five pay ways kind of getting to paid of status and how they're going to shift the dynamics a little bit. But at the same time I would expect that would be your expectation kind of factoring into the 2017 guidance. So looking at your sector sales being more robust in kind of the first half of the year, how much of that accelerated that mix shift that we've seen year-to-date.","Dan Amos","So I mean the way I would think about it is when we went into our outlook call and therefore our guidance we guided to a range of 71% to 73% for our benefit ratio in Japan. And in the first quarter we posted 71.7% and in the second quarter we dipped down to 70.5. And so there's obviously a lot of attention being paid to the second quarter and whether there was something of a more permanent nature there. But I'll just remind you of the fact that we did in fact see a good level paid up policies in the first quarter. And our benefit ratio was 71.7%. So our view is that we will travel on the low end of that range of 71 to 73, but we would expect the benefit ratio to kind of come back to those 71, 72 levels as we go throughout the year. ","So we did in fact see good favorable claims results in the second quarter that then led also to IBNR breaking to the positive if you will i.e. lowering IBNR. IBNR trends are slowing the pace of increase in IBNR. So did have some of those what I would call normal positive or favorable results, but it was just pumped up by really the mix now really taking traction and bringing it down by another 100 points. So hopefully that helps, but you are seeing some favorability. As I mentioned I do expect to travel in the low end of our range, but I would expect a bit of a tick up from what we're seeing in the second quarter.","Humphrey Lee","So in other words, the strong sales that we've seen in the fourth quarter or the first two quarters of this year that had relatively limited impacts to that mix shift is just more about the pay off status of those five pay ways, is that correct?","Dan Amos","That\u2019s right, you can sort of see at this quarter, the strength of our third sector sales contributed a bit over 5 billion yen to the earned premium while the paid up status of our product dropped the first sector savings premium by 14.5 billion yen. So there's a bit of a disproportionate amount of shift because we're in that peak year of paid up policies here in 2017, so that will start to calm down.","Humphrey Lee","And then just to stay on the sector sales a little bit. So sales continue to be pretty strong even though my understanding is that the Japanese market is getting more competitive in this third sector products as many other players are shifting their focus to this area. Can you just talk about in addition to kind of the successful relationship with Japan Post, anything that is notable that you\u2019re seeing the held you to deliver such a strong sector sales in the first half of the year.","Dan Amos","Well, would say that my meeting with Japan Post CEO was a very strong meeting and one that is encouraging to continue to see growth in the cancer insurance market with them. And the potential seems to be even stronger than what we first thought and have a longer tail on it in terms of continued penetration. Maybe Koide would like to make some comment some Japan. Koide, are you on?","Masatoshi Koide","[Foreign Language] This is Koide from Aflac Japan.","[Foreign Language] So as Dan mentioned, the reason why we have been very successful in the first half of this year is, one, is of course JP.","[Foreign Language] Another contributor was the medical product that we've launched in February.","[Foreign Language] This is because of the new product effect.","[Foreign Language] That\u2019s it from me.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead sir.","Ryan Krueger","I had a follow up on the medical product, the revised EVER. I guess the sales, you talked in the past about shorter sales cycles for medical products, I guess it's been a few months now, just help give -- hoping for some perspective on kind of how much longer you think the new product can resonate before kind of it reaches the end of the natural selling cycle for medical in Japan.","Dan Amos","Well, the nice thing about adding a third pillar with allows us to cycle different products at different times. So it's not just medical, but then we entered this in cancer and then we back off and go to a new medical again, but Todd, you want to make any comment about the life expectancy of the products.","Todd Daniels","Thanks Dan. I think if you go back and look at what we have in our fab sub materials you can see how many quarters you get from a repricing. Back in 2015, you can see third quarter medical sales around 9.1 billion yen, and that stayed at a relatively high amount until we came out with a substandard medical in second quarter 2016. So you're going to see the natural pacing of the product probably for a few quarters. But one thing I\u2019d point out with this is the channel differences. So we're focused on the Japan Post selling the cancer product and the good results we saw there. But what we have different now that we haven't had in the past is the associate channel is focused on selling the medical product, while contributing to cancer cells. So you have both cancer and medical products up for the year, which is something we haven't been able to enjoy in the past.","Ryan Krueger","And then quick one Eric, can you just give us a sense of what new hedges are casting at this point that you're putting on for the US dollar portfolio and how much of the 2018 costs are locked in?","Eric Kirsch","First the second question about 51%, 52% of \u201918 is locked in. As Fred mentioned, we continually look at that throughout the year. So we'll expect to even make deposits on that and get that locked in percentage higher as we get into fab and to the earnings outlook call. With respect to current costs, we've been fortunate because the kind of pick at the end of last year. And if you think about the macros, US had an outlook at the year-end of very high growth, the Fed lifting rates perhaps three times. Japan being stabilized, the cross currency basis came in a bit. So hedge costs are actually running lower now than they were at the beginning of the year in our forecast. When you look at longer term hedges, which is a place where we\u2019re focused for the longer dated assets, you're looking at a little over 2% like 2.05. When you're looking at shorter dated hedges like three month hedges which is what will be focused on later in the year for our floating rate assets. You're currently looking at about 170 basis point.","Operator","Our next question is from Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, sir. Mr. Dargan your line is now open.","Dan Amos","Why don\u2019t we go onto the next question.","Operator","Next question is from Mr. Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your line is now open, please.","Suneet Kamath","Question for Teresa on the US business, good to hear that things are moving in the right direction. But if I think of your 3% to 5% sales growth long term target. It's quite a bit lower than where I would argue Unum has been running. And I would say that there's lots of similarities in terms of the business mixes. One thing that Unum does differently is I think they've really separated the brokerage business from the traditional agent channel, just wondering if that's a strategy that maybe you guys should be thinking about in terms of more of that delineation between the two channels given prior comments around channel conflict.","Teresa White","Well certainly, so what I look at is the market and I get your question, the market forecasts to grow about 6%, broker growth is about 8% to 9%. And Aflac broker growth is already within that range. So we are internally looking at the broker side of the business as well as the career side of the business. But we have the fortune of having one of the largest distribution forces and career agents selling over 70% of our business. So that's a large base to grow over and so that's why when we looked at our guidance, we believe that the guidance of the 3% to 5% is reasonable. And it's really the difference in our distribution mix at this point in time. So, I think that\u2019s kind of what I'll share as it relates to distribution.","Dan Amos","I'd like to make one other comment, the thing that\u2019s so great about our company is our brand, but it also is a liability in one respect. Certain companies can break their brands apart with different ones but the companies don't necessarily have great brand recognition themselves, so it doesn't make any difference. In our case everyone wants Aflac and wants the Aflac does because they know our name. So in our case, with brokers and individual agents no one won't for example See CAIC which is our Aflac group, they don't want the name CAIC, they want to name the Aflac Group because of that brand. So our channel conflict is somewhat to do with the brand itself and that if we had separate brands and we thought about that. But as you can imagine everyone likes to be able to go into an account and be able to say the name of the company and they immediately know who it is and like the brand. So that give us some pause but at the same time it's worth because we feel like on the other hand that's why we're number one in the market by far in terms of what we're doing.","Suneet Kamath","And then just a follow up on that. From time to time we do hear about acquisition possibilities in the group side, particularly in the brokerage business. I know you did CAIC a while ago, but would it make sense to think about something a little bit bigger and kind of jump start your brokerage sales. Acknowledging that Teresa said that you're already running a little bit higher than in the market overall.","Fred Crawford","This is Fred, I'll take that question and Teresa welcome any comments you have. But the most common discussion around our name from time to time is the notion of True Group if you will as opposed to differentiated from the group business we have in South Carolina. This would be True Group Life, short of long term disability and we have for a while had to contemplate strategically the importance of that product and how it plays into our business model particularly as you go up market and into the brokerage space. And we effectively had what amounted to a build buy or partner decision framework, the build was not very practical because it would take a lot of time nor do we possess necessarily the expertise and infrastructure to support that type of business. The buy is not appealing because the premiums associated with purchasing large group players is very significant comes with integration, issues and risk, and we don't think argues for the company's capital. And so what we have done is we are on a path of partnering on True Group products such that we can offer that product to the brokerage space under the Aflac.","By partner meaning we partner on the administrative side, but also on the risk taking side. When you're Aflac looking at that business the thin margins and occasionally volatile results that come with True Group aren\u2019t particularly appealing, they may be appealing to a company that is in other types of business and looking to diversify. But to us, they don't necessarily argue for capital let alone overpaying or paying a tremendous premium for the property. So we've gone down the partner route and you'll hear more about that over time. I think thus far the only announcement we've made is with Trustmark on a life-LTC related - I came out of Lincoln so those of you familiar with MoneyGuard know it's that type of a product offering which has become popular in the work site. And that's the type of parting will do as we go forward to measure up against the market. But it just doesn't argue for our capital to be a buyer at this time and take on that risk nor can we afford the time it takes to build. So we've chosen the partner route.","Teresa White","I think the only thing I'll add to that is in September, I think we can bring a little bit more color to the question of broker versus career and the strategy overall, so we\u2019ll do that.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, sir.","Erik Bass","Dan, I was hoping that you could expand on your comments about looking for ways to strengthen the partnership with Japan Post. And so wondering are there potential new product opportunities or potential opportunities to expand that. If you could comment a little bit.","Dan Amos","Well, we didn't really go there at this particular time when we were having our meetings because we think there's still enormous amount of potential with [indiscernible]. But certainly we would like to have discussions in that area, but as you know they sell their all medical products right now. So I think that would be a much harder thing to consider for anyone including us. So right now we just want to get to those 20,000 offices and make sure we're penetrating it and they are committed to continue that going forward. You are exactly right, as big as that distribution channel is, we\u2019re always keeping our ears open to see if they ever had any consideration for doing that, we would do everything we could to open that channel and open that door with them.","Erik Bass","I know you can't comment on specific sales levels for the post, but can you give any sense of how penetrated you are in the channel today, now that you've had access to the full 20,000 post locations for a bit. How close are you to being fully penetrated in the channel?","Dan Amos","I really, I can't speak on that, but I don't know either because it's something new that's never - there's never been a partnership like this. They've never done a deal where they let everybody have all 20,000 post offices. So what the penetration is, I don't know, but the thing I will reiterate is, here we are been in this program this long and we had a record this quarter. So I don't think it's over is the main thing. Everybody is wondering when it's going to hit down and it doesn't seem to be headed down, it seems to be going up. Of course that can\u2019t go on forever, but I'm certainly encouraged about that. The one thing that we always talk about on these calls is how negative interest rates or low interest rates are killing us or everybody, not just us Aflac, but the industry as a whole, it's terrible.","But the products that we sell in the third sector are less interest rate sensitive and so it's helped us with our last partners, all of them. Here's a product that they can sell that will help them financially, help us financially and it's a win-win. So I think that will continue going forward and I'm excited about that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open, sir.","Sean Dargan","I had a question about the income support product. Ultimately what will this do to be the benefit ratio, will this change that mix shift at all. I mean how big can this product get and I guess this is my question.","Todd Daniels","I would not hold your breath on the income product adjusting our benefit ratio anytime soon just given the sheer size of the earned premium build over it but\u2026","Dan Amos","And I\u2019d like Koide to talk about the potential of the product, but why don\u2019t you go ahead and answer.","Todd Daniels","The benefit ratio for the income support is expected to be in line with our other third sector products, somewhere between medical and cancer. And again because of the sheer size of it today, there would have to be a material amount of sales of income support which I think we'd all enjoy in order to effect the benefit ratio in anyway a regular third sector sale would.","Dan Amos","Koide, would you like to comment on the potential of that market?","Masatoshi Koide","[Foreign Language] Right now this income support product market itself is still in development stage. And we intend on developing it into a third pillar over the medium to long term perspective.","[Foreign Language] That\u2019s all from us.","Dan Amos","It's just too early to tell at this particular point and we're encouraged with it initially. Any time a new product comes out they generally have a spike in it and our agents go to the path of lease resistance. So as you've seen in the past when we introduced medical, cancer drops off, we introduce a new cancer, medical drops off. We introduce this, it hurts the others. So they move and we've never cared as a company where they go. But the potential of taking this on to this large customer base of ours has enormous potential, but it's still too early to tell how successful it's going to be, but I'm certainly excited about it and think it has the potential long term.","Operator","At this point speakers, there are no questions in the phone.","Dan Amos","Thank you very much. Before we end the call today, I'd like to remind everyone of our upcoming financial analyst briefing in New York on September 28. For further details or any questions please contact our investor and rating agency relations department and we hope to see you all there. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Robin Wilkey","Thank you and good morning. And welcome to our third quarter call. Joining me this morning from US is Dan Amos, our Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac US and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Joining us from Tokyo is Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan; and Koji Ariyoshi, Executive Vice President and Director of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some statements in our teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to take a look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.","Now, I\u2019m going to turn the program over to Dan who\u2019ll begin this morning with some comments about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the US, Fred will follow with some brief comments about our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the year. Dan?","Dan Amos","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that I\u2019m pleased with the company\u2019s overall financial results for both the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. As you no doubt saw from yesterday\u2019s press release these strong results gave us confidence to an upwardly revised our operating EPS outlook for this year to the range of $6.40 to $6.60. Fred will provide more color on earnings and our outlook during his comments.","I will lead off by providing an update of Aflac Japan our largest earnings contributor. From a distribution perspective our traditional licensees which include individual licensees, independent corporate agencies, affiliated corporate agencies have historically been and remained to-date viable contributors to our success.","Additionally our alliance partners continue to advance our strong results. I\u2019m particularly pleased that just this month Japan posed through its 20,000 plus postal outlets begin selling our new cancer insurance product designed exclusively for cancer survivors. Our traditional agencies first began selling this product in March, 2016 while we anticipate the sale of our cancer insurance for cancer survivors we\u2019ll be slightly additive to our overall sales results more importantly it underscores our reputation and commitment to being there for Japanese consumers, when they need us most.","These various distributions outlets further our goal of having a presence in all the places people want to make their insurance decisions. From a product perspective, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in limiting the sale of first sector savings products which are interest-sensitive. First sector product sales decreased 54% in the quarter putting us squarely on target to reduce first sector sales by at least 50% in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2015.","We have been aggressively and pulling product from select channels conservatively re-pricing our WAYS and endowment products for the reality of a prolonged low interest rate environment. We are extremely encouraged with this significant progress we\u2019ve made in limiting the sale of the first sector products.","Turning to the third sector sales results. You\u2019ll recall that we upwardly revised our annual sales target to these products last month, at the Tokyo Analyst briefing making this the second positive revision to our sales target this year. At the meeting, we announced new third sector sales outlet to flat to up 5%. We\u2019re pleased that Aflac Japan generated a third sector sales increase of 2.5% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. These strong sales results in the face of difficult comparisons reflect stronger than expected productivity across the majority of the distribution channels.","This is even more notable when you consider the sales through the bank channels have been moderated significantly by restrictions on the sale of first sector products. I\u2019ll remind you that fourth quarter still presents difficult third sector comparisons particularly following two years of extremely strong cancer and medical sales.","Our third quarter sales results also benefited from the July introduction of the new third sector product called income support insurance which has accounted for 7.8 million yen or 3.3% of the third sector sales. This product provides fixed benefit amounts in the event that a policyholder is unable to work due to significant illness or injury.","Additionally, this product was developed to supplement the disability coverage within Japan social security system. Our income support insurance product targets young to middle age consumer ranging in the age from 20 through their 40s, a segment of the population in which we believe were underpenetrated and represented.","By focusing our efforts on this demographic, we believe that we\u2019re building relationships to lay the groundwork for the sale of cancer and medical insurance later in life. While it\u2019s still early we\u2019re happy with the reception of the income support insurance, as received. We believe this product has the potential to gradually develop into a new Aflac pillar products over the long-term.","Turning to Aflac US, we are pleased with our earnings are exceeding our expectations to the first nine months. Profitability in the quarter was driven by improving benefit ratios that we continue to see over the last several years. We have simultaneously pushed resources back into the business and particularly we\u2019re investing in an end-to-end system for the group platform that will provide the capabilities of all of our group constituents including brokers who typically sell group products.","While we are expanding our presence in the voluntary work side insurance market, we are also being very disciplined in the pricing of the business, especially as it relates to the profitability within the smaller case group space that includes employers 100 to 250 workers. Although sales in the quarter were lower than expected, I will remind that I said many times that fourth quarter sales and particularly sales in the last three weeks of the year largely determine our annual sales results.","Our efforts are focused on increasing the productivity of our career agents and brokers. I believe the measures that we rolled out over a six month period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 are the wide approach and as you\u2019ll recall one major element of the changes we made including the compensation to better align incentives for the career agents with company sales results. We\u2019re continuing to fine tune our compensation package for our top sales management to closely align pay with performance. With this superior incentive program we\u2019re seeing our top sales management begin paid extremely well and some of the poor performing sales managers have decided that they\u2019d rather concentrate on sales instead of management.","While we have like to have seen, the measures, the more immediate impact on our sales results, we know that it can take some time. However, I want to point out that we are exceeding our profit target while implementing these changes. Most importantly, we continue to believe the changes that we\u2019ve made through our sales infrastructure and compensation are in the best interest of the company to produce long-term results.","We also remained encouraged with the broker business. Over the last few years our sales threw the broker channel have grown. Our fourth quarter sales results have become more and more impactful as you saw in 2014 and 2015. This means it becomes more and more challenging to project full year sales even though sales results for the first seven nine months we know, although I\u2019m encouraged by the pipeline of business schedules for the fourth quarter. We\u2019re still enhancing our forecasting of how much of the pipeline materializes into actual sales results. Therefore we believe Aflac US will require particularly strong fourth quarter in order to meet the lower end of the 3% to 5% target increase for 2016.","I will remind you that our brand is a key differentiator for Aflac both in Japan and in the United States. As a product innovator and trusted brand in both countries we experienced a tremendous amount of success leveraging the strength of our brand to drive sales in both countries nine out of 10 consumers recognize the Aflac brand. But our brand is more than the Aflac duck for the advertising initiatives. It\u2019s also about how we take excellent care of the policyholders.","In Japan, as our powerful brand has propelled Aflac to ensure one out of four households. In the United States, we processed, approved and paid nearly $1.3 million one day pay clients in the first nine months of 2016. And most importantly 96% of the policyholders that use one day pay said they\u2019re likely to refer other people to Aflac. We believe this will result in more new sales going forward.","Our products are well suited in both Japan and the United States market. And we are well positioned in the two largest insurance markets in the world. Turning to capital deployment, let me just say that we continue to view growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares is the most attractive means for deploying capital particularly in the absence of any compelling alternatives. We are on target to repurchase about $1.4 billion of our shares with the majority already repurchased during the first nine months of the year.","The Board of Directors action to increase the dividend by 4.9% demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders. This marks the 34th consecutive year of increasing our cash dividend. We are proud of the achievement and our objective is to grow the cash dividend right in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact to foreign currency translation.","We continue to manage the business for the long-term benefit of the shareholders, the policyholders and all stakeholders. We believe, we will continue to achieve more by building on these strategies and the foundations that have propelled our success. By doing this, I believe we will continue to enhance shareholder value while delivering on our promise to the policyholders.","And now let me turn the program over to Fred, who\u2019ll cover the financial results and outlook. Fred?","Fred Crawford","Thank you, Dan. Our third quarter performance continues the strong financial results reported in the first half of 2016 and execution on key initiatives design to drive long-term growth and effective allocation of our capital. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both Japan and the US. Operating EPS increased 16.7% or $0.26 per share with a little over half the growth driven by the strengthening of the yen and the remaining from share repurchase and pure earnings growth.","Excluding the impact of the yen operating earnings increased 7% as compared to the previous year\u2019s quarter. Our Japan segment margins were solid. We concluded as part of our annual actuarial review process that it was appropriate to reduce the IBNR reserves for our cancer insurance block of business by approximately 4.6 billion yen or $0.07 a share. This amount is very similar to the adjustment we made in the third quarter last year and reflects continued strong cancer claims experience. Expense ratios were generally in line with our guidance.","In the US benefit ratios continue their favourable trends for the year. Our expense ratios was favourable to our expectations for the quarter. Consistent with previous year, we fully expect our expenses to tick up in the fourth quarter as we make progress on certain strategic initiatives and increase our promotional and IT spend. Overall our US pre-tax profit margins are set to perform at or above the high end of our 2016 guidance range of 17% to 19% for the year.","For both Japan and the US, we will spend some time on our December Outlook Call discussing revenue trends. Benefit ratio drivers and specific to expense ratios where we intend to invest in the platform throughout 2017.","Turning to investments, results were both by the quarter end and year and were aligned, year-to-date were aligned with our expectations as we continue to navigate the low yield environment and further diversify our portfolio. As we discuss during our Analyst briefing in Japan, we continue to execute on a comprehensive plan that includes for channelling interest-sensitive premium flows through actions to reduce the sale of first sector savings products developing alternative high quality yen investments including a measured re-entry back into yen private placements.","Finally executing on our US Dollar investment strategy where we can hedge market value affectively and optimize investment income consistent with risk ALM and capital objectives. With respect to our US Dollar program in hedge cost, our reported third quarter cost were elevated recognizing the currently isolate and report the full cost of forwards in the period we purchase.","Consistent with the strategy we have outlined to at our Analyst briefing in Japan we have successfully executed uncovering approximately $3.3 billion of additional US Dollar assets under the hedge program and have proactively extended the duration of our forwards to better manage 2017 cost and associated volatility. Both of these actions will serve to exaggerate our reported cost in the period under our current reporting.","Amortizing the cost over the life of the forwards, the non-GAAP reporting convention we plan to adopt in 2017. Our hedge cost for the entire book of hedges were $54 million pre-tax or $0.09 a share this quarter. Assuming no material change in hedging strategy and our current reporting method, our pre-tax hedge cost guidance remains in the $280 million to $300 million range for 2016.","Moving to an amortized basis for reporting tactically extending duration continuing to refine the asset allocation and hedging strategy will serve to reduce the quarterly volatility as we incorporate hedge cost into our definition of operating earnings for 2017. We\u2019ll cover this approach and forecast in more detail at our Outlook Call in December.","Turning to capital, we commented last quarter that hedging additional US Dollar asset classes would further strengthen our SMR. We ended the quarter with an estimated SMR above 900% up significantly from last quarter. RBC is also preliminary at this point, but we expected to remain strong in the mid 800% range despite the strengthening of the yen in packing our ratio negatively throughout the year.","This is the result of the Japan branch embedded in our US statutory results. Overall credit conditions are stable impairments in the quarter were modest and primarily related to our Japan equity portfolios where depressed market values have triggered impairments in accordance with our internal accounting policies.","We continue to return capital to the shareholders between dividends and repurchase, we\u2019ve returned approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders year-to-date. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company and expect achieve our target of $1.4 billion in repurchase for the full year.","As Dan highlighted our board elected to increase the shareholder dividend $0.43 per share for quarter, a 4.9% increase in marking our 34th consecutive year of dividend increases. Bolstered by US segment earnings outperformance and solid results in Japan, we\u2019re comfortable increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to $6.40 a share to $6.60 per share on a currency neutral basis.","We have provided in our press release an EPS range for the fourth quarter assuming yen\/dollar exchange rate of 100 to 110. As mentioned last quarter, we are conducting our normal actuarial review of interest sensitive blocks of business in Japan. There are two smaller legacy blocks of interest sensitive third sector business that may require strengthening as these blocks have been susceptible to strengthening in the past. In addition from a corporate perspective post-retirement benefit liabilities are sensitive to long-term rate assumptions and when that finalized we anticipate an adjustment in fourth quarter and suspect this will be a common theme among many large corporate entities.","Overall we remained well positioned in terms of core margins and capital strength and look forward to our December outlook call where we will expand on our strategic plans and 2017 outlook.","I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Robin to begin our Q&A session. Robin?","Robin Wilkey","Thank you, Fred. Now we\u2019re ready to start taking your questions. But first let me remind you that to be fair to everybody please limit yourselves to one initial questions and only one follow-up that relates to your initial question. We\u2019re now ready to begin with the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] we have our first question from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Jimmy Bhullar","My question was just on your higher EPS guidance. If you could discuss whether it was more the benefits ratio coming in better that gave you the confidence to raise the range or was it just lower discretionary spending. And to what extent are these things that will affect next year? Like if it is spending, could that spending go over next year or likewise, if it's the benefits ratio, should that continue to be favorable through next year as well?","Fred Crawford","Sure, Jimmy thank you for the question. This is Fred. Really the revision to our guidance is, as I mentioned in my comments largely bolstered by outperformance relative to our expectations on the earnings front in the US. However I would add that year-to-date both the US and Japan have been traveling at generally favourable ends of our ranges for both benefit ratios and expense ratios and so I made a point to say also or point out that Japan solid results are contributing as well, but the true outperformance relative to our expectations was more pronounced in the US earning side.","In terms of as we look forward, we will spend a big deal of time not surprisingly during our December Outlook Call talking about the trends as we look at next year so I\u2019ll spend more time there. I would say in general you would expect us in the fourth quarter for example to see some expenses pick up. This is not uncommon if you follow the company over the last few years you\u2019ll see that tick up has to do with the timing of promotional spend and the natural progression of initiatives as we go throughout the year.","As we go into the next year, we will continue to be investing particularly in our US platform and we\u2019ll speak more about that. I don\u2019t know that I would suggest it to be material but you would see a slightly elevated expense ratio as we invest in that platform and then in terms of benefit ratios. We\u2019ve been tracking in particularly in the US at a favourable level. We expect to some degree to see a continuation of that near term eventually normalizing back towards our range. But we have seen some persistency if you will relative to the benefit ratio being favourably throughout the year and based on what we\u2019re seeing right now, that should continue for a bit, but we\u2019ll talk more about it during the outlook call.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then if I could ask one more, just on your hedge cost, it was pretty high this quarter. To what extent did the increase related - you're just increasing duration and if you could just give us some color on how far you are going out on new purchases and what the basis point cost is for the hedges, that you are putting on?","Fred Crawford","Yes, there is really two principle drivers of the hedge cost being up, given how we report it and that was really the tactical moves made in the quarter and it was a combination of extending duration as you mentioned. I would say over the past year for example, we\u2019ve pushed that duration of our hedge portfolio out from roughly four or five months to upwards now 10 months and that means by definition we\u2019re buying out into the 1 year 18 month timeframe in some cases on the forward curve. This is in part not only to manage forward volatility which we think is important for consistency and stability of our reported earnings and cost, but it\u2019s also because we\u2019ve actually seen a flattening of the forward curve, where it\u2019s more economic for us to go a little longer and lack some of that in, so we\u2019ve been quite tactical on that front.","The other piece that contributing over the course is just simply covering more assets and in particularly covering assets that we\u2019ve been building in the US Dollar portfolio things like bank loans, commercial real estate and equities. We\u2019re covering those assets are important not only from the pure hedging perspective but also you get the favourable capital treatment or really protect the favourable capital treatment that you need for SMR. So those have been the two areas of contribution I would say about 35% or so, the cost related to duration extension in the quarter and about 40% of the cost increase or the cost you\u2019re seeing related to covering additional assets just to give you some round numbers.","Again we\u2019ll be moving to an amortized basis, which is a more logical way of looking at the cost going forward. I\u2019ve tried to give you some color for what the quarter looks like if you were to amortize cost today. We really believe in the tactical moves we\u2019re making and during the outlook call, we\u2019ll give you a full rendering of how the year would look and how comparable years would look, as we incorporate it into our forecast for 2017.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open, sir.","John Nadel","Two questions. One, Fred, just real quick, what is the size of the notional amount of the hedged asset program as of the end of the third quarter? I know it was $14.3 billion or $14.4 billion last quarter. It sounds like it's probably in the $17.5 billion, but if you have the number that would be great.","Fred Crawford","And Eric you can jump in, but I think we\u2019re traveling close to the $16 billion and this would be particular to the forwards that we\u2019re covering. So John, realize that we use two instruments to hedge the vast majority of what we use our forwards and that\u2019s where the cost comes in. we also do some collaring on a small portion of the assets, which tends to a much, much lower cost type approach to hedging. The vast majority of our hedging has done using forwards and that notional is traveling around $16 billion up from around $12.7 billion in the second quarter to give you an idea.","And I think I\u2019m going to anticipate where you may be going with this question from an understanding forward cost and that is, if you were to take our $16 billion in notional and just hold that constant, we\u2019re seeing cost traveling between you know 170 to 180 basis points actually more recently it\u2019s gotten a bit favourable coming off BOJ and Fed announcements, that\u2019s why we move to accelerate locking in some other cost. But we think it\u2019s more wise to be thinking in that 180 basis point range and that gives you a sense of where we\u2019re traveling from an amortization perspective.","John Nadel","Okay, that's helpful. And would you anticipate that a Fed hike, I guess in December, would - all else equal, would increase that cost?","Fred Crawford","You it\u2019s always hard to say and the reason for it John as well on in theory, a Fed moving rates up and the BOJ staying put or continuing to move rates down, widens out your hedge cost realized at that things are priced into the market and so to what degree a Fed rate hike is already priced into the market, is a bit speculation. I don\u2019t know if you have any.","Eric Kirsch","I\u2019ll just add to Fred\u2019s comment. Today if you looked at one year hedge cost are about 168, but we\u2019re anticipating upward pressure for exactly the reason you said, if you looked at the forward curve one year from now, one year hedge cost about 200 basis points. So to Fred\u2019s point, the market is anticipating the Fed hike.","John Nadel","Yes, understood.","Eric Kirsch","One year [ph] from now, we would expect hedge cost probably to be higher 20, 25, 30 bps anticipating some Fed activity, but even by the Federal Reserve\u2019s own public announcements, even if they raise rates they\u2019ve been very clear slow and gradual nothing sharp because US economy won\u2019t support that.","John Nadel","And then that last follow-up on this one is just, if you look out a year from now approximately how much growth would you expect to see in the actual US Dollar investment program that would require the hedge.","Fred Crawford","Yes, I think we will provide some back up to that John on the outlook call. I don\u2019t want to steal some of the announcements from that. So I would suggest you will go into more detail. I will point this out however, it\u2019s not simply a matter of growth in the US Dollar program, which I would anticipate to be gradual. It\u2019s also the mix of where we\u2019re investing and what you\u2019ve seen onto do through bank loans for example middle market lending and then more recently exploring transitional real estate lending which is just a form of bridge loans, commercial real estate. These are all characterizes being floating rate US Dollar investments not that\u2019s particularly advantageous for us because one you\u2019ll tend to hedge that using short dated forwards where it\u2019s relatively less expensive forwards, but also from a duration matching perspective you end up, then is a same pressure that supply to hedge cost tend to result in increased LIBOR rates and returns are yields on the floating rate securities, but one of the things that we\u2019re working on is not just the notion of asset allocation and where the US Dollar programs goes, but also refining our asset allocation in that portfolio to be more effective as I mentioned in my comments more efficient and effective in hedging and in the process further managing volatility.","John Nadel","That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Kovac with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Kovac","Wanted to focus a little bit on the US sales slowdown this quarter kind of relative to your longer term expectations and wondering if we could dig in a little bit more to what was really driving at this quarter. It seems like slow down across some of the accident in core cancer products but any additional color you can provide will helpful.","Teresa White","This is Teresa, so thank you for the question Michael. The weak sales this quarter really I think attribute to the changes that we\u2019ve made that are settling in. The markets that are succeeding have three fundamentals; one is, tightened broker collaboration, the second is as Dan talked about productivity per producer increased and improved productivity per producer and then the third thing is an increase in conversion rates that were approved to producers. What we\u2019re really focused on is making sure that we managed the full performance of all of the markets from that perspective.","We are seeing some positives, we\u2019re seeing positive growth in new account. We\u2019re seeing positive growth in producer productivity. But we don\u2019t have all markets flicking on all cylinders and so that\u2019s really the focus from a US perspective.","Dan Amos","And I\u2019m like one other contract, the new contract that we put in 18 months ago or so what you saw is, if you remember we had an enormous four quarter that year and a lot of people stayed around continued to produce, but now that half the organization is doing great and making more, the other half is making less money. These ones that are making less money who are making money under the old contract, so they\u2019re having to perform to get paid which is the way we want it, but a lot of them re-evaluating how hard do I want to work for that money? And if they want to work hard, they can make a lot more and some of them are saying, I\u2019ve done well I\u2019m going to take my money and I\u2019m going to move more towards just sales and not have to worry with sales management and how much more complicated it\u2019s gotten. I mean, Everwell one day pay, all these other aspects have changed them from just being a sales manager to the managing or from changing from just managing sales to being a real sales manager which includes looking at profitability making sure we\u2019re just blending our approaching to offering group products at certain prizes and so we\u2019re going through a little change with that, we hope wouldn\u2019t happen but I\u2019m certainly not surprised and so that\u2019s the other aspect.","Michael Kovac","Great and then I guess now that it\u2019s been sort of 18 months as you mentioned since the initial rollout, do you feel like most of that is sort of through the system or should you expect to kind of continued drag from sort of the transition through the next couple of quarters.","Dan Amos","I think that it\u2019s hard to call, I can\u2019t tell you how much the market\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve been around here long time and it\u2019s always been more of the same for the first 25 years I was doing it, now it\u2019s not, it\u2019s - our great sales organization which I\u2019m so happy with and but in addition to that it\u2019s the brokers, it\u2019s the change what we never had the skew of business to the fourth quarter but because of the way they enrol the accounts. The way it\u2019s working now wears me out it\u2019s like a football game where you got to pull it out in the fourth quarter, but that number\u2019s becoming larger and larger and we\u2019re trying to shift it more to the third quarter and it didn\u2019t work, they still want to turn it in, in the fourth quarter and we had more control over the associates because they listen more but when you deal with this broad based broker, you just take it when - but we got this big pipeline. So I think things are moving in the right direction, but I still believe next year the fourth quarter is still going to be big because of the way it happens.","Teresa White","Yes and I\u2019ll say from a pipeline perspective when you look reenrolment, you look at new business in the pipeline, the pipeline looks good. So we feel good about the pipeline but to Dan\u2019s point you got to pull it out in the fourth quarter which is very, very different from what we\u2019ve been accustomed to in the past.","Michael Kovac","Great. That's helpful. And one last follow-up on that. As we think about the promotional expenses, I know Fred and others mentioned that those tend to be higher in the fourth quarter, should we expect them to be above prior year's levels as a result of sort of trying to pick up some of the potential sales growth in the US?","Fred Crawford","Not particularly, actually our overall budget year-over-year is relatively stable from an overall promotional and marketing spend, there may be modest differences quarter-over-quarter from a timing perspective and particular timing of ad spend and so forth, but the notion of that being bunched around enrolment season and in the fourth quarter is not unusual and there\u2019s not really a large step up Delta, if you will to the promotional spend.","Dan Amos","I will make one final comment and that is I don\u2019t like the sales quite where they are, I like them better but I like what\u2019s happening in our operations. I like the idea that we\u2019re doing the one day pay, I like what\u2019s happening with Everwell. I like how the brokers are coming on. I like what I\u2019m seeing in writing large accounts, but we\u2019re being disciplined and not just writing every account, some they couldn\u2019t be profitable were passing by. I like what Teresa is doing and merging the brokers and the associates together. But with that are growing pains, but all in all I\u2019m pleased to what\u2019s taking place in that regard. I just want stronger sales.","Michael Kovac","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Your line is now open sir.","Seth Weiss","Fred, I wanted to follow-up on your comments that in the US you expect the beneficial underwriting trends to persist in the near term but normalize back in the long-term, could you just comment on what gives you the visibility in both the near term and long-term?","Fred Crawford","What we\u2019re seeing right now is first of all realized of course, benefit ratios will fluctuate each quarter and so there will be quarters where we\u2019re in our range and quarters where we move it in the range are little favorable, but what we\u2019re seeing year-to-date even somewhat last year and the latter stages of last year, is a consistently favorable benefit ratio and what we see going on there we believe relates to somewhat to mix of business and two particular types of business that are driving this, we believe our one group business where group business naturally is priced to and expected to travel at a lower benefit ratio than you would find say on individual products in the way it\u2019s priced and that\u2019s just the function of how it\u2019s priced and that\u2019s just the function of how it\u2019s priced and structured as a product.","And as business grows and becomes more of our in force and plays more of an influence on our benefit ratio is just a little bit of that. The other dynamic though is really more guaranteed issue business, where the actual building reserves tends to be slower and more moderate in their early years and so as you start to sell more of that guaranteed issue business as proportion of other business, you\u2019ll see just the slower ramp up in reserves and a generally more favorable near term benefit ratio. So that\u2019s what I mean when I say we would expect to see as those types of business age, that they will age back into our expected long-term range of benefit ratio, but for a period here. It looks as if we\u2019re traveling at a again a persistently low benefit ratio relative to our expectations and again it\u2019s all on the margin, where we\u2019re traveling I think maybe 50 or so basis points, better than our guidance in general, but we\u2019ll provide more of an update on this and some trends as we get to the outlook call.","Seth Weiss","Great, thank you and once quick follow-up just on the hedge cost. You commented or reiterated at $280 to $300 million range for the full year. I believe you\u2019re already at the low end of that range, so could we assume that you\u2019ve effectively done most of your purchases for the year on the US Dollar denominated program.","Fred Crawford","That\u2019s right unless we take a different tactical approach, for example decide into aggressively lock in more long-term hedges than we would expect to stick with that guidance and what that really means is, you can see we\u2019ve covered effectively all of our needs, we\u2019re right now about 98% covered if you will on our hedge activity in 2016 and furthermore, we\u2019ve gone into 2017 and we covered a lock in if you will about 40% of our cost in 2017 and that\u2019s what we want to try to do, we\u2019re going to try rolling if you will as we go forward, so that we can create a level of consistency in our hedge cost.","Seth Weiss","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Humphrey Lee with Dowling and Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Just another follow-up on these hedging costs, given a lot of the Japanese insurance companies you\u2019re talking about expanding the foreign investment program backed by a hedging program behind it. So from a hedging instrument perspective given the higher demand, do you see any potential impact on the hedging cost from the capacity perspective, from your counterparties?","Fred Crawford","From my conversations with the team, I\u2019ll ask Eric to weigh in though. The forward market particularly the forward market involving two of the largest and more stable currencies on planet Dollar and yen is such a deep and strong market that you tend not to see the ebb and flow of purchasing and selling having a tremendous impact on it. There will be times where supply and demand do play-in, in fact into the forward cost that\u2019s natural and by the way by locking in a little bit longer we have the ability to sort of step out on the margin where necessary and step back in tactically and that\u2019s part of what we try to do on the margin.","So there\u2019s no doubt, there\u2019s some possible influence but I\u2019m not sure given the depth of this market that it would be significant, but Eric maybe you have some comments.","Eric Kirsch","Fred\u2019s absolutely right, there\u2019s not an issue, the availability of forwards. There\u2019s plenty of capacity in the market from counterparties, however it does drive into the price of the forwards. We tend to mostly talk about the difference between central bank policy between the Fed and Japan that is the largest driver and [indiscernible] is the largest driver, but there is also something called the basis is basically a reflection of supply and demand for dollars. But to your point, a lot of Japanese insurance and other investors outside of Japan are buying along the dollar assets and therefore in the currency market and that will drive up the price in the forwards, but it will not reduce the supply. There is more than ample supply for the most liquid market in the world.","Humphrey Lee","So to that point, even if longer term, the interest rate environment to become more normalized. But if there is [indiscernible], there is the demand from the Japanese insurance companies that could create an upward pressure on the basis.","Fred Crawford","That\u2019s right investors from around the world, not just Japanese insurance companies.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. And then just to follow up on the US dollar investment. So to the point that they are definitely a greater demand from foreign buyers of US assets, so for your tactical shift in terms of your asset allocation to bank loans and middle market lending, have those asset classes been tapped and by the other foreign buyers as well, and if so, can you talk about the competitive landscape in terms of sourcing of these assets?","Eric Kirsch","Happy to. It\u2019s a very, very large market and is attractive to insurance companies like ourselves. However there is a trend of a shift capital available, to the loan, middle market, loan market, even transitional real estate and what I mean by that is, there\u2019s thousands of lenders across the United States lending to thousands of small middle market company and in the real estate market. Historically banks have been the capital providers to those loans markets for the lenders if you will as well as re-syndicating some of those loans because of Dodd-Frank the banks have removed themselves from that market, it\u2019s no longer capital friendly for them.","For an insurance company like us, we like to focus on credit risk and underwriting where we can negotiate, very tight covenants [ph], of high predictability of securement [ph] of loans if you will and our money so it\u2019s an attractive asset class, so yes it\u2019s true. There is a trend of insurance companies and other investors substituting for the banks. So in a way, the zero sum game I couldn\u2019t give you exact specifics but insurance companies are coming in, where banks are leaving and providing that capital to the market.","Now naturally, to supply and demand, so there may be more demand than there\u2019s been in the past and that might tighten spread to that but you\u2019re getting paid for taking the credit risk and those types of particular loans, companies but you\u2019re also getting senior secured status, very tight negotiations to your favor to protect yourself in case there is any credit challenges with the company.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, thank you for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is now open, sir.","Ryan Krueger","Fred, first, I wanted to follow up on your comments about the fourth-quarter actuarial and post-retirement benefit review. Are those - are anticipated impacts from those included in your fourth-quarter EPS guidance or would that be viewed as separate impacts?","Fred Crawford","Yes, it\u2019s. Here\u2019s how to think about it. In terms of our fourth quarter estimates, the post-retirement benefit adjustment we have allocated or set aside in our forecast, in our estimate an amount of money. It is preliminary and we don\u2019t have the final because it ends up being the result of a final posting if you will of the pension interest expense or basis points from a composite and so what the pensioner world waits for is the production of that composite, but we fully anticipate it to be down. It\u2019s hard to envision there being a recovery in it and as a result, we have a greater level of confidence there will be something and so we have set aside some money for that.","In the case of our review of these legacy blocks of business I mentioned, that is not in the number because we really are too early in the process to know what might be the practical ranges or if it will be a resource for anything at all on those products and so we do not have anything in the numbers for that.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, thanks and then another follow-up on the US sales. Is the comment that it will be more challenging to meet the 3% to 5% full year target, should we view that as more reflective of somewhat lower sales in the first few quarters of the year relative to what you would have expected or does it have more to do with your actual outlook for the fourth quarter and broker production?","Teresa White","I think the broker production as far as the pipeline looks pretty good, so within the range. I had hoped that we would be a lot further along after the third quarter and so I would view it more so as my disappointment in where we are as of the end of the third quarter. However, I will say this as Dan said, there\u2019s a plenty of opportunity for us to really bring in new business. We also are looking at the profile of the business that we\u2019re trying to bring and we are turning down some of the cases and so, when we talk about it, going to be a little bit more difficult. It\u2019s really going to require a great fourth quarter for us now. We said that the last couple of years and our sales teams delivered. So that\u2019s really just kind of how I\u2019m looking at it at this point. Do you have anything else, Dan?","Ryan Krueger","Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciated.","Operator","Our next question is from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open sir.","Yaron Kinar","I also have a question on us sales so and talking about your forecast and the environment you\u2019re seeing right now, you talked a lot about the distribution force and the dynamics that you\u2019re seeing there. Can you also talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the competitive landscape from manufacturing perspective?","Teresa White","Well from a competitive and did I hear manufacturing perspective?","Dan Amos","Competitive.","Teresa White","Okay, so from a competitive perspective. We are seeing a lot more competitors in the voluntary space. Some of the employer paid benefits are now becoming voluntary benefits. So again, additional voluntary benefits in this space. At this point, we\u2019re also seeing competitive bids specifically on the broker business. Some of the bids as I said earlier, we really are passing on because of the profile of the business and we want a really stable product profile and some were choosing to partner to get like the long-term care type products. So we\u2019re trying to go to best-and-breed to get those, so really from a competitive set we\u2019re seeing a lot more competitors in the market. But we still feel good about what we\u2019re doing in the market as well.","Dan Amos","I want to say one other thing about this. This is not unusual ended. I can go back 20 years ago and remember when our competitors got in the market and they were going to cobalt and chemotherapy benefits. We kept telling ourselves, we couldn\u2019t meet that they ended up having 50% rate increases two or three times in a row to offset that. The good news is we\u2019ve got all these statistics of what we\u2019ve been doing in the cancer insurance business and in this area. For so many years, we kind of know how to price it and some that want to make lowballs it generally bites them later on. And yes, it gives us a little problem short-term to sales go back 20 years ago, we were losing sales to some of the competitors couple of those companies aren\u2019t in business anymore and few that were had to change the way they approach things.","So this is not that unusual that we\u2019re having people lowball on products. We\u2019ve seen in Japan, but the fact is we know what we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re pricing it right and we\u2019re giving the customer a good value and in return we\u2019re making a good profit.","Yaron Kinar","I appreciate the color. And then another question. Regarding the revised guidance, if I back - out of the numbers correctly, I think I got to roughly flat constant currency earnings in the fourth quarter and the midpoint of that guidance range. And if I heard Fred's comments earlier, I think those numbers don't include the potential adjustments to reserves or on the pension front at this point - retirement [ph] front, sorry, at this point. So what other drivers are there right now that are serving as a head wind relative to last year or is it just that last year was a very strong quarter?","Fred Crawford","No, I would say in general it\u2019s really a couple of things. One is what I mentioned we believe there will be a bit of an acceleration and expenses in the fourth quarter that\u2019s what we\u2019re forecasting, sometimes that plays, sometimes the timing of that doesn\u2019t play out but at the moment that\u2019s our forecast and then again recalled it. I did in fact include some level of expense related to what we believe is inevitable post-retirement benefit adjustment related to interest rates. Now again that\u2019s not finalized and you need to understand the final before you can book anything, but we know enough to know that there\u2019s a probably a range amount in there. So that\u2019s a little bit of what\u2019s traveling through the number and you know obviously we\u2019ll continue to do our best to meet or exceed the forecast as best we can.","Yaron Kinar","But I thought that fourth quarter usually see an acceleration of expenses. So wouldn't that have held through last year as well?","Fred Crawford","Yes, it\u2019s all relative it\u2019s a matter of how big the acceleration was last year and how big this year. So I would say those are really the issues.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open sir.","Tom Gallagher","Thanks. Another question on the hedging program. So Fred, if you factor in the cost of hedges currently and then you consider the impact on your first sector business like WAYS, are those products still going to be profitable when you factor in the cost of rolling these hedges here? And is that the way you're thinking about it at a discreet product level in terms of profits or are you thinking about the hedge in a different way? Is that sort of a corporate expense? It's discreet and not being factored in at the product level?","Fred Crawford","No, it\u2019s not discreet, in the sense when we look at our - are putting new money to work if you will premium and what new money assumptions that\u2019s called the new money curve, we need to achieve to achieve certain profitability levels. We not only factor in what I would call the gross yields we would expect on investing our money, but when it comes to the US Dollar program. We also are projecting a hedge cost environment into the net yields that we expect to support the product. So when we are pricing a product like WAYS, we\u2019re looking not only at the interest rate environment and mix of investment and associated credit spread if you will. But we also in our case have to be factoring in hedge cost.","So it\u2019s a very real part of how we think about the product and so as a result, all of the re-pricing that we\u2019re doing is really having to take into account the low interest rate environment, our asset allocation, hedge cost and then most notably and Japan is also a recognition that the standard rate if you will or the discount rate assumption used for reserving practices is going to come down materially in Japan at the end of March, 2018. All of those things have been factored in to pricing out our savings or interest sensitive related for sector products namely WAYS, child endowment and making sure that we can adhere to use of profitability.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, so we shouldn't be thinking about worrying about DAC or reserve adequacy for your first sector business in a broader sense when you consider what's going on with these hedge costs?","Fred Crawford","Right, we do that actuarial work. I\u2019ve pointed to a couple of legacy blocks of business as it relate to being particularly close to the edge and we have to watch and carefully watch that and these tend to be blocks of business that you\u2019re familiar with Dementia, Super Care. These are products that we\u2019ve been watching for a number of years. But we do the testing work on all of our products both third sector and first sector in the fourth quarter, not surprisingly we will see the reserve margin squeeze on first sector savings products as it relates to the current environment including hedge cost. But we have solid margins in those areas and so at the moment, we don\u2019t see that as a risk, it\u2019s more these acute what we are calling legacy smaller blocks, but are actually third sector business to be technically correct.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, and then just a follow-up for Eric. Can you comment on what\u2019s the breakeven of where hedge costs would have to go to the point where you would say this has been a negative decision from an economic standpoint in terms of building up this US Dollar portfolio? Clearly running at 180 basis points, I know it\u2019s high. Is that still - is that a net positive? Like when you factor that in and look at the yield and the risk related to building up this program?","Eric Kirsch","Yes, absolutely. The approximate number is 2%. Meaning our earnings are about 3.6%, if you looked at spot hedge cost 160, 180. We got about 2% margin built in but we just like to follow-up a little bit on Fred\u2019s comments before to put this thing in context because your focus appropriately so is on the large increase this quarter. When we went into this program, we presumed the long-term average of hedge cost is somewhere between two and three quarters and three. So we were very clear when we got into the program hedge cost were historically low and that was about 60 bps back in 2012, they kept traveling down to 20. So what we\u2019re seeing now is more of a normalization, we could never know exactly when or where are the exact macro dynamics that would make hedge fast a lot, but we always knew they would go up. So even though they\u2019re at 168 or 180 basis points today that\u2019s about 50%, 60% of the way towards the long-term average, but then if you think about that long-term average. It would take quite a huge amount of growth in the United States for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rate so substantially, to get to those numbers. It could happen some day but we got about 2% margin to be precise on your question before we\u2019ll be saying, this is a breakeven trait.","Tom Gallagher","Got it. So really this would have to cost you 350 to 400 basis points before it became breakeven?","Eric Kirsch","That\u2019s right and finally I\u2019ll just again reiterate what Fred said earlier that assumes we\u2019re passive. And we do nothing, but again we continue to look at asset allocation and changing the mix of the assets to better match off against those hedge costs like the floating rate assets. We also look at the current composition of the portfolio. We may decide to lighten up on certain asset classes and then of course, there\u2019s - how do we look at the hedge strategy itself, which we continue to look at and as Fred has mentioned continue to lengthen duration.","So if we just were passive that\u2019s the answer, but we would expect to continue to manage that with a fine tooth comb to preserve as much as that margin whether it\u2019s through higher income or better hedge cost management. So that will be dynamic overtime certainly.","Tom Gallagher","And Eric, when you compare the cost, is that to JGB yields? Is that the benchmark?","Eric Kirsch","That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s the ultimate benchmark so that\u2019s another point, Tom. Three or four years ago, 20 and 30 year, JGB\u2019s were 2% when I got here, they traveled 10 days a point a few months ago, now they\u2019re at about 40 or 50. So it\u2019s all in relativity and once again the dollar program has limits and we\u2019re actually pretty close to those limits. We have some capacity and as Fred said, we\u2019ll talk more in the December outlook call, about future purchases but in context of a large global portfolio, we like the diversification because if all we were buying were yen assets and we\u2019ve got quite a large amount every year maturing private placements, old assets and 2% to 3%. Our net investment income would go down pretty rapidly as well. So it\u2019s a diversifier and it\u2019s a balancing act. But that\u2019s why we have limits on each part of our program.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Robin Wilkey","Thank you very much. We are at the top of the hour right now. So before we end today, I want to take the opportunity to remind everybody as Fred said, mentioned earlier that we\u2019re going to have our 2017 Outlook Call that will be held later this year on December 2, so we want to make sure you mark your calendars for that event on December 2 and for further details on the call. Please feel free to call our investors, Rating Agency Relations Department and we look forward to speaking to all of you.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","","Robin Wilkey","Thank you, Marianne. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Ken Janke, President of Aflac U.S, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. And from Japan we have Tohru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan joining us.","Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although, we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and the operations in Japan. Dan and Kriss will join us and provide further details about our activities and 2013 and 2014 EPS guidance. Dan?","","Dan Amos","Okay, thank you Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am pleased that we met and in many cases exceeded our financial targets for the third quarter. Notably, we believe we are well positioned to increase operating earnings per share about 5% for the year before the effect of currency. At that time, we anticipate operating return on equity will be strong in the range of 22% to 25% for the year before the impact of the yen. We will spend some time talking about our financial and earning guidance this morning, but let me take a few minutes to give you a high level perspective on the operations and how I view our business. I will start with Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. We continue to enhance our distribution opportunities and product offerings in Japan. I\u2019m very pleased with expansion of Aflac Japan\u2019s last agreement which pays and post which commenced in October. This agreement ranks together the Japan the most the largest nationwide distribution network in Japan and Aflac Japan the industry leader in cancer insurance. Both companies will be able to maximize numerous synergies by working together. With respect to our products in Japan I\u2019m pleased with our newest medical offering which successfully launched in August. We expect this product will continue to popular with consumers. The combination of Japan post and the new product we\u2019re allowed is the strong indication of our focus on our higher return third sector products. In regard to Aflac U.S. the sales environment continues to be challenging. The U.S. consumer sentiment hitting it's lowest level in nearly a year. Our job is to be multi-dimensional in our distribution to create a presence where consumers want to purchase our products. We\u2019re working to enhance our sales capabilities both through our traditional sales force and brokers who operate in local, regional and national markets.","In addition we\u2019re currently policing Aflac\u2019s private exchange platform which we believe will provide us with even better access to smaller case market. We\u2019re also creating products that respond to and anticipate the needs of consumers and businesses particularly in the current healthcare environment. With change comes opportunity and we\u2019re positioning Aflac in a way that we should benefit from healthcare reform.","Whether we\u2019re talking about our operations in Japan or the United States as an insurance company our primary mission is to fulfill our obligations to the policy holders at the same time we\u2019re listening to our shareholders and understand the importance of capital deployment. To enhance the predictability of that capital deployment we fortified the level of SMR and taken steps to insulate the capital ratio against factors that connectively impact in the future.","Doing so gives us greater confidence in our ability to target and deliver our profit repay creation amounts from Japan to the United States. Once we know our customer obligations are satisfied our objective is to enhance shareholder value through share repurchase and a growing cash dividend. As we said for many years we believe those are the most attractive uses of capital and those are the avenues we will continue to pursue. In fact in 2013 we initially expected share repurchase to be in the range of $400 million to $600 million we now anticipate purchasing $800 million of shares this year. That means we will be purchasing more than 500 million of shares in the fourth quarter alone. Previously we have communicated our expectation of 2014 repurchase to be in the area of 600 million to 900 million for the year. We now anticipate next year\u2019s range to be 800 million to a $1 billion. I\u2019m also pleased with the action by the Board of Director\u2019s to increase the quarterly cash dividend by 5.7% effectively for the fourth quarter 2013. This marks the 31st consecutive year of increasing our cash dividend. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in-line with operating earnings before the impact again.","Overall I\u2019m pleased with Aflac\u2019s position in Japan and the United States the two largest insurance markets in the world. But let me leave you with this thought [ph], you have all heard me say my job is to balance interest of all stakeholders. I think we did a good job for that this year just as we have in the past. I believe we\u2019re going to do it again next year by protecting our policy holders with a strong SMR and returning significant capital through our owners.","So now I will now turn the program over to Kriss. Kriss?","","Kriss Cloninger","Thank you Dan. I would like to follow-up with a few comments on how we delivered on those promises and what it cost. You may recall that in the second quarter conference call, I was asked if there was a sense of urgency to stabilize the SMR. My simple answer was yes. And today, I can tell you that we completed several actions during the third quarter to fortify and enhance our SMR as well as to protect FSA earnings and profit repatriation in the future.","Let me take you back to the second quarter of this year. The U.S. Fed made comments that resulted in a spike in U.S. interest rates in May and June. Interest rates in Japan also increased. And by June 30 we have experienced a significant decline in the market value of Japan\u2019s assets categorized as available-for-sale or AFS. As a matter, we went from a net unrealized gain position in the AFS portfolio at the end of the first quarter to a net unrealized loss position in the same category at the end of the second quarter. This mark-to-market decline was the primary factor, because our SMR to decline by 101 basis points to 585 at June 30.","Now, while that SMR result was still within our targeted range, we were concerned that another spike in interest rates whether in the U.S. or Japan would further lower the SMR and make our share repurchase activities more uncertain. The first thing we did was to begin using the policy reserve matching our PRM accounting category in Japan. We used PRM to limit the mark-to-market risk on about $7 billion worth of our Japanese government bonds that were previously held in AFS. While using PRM did not materially increase the SMR during the third quarter, it does provide significant SMR protection against further increases in yen interest rates.","In addition, we executed derivative transactions to reduce dollar interest rate risk. For the use of interest rate collars, we hedged approximately 25% of our total dollar exposure in Japan against the risk of rising interest rates. Then late in the quarter, we entered into a reinsurance agreement, excuse me, which generated an SMR increase of about 115 points and represented the majority of the SMR improvement in the third quarter. While the cost of the reinsurance agreement will lead to about an estimated nickel per share reduction of EPS in 2014 we believe that provided the most cost effective means to increase capital in Japan.","Now, let me discuss some other factors primarily involving investments and other operating expenses that are affecting our 2014 guidance. These factors highlight the reasons why we expect our 2014 earnings growth rate to be somewhat lower than our 2013 growth rate. First, let me describe the investment headwinds. In the third quarter of 2013, we made a deliberate decision to move toward a more conservative asset allocation revising our asset allocation to emphasize yen denominated purchases. At present, we estimate that about 51% of our 2013 Japan cash flows will have been invested in yen with the balance allocated to the dollar denominated U.S. corporate bond program. Because we anticipate continued volatility in the financial markets for some time to come, we expect to allocate 80% to 90% of our estimated 2014 cash flow to yen denominated securities with the balance going to dollars.","In addition, we continue to see very low investment yields in Japan. This change in investment allocation along with assumed investment yields and less new cash flow combines the negatively impact investment income growth by approximately JPY6.9 billion before taxes or about $0.11 in operating earnings per share. Expense headwinds included increase in commission expenses related to an increase in Japan\u2019s consumption tax rate beginning April 2014, which is expected to cost us about JPY2 billion or $0.03 a share in 2014. In addition, we increased our commitment to a multi-year program we referred to as the corporate value enhancement program or CVEP as we may later refer to it which involves a major investment in our business systems and processes to strengthen our position as the leading provider of third quarter products. In total the increased expenses for Aflac","Japan in 2014 excluding the cost of reinsurance agreement and consumption taxes on commissions will be about 8.5 billion yen before taxes or about $0.12 a share.","Like Aflac Japan, Aflac U.S. is increasing it's spending to strengthen service levels for our distributors and customers. This initiative will begin with significant improvements through our enrollment and billing systems. The additional expenditure on this project will likely total that $7.3 million before taxes or about a penny a share. We do have some (indiscernible) wins as we offset some of these costs. We recently modified our U.S. pension plan and retiring medical benefit plans which reduces our liability and will result in lower expenses going forward. The change in both retiring medical and pension plans will lower expenses by about $24 million or about $0.03 per share in 2014.","As Dan mentioned we have upwardly revised our expectations for share repurchase in 2013 and \u201914 both of which will benefit EPS growth next year. Additional we expect the majority of our share repurchase activity in 2014 to occur earlier in the year.","The incremental benefits our earnings from the expanded share repurchase program is about $0.12 per share in 2014. We understand that many of the activities we\u2019re undertaking come at a price and the price is a slightly rate of EPS growth in 2014.","Taking all of these factors into account of the yen average is 95 to a 100 yen to the dollar for the fourth quarter in 2013 and continues into 2014 we would expect 2014 EPS to be in a range of $6.28 a share diluted share to $6.52 which is a growth rate of approximately 2% to 5% on a currency neutral basis.","It is important we think that perhaps [ph] all the items are discussed the 2014 EPS growth rate objective would have been comparable with the 2013 EPS growth rate we expect to achieve. More importantly as we look to the future we anticipate the headwinds we face in 2014 will diminish significantly in 2015. We believe all actions we plan for 2014 will ultimately serve not only to protect our policy holders but also benefit recurrence to shareholders.","Now let me turn it back to Rob for some comments on the quarter.","","Rob Wilkey","Thank you Kriss. Before we begin with our Q&A this morning I want to take this opportunity to remind you all that we will be hosting our 2014 (inaudible) meeting in Tokyo, Japan on Tuesday, September the 16th but please mark your calendar and we hope to all see you there. We\u2019re going today to go straight into the questioning and to be fair to everybody. Please remember to limit yourself to one initial question and only one follow-up that relates to your initial question. Now we will be happy to take your questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from John Nadel of Sterne Agee.","","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","I\u2019ve two questions and I guess maybe more directed to Kriss or Dan. They center around the two bigger items that are headwinds for 2014, I guess you know the infrastructure projects that you\u2019re talking about in particular for Japan for next year. I\u2019m just wondering if you had any discussion internally about redirecting for example some of the incremental spending that you expect to do in the fourth quarter of \u201913 around promotions spending that sort of thing toward may be getting a head start on the infrastructure projects instead. In particular, it seems like you have got similar tailwinds around Japan third sector sales growth in over the next one to two years maybe even longer given the medical product rollout and given the Japan cost arrangement. And given, there is also some increasing signs that the Japanese government may yet again adjust deductibles?","","Dan Amos","Well, let me \u2013 I will let Kriss answer this, but let me just say that it\u2019s an accounting issue. We can\u2019t prepay anything. We have \u2013 we can only do it as we actually have the contract working on it and it takes time, but I will let Kriss go into more detail.","","Kriss Cloninger","Well, as it relates to the so-called CVEP project, I will make a couple of comments and then I\u2019d like Tohru Tonoike to make some additional comments on this. John, this is a multi-year project. It\u2019s a significant long-term project that we have \u2013 we initiated several years ago. For the first couple of years, we were able to absorb the cost of the incremental cost that doing the project planning and some of the initial work within our operating expenses in Japan within the normal earnings increase to guidance. We have reached a point though in the project where we have to ramp up the expenditures for a couple of years to be \u2013 to really make solid progress on both the administrative, the marketing and the ITE aspects of this project. I have identified what the ramp up is for 2014. We expect to spend a similar amount in 2015, but that won\u2019t incrementally affect earnings. So it\u2019s not as simple as moving some promotional expenses in the fourth quarter of \u201813 to offset the anticipated expenses for the project in 2014, project simply too big. Tohru, would you like to make some additional comments on CVEP and then we probably need to come back to the sales question.","","Tohru Tonoike","Yes. As Kriss pointed out that we have been developing the program during the last couple of years, but OECs of the program, most of our jobs that are of \u2013 say what I call the planning and less implementation or a development of the program. But during the 2013, we have increased the level of the program development of the program and then best activity will be higher in the 2014 and then it will be plateaued for the rest of the several years. So yes and as Dan mentioned, the timing of incurring the expenses is tied to the volume the work we put into the program. So we discussed to move the timing, accelerate that work to the extent possible, but there aren\u2019t too much say flexibility available to us on that. So this is as much as we could have done.","","Dan Amos","But let me say one other thing, one of the things that\u2019s driving this project to cost more money is as you remember how you all complained about we were slow in putting in rate increases. Our systems couldn\u2019t handle it. We now \u2013 this is part of this new project is it we can address that upfront and we are getting it done as quickly as we can for future not so much the past. We feel fine now what we have done in the past. But for the future and Paul is going to make some comments about sales, because he has been over there, he will be moving over there in January.","","Paul Amos","Yes. John really quickly I will say that obviously the additional promotion expense is around pushing our third sector products. We clearly deemphasized the first sector and emphasized the third sector. And we are trying to push those products where we fill the launch of our new EVER plan has done at or above expectation and we feel strongly about where we\u2019re going to end up the fourth quarter on the third sector side. So overall I think the coordination of our communication and promotion is critical to the success of the sale and I feel very good about what we\u2019re going to do in that marketplace.","","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","And then my second question related to the outlook for investment for the investing of new cash flows, you know I understand that 80% to 90% in JGB is you know for 2014 and I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s obviously going to reduce the new money yield pretty dramatically given where rates are right now. But I\u2019m just wondering you know you\u2019re two years into this build-out of the new investment department with an eye toward a more balanced investment approach overtime. You know and you spend a lot of money on that and it appears the outcome and maybe this is more market driven I would appreciate your comments but it appears the outcome you know after all that spending and build out is that you\u2019re still going to end up investing very similarly to the way you did a couple of years ago.","","Dan Amos","Well that is true right now for the short term but take into account all of the things that we have been doing so far. We have addressed the issues with Europe, we have done the colors [ph] we have sophistication now that we would not be able to handle have we not staffed up. If the staffing up for us to buy 80% - 90% of our business in JGB the answer is no. Our staff up is to have a diversified portfolio but we have to take what we\u2019re dealt at the time we have been dealt and we felt the most important thing is to you know again hearing it loud and clear from all of you make sure you get the profits out of Japan and we have had to firm that SMR which cuts down the volatility with the JCB but don\u2019t take this that we like that. We would much rather be much more diversified, we would much rather being doing the things that we told you we\u2019re setting up for but I promise you that this new department that we have setup has capabilities in monitoring that we have to have in place before we can take on some of these. So I\u2019m going to let Eric talk about it but I didn\u2019t feel it was fair for Eric to have to depend what I\u2019m responsible for originally setting up and while we set it up.","","Eric Kirsch","Yeah I would just add to that thank you Dan. When you think about the investment in the group, it just simply can\u2019t boil down to as you return higher than it used to because Dan went over so many critical issues that were important to the health and the future of our balance sheet that we were able to address through these investment but I have also add when you look at these returns is a long term right? It's not what you did this quarter, this six months it's the long term. So I would offer to you since the build-out of the team the fact is we have instituted parts not all but parts of our strategic asset allocation. We have $11.5 billion in what we call the hedged corporate bond program that was not there before and it's not for the build-out. We probably would have had that money primarily NJGBs [ph]. So if you just look at that bucket and I will give you just a net estimate on annualized basis, if you look at the incremental yield of those hedge corporate bonds taking out the price repaid for the forwards the incremental expense of the investment team which again is spread out over many different things, we\u2019re just focusing it on this. We\u2019re looking at a net of about a 125 million or so an annuity stream of income and that\u2019s just after two years of building out not that I have got here and started with the 50 extra people, we had to hire them. We\u2019re in the middle of instituting a new technology platform and throughout that period we have addressed and reacted to things that have happened in the market that are critical for the overall company. So I would offer, we have accomplished a lot for that investment and there is more to come. So from a taxable [ph] standpoint we will always be careful to the markets and the needs of the organization.","","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","And Eric fair to say that you know the market gives you some opportunities over the coming months to tactically adjust that allocation and you will respond I assume.","","Eric Kirsch","Absolutely. The teams are thinking about the markets and our different options all the time. And one last comment as well and Dan touched on this, it shouldn\u2019t be lost that the reduction in our private placements, which is the biggest risk that we have is significant. I think when I got here we were close to 50%. We are now just under 30% of the overall portfolio. And that docket of privates is in much better shape than it\u2019s ever been which helps us to have confidence in the future health of the balance sheet.","","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","No question. Thank you very much for the full response.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Deutsche Bank.","","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning everybody. You touched upon the Japan post-deal again this quarter and I want to dig into that a little further if I could. In maybe better understand the opportunity there and I understand that there are 20,000 branches that you now have access to, but at the same time this is potential product has roughly 15%, 16% penetration in Japan already, you have a 50% market share of new sales. So how does that opportunity really play out over the next few years if you could add some color to that?","","Paul Amos","Yes, I am going to turn it over to Tohru here in just a second to talk to his perspective on Japan Post, this is Paul, but I will tell you that as Dan called it at the last conference call a game changer, we want to make sure you understand that everything that happens in Japan happens at a methodical and very pragmatic pace. We have amounts that we are opening up a 1,000 additional post office locations beginning in October. And we believe that through the middle to end of next year, we will potentially be looking at products and how we will enhance our cancer plans effectively sell through the Japan Post channel, but we believe over time that product and that will be pushed through that channel in a highly effective manner and we believe it\u2019s something they can be a benefit. We are not ready to commit to any particular numbers based on what are continuing and ongoing negotiations with Japan Post about how that will both be rolled out in terms of the number of branches as well as what the sales targets will be, but Tohru, if there are any additional comments you want to make, we just continue to believe that this is a significant deal for the company and we will have a material impact on our cancer sales.","","Tohru Tonoike","Yes, Paul, thank you. And one thing I would like to point out is that the Japan Post network is a huge network and that network happens to have the least say overlap with our existing distribution network. In other words, we have been very good after the promotion of the business in the large metropolitan areas, but relatively not so good in the rural areas. On the contrary, Japan Post network is spread all over the Japan including very rural areas. So we are hoping that having the Japan Post network will help us increase the sales in the areas, which we have not been so strong in.","","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And I have one follow-up on that if I could. Looking at the guidance for 2014, basically you are saying without the specific headwinds that you discussed earnings growth itself having the mid-single-digit range. And I guess I was a little surprised to see that that earnings would not have come in stronger than that given the new emphasis on third sector sales and maybe ACA being less of a headwind next year. And just want to hear your thoughts on that?","","Dan Amos","Let\u2019s repeat that again, please.","","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So if I look at the guidance for 2014, my understanding is that without the specific headwinds that you detailed earnings or EPS growth would have been the 4% to 7% range. And my question is why wouldn\u2019t it have been higher again without the headwinds given the fact that you are emphasizing the more profitable third sector products in Japan and maybe ACA becomes less of a headwind next year as well? Why wouldn\u2019t we see earnings come in a little higher than that?","","Dan Amos","Well, it would have been in closer to 4% to 7% if not slightly higher than that. As I pointed out last year, it takes a little bit of time for the effect of the first sector products to earn their way through the financials even though we are writing about 60% to 70% less ways in the last three quarters of 2013 then we wrote in 2012. We still wrote a fair amount in the first quarter of 2013 and we\u2019re still writing a fair amount even though the percentage reduction is high as a percentage reduction is. It's still a larger volume of business than the third sector products. In addition you\u2019ve got some persistency differences between the first sector products, many of which were paid for with the so called discounted advance premium program and when people pay all the premium upfront they don\u2019t tend to laugh because they don\u2019t have to make any more payments but you still get premium earning out so that persistency on that first sector of business is better than still very strong persistency on the third sector business. Fundamentally the guidance I gave that they will be meeting for margins and benefit ratios both between first sector and third sector is holding up well based on our experience so far and it's just a bit too early, you\u2019ve seen the change in margin toward the higher margin third sector products. So it just takes it a while to play out the long answer to a good question but the 4% to 7% was kind of in-line with the 2013 initial guidance. Again our guidance is usually on the conservative side historically and we have usually done a little bit better than that so I\u2019m not guaranteeing that but I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s historically being a factor in our guidance.","","Dan Amos","I would like to say one other thing about the life product sales. We\u2019re revisiting caps on the sales because it's interest rates have gone down. We think it's something we need to consider and we will know more about it but we\u2019re certainly considering it for 2014 and we will let you know more at the time.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley.","","Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley","Quick follow-up on the assistance cost. I think a lot of investors are wondering why the CVP cost weren\u2019t incorporated into your comments back at Investor Day. If you can bring development in this program now for several years, did you expect those cost that to be absorbed in the regular budget and you\u2019re giving that more precise and how much is it going to cost, any color there would be very helpful and also just on another question on the U.S. I understand your private exchange is in test mode but perhaps if you can also discuss a little longer term you plan to perhaps get your product on some other positive changes like that which say break us into steps. Thank you.","","Dan Amos","Nigel I will make some comments on the CVP project as I said initially we\u2019ve been trying to observe the cost of that into our general operating expense for as long as we could. During the early to middle part of 2013 we basically finalized a plan that have been through a couple of iterations both with the project administrators and executors that were using as well as with outside consultants that were used in this program. We finalized that plan pretty much during the middle part of 2013 and got a much better handle on the plan we\u2019re going to use to proceed and so we had a more certain estimate of cost after we completed the plan and actually that was our replan that we went through. So we have been doing a lot of work on this, we have been doing a lot of internal cross examination to make sure we have the value proposition correct and that we\u2019re committed to go on forward with it and now we\u2019re at the point where we do believe we have a value proposition correct. We do have good cost estimates going forward. Let me see if Tohru wants to add anything to that but essentially that\u2019s it from my perspective.","","Paul Amos","","Yes. The only thing is that during the basically the planning stage, we have been able to absorb the cost within our general expenses. And as Kriss mentioned, it was in the third quarter of this year when we finalized the plan for the whole program at which time we became able to communicate our plans more clearly to the outside world. So yes, and so like I said that until 2013, we were able to absorb the cost within the general budget, but that asset the program going into the full implementation stage that is the amount of the cost to exceed the range we can absorb.","","Dan Amos","And Nigel, I would add this comment, we have constantly reassessed priorities and the ability to change the products and premium rates on the per sector products that became a much higher priority, one that we felt like have the economic impact to justify the increased expenditure going forward. So from an investment point of view, we thought okay, this is an investment we need to make to protect our future financial position.","","Ken Janke","Nigel, this is Ken. Let me comment briefly on your exchange related question. Dan has indicated that we are in the process of piloting the Aflac private exchange which referred to as Everwell. It actually just started last week. So we have had several cases built in a very limited number of markets, but we don\u2019t have enrollments occurring yet. It was our decision when we began down this path to take a very conservative and pragmatic approach to the market with the rollout of the exchange. We want to make sure that it meets everyone\u2019s expectations, the agent\u2019s expectations, the expectations of the employer as well as the employee and also us internally. So we prefer to go a bit slower as we launch this. So we are piloting in three states. If all goes well, we would expect a schedule rollout next year, but the purpose right now is really for the 50 and under case size market. So, it\u2019s a very targeted market for the Aflac private exchange into \u2013 a couple of years from now to likely go up to a 100, but the private exchange will primarily be for the small case market. Your question about Aflac products appearing on other exchanges that is something that we are evaluating currently, but it\u2019s really taking for right now at least a backseat to the efforts we are taking to get the AFLAC private exchange rolled out properly.","","Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley","It\u2019s great.","","Dan Amos","And those states Nigel are Texas, Georgia and Illinois.","","Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks a lot.","","Operator","Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMC.","","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMC","Hi. I had a question first on the reinsurance agreement that you singed in Japan, could you just discuss the mechanism of the contract how it works and I don\u2019t think it affects FSA or GAAP results, but you could mention that as well? And then like you have the potential for more and under what circumstances you might consider additional contracts, the only other one I had was on the U.S. business and there has been a lot of talk about healthcare reform. How much do you \u2013 longer term, do you see this as more of an opportunity or a threat as it affects the supplemental products market in the U.S.?","","Dan Amos","I will take the first one. I have always believed that with change comes opportunity. What better example then we go back to 2001 with Japan and realized that everyone thought we were dead, we were in trouble. Cancer insurance was going to be taken away by the big life insurance companies. Three months after the initial deregulation, we were the number one seller of medical insurance and still hold that to this day and now have cancer insurance have continued to be number one. We are positioning ourselves that we will be \u2013 continue to be the number one insurer with supplemental health insurance products. I believe our ability to be able to do exchanges, our ability to be flexible because of relatively low price products, I believe it's going to stand out more because different plans that are being offered bronze, silver, gold and I think it's pretty clear the vast majority of people are going with the bronze plan it's going to be offered. That means it's going to be a very defined amount of out of pocket expenses to consumers which plays well with us. Also our brand our name recognition is now it's hit 94% no one that is in the market today even though there may be other companies that have reasonable brand awareness not to our level but they are not seeing as being \u201csupplemental health products.\u201d So I think we\u2019re in a great position, I\u2019m excited about it there is uncertainty make no doubt that\u2019s out there today but that too will pass and when it passes we have to be ready and to go in a way that I think will accelerate growth for us and we\u2019re counting on that. When and where and how it will do as I mentioned consumer confidence is down, that hurts us. Other areas people that want to procrastinate are always looking for excuses they can use right now. I want to wait till everything is finalized with national health plan but all in all I don\u2019t think I would swap places with anyone in the industry in terms of being prepared for healthcare as we are right now.","Now the other question, who wants to take that?","","Kriss Cloninger","I\u2019ll take that, that\u2019s all about the structure of the co-insurance agreement and some related questions. Jimmy the reinsurance agreement is co-insurance in nature with a third party reinsured that\u2019s authorized for reinsurance in Japan. We co-insured portion of one of our more established predictable, profitable blocks of business. It's a no-cash transaction upfront going forward we will see the portion of the premium income from that block, net of an expense allowance we receive from the reinsurer and reinsurer will reimburse us for the proportionate share of the claims on the business. So it's a pretty straightforward agreement. But because the reinsurance is permanent in nature we\u2019re allowed to take a reserve credit in say financials for the pro rata share of FSA reserves on the block and the amount of those reserves we get a credit for is approximately a 100 billion yen.","You know based on the difference between the premium we pay and the claims we expect to receive there is a net cost associated with agreement and I indicated what that is, it's anticipated to be about a nickel a share in the 2014 GAAP financials. As far as U.S. statutory treatment the reinsurer is not an authorized reinsure in the U.S. so we will report our U.S. statutory earnings based on the co-insurance being an effective agreement in terms of stated premiums and claims but we will not admit the reserve credit. So we won't get any surplus relief on the U.S. statutory statement or the risk based capital measure but that didn\u2019t trouble because our RBC is already strong enough and we didn\u2019t feel like paying the extra cost of you know that it would take to get the reserves backed by letters of credit and authorized for you know surplus recognition in the U.S and on a GAAP basis nowhere I mean we\u2019re releasing some reserves but we\u2019re putting but a deferred profit liability amortizing the cost in accordance with the accounting requirements and you know again the net cost is what I indicated.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMC","Okay, thank you.","","Dan Amos","Going forward, you ask again about additional capacity, we believe we do have additional capacity, but I will say that I view this as a sale of a portion of our business and it\u2019s not an action we would enter into lively compared to say a financial reinsurance transaction, where you are basically getting a loan and paying it back over a period of time. This is more of a permanent transaction and not something that I would enter into routinely. Regarding capacity, I think we do have additional capacity, but it\u2019s not something we are going to look at quarterly and see where our SMR is and say okay, do we need another $2 billion reinsurance this quarter? That\u2019s not what we are going to do.","","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMC","Got it, thanks.","","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse.","","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Good morning. First question is Dan, did I hear you correctly that you said you were reconsidering the limits that you have on (indiscernible) sales, just wanted some clarification on what you had mentioned there","","Dan Amos","That is correct. What I have said is that with interest rates moving lower, we adjusted put limits last year and this year. We are looking at them again now for \u201814. So even though, our productions weigh down we still could have limits even more so. So we are monitoring that and seeing what we need to do. And we are not the only ones in the industry doing that. So it\u2019s not limited as this does. Other companies are doing that as well.","","Ken Janke","Basically, this is Ken, the price increase that we implemented for first sector products in effect became a production cap, because they were the primary distributors moved out our products, but with interest rates declining again in Japan, we don\u2019t want to repeat a 2011, where our other companies put in production caps and all of a sudden we have become more attractive product in the marketplace. And so you can still make this a good profit margin product investing in JGB, so I assume the pricing has been dramatically altered then.","","Dan Amos","Well, it was dramatically altered April 1 when we increased the pricing of the product to recognize the 1% standard valuation interest rate in Japan, we basically re-priced first sector products at 1.25%, but still even at that level though we have got profits in it, we are trying to minimize the low margin products emphasizing the higher margin third sector products.","","Kriss Cloninger ","And since April the deals in Japan have declined further.","","Dan Amos","That\u2019s correct.","","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Great. And just one question related to your capital return program, Kriss when we think about the I guess what annualized you are almost at a $700 million level for common dividends and the buyback for next year expected to be $800 million to $1 billion, should we think about that being a level as you move forward into \u201815\/16. Is that just based on the way you have optimized things? Is that \u2013 should that be a fairly consistent amount of capital return? Do you think that\u2019s going to go up materially or you are kind of overspending, how \u2013 can you frame how we should think about what you have done now and what that would mean more prospectively?","","Kriss Cloninger","I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s overspending at all Tom. We are not pulling down additional capital from Japan to invest in share repurchase. You know that historically our profit repatriation from Japan has been somewhat highly correlated with the FSA basis earnings and we have been trying to make sure that we achieve some stability in those FSA basis earnings. On average, probably over the last 10 years, we have taken out about 80% of our FSA basis earnings as profit repatriation and lot of that gets allocated to the share repurchase activity. In various specific years, we have gone around 50% or 60% of FSA earnings. And in one year, we took out 100%, but in general, there is going to be high correlation between profit repay creation and FSA basis earnings and our guidance is based on the notion that we\u2019re going to be able to stabilize FSA earnings and the increased repay creation would kind of be a normal increase associated with recognized FSA earnings you know and then the common dividend and the share repurchase it roughly you know approaching 2 billion a year is what I would consider kind of a normalized run-rate not excessive or not supplemented in anyway but other than normal earnings.","","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","So approaching 2 billion meaning you could have another 500 million or so of upside as you think about it going forward?","","Kriss Cloninger","Well we have given the 2014 guidance but you know as you said you know thinking about round numbers I mean we\u2019re between a 1 billion and a 1.5 billion and what comes next which in my mind is 2 billion so as I think about 2015, 2016 you\u2019re probably heading in that direction.","","Dan Amos","And let\u2019s be clear, no one has to make it clear to us that that\u2019s what our shareholders want us to do. We got the message and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re moving that way and that\u2019s why this call and these things that we\u2019re doing. This is our number one priority because that\u2019s what our shareholders believe will ultimately enhance the value of our shares.","","Operator","Our next question is from Joanne Smith of Scotia Capital.","","Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital","I just wanted to ask if you could just clarify the last statement that you made Kriss in terms of the profit repay creation. Did you just say that you were moving towards 2 billion?","","Kriss Cloninger","Not all profit repay creation by itself but I was including the payout to shareholders including common dividend which is approaching 700 million and you know a $1 billion say of share repurchase in 2014 which be expected to increase somewhat over the next several years. And we should have said the number but in my mind it's kind of in the range of where I\u2019m shooting for.","","Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital","Next question on the U.S. sales and Japan sales I guess, in the 2014 guidance there was no guidance for what you\u2019re looking for in terms of sales growth and either the U.S. or Japan. With the weak sales in the U.S. in the third quarter I was somewhat surprised that you did not change the 0% to 5% target for the full year and with the pick-up in sales in the third quarter in Japan I\u2019m little bit surprised that you haven't gotten more comfortable providing guidance for 2014. So can you just address those issues please?","","Dan Amos","I will let Paul do Japan then I\u2019ll cover the U.S.","","Paul Amos","Overall you know obviously we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to finish this year with the strong momentum that we have in the third sector due to the new product launch in the middle of August. It's hard for us to tell exactly how we\u2019re going to finish the end of this year. However we do believe it's going to be at the high end of the range that we have given 0 to 5 but at this point as Dan mentioned there are quite a few factors going on all the sales projects for next year whether we put in caps on first sector products whether we you know what products we\u2019re going to launch in terms of next year and having in the third sector. We do feel third sector is going to be continue to be the emphasis but at this point we just can\u2019t give you a strong range, what we will do though is in the fourth quarter at least give you those numbers and that\u2019s what we have traditionally done even though we have given you the earnings release previously we have given you the sales projection at the end of the fourth quarter and that\u2019s exactly what we plan to do to remain consistent with years passed.","","Dan Amos","And as far as the U.S. goes I never like to say we\u2019re not going to achieve an objective but I think the headwinds that we have had regarding uncertainty in this fourth quarter gives me pause [ph]. So I would not say that I\u2019m optimistic but I do believe once this calms down that again where there is change is opportunity and I believe that we\u2019re going to get it together. The main thing I\u2019m trying to do right now is to concentrate on getting it right for healthcare reform. And Teresa, who is our Chief Operating Officer at Columbus and Dan Lebish who we put as the Chief Operating Officer of Columbia with group insurance and Ken overseeing all of it. We are coordinating to make sure we do these things right to handle and be ready. And so that has been my emphasis for the remaining of this year. Our director sales, their quotas are still based on the numbers that we set. There is no lowering or anything. So they are all pushing as hard as they can, but as I said, I am not as optimistic we will achieve that, but I am going to say never till the end, because with group insurance and other things, big things can come through, so we will watch it and see.","","Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital","Okay. And then just one last final question and that is on the deductible in Japan, what level of confidence do you have that there is going to be structural changes that occur in Japan and that would include an increase in deducting the deductible on the national healthcare programs? And what kind of timing would you be looking at?","","Dan Amos","Well, you remember that I said it was going to 50% 10 years ago. I said, well if it went to 0% to 10% to 20% to 30%, I didn\u2019t see any reason it wouldn\u2019t eventually go to 50%. Well, my answer is I am already behind, because I thought it would have happened by now on some of it. Now Paul is over there and maybe to (indiscernible) comment on.","","Paul Amos","I would just say that obviously it\u2019s the third pillar of (indiscernible), he has had great success in some of the implementations thus far. And I think it\u2019s difficult to ever predict what\u2019s going to go through a political system whether it\u2019s here in the United States or in Japan. The fact is however the population demographics continue to push in such a direction as well as the overall Japanese consumer sentiment about the healthcare program in general. And you have seen them already talking specifically about raising the co-pay for ages 70 to 74, I don\u2019t know if Tohru wants to chime in on this, but I think in general, it\u2019s very difficult to us to commit anything that\u2019s outside of our control. Obviously if it were to shift to a 40% or 50%, it would be a positive tailwind for us. Tohru?","","Tohru Tonoike","Yes, this is Tohru. I think I agree with Paul about the prospects of the co-pay for the elderly people between 70 to 74.","","Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital","Okay, thank you very much.","","Operator","Our next question is from Randy Binner of FBR Capital Markets.","","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","Hi, okay, thank you. I will keep it brief since we are at the top of the hour, but just on the buyback this quarter now is pretty significant at $500 million, so just want to clarify that you have not executed on any of that so far when the blackout period for that is over and if you have any special execution plans to get that done this quarter given the size?","","Ken Janke","Randy, this is Ken. We typically move out of the blackout period after in the afternoon of the daylight today after the conference call when we know all of the news has been properly disseminated. We have evaluated not only our capital position, but trading volumes and restrictions that we have for purchasing on a daily basis and we are confident that we can execute those purchases in the fourth quarter.","","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay.","","Dan Amos","So we hadn\u2019t bought any so far and after 12 o\u2019clock today, 1 o\u2019clock we can be in the market.","","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, great. Yes, that would be good. And then just one other quick one, just a follow-up on the reinsurance transaction, is it \u2013 when you say it\u2019s prominent how prominent is that? I mean, can you get out of it or is this, I am just kind of curious what the definition of permanence is there?","","Dan Amos","Well, there is recapture provision in there. I suspect if we negotiated with assuming company we might be able to do something, but that\u2019s not our intent. We intend to let it play out over time as I said albeit more as a sale of a block of business than I do shorter duration reinsurance arrangement that can be recaptured.","","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","And is this counterparty, can we take it as the Japanese insurance company?","","Dan Amos","It\u2019s an international insurance company that operates in Japan.","","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. And then one last one just detailed question, you outlined there is $0.05 of EPS cost for the reinsurance deal, where does the hedging piece such as the rate collars fit in, is that in that $0.05 or is that somewhere else?","","Dan Amos","I don\u2019t have anything to do with that. This is strictly a claims reinsurance, didn\u2019t have anything to do with interest rate hedges on assets. There is no asset transfers involved. We remain responsible for all the exchanges and the investment income on assets back in the block, it's strictly claims released and exchange for the payment of gross premium net of an expense allowance.","","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","I guess what I\u2019m trying to say what is the callout then on the interest rate colors, is there a cost in the kind of the list of headwinds to \u201914 EPS?","","Dan Amos","There is zero cost color but there are settlements depending on where rates move to. But the estimate is zero.","","Rob Wilkey","Okay Marianne as Randy pointed out we\u2019re past the top of the hour. We\u2019re going to take just one more question.","","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James & Associates.","","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Can we revisit CVPs follow-up, CVP the $0.12 that you\u2019re the increased $0.12, what is the total amount that you\u2019re spending on this in \u201913?","","Kriss Cloninger","Tohru might be able to answer but what we\u2019re addressing here is the incremental cost over 2013. Actually you know the way you measure cost we have had a lot of discussions with Aflac Japan personnel and you know it's whether you go through a fully absorb cost and all that kind of thing and I don\u2019t want to get into that on accomplished goal. So I will just say that EPS the guidance is the excess direct cost that we intend to invest in the CV program over what we invested in 2013, however that number was derived.","","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","A question on the reinsurance, in the long run does the historical ratio of the amount that you repay relative to FAS earnings, does that change it at all because of this?","","Kriss Cloninger","Well we\u2019re not, we will get to count the reserve release as part of FAS earnings. However we are leaving the reserve release in Japan as part of our capital base. We\u2019re not going to repay three any portion of the profits triggered by the reserve release associated with the reinsurance agreement. So if you just look at reported FAS profits, they will be significantly higher well by about a 100 billion yen than they would have been without the agreement and we don\u2019t plan to take any of that out. We plan to generate capital with this transaction and we couldn\u2019t achieve that purpose if we repay created that portion.","","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay how about in \u201915 and \u201916?","","Kriss Cloninger","I\u2019m relying pretty much on routine FSA operating earnings which will not be benefited in any extraordinary way by the reinsurance agreement. There will be a routine cost in the FSA earnings approximately of the same amount that impacts U.S. GAAP earnings as I indicated. There will be a difference between the premiums net of allowance is paid and the benefits received, that will probably a net cost of reinsurance that will go through 2015 FSA earnings in addition to GAAP and staff [ph] but that\u2019s not material compared to you know what we\u2019re talking about on the initial reserve release associated with the transaction.","","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay and then one more if I may, with Paul moving to Japan what is the chain of command in Japan these days?","","Dan Amos","Well the operating will still be run by Tohru. He is still the Chief Operating Officer and in charge. Paul is not going to be living there for the rest of his life. He is just moving over there for a period of time, six months to a year whatever it ends up being just to better understanding, Paul speaks Japanese. He will just be over there learning the culture more, being associated with them, building relationships with them and giving him a better understanding of exactly how it works and they all get along very well and I am very pleased with how that\u2019s going just as I am pleased with Ken and what\u2019s going over there and the job that Teresa is doing. I think all-in-all, this has been a very smooth transition and just allows flexibility for you to understand our management team and let them be able to be able to do cross jobs and do different aspects up.","","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay, thank you guys.","","Robin Wilkey","Marianne, thank you very much for about 15 after the hour, if anyone wants to follow-up after the call, please call Investor Relations and we appreciate your participation on the call.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question and answer session. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Young, Vice-President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations.","David Young - Aflac, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me this morning from the U.S. are Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac, Incorporated; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice-President and CFO of Aflac, Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice-President, Global Chief Investment Officer, and President of Aflac Global Investments; Rich Williams, whom you may recall joined us in September of last year as Executive Vice-President and Chief Distribution Officer; Al Riggieri, Senior Vice-President and Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary. You may recall that Al was promoted to this position on April 3 of this year.","Joining us from Tokyo are Charles Lake, President of Aflac International and Chairman Representative Director of Aflac Life Insurance Japan; Masatoshi Koide, President, Representative Director, and COO of Aflac Japan; Todd Daniels, Executive Vice-President and Principal Financial Officer of Aflac Life Insurance Japan \u2013 you may recall that Todd was promoted to this position on April 3 and now operates out of our Japan office \u2013 Koji Ariyoshi, Director, Executive Vice-President, and head of sales and marketing for Aflac Life Insurance Japan.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. The earnings release is available on the Investors page of aflac.com, and also includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures.","Now I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Fred will then follow with comments about our financial outlook and capital management. Dan?","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Thank you, David, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. Although we just have one quarter under our belt, let me begin by saying that the first quarter of 2018 established a solid start for the year.","Let me give you more detail, beginning with our Japan operations. Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor, generated strong financial results for the quarter. As we anticipated, third sector sales faced challenging comparisons. You will recall that in February of 2017 we launched our refreshed medical product. Additionally, we communicated our plan to introduce our new cancer insurance product after the conversion of the Japan branch to a subsidiary was complete on April 2.","Keep in mind, as the pioneer and leader of cancer insurance sales, when we announce that we will be introducing a new cancer product post-conversion, much of our distribution felt compelled to hold out on the cancer sales until they could sell the new cancer product. The combined effort of launching a product in the first quarter of 2017 and delaying the launch of our new cancer product until April of 2018 made the challenging quarter.","Aflac Japan generated sales results that were modestly weaker than our expectations. However, we expect third sector sales to build as the year goes on, and I am confident that we will achieve our sales target as outlined during our outlook call for 2018. In addition, we remain on pace to generate third sector earned premium quote in the 2% to 3% range, reflecting Aflac's stable sales and stable persistency.","Regarding distribution, our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success, and we continue to roll out our model sales offices designed to increase productivity. Our alliance partners also made significant contributions to our sales results. Our extensive distribution network that includes Japan's Post \u2013 20,000-plus postal outlets furthered our goal to be where people want to buy insurance. Our focus remains on maintaining our leadership position in the sale of third sector products, along with building the sale of the first sector protection products. Both of these type of products are less interest rate-sensitive and have strong and stable margins. We will continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduce innovative new third sector products to maintain our market leadership.","Turning to the U.S. operations, we are pleased with the financial performance and strong profitability of Aflac U.S. in the quarter, which is particularly notable because these results also reflect on our ongoing investment in our platform. Our sales results were in line with our expectations. I anticipated productivity to improve across all distribution teams. We continue to expect full-year sales growth of 3% to 5%, with production performance building as the year goes on. Ultimately we believe our investment in distribution and customer experience objectives will yield strong sales and stable persistency. We expect to generate an earned premium growth outlook in the 2% to 3% for the year.","As we discussed in our financial analyst briefing last September, we continue to expect higher growth in the broker sales for our industry. Our team of broker sales professionals has made progress in successfully deepening Aflac's relationships within the large-broker community. Our product partnering initiatives for true group products is still early in its development, but is already starting to take off. As a result, Aflac is seeing a high rate of growth through broker and strong sales growth in our group products.","Aflac is different from our peers in that the majority of our sales come from our independent sales agents rather than Brokers. These sales agents are important, and are best positioned within the industry to reach and therefore succeed with smaller employers and groups with fewer than 100 employees. This segment, which we will continue to focus our attention on.","Brokers have recognized more and more that our clients need the type of products Aflac offers. This has increased the appeal and therefore the interest in doing business with Aflac. Brokers are looking for us to assert our strong experience and fulfill the capabilities. Our field force and independent agents are experts who have the ability to work with brokers and broker sales professionals to accelerate growth.","We are seeing positive momentum in our ability to meet the needs of brokers through this sales approach. We characterize this collaboration as broker-influenced business, and as we look to the remainder of 2018, we continue to expect sales to skew to the fourth quarter as brokers and broker-influenced sales are a growing part of our business. We also increased our career sales agents' adaptation of the Everwell enrollment platform, which we continue to leverage to enhance our customer enrollment experience.","I want to briefly touch on One Day Pay, because I believe it continues to differentiate and re-enforce our strong brand and policyholder trust. More than 90% of the policyholders that have used One Day Pay say they are likely to refer other people to Aflac. I believe our dedication to paying claims fast and fairly will benefit future sales. This is especially true because as independent research shows, that there is no doubt American consumers need cash quickly, and paying claims fast sets Aflac apart. We believe investing in innovative solutions and industry-leading initiatives like One Day Pay will only further distinguish Aflac from the competition.","Turning to capital deployment, Fred will provide more details shortly, but first I'd just make the comment that we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our stakeholders. At the same time, we're balancing our financial strength with increasing the dividend, repurchasing the shares, and re-investing in our business. We continue to anticipate that we will repurchase in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of our shares in 2018. As is always the case, this assumes stable capital position and absence of compelling alternatives.","As I mentioned, we recognize that targeted investments in our platform is critical to our growth strategy and driving efficiency that will impact the bottom line for the future. Benefiting from the December U.S. tax reform, we are leveraging the opportunity to accelerate our investment in initiatives that reflect our company's values and objectives. We expect to increase overall investments in the U.S. by approximately $250 million over three to five years. These strategic investments focus on three main categories: continued growth in the company's U.S. operation, enhanced employee benefit and training programs, and investing in technology, innovation, and digital businesses.","Looking ahead, we believe our strong earnings growth will reflect the underlying earnings power of our insurance operations in Japan and the United States. It will also reflect our prudent approach to deploying excess capital in a way that balances the interest of all stakeholders. At the same time, it will reflect our dedication to delivering on the promises we make to the policyholders.","I'll just conclude by reiterating how excited I am about our company and our future growth, and believe that it will continue. I'll now turn the program over to Fred to cover the financial results. Fred?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Thank you, Dan. We are off to a very strong start to the year on the earnings front, as results for the quarter exceeded our expectations.","For the quarter, and accounting for our recent stock split, adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share benefited from strong pre-tax margins both in Japan and the U.S. Our reported results were also impacted by a strengthening of the yen as compared to the 2017 period, contributing $0.03 per share to the quarter's results.","The quarter's effective tax rate of 26% includes the tax treatment of equity compensation under GAAP. When normalized, our effective tax rate of 26.5% came in as expected, and represents a blend of Japan's tax rate of 28%, the U.S. rate of 21%, and based on our current mix of earnings. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter benefited by approximately $0.11 from the 2018 adoption of U.S. corporate tax reform.","Japan branch conversion costs in the quarter were $29 million. Through the end of the first quarter we have recorded approximately $71 million in total conversion costs, and expect to come in at the low end of our $120 million to $130 million original estimate. The majority of the remaining costs are expected to be recorded in the second quarter.","Turning to our Japan segment results, both our benefit and expense ratios came in favorable to our expectations, resulting in a strong pre-tax profit margin of 21.1%. Our total benefit ratio at the lower end of our guidance range of 70% to 72%, driven by a favorable third sector benefit ratio, which was positively impacted by results in our older cancer in-force block.","When comparing the quarter's ratio to last year's results, the reduction was largely driven by the continued shift in business mix from first sector towards third sector, which carries a lower benefit ratio. Our expense ratio in Japan also came in at the lower end of our projected range of 19% to 21%, and is largely timing-related as we anticipate increased promotional spend with the launch of our refreshed cancer product in the second quarter. In addition, we anticipate stepped-up investment in product development, digital, and IT initiatives designed to drive future growth and operating efficiencies.","Investment income performance in Japan also contributed to our strong results. The quarter's outperformance was driven by favorable results in our U.S. dollar portfolio. We were opportunistic in accelerating the growth of our floating rate portfolio, and also benefited from higher floating-rate yields relative to our expectations heading into 2018.","Turning to the U.S. results, our overall profit margin in the quarter was a strong 21%. Our total benefit ratio came in below our guidance range of 51% to 53%. While generally consistent with recent claims trends and our mix of business, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and we expect benefit ratios for the remainder of the year will climb back within the range. Our expense ratio in the U.S. came in as expected and reflects continued investment in our platform.","As Dan noted in his comments, with U.S. tax reform, we announced our intent to invest up to $250 million over the next three to five years in our U.S. business. We have worked to identify specific areas of accelerated investment, and estimate the impact to be approximately $0.03 per share for the remainder of 2018.","Before leaving the U.S. segment, it's worth noting we transferred an investment portfolio totaling approximately $615 million in fixed income assets out of our U.S. segment to Aflac, Inc. as part of shifting contingent capital to the holding company. Although it does not impact our consolidated results, this move has the effect of reducing net investment income in the U.S. segment, and a corresponding increase in investment income in our corporate segment.","Together with strategic venture investments and other business activity at the holding company post-conversion, we have added line-item disclosures on our Corporate and Other segment in our financial supplement that we hope you'll find helpful.","We ended the quarter in a strong capital position. Japan's solvency margin ratio is estimated in the 1,000% range. Recall that as part of our April 2 conversion from a branch to a subsidiary, we expect an accounting-driven decline in SMR. Based on our year-end ratio, we estimate the impact to be approximately 130 points, and have plans in place to restore the SMR accounting impact within a three-year period.","Our estimated U.S.-only risk-based capital ratio at the quarter end stands at roughly 870%, and includes a partial adoption of the U.S. tax reform by adjusted deferred tax assets to the new tax rate.","It is our understanding the NAIC is still finalizing the precise timing of the full adoption of tax reform, which may move into 2019 and also incorporate proposed C1 changes to asset capital charges. We will monitor and update accordingly, but do not expect any disruption to our U.S. excess capital drawdown plans. We will proceed with the drawdown of $500 million in excess capital along with normal dividends as we move through the remainder of the year.","We ended the quarter with over $2 billion of capital and liquidity at the holding company. We set aside $1 billion for contingent capital, and $500 million for liquidity in support of holding company derivative positions. Overall credit conditions and asset quality remain strong, with only a modest level of impairments in the quarter.","We continue to seek balance in growth and platform investments while returning excess capital to our shareholders. Including dividends and share repurchase, we returned approximately $500 million to our shareholders in the quarter. We are maintaining our current range for repurchase of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in 2018. We repurchased 6.6 million shares of our stock for $296 million in the quarter, and remain tactical in our approach, guided by relative returns on excess capital deployment options.","As we move through 2018, we are hard at work to optimize our post-conversion capital and liquidity profile. This includes our plans to draw down U.S. RBC, assessing our approach to managing Japan's build in capital generation, and optimizing holding company contingent capital and liquidity.","On the topic of optimization, we are working to refine our approach to protecting the U.S. dollar value of yen-denominated dividends out of our Japan subsidiary, while lowering enterprise-wide costs associated with Japan's U.S. dollar investment hedging. We accomplish this by entering into offsetting hedge positions at the holding company. While not material to our results in the near term, the impact of this activity comes through our Corporate and Other segment in the form of additional income.","We are balancing the need to manage our Japan subsidiary capital and FSA earnings volatility while lowering our enterprise exposure to the potential of a weakening yen. Coming off our successful conversion, we will further develop these optimization strategies and provide more detail at our September financial analyst briefing in Japan.","In closing, while it's early in the year to be adjusting our outlook, we are off to a solid start in terms of our currency-neutral earnings per share guidance range and overall pre-tax margins in both Japan and the U.S. And I'll hand the call back to David to begin Q&A. David?","David Young - Aflac, Inc.","Thank you, Fred. Now we are ready to take your questions, but before we begin, let me ask, to be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to one initial question and a related follow-up. We will now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. You may now ask your question.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So you mentioned in Japan's third cycle sales, you talked about the rollout of the new cancer product. Can you talk about, at a high level, the reception of the new Day One cancer product, and I guess the month-to-date sales?","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","We can't break out monthly sales, but maybe someone in Japan \u2013 who would like to take that?","Masatoshi Koide - Aflac Japan Co., Ltd.","Hi. [Foreign Language] This is Koide from Aflac Japan. [Foreign Language] The new cancer product that we have relaunched has added a new coverage, not only just focusing on the treatment itself, but there are benefits that we have added such as appearance care or palliative care, and these are the things that we try to align with in changing of the diversification of the treatment as well as environmental changes. So we are offering extensive coverage through this product. [Foreign Language] And this also product caters to the needs of a broad range of customers in different ages.","[Foreign Language] And not only that, we are offering new plans for brand new customers, but we are also offering a special product or special benefit for existing customers. [Foreign Language] And also, those customers who were not able to take out cancer insurance due to their concerns relating to their health, we now have a rate specifically for those customers so that these customers are able to take out our cancer insurance under a nonstandard rate. [Foreign Language] And we have started to sell this product with these sales points and appealing points with targeted customers, and our sales have been as expected. [Foreign Language] That's all from me.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Thank you for the color.","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","I would say that overall, as I look at the numbers, I've been pleased with the rollout of this new product. And as I said in my comments, I do expect us to make our goal for the full year.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Understood. My second question is related to the U.S. dollar-invested assets in Japan, which increased by $3 billion in quarter, and then your hedge ratio is now down to 36% from your target of 40%. I was just wondering what was the driver for the increase in the U.S. dollar-denominated assets in Japan, and then also in terms of the low hedge ratio? Is it just a timing issue, or is there also a little shift in your strategy?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","There's not a shift in our strategy as it relates to what we provided in the way of our outlook call. There will be timing issues related to the development of both the U.S. dollar portfolio and the hedge ratio as we go through the year, but we're still targeting overall a 40% hedge ratio on an increasing U.S. dollar portfolio. I think our projection is to have the U.S. dollar portfolio build to roughly the level of $25 billion to $26 billion, perhaps right in that range.","So you're seeing our notional level of hedges right now, for example, at not quite $10 billion, I think, roughly a little better than $9.5 billion. And that will build up to more the $10.5 billion range, so that's why you're seeing our hedge costs are slightly lower than the run rate expectation, which is similar to last year's hedge cost range of roughly $240 million to $250 million-type range.","So the build in the U.S. dollar portfolio is really what I mentioned in my comments, and that is, we accelerated \u2013 we were able to opportunistically accelerate investment in particularly floating rate assets, and even more specifically transitional real estate. This was somewhat related to the announcement related to NXT where we purchased an outright portfolio to accelerate the build.","But more pronounced than that was simply seeing a lot of good opportunities come our way to invest more proactively. So we jumped out of the gate with a little higher investment in floating rate, which is a U.S. dollar initiative, and so the build in U.S. dollar. And you'll see the hedge ratio catch up a little bit as we go through the year.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","So basically, so right now the U.S. dollar program, the U.S. dollar investment asset \u2013 the investment program, is around $27 billion. So it's a little bit above your $25 billion to $26 billion. And so you're just going to let it sit there to let your overall general cap grow to that level?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Yeah. We jumped out a little early to build the U.S. dollar portfolio because of the opportunity, but we would expect to stay in that range.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore. You may now ask your question.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. Fred, I want to ask you about the optimization program you were referencing. I'm not asking you to front-run your \u2013 what you're planning on talking about in September, but can you just give at least a broad idea for what you're approaching with this? Like is this more about risk management, or is there a potential carrot (27:28) at the end here, whether it's capital or whether it's better cashflow or earnings? What is the potential, or can you dimension this a little bit?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Yeah. I will definitely look to dimension this and provide greater detail as we move towards September. And that's really consistent with a lot of the work streams we have going on, Tom. But at a high level, I'd characterize the approach as follows.","We have purposely built up a fairly good amount of excess capital in the system. And that's because we're going through a year of transformation in terms of the conversion of the Japan branch to a subsidiary. And so they really fall into three categories. Category one you know a lot about, and that is the drawdown of excess capital, and actually the geographic movement of excess capital out of our U.S. platform. That's well underway. We started into that last year materially, and we continue through this year and next year. And that's the drawdown of RBC.","Now a question I often get is, can we bring that down below our targeted 500%? And I think that's possible to do. But I think it's very sound for us to first settle into our structure, start producing statutory statements on a U.S.-only basis, make sure we have a handle on full assessment around not only our performance on a U.S.-only statutory basis, but also we've got to watch the moving target of the NAIC and how they're playing around with both tax reform and C1 charges. I don't expect that to be disruptive to our plan. In fact, I think we may find as much opportunity as we do anything else, once all that settles in, just by nature of our business model. But the question becomes, can I bring or further optimize U.S.?","Second big area is SMR in Japan. We've done a lot of work to calm down the potential volatility of SMR in Japan, and we've also done some work over optimizing the trade-off of hedge costs and hedge ratio, and absorbing a certain amount of capital and increased volatility. And as we've dialed that in, we're starting to look more carefully at the quality of our increasing FSA earnings or the capital generation, which has been increasing in recent years, and we expect that to continue; and then how we dial in a more normalized SMR ratio, given the risk profile of our business.","This is by the way a much easier conversation to have with both a regulator and a rating agency when you're a subsidiary status and not a branch status. And so we're going to come off of this conversion and really sit down and go through those mechanics.","And then last but not least is the holding company. As I mentioned, we're carrying a bit north of $2 billion at the holding company, but have sort of a standby level of capital of $1.5 billion, both contingent capital and liquidity. The issue is if we're carrying upwards of $500-plus million of additional available capital at the holding company, how best do we utilize that? How do we best put that to work for our shareholders, and how confident are we that we can put it to work and not run any risk.","So those are the three big categories of where we're holding capital. And as we've said all along, the key element to opening up the door for this was completing the conversion of the Japan branch to subsidiary. That now opens us up to be much more efficient in optimizing our game plan.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","That's interesting. I appreciate the thoroughness there. I guess my one follow-up is, you also mentioned a 130-point negative impact from the conversion from the branch to a sub, and a plan to restore that SMR back to I guess 1,000%. That would seem to be at odds a bit with being able to be more efficient with capital, if you're going to have to restore SMR percentage. Unless there's a, more of a financial engineering mechanism to get you there? Can you comment on that?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Yeah. It's very important to understand what that 130 points is. That is a, I used the terminology, that is an accounting-driven reduction in our SMR. And what I mean by that, you'd have to reflect back on some of the early days of our announcing the conversion. When we convert from branch to subsidiary, we effectively transfer retained earnings into other capital accounts. And that is just an accounting, an FSA accounting dynamic. And when you do that, you lose the tax gross-up impact to SMR from moving out of retained earnings.","As we go forward, our intent is to pay dividends out of those capital accounts. Therefore, as we earn money or bring retained earnings to the table, we build more quickly back up that retained earnings to the levels prior to conversion, and with that comes the tax gross-up benefits. So that's what I mean by the restoration of just that accounting drag. And it's important just to note that that was not some sort of economic loss of capital. It's simply an accounting issue, and we have plans in place to restore it.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi. You may now ask your question.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thanks. Wanted to get back to Japan and the new cancer product. Can you give us a sense of what you think the ramp would look like in terms of distribution channels? In other words, at what point do you think you'll have that new product in Japan Post, Dai-ichi, and your other channels that you distribute through?","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Koji, would you take that?","Masatoshi Koide - Aflac Japan Co., Ltd.","This is Koide again. The new cancer product is offered through all our channels, including Dai-ichi Life and Japan Post. And that's it for me.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","In other words, is it \u2013 it's currently being offered through all the channels, or there's not like a ramp-up in terms of particularly the Japan Post branches?","Masatoshi Koide - Aflac Japan Co., Ltd.","And as I mentioned, the new product that we've launched in April is already being sold through all our channels.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it.","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","But there is, in all cases \u2013 when we deal these affiliated partners that we have, we don't have the control that we have with our field force. So your question dealing with how excited they are about it is something that we have to work toward getting them to do.","But we do expect it to pick up in the second half of the year. Not so much the second quarter, because it still \u2013 they have actually put it out to the people, but when you're dealing with associates that have sold another way or another product, it just takes a little time. So from that standpoint, I don't want you to think that all of a sudden it's just going to take off. It'll be more the second half than the first half.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then, I guess for Fred, in terms of how we account for the new sales, to the extent that you sell to an existing customer, let's say an existing customer upgrades the product, what get reflected in the new annualized premium? Is it just sort of the incremental premium? Or is it the full sale, and then there's maybe an offset in the persistency?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","It depends on the nature of it. If there's just an existing client that simply enhances their current cancer product, it ends up just being incremental AP and the associated earned premium. If there's a situation where there has been essentially a replacement of the policy, in other words, a lapsation of the policy and replacing it with a brand new whole policy \u2013 sometimes characterized as a conditional surrender \u2013 then that gets counted as a new sale. But it really depends on the situation.","And I believe we've designed the product, the new cancer product, to encourage more of that upgrading of your existing policy, because that, ultimately, we think plays better over long-term economic value.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMC (sic) (JPMorgan Securities LLC) You may now ask your question.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. So I had a question on Japan sales. And I understand the weakness in cancer was sort of expected, given the product that you launched in April. What was surprising was the weak sales in the medical product. And I think even if you look at it on an absolute basis, they were the lowest that they've been in the past several years. So just comments on what drove that, whether it's competition-related or it's just that's the product that you launched last year sort of needs to be refreshed again?","Masatoshi Koide - Aflac Japan Co., Ltd.","[foreign language] Again, this is Koide from Japan. [foreign language] We had a tough first quarter this year in 2018 because we had a very large sales last year in the first quarter in 2017, because we launched a new medical product. [foreign language] And then in the first quarter 2016, we launched a sub-standard medical product. [foreign language] And so even comparing against the first quarter 2016, we had a tough comparison in the first quarter 2018. [foreign language] That's it for me.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just on \u2013 and I was more referring, not to the growth as opposed to just the absolute level of the sales, but I guess I could take it offline. On the U.S. business, the sales were weak, but it doesn't seem like there was much of an impact on your business, because of all the publicity and the negative articles and press earlier this year. Is that your view as well, or have you seen impact, whether on sales, or recruiting, or a persistency of the business?","Teresa L. White - Aflac, Inc.","Jimmy, this is Teresa and I think \"no\" is the answer. We have not seen any impact at this point. Our sales for the first quarter met \u2013 they were in line with our expectations, so again, as Dan said, our full year remains the same, the full year plan.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi, thank you. I had a question for Fred on the 2Q guidance, the midpoint of which seems to suggest a lower level than I would've thought, especially given the results of this quarter. Is this just being conservative in terms of assuming higher claims and normalization in margins? Or are there other moving pieces in terms of expenses or seasonal items that we should be thinking about?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Well, what I would say is in my closing remarks, I noted that we're off to a strong start relative to our currency-neutral EPS range. And we're also off to, obviously, a very strong start to pre-tax margins, both in Japan and in the U.S. Our guidance for example for Japan, pre-tax margins, is 19% to 21%, and we're right just a tick above 21%, the high end. And of course in the U.S., we're actually traveling above our pre-tax margin guidance of 18% to 20%, coming in at 21%.","When you look at Japan, what I would expect is that the expense ratio will start to catch up more to the midpoint of our estimate, more in that 20% range, as we go through the year. As I mentioned, we have a little bit of a delay, if you will, in some of the spend because of the promotional spend being more aligned with our cancer product launch.","Benefit ratios came in at the strong end of the range at 70.3% in Japan. And there is some mix dynamic in that, first sector and third sector, but we continue to see strong trends and results, particularly in the cancer block of business in Japan, and that seems to be contributing to pushing us to the low end of the range. And could that continue? Yes, it could continue, of course. But benefit ratios can be volatile. And it's early in the year.","On the U.S. side, obviously we're seeing a tick up in the expense ratio, which you would expect because we're proactively investing in the platform. You noted I mentioned incremental investment in the U.S., which will push us up towards the 35.5% to 36% range as we go through the rest of the year, so the upper end of that expense ratio range, but we continue to enjoy extremely strong benefit ratios. There is some volatility that does come into play in any particular quarter in the benefit ratio.","But still underpinning that ratio, in terms of being at the low end of the range, for example, is good solid trends in that performance. We did see a little bit of volatility in our cancer block in the U.S. We had lapsation among older age cancer policies where you would have a disproportionate release of reserves. We estimate that that may have contributed something in the neighborhood of 50 basis points or so to the positive results.","It's very \u2013 from our standpoint, we would not naturally expect that type of dynamic to persist as we go through the year, but that certainly helped out the quarter. But still, even after adjusting for that, it's a very, very strong start.","So it's too early in the year for us to be adjusting a guidance across the board, that wouldn't be prudent. But as I said, we're off to a strong start on margins and EPS.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Thank you, that's helpful. And then, given your increased exposure to floating rate securities, can you talk about the sensitivity of your investment income to changes in LIBOR? And should we expect any material benefit from higher rates, or will it largely be offset by higher hedging costs?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","We have Eric on the phone from New York to talk about that. But that is where the growth in the U.S. portfolio is coming from, on the floating rate side, and then even though you are then exposed to any sort of new hedge instruments, it will tend to be aligned with higher yields as LIBOR rates rise.","And you might note that we're 80% \u2013 we've talked about being 80% locked in in our hedge costs for 2018. The 20% that remains exposed has a lot to do with the build of the floating rate, and the natural roll of floating rate instruments. So yeah, you experience higher hedge costs when you do that, but it's offset, we believe, by higher LIBOR yields, and we're actually seeing that.","Eric, I might invite you into the conversation. The other thing I would say is, earlier on in the Q&A, Humphrey Lee asked some questions surrounding our U.S. dollar portfolio size and hedge ratio. And Eric, I would just invite you that if you want to comment on this, and then any comments on that portfolio, please feel free to do.","Eric M. Kirsch - Aflac, Inc.","Sure thing. Thank you, Fred. And Erik, that's an excellent question, because obviously LIBOR's been getting a lot of attention. And Fred has answered it accurately from a conceptual standpoint. Even with the rise in LIBOR, the strategy we set up was designed so that the asset side and the liability side would sort of be neutralized from any increases or decreases in LIBOR since the income's going up and the hedge costs conceptually go up.","However, I would note LIBOR's gone up more than expected this year, and actually we'll get a net benefit from that, and that's primarily because generally speaking on the floating rate assets, which are one-month or three-month LIBOR, we generally want to match the hedges. But going into the year, we did do a tactical move where we, what we call termed out our floating-rate hedges by buying nine- and ten-month hedges, because we did have a belief, which I don't think anybody would argue with, that hedge costs and LIBOR were going to increase during the year.","So in essence, for the majority, not all, of our floating rate assets, we locked in 2018 hedge costs back in November and December. So even though LIBOR is higher today than the forward curves would've suggested, our hedge costs will be minimally impacted by that. On the other hand, our floating rate assets, which we also projected in our income projection to go up, because LIBOR is higher than we all expected, the income side will get a little bit of a kick, if you will, and get an income benefit.","So that's a tactical adjustment on the hedging strategy which we believe is within the confines of our overall strategy, which we may do from time to time. But even if we hadn't done that, while our hedge costs might have inched up, again, as I just said, the income went up anyway, so the net would've been neutral to perhaps slightly positive on a net income basis. And that's part of the beauty and the design of that strategy.","Relative to the earlier comments from Humphrey, Humphrey, you were ticking off the correct numbers from our FAB supplement, but just when we're looking at the dollar program, we are looking at it in Japan terms, if you will, since it sits on the Japan balance sheet. So you're looking at converted numbers at the current exchange rate. But a bit more accurate, the dollar program is at about $25 billion and the hedge ratio is at about 40% on an economic basis at March 31.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from John Barnidge of Sandler O'Neill. You may now ask your question.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you. My question is about U.S. sales. Short-term disability sales have now declined for two consecutive quarters for the first time since the beginning of 2014. Can you talk about the decline there, and maybe what's causing that and expectations for the sale of that product going forward?","Teresa L. White - Aflac, Inc.","So this is Teresa. I'll just start out by saying in 2017 we had increases in short-term disability sales, specifically because of an enhancement that we made to that product, that individual product. So you're seeing the benefit of that in 2017. But then what you're seeing in 2018 first quarter is you're seeing a stronger broker sale, which really is muting some of the sales that you're seeing on short-term disability. So we don't see any major concerns with short-term disability, but I'll switch it over to Rich, who might have additional comments that he might want to make.","Richard L. Williams Jr. - Aflac, Inc.","Yeah. And, Teresa, first of all, I agree, and you mentioned 2017 compared to 2018. I would also note that as our broker sales continue to increase, as Dan mentioned in his comments, we're seeing significant acceleration in group product sales. So it's a little bit of just the broker firm (47:58) sales driving more group product sales, having a little bit of effect, but the absolute dollar amount of individual STD sales, very much in line with prior periods.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Then my follow-up is also on the U.S. One Day Pay is clearly a great value-add for your U.S. products. Do you have any ability to maybe quantify by how many basis points this has led to an improvement in the benefit ratio since it was introduced? Because the quicker you close claims, the less the claim probably is over the long run? Thank you.","Teresa L. White - Aflac, Inc.","I'll say this. One Day Pay, do I have something that quantifies that? It's more anecdotal, in that what we're hearing from our sales force, what we hear from surveys, from our consumers, our policy holders, is that One Day Pay is a differentiator for Aflac. So I don't have any quantitative, except for research that we've done that has been third-party research.","Richard L. Williams Jr. - Aflac, Inc.","And we don't really see any material differences in what I would call the profit patterns and behavior of a One Day Pay scenario and any non-qualified One Day Pay claims process. So we're not seeing anything relevant to those margins. It's really what Teresa is saying. It's about penetration and customer experience.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Great. Thank you for your answers.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from John Nadel of UBS. You may now ask your question.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Hi. Excuse me. Good morning, everybody. Fred, just a follow-up question on the investment spending in the U.S. I think it's expected to be about $250 million over the next three to five years. I think you mentioned \u2013 you mentioned an additional $0.03 of spend for the remainder of this year. Is that \u2013 should we be correlating that to this year's portion of the $250 million?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","It's not going to work that elegantly. And what I mean by that is, when we talk about our U.S. platform, realize that you're talking about not just U.S. the segment in insurance, but also corporate-related activities, such as our efforts to build out our venture investments and digital initiatives. Much of that investment actually takes place at the Corporate and Other, at the holding company level, and not necessarily down in the insurance company. And so you have to sort of be mindful of that. It's really about jump-starting and driving and accelerating growth in the U.S. overall.","What I would say in terms of characterizing the spend, though, is a couple things. One is, a lot of what we're talking about here is an acceleration of investment, and not just some sort of new run-rate level of spend. Tax reform gives us an opportunity to deploy cash flow in a way to accelerate our efforts, which we think is beneficial.","And some of the areas of that $0.03 a share that I mentioned, for example, include things like training and development, which \u2013 training and development I know doesn't necessarily give you specifics, but one of the orientation around this is really helping a workforce essentially get, embrace change management and move towards a more automated environment, which is very, very critical in the workforce today. As we look to do automation, we need a workforce that really is able to fold into that new automation.","We're also spending money to jump-start the productivity of our organic distribution model in the U.S., while at the same time investing in technology that we think will develop expanded distribution opportunity, and so we've pinpointed some of those investments and accelerated it into the current period. And then Teresa's talked about technology roadmap. We've got a long-term roadmap of improving and building out our technology, or modernizing our technology. And we've gone into that roadmap and specifically plucked out areas of it that drive growth to accelerate that spend.","So the screen we've put on the $250 million is a real simple screen. Dan and I have talked about this, and we have one major gating issue, and that is, we want all of that spend to be hardwired towards growth. That's the reason we're accelerating the spend, and that involves all categories of investing in our people, investing in distribution, investing in technology, but it better be hardwired to a growth initiative in order to green-light the spend. So that's the way I would characterize the investment.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Okay. That's very helpful. And then I guess my second question is about sort of the distribution side in the U.S., and I think you guys have characterized, particularly last year, a four-pronged approach, sort of veteran agent productivity, conversion rate of new agents to veterans, and a couple of other components. I guess Teresa, the question for you is, as you look at those four contributing factors, and I think each one of them was a positive contributor \u2013 the sales growth in 2017, early in 2018, how do you feel about those four items?","Teresa L. White - Aflac, Inc.","I'm going to pitch that to Rich and allow him to speak a little bit on that topic.","Richard L. Williams Jr. - Aflac, Inc.","Thank you, Teresa. I think the answer is pretty much consistent. First of all, each of those four areas that you mentioned, we continue to see favorable progress and we're executing there. And, as Dan mentioned early on, our results for the first quarter were in line with expectations, and we plan to see continued acceleration throughout the rest of the year.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. I had a couple questions on Japan. The first is, I think it was mentioned that some of the new sales were related to, I guess, replacements of sort of older policies. And just in light of the comments that suggested that third-sector benefit ratios this quarter benefited in particular from older policies, can you help us think about how quickly some of those older policies are rolling off, if sort of that new sales trend would accelerate that at all, and what the implications could be for sort of the trends for benefit ratios?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","Cancer business in general, in fact all of our business in Japan, has very high persistency. And so that tends to be fairly consistent. Realize, by the way, that cancer in Japan is age-banded, so it's not just sort of automatically the case that if you have an old cancer product, you just upgrade, because of course you are presumably much older and you're going to be priced differently. And so it's got to take a very unique dynamic for that to be somehow attractive to you as a consumer, and have the right value proposition.","Really what we're seeing in cancer, quite candidly, is a continuation of what we've been seeing for a while, and that is a lot more outpatient treatment, which means a lot less days in the hospital. So outpatient trends. We're seeing continued advancements in cancer treatment really play two roles. One is, it requires us to upgrade our cancer product periodically, so as mentioned earlier, some of the major reasons you upgrade a cancer product every three to four years is because of the technology and treatment advancements and now being able to cover those treatments for the consumer.","But those same advancements in early detection and treatment are also working to calm down the claims pace activity, particularly on older blocks. So we're just simply seeing a continuation of what we've been experiencing, and it's obviously helping out our results.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.","Any questions from anybody from Japan?","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So yeah, I had one more question. Just on the WAYS product and the selection customers are making, I mean I noticed a little bit of shift in policyholder benefits, sort of from incurred claims \u2013 or to incurred claims from increase in policyholder benefits. Could you just talk about like the trends in the selections the customers are making, and any impact that that would have on either FSA earnings or just benefit ratios in the segment?","Frederick John Crawford - Aflac, Inc.","We have Todd on the phone and, Todd, you may want to answer that question. I think you've got a couple different questions embedded in there. Do you want to give a shot at it?","J. Todd Daniels - Aflac, Inc.","Yeah, I'll go ahead, Fred. I think what you're seeing with the WAYS product is two different buckets of money, I'll call it. So you've got your policyholder reserve that's being released when policyholders actually take their cash surrender value, and we're seeing that pretty consistently when these policies become paid-up. And you also have an annuity settlement option that has the same effect of reducing your NBR and moving the reserve, I'll call it, up to an incurred claims line. And every time we pay an annuity payment, a claim is paid out of that reserve. So that's the geography.","The overall impact of the benefit ratio on a GAAP basis is negligible, because the money is staying in the system. It's still in the benefits line, and overall. From an SSA perspective, it's a similar dynamic. You don't see an impact of those products going straight to the bottom line when they lapse.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac, Investor and Rating Agency Relations. You may begin.","Robin Wilkey","Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me this morning from the US is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac US; and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. From Tokyo, also joining us today is Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although, we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate, because they're prospective in nature. Actual results to differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact those results.","Now, I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter as well as our operations in both the US and Japan. Dan?","Dan Paul Amos","Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. I am extremely pleased that sales of the third-quarter products were up a whopping 25.2% for the second quarter and 23.3% year-to-date. In addition to continued strong sales of our cancer insurance, the new medical product we introduced last month has proven to be very attractive and what has become a very competitive market.","From a distribution standpoint, Aflac Japan generated positive sales growth from all of our sales channels, which lets us know we are focused in the right direction. Our goal is to have a presence where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions, and these results reflect our success in broadening our reach and our sales opportunities.","Keep in mind that Aflac Japan's fourth quarter sales of third sector products were up 28.5%, thus making this year's fourth quarter a tough comparison. Given strong third sector sales growth in the first half of the year and the positive reception to the enhanced medical product, we now anticipate that sales of third sector products will increase between 7% to 10% for the full year. This is much stronger than our original expectation and impressive given that are already leading market share position in the third sector products.","Now let me turn to our US operations. I'm encouraged that the second-quarter sales improved over the first quarter results. I believe that the changes we've made to our management infrastructure last year are setting the stage for bigger and better sales opportunities. Additionally, one day pay has generated a lot of excitement with our distribution channels, accounts, and policyholders. Through the industry-leading claims initiative, we are able to process, approve, and pay eligible claims in just one day. This allows us to deliver on our promise to our policyholders even more meaningfully by getting cash in their hands faster than ever.","We continue to estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use One Day Pay for their claims. In 2015, we expect to process nearly 2 million claims within the parameters of this initiative. Along with our strong brand and relevant products, I believe One Day Pay will continue to underscore the value of Aflac's products and ultimately help Aflac sales long-term.","At the same time, 2015 continues to be a year of building an Aflac Group. We are making progress with advancing our relationships and our potential business opportunities through insurance brokers and larger case market.","As our production through broker and larger employers grows, we anticipate that sales will be driven progressively toward the fourth quarter, which will magnify the seasonal pattern of our sales to a certain extent. We continue to concentrate our efforts on increasing Aflac U.S. sales 3% to 7% for the year.","Having covered operations, let me turn to a topic I know is top of mind with the shareholders, and that's capital deployment. We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders.","We continue to believe our capital strength puts us in an excellent position to repatriate approximately JPY200 billion to United States for the calendar year 2015, which continues to reinforce our plan to repurchase $1.3 billion of the common stock in 2015 and places us in a good position for the next year as well.","As I've said at the financial analyst briefing in May, we believe that over the next few years, all else equal, we'll have opportunities to increase the capital available for deployment. Let me reiterate that our strong bias is the first to continue with our strong record of dividend growth; followed by repurchasing of our stock; and third, disciplined investment in organic growth initiatives.","With the first half of the year complete, I'm pleased with the company's results. We have upwardly revised our target for 2015 operating earnings per diluted share to now be in the range of 4% to 7% on a currency neutral basis. Historically, the majority of the expenses have skewed more toward the end of the year.","However, we have expedited some of the spending in the first half of the year and now believe expenses should lessen in the latter part of the year. Of note, some of the expense acceleration is driving strong growth rates, and we are experiencing in Japan and expect to experience in the United States. As always, we are working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objective while also delivering on our promise to our policyholders.","Now, let me turn to a topic I know you're eager to hear about. As most of you know, Fred Crawford has joined the Aflac team at the end of June as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At our analyst meeting in May, I shared how important it was that we bring in someone who not only has a new perspective but who as a leader also enriches our corporate culture. Ultimately, the corporate culture of our organization is a very important factor of leadership, because it helps define the company's common goals, objectives, and standard of behavior that employees have come to count on.","Throughout Fred's three decades of financial leadership experience, he has consistently demonstrated that he possesses the characteristics that we have been looking for and we believe he is the right man for the job.","Let me just say that he is off to a tremendous start at Aflac in terms of overseeing the financial management of the company's operations including global investments. As you know Kriss is continuing his duties as President of the Corporation, in addition he is working closely with Fred as he transitions to Aflac. Fred has also been rolling up his sleeves and I can tell you that he fits right into Aflac. Fred we are glad to have you.","Now Kriss is going to say a few words about the transition followed by Fred who will then turn it back over to Robin. Kriss.","A - Kriss Cloninger","Think Dan. First let me say, I have been both privileged and blessed to have held CFO responsibility at Aflac for the last 23 years. And I look forward to continuing to serve Aflac and all of its stakeholders including the investment community as President of Aflac Incorporated at the pleasure of Dan and the Board.","I've always wanted to transition my CFO duties at a time when Aflac is financially strong. And today, looking at our capital position and our earnings prospects, I certainly believe that to be the case. I'm pleased we were able to upwardly revise our EPS guidance for 2015. We've performed at\/or better than expected for the first six months and our outlook for the full year is more favorable than our original estimates.","Accordingly, I believe Fred is joining us at a good time, and I'm enjoying working with him as he transitions to his new responsibilities. And let me tell you that Dan and I were immediately impressed with Fred during our interview process. We believe his breadth and depth of experience as well as his exposure to the financial challenges that the industry faces gives him a perspective that will significantly benefit Aflac. But equally important to this was Fred's history as an active partner with his previous CEOs. I have complete confidence that Fred will capitalize on those experiences and fully meet our expectations of him as Aflac's next CFO.","So with that build up, let me turn it over to Fred for a few comments.","Frederick Crawford","Thinks Kriss and thank you Dan for the nice comments. Let me start by thanking the entire management team here at Aflac for welcoming me into the Aflac family particularly Dan and Kriss, who have built out a very comprehensive transition plan for me into the new CFO role. It's a real privilege to be here.","Ever since I started with the company nearly a month ago it has been a whirlwind of meetings and activities directed toward gaining a deep understanding of the operations, our strategy, key initiatives and of course the key financial drivers. I've had an opportunity to spend a productive week in Japan. I also attended a sales force meeting in the U.S. and countless briefing sessions at various -- with various areas of the organization, especially on matters related to driving growth, valuation and efficient capital management.","It's clear to me that here at Aflac, we have a very high caliber level of people who are dedicated, compassionate and who generally love what they do. I've joined the company at a particular good time as a strategic planning process is underway and the 2016 financial planning process begins. I will understandably play a more limited role on this call, but as I immersed myself in operations, investments and the financial details I look for to sharing my perspectives with you in the future periods.","I can assure you that under Dan and Kriss' leadership the team is laser focus on driving growth, effectively deploying and delivering capital back to our shareholders and leveraging our platform here in the U.S. and Japan. So with that I'm very excited to be here and I look forward to more opportunities to interact with all of you.","And I will hand it back to Robin. Robin?","Robin Wilkey","Thank you, Fred and welcome. I would like to go over some second quarter numbers this morning, starting first with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the currency impact for the quarter, the Yen weakened against the Dollar 15.7%. In reference to topline in the interims, revenue as reported were flat for the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Yen revenues declined 1.4%.","In terms of the quarterly operating ratios benefits to total revenue declined slightly compared to last year going from 60.6 to 60.5 in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of the weaker Yen, the benefit ratio for the quarter would have been 61.3%. Reinsurance had 110 basis points positive impact on the benefit ratio in the quarter.","The expense ratio in the quarter increased to 18.4% from 17.7%. Expenses were in large part due to write-off -- software development costs related to modernization activity, planned increased spending associated with upgrading of our system software in Japan and also promotional expenditures for our new medical product.","The pre-tax profit margin declined slightly during the quarter going from 21.7 to 20.1. Excluding the impact of the Yen, the pre-tax profit margin for the quarter would have been 20.1%. With the retraction of the margin pre-tax earnings declined 3.1% in the Yen terms. Excluding the Yen pre-tax earnings would have been 8.9% -- would've declined 8.9%.","Now, let me turn to Aflac U.S. where total revenues rose 1.9% for the quarter. And looking at the operating ratios, the benefit ratio was 47.7% compared to 48.1%. The primary reason for this improvement was the continued favorable claims experience. The operating expense ratio increased going from 31.6 to 32.8. This increase is a result of increased spending on the U.S. sales strategy as we've discussed before and is in line with our expectation.","Now looking at some of the other items, non-insurance expense at the corporate level were 38 million compared to 51 million a year ago. This decline reflects the impact of the extinguishment of the debt executed last quarter. Parent company and other expenses were 20 million compared to 19 million in the second quarter 2014. On a operating basis the corporate tax rate was 34.6 compared to 34.5 last year.","As reported, operating earnings per diluted share before the Yen impact were 164 compared to 166 a year ago. The weaker Yen decreased operating earnings by $0.14 per diluted share for the quarter.","Lastly, let me comment and reiterate some of the statements Dan made. We have upwardly revised the target obviously for 2015 and now expect operating earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 4% to 7%. For the third quarter, if the Yen averages 1.22 to 1.25, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of 140 to 153 per diluted share. Using the same currency assumptions for the full year, we would expect to report EPS similar in the range of $5.88 or $6.17 per diluted share.","Before we take your questions, I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on a change to the timing of our earnings guidance practice. After careful consideration, we concluded the best practice would be to provide earning guidance in December for the following year in the form of a dedicated outlook call. We believe this process better aligns us with the natural timeline of our financial planning process.","Additionally, this practice also puts us more in line with the guidance disclosure practices of many of our peers. Now, we're ready to take your questions. But, first let me remind you to be fair to everybody, please limit your questions to one initial question and only that's only one follow-up that relates to your initial question. We will now take the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning, everybody. I wanted to focus on third sector products and specifically the new guidance. Is the new guidance for the full year 2015 reflecting any changes to your fourth-quarter expectations or is it mostly driven by the first-half results and maybe expectations of stronger sales in the third quarter?","Paul Amos","This is Paul. Let me say that certainly our first through third quarter's -- first two and performance third expected are running ahead of our expectations, and so that is a considerable portion of the 7 to 10 target. That said, we do believe that we've improved modestly our fourth-quarter outlook. Again, we've only had a very short period of time in terms of seeing the medical sales of the new product that's just been launched. And so, I think I will have a better view on how the fourth quarter is going to be as we get to the third quarter call, but I'm extremely optimistic about what's happening as Dan said in his opening remarks. We\u2019re up across all channels, and 7 to 10 increase in third sector reflects a much improved number over where we thought we would be coming into 2015.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. And then my follow-up. Also still seen on the third sector product sales, are you seeing any changes in the demographics that are buying the new product compared to what the traditional demographics has been? And also have you seen -- maybe can you offer some detail as to what portion of cancer products sold are coming from Japan Post?","Paul Amos","Yeah. Unfortunately, we cannot disclose or we do not disclose how much of the percentage that's coming from Japan Post. What I can tell you, what I said and what Robin has said is that we're up across all channels and that our cancer growth is not driven solely by Japan Post, but instead by all channels. In terms of the demographics, there\u2019s somewhat similar to what we've seen in the past. We are targeting younger customers by certain product lines, and we've seen some movements because of that. That said in the aggregate, I would not tell you that that move has been significant up to this point.","Yaron Kinar","Great, thank you very much for the answers.","Paul Amos","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamminder Bhullar","Hi. I had a question on U.S. sales and recruiting and the producer account. You\u2019ve made a lot of changes in your sales infrastructure, but we've seen a steady decline in recruiting in the agent count, when do you expect the changes to start lifting recruiting, and do you expect it in the fourth quarter when it's a heavy sales season or would it be more likely in 2016?","Teresa White","This is Teresa. So let me start by talking a little bit about the recruiting number. The recruiting number consists of both broker recruits and career agents. And on the broker side, we\u2019ve purposefully reduced the number of recruits there because our goal is to strengthen and deepen the relationships that we have with our current brokers. We've hired 120 broker sales professionals and our goal is to continue to earn the business of each of those brokerage houses and to help them to grow their business.","Now and many of these are large brokerage houses that we have these relationships with. So we knew that the business would skew towards the latter end of the year. And we knew that we needed to start working on deepening relationships with these brokers. So, I feel good about that, but that means that recruiting number will not be driven upward as steeply and the decline that you see in that recruited number is driven primarily by the broker recruits.","Now from the career perspective, we will continue to work at increasing the number of career recruits. Our goal there was to initially increase the number of district sales coordinators, because in our field force, those are the field hierarchy of coordinators who actually train those new recruits. And we have increased the number of districts by 16%. And so, we are now seeing an increase in recruits as well. For the second quarter, it's around 3%, 2.6% is what we are seeing increase in recruits.","So we have strategy certainly to continue to increase recruiting, but our philosophy has changed somewhat on the broker side. We do know that lower recruitment does not mean lower sales at this point in time because the broker business is growing and we are pleased with that.","Jamminder Bhullar","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Dally","Great, thanks and good morning. So my question is for Fred, first congrats on your new position. One of the key questions we get is how will the financial management of Aflac change, if at all, with you taking over as CFO, so I know it's early but any priorities that you have which are perhaps a little different to where Aflac was previously focused?","Frederick Crawford","I think you should expect no -- certainly no sharp changes right or left from me. One, job one is really focused on understanding Aflac's operations and strategy. My approach has always been the same at the companies I've worked at. My ability to be effective in understanding the financials and particularly also capital development is everything about understanding the operations. So where I've been spending most of my time is just getting a feel for the platform both here in the U.S. and Japan.","I'm very privileged in taking over for one of the most respected CFOs in the industry who has spent a lot of time and years developing great people around him and great practices. I fully expected I would arrive here and find a very solid financial operations and management and that's exactly what I found. So really where my focus is going to be is really more contributing to really Aflac's focus on driving growth and taking the company to like the next level.","I think my observations of Aflac is that the good news is that we're dominant in the markets that we serve. But at the same time that raises the stakes on driving future growth. And we've got a lot of initiatives underway doing that and that's where my focus is going to be is understanding that and helping to interpret those strategies to how it matters to our financials and how it\u2019s expected the flow-through. So, that's where I'm expecting to spend the lot of time. But in terms of the core practices of the company, they are very solid, they are very familiar, and I like what I see.","Nigel Dally","Great. Thank you.","Eric Kirsch","And I like to comment as a CEO. Chris and Fred thought processes are much the same. They are very thought provoking in their approach to everything that they do and the mutual respect that the two of them have for each other, I have seen over the last month, is only going to make our company stronger. And I told Fred not to get the big hit, but that he was exceeding our expectations and he certainly has been in all the eyes of the people that have worked with him so far.","Nigel Dally","I appreciate the color thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Market. Your line is open.","Randy Binner","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get some update or color on ongoing reinsurance transactions. There was nothing no worthy there in the quarter, so should we still be thinking about those as coming along and enabling that kind of you hitting the higher end of the capital deployment range you give it the FAB meeting in May?","Kriss Cloninger","Randy, Kriss. You're pretty much on target there. At FAB we indicated a range of deployable capital we expected to see over the next three years of somewhere in the neighborhood of 6.3 billion to 7.5 billion, I told you at the low end of the range, I didn't think we'd have to do much in the way of extraordinary capital raises either through reinsurance or other means to achieve that level of capital deployment.","Perhaps some modest level of reinsurance to get to the 7.5, we might have to do some other things. We've got our year to the ground and the reinsurance market overall as you know we're pursuing ways to achieve cost effective, cost efficient ways to reduce sterile capital particularly in the Aflac Japan operation, we think we did that through our last transaction. That exceeded a significant block of business in Japan, but allowed us to recover our retrocession from the reinsure of 90% of the block to minimize the cost of that block. And still achieve a significant reserve release in Japan.","We \u2013 we're talking with the reinsurance community about additional follow on opportunities of that nature. We don't have anything in the works at the moment. Nothing to announce. But it's part of our planning process and we're continuing to flesh out the planning around sources and uses of capital. And Fred and I have been having significant discussions along with Ken Janke in our planning for the future there. But nothing in the pipeline at the moment, nothing that you ought to expect here about in the near-term.","Randy Binner","I guess, the follow-up would be given the amount of capital in the reinsurance area in general and kind of the trajectory of the deals you've done which have gotten kind of each one has been better of the three major ones, is that still the direction of the conversations you have with the reinsurers that the terms and conditions and circumstances continue to improve, is that a fair way to think of it?","Kriss Cloninger","That's our objective, yes. And we continue to explore the market to achieve that objective.","Randy Binner","Thanks. Thanks a lot. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Erik Bass of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. Dan in your comments you had mentioned for the priorities for capital return. You said dividends, buyback from organic growth. You discuss how you're thinking about M&A a new level of interest in doing something particularly in the U.S.?","Dan Paul Amos","I think that the price of insurance companies are through the roof. And I can't possibly see in anything making any sense at this particular time. The thing I could see are small things that would ultimately enhance our internal growth. But like a CAIC type that makes us broader in our perspective.","So in terms of capital it wouldn't even be a blip on the screen. It wouldn't even require a release it would be so small the things we're looking at. So right now is not the time. What we need to do is concentrate on what ultimately enhances shareholder value and that's growing our business internally and then doing share repurchase if that makes sense. And then also increasing the dividends. So I am staying in that area.","Erik Bass","Thank you. That's helpful color. Just one more on the M&A theme. I guess as you're seeing more domestic Japanese companies look abroad for growth and do foreign M&A. Is there any change in their competitor behavior focus on the local market in Japan?","Kriss Cloninger","I'll let Paul take that.","Dan Paul Amos","We closely follow all the Japanese domestics. We see certainly sometimes different behavior between those that are mutual companies and those that are stock companies. But in general, they are following their overall strategic long-term plans allocating certain percentages of revenue they like to see outside of Japan. But we don't believe in any way that's fundamentally changing the domestic marketplace.","We do however believe that our continued focus on Japan and the efforts that we're making there are allowing us to continue to execute better and better and I think that's evident in this quarter's numbers. As we continue to keep our focus right in Japan and what we think the Japanese consumer needs.","Erik Bass","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks, good morning. First, can you talk about the key factors that led to your upward revision in 2015 EPS guidance?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes, Ryan, I will cover that. Basically, we got the first six months under our belt, things came in as I said at or somewhat better than planned in most particular areas. I always like to say we've got a lot of moving parts in this organization and I have to expect some good variances from plan and some that are maybe not quite as favorable.","But net-net, things that moved from plan netted out to be on track. I will say that we had frontloaded expenses both in Japan and the U.S. this year relative to where they were in the prior-year at least on a comparative basis.","In the U.S. it was all continuing build-out of the change in the sales management model and alike in Japan we had planned to do some additional work in our IT areas in terms of building out some of the systems we are working on and the like. Of course, we ended up with that relatively modest write-down of some of the software developer costs we had previously incurred.","I'll tell you there are a lot of moving parts on that software development cost thing. We are going to get a credit from the vendor that participated in doing that software development that'll benefit us in subsequent periods. Credit somewhere between at least half of the amount of the write-down and we have some optionality in terms of when to take advantage of those credits.","But all of that being said, we had a good solid first six months. We think will be on plan or better for Japan and U.S. benefits in the second six months. We are ahead of plan to some extent in net investment income. And, of course, we did that bond transaction to take out the 8% notes that we had outstanding. Took them out and the combination of first and second quarter eliminated $850 million of bonds they carried an 8% coupon replace them with about $1 billion of debt. They carried much lower net effective coupon rates and that's going to save us about $0.07 per share a little bit over 1% increase in EPS during the period.","So all of those things as netted together, I mean the increase in guidance wasn't huge, but it was an upper revision to indicate that we had a good plan for the year and we have confidence we are going to make it during the second part of the year. Good sales help that too.","So that is about it from my perspective. I don't know Dan if you want to add anything to that. But that is the financial story I will let you follow-up if you want to.","Frederick Crawford","You know, I think he got it.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks Kriss. And then -- and my follow-up is just on the Japan new money rate, it increased meaningfully to 3.76% in the quarter. Can you talk about what drove that and how meaningful were the cash flows that were invested at that rate?","Kriss Cloninger","Sure, absolutely. A big driver of that was as you recollect I talked about earlier in the year that most of our cash flows were back ended in the second half of the year. And one large portion of those cash flows was again you recollect we had the flash crash of October 15 last year. We sold about $1.2 billion of treasury, but we opted to put that into yen or JGBs because we didn't like the dollar opportunity at the time. We planned to bring that back to dollars during 2015, but we wanted to be opportunistic so not knowing exactly when that would be that was planned for July 1.","As you know during the second quarter tenure started at about 190 or 180 or so, ended the quarter around 240. And in early June hit around 245, 250. We opted to take about two-thirds of that money and allocated in June mostly to some investment grade corporate bonds and a little bit of high yield. So we were opportunistic in terms of the timing planned for, but we did a little earlier than we originally put in the budget of July. So that was the big driver of that new money yield.","And as I had said last quarter we expected over the year this would iron out the first quarter was just because we focused primarily with the small amount we had on JGBs, but we'd always planned on having a larger dollar allocation. So, I hope that helps.","Ryan Krueger","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Steven Schwartz","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Just a couple of follow-ups on previous questions. Teresa, just so I'm clear here, the recruited agent number, the brokers, these are like account managers that you're including in these numbers? Some guy working at Aon [ph] ?","Teresa White","The recruited numbers are all recruits. So, broker recruits as well as career recruits. So if an Aon example may have producers that are recruits as well, so anyone with a license, and it depends on the state, but anyone with a license, they are counted in this recruited number.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. Could you tell us what weekly average producers or monthly average producers, what those comps would look like with regards to just the traditional career agency force?","Kriss Cloninger","The numbers that you see actually in the FAB Sup, I would say, primarily are the sales force, the career force. One of the things that I've spoken with Robin about is, as we skew more towards broker business that we need to re-look at how we present this information in the FAB Sup. And the reason I'm saying that is, the numbers that are represented here are primarily our sales, our careers sales organization numbers. So the weekly \u2013 average weekly producers, average monthly producers, and then we had brokers that were contracted as associates.","But as we have executed on our new broker strategy now we've started looking at brokers as a single entity in our system, but they are not well represented here. So the field force is still very, very important to us and we're continuing to work with them on the less than 100 \u2013 100 or less accounts. But I don't think that I'm fairly representing the broker community on the FAB Sup and we plan to change that.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. And then a follow-up for Eric. Eric if I get to the previous answer, right, basically the point is that it wasn't really new cash flows. This was from premiums or whatever, from the company. This is just selling JGBs and trading those into dollars.","Eric Kirsch","Primarily. There is a little bit of new cash flow. So when I speak of new money, it's an accumulation from operations, maturities, calls, the interest, coupons, things of that nature. But the percentage breakdown is primarily from the JGBs coming back to dollars.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. Any sense of what we should be thinking about for the rest of the year for new money yield?","Eric Kirsch","We have a number of things in the pipeline. It will be somewhere, I would say, between where we are now and much higher than 2%.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. Thank you.","Eric Kirsch","You're welcome","Operator","The next question is from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Hi. Good morning, everybody and Dan I think I can probably speak for most of your shareholders when I say I'm really excited to hear that you believe 18 times forward earnings is a too high a price to pay for insurance company acquisitions.","Dan Paul Amos","Let me say that's from our standpoint. I can't speak what other people would, but from our standpoint we can't make it work.","But it'd be a good evaluation for Aflac.","John Nadel","All right. Well, yes, it certainly would.","Dan Paul Amos","We have to [indiscernible].","John Nadel","The question I have for you is where did -- if you could just level set us on where the parent company cash position ended the quarter and how much of that \u00a5200 billion that you have planned to repatriate for the full year how much of that was taken through the first half of the year?","Dan Paul Amos","Let's see I've got some of those numbers here John. Total cash and cash equivalents were right out 1.4 billion, but that was down from almost 2.5 billion at the beginning -- end of the first quarter because we refinanced and paid off those notes of a little over $1 billion during the quarter.","The cash available to shareholders which we count as the amount of cash that we actually got less $500 million minimum balance cash collateral amount and any debt refunding activities we've got, that's closer to 400 million.","And we'll expect that to grow modestly during the third and fourth quarters as we receive additional amounts of repatriation. We actually received \u00a5119 billion in July that wasn't included in that number at the end of the second quarter I gave you. And we got another 50 billion planned or recover or received during the remainder of 2015. Cash position is pretty good.","John Nadel","Absolutely. Thank you.","Dan Paul Amos","Sufficient to support the share repurchase objectives anyway.","John Nadel","Yeah. Understood. And so I guess that sort of begs the question, what are you looking to see in the back half of the year to give you maybe a little bit more confidence to think about that $1.3 million for 2015 being a higher number.","Dan Paul Amos","Well, we think about it being 1.3 that's implicit in the guidance, the revised. We haven't really thought about it being a bigger number at this point. But it's certainly possible depending on how things break that we would consider that if appropriate. But we're not ready to say it's appropriate. We're doing our cash planning our earnings planning et cetera, et cetera, and the updated guidance we gave you which is toward the high end of the original guidance is as far as we going to go right at the moment.","John Nadel","Okay, understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. Just a question about waste sales in Japan. It was up 36% in the quarter to \u00a55.6 billion, if I recall correctly the highest level since late 2013. I understand the product is being repriced and you're using it to maintain relationship. I'm just kind of wondering what is the return on the reprise waste products and what kind of new money yield you need to achieve that return?","Dan Paul Amos","Well, this is Paul. Let me start on first sector broadly. And say that first sector as we promised, we were going to actively manage is down again 11.8% in the quarter and down 21.1% year-to-date.","We did, as a part of our strategy, re-price and redevelop part of the WAYS product, our BR product, really focused on 15-year and longer, first and foremost, to help handle any disintermediation risk; second of all, to target a potentially younger customer and we've already seen in the first quarter a lower average age of issue as a result; and, finally, as we've discussed or I've discussed at FAB as an accommodation to our agency sales force.","Keep in mind, several of our large channels don't even offer first sector generally, whether it's Daido, Dai-Ichi or Japan Post. But through our bank channel, we continue to monitor in cap sales of first sector products. But as our exclusive agencies depend solely on Aflac for their products and they continue to do a great job creating cross-selling between first sector sales and third sector sales, we continue to work with them to develop product that we think can meet our needs as well as meet the needs of growing our third sector sales in Japan.","I'll turn it back over to these guys to talk about the expected profit margin and the overall rate for interest.","Kriss Cloninger","Well, I'll make a brief comment on that. As you know, we've continued to operate in historically low interest rate environment in Japan. That's led us to being cautious and disciplined relative to our sales practices. In today's interest rates, we're looking at mid-single-digit profitability as a percent of premium on the WAYS business produced today, if those low interest rates continue on for the full premium period of the policy.","As Paul mentioned, we extended the premium period for the new version of WAYS from pretty much a 10-year minimum to a 15-year minimum call. That produces over a premium rate in each year we collect a premium, it gives us a longer period of time to yen average or dollar average invested interest rates during the time we receive the cash from the product.","And at today's interest rates, again historic lows, if those persist throughout the premium period of the policy, we expect to come in mid-single digits, which is not really consistent with our company objective. We're optimistic or hopeful that interest rates will improve somewhat over time and will get the benefit of investing some of the future cash flows at somewhat higher interest rates, but that remains to be seen.","All that being and said, we do believe that it's in our corporate interest to maintain the agency relationships with the channel we've developed to continue to promote the cross-sale of third sector products, which we're pretty good at, and just monitor conditions as we continue to accept business. So it's not a rosy picture at current interest rates, but we're trying to just keep the distribution system afloat at this point.","Dan Paul Amos","I see WAYS a little bit like a contest for salespeople. You've got to keep whether we're trying to find a way to enhance sales of the third sector. One way that we're enhancing sales is that they feel like they need this WAYS product or a product to have a broad enough portfolio. And so we give up some on profit margin but whether we had had a sales contest that cost us a lot of money to increase third sector or whether or not we took a little bit lower profit margin on the life insurance product, it still ultimately our objective is not to grow WAYS, our objective is to grow third sector. And the numbers reflect what's going on in Japan that we are in fact growing third sector and growing it dramatically. No one with the profit margin we've got with the market share we've got is expected in a 12 month period to grow over 25% which is what we are growing right now.","Humphrey Lee","This is helpful. Just a quick follow-up on that is, do have any kind of sales cap on the WAYS product through your agency channel?","Dan Paul Amos","We encouraged certain products of first sector products to be sold at lower levels through our agency channel by either not entering the production credit we give them or taking away certain elements of the product related to that channel. Specific to the new WAYS product, we are focused on helping them and allowing them to sell that 15 year and longer because we believe, as Chris pointed out, it has some advantageous elements to the overall sales. But as we've cited, we have to be very careful in taking away products from exclusive provider because they would obviously have the opportunity to become non-exclusive and offer other companies products which would damage our relationship with them should we determine that we were no longer going to offer any first sector products but strictly managing products like child endowment and annuity has been something we have been heavily focused on.","Kriss Cloninger","But Paul's answer is yes and your real question is, what if interest rates go lower. And the answer is, we can control it if we need to.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, got it. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Colin Devine with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Colin Devine","Good morning. [indiscernible] with respect to your comments about Fred, I didn't realize Fred was quite as old given how long he has been around this business.","Frederick Crawford","Getting older every day, Colin.","Colin Devine","These markets can do that to you.","Frederick Crawford","It's not the years, it's the mileage.","Colin Devine","It's the truth. For Dan and Kriss, you know, the growth rate of the premiums and forth has continued to slow in both Japan and the US. And how much of the concern is that to you and I guess by extension is that really reflecting what we're seeing with some of the recruiting challenges and what's it going to take to turn this around?","Dan Paul Amos","Well, of course, the sheer size of Japan is a challenge. I believe that the things that we're doing in the United States, you asked me, so I am going to answer it, Teresa could answer it, but I'm going to answer it is that I still believe the US has enormous potential. I believe some of the things that we're doing specifically last year at this time for the first nine months since we put it in, we are up about 6.7%. That's still doesn't excite me too much. I want to see double digits. But I think we\u2019re doing the right thing in that regard. Our specific areas of the country about 40% of them were up prior to these changes. And now about 60% of them are up. So they're moving in the right direction. So I'm hoping that as we see now national healthcare or Obama Care pretty well set, every ruling every everything, the people have far is kind of over now people will lock in and become used to that. It's here to stay and I think that will ultimately broadens our opportunity to grow our business. But we have got to grow new sales. And I make no doubt about that. And so we'll continue to work that way.","Colin Devine","...with respect to Japan too.","Dan Paul Amos","Okay. I'll make a few comments on Japan. Colin I'll say that the financial guys look at increasing profitability more than they look at increasing premiums and force. And some of that today is a discipline. You know we have had input on from the investment community over the last several years 2010, 2011, 2012 we wrote a lot of per sector premiums. In my opinion it had good profit margin. And I'm convinced we added significantly to the value of the enterprise and grew our profits with first sector products. But we got a lot of push back from the investment community saying we don't want you to grow those large premium policies.","Those more investment oriented products. So it wasn't solely that input that cost us to push back but it was partly that input that cost us to push back some in the first sector. And so we've reemphasized our core business third sector products that cover the body instead of being investment oriented or life insurance oriented more. And we're concentrating on growing that and I think redirecting the efforts of our distribution system. The third sector is leading to significant increases in growth.","You know the fact of the matter is you've got a certain persistency or lapse rate that's just associated with the market and you lose a certain amount of business through lapses and your net gross based on how much new production you can have that offsets the lapses and force. And as we get bigger and bigger and bigger in terms of your legacy block the lapses become bigger and more new businesses is required. So we've got a balancing act going on Colin.","But our final focus is on enhancing profitability and value of the company for the shareholders. I don't worry quite as much about the metric of premiums and force as I do profit growth. So I'm going to leave it there and let you push back if you want.","Colin Devine","For sure. You would be disappointed if I didn't. So Kriss if we take that the pre-tax margin seems to pretty much stabled in around 21% but the ROE has continued to significantly drop over the last five or six or seven years. Where do you see the ROE stabilizing out for Aflac Japan?","Kriss Cloninger","Well you say it has significantly dropped for the last few years.","Colin Devine","Back in 2009, 2010 it was off the charts. I think above the 41%.","Kriss Cloninger","Well I don't know, I hadn't...","Colin Devine","Pre-tax...","Kriss Cloninger","41% -- okay. Pre-tax maybe you're right. All I know is we are in the far upper right hand corner of every chart I ever see relative to companies producing ROEs and right now on an operating basis excluding all the unrealized gains and losses and excluding the effect of currency our ROEs are still in excess of 20%.","I think they were like 23.1 or something like that. That was a number. I happen to remember that number because I kind of like those ROEs. That was it for the second quarter on an operating basis.","Darn, one thing we determined when we were interviewing CFO candidates is every person we interviewed told us that one thing that attracted them to talking to us was our profitability metrics and our returned metrics.","Our margin metrics, our ROE metrics, they say gosh, my company sits around and lusts after your metrics. It's really attractive situation. So I'm sensitive to what you're saying about ROE declines and quite frankly, the first sector business if it produces mid to single-digit profit margin that's going to carry a lower ROE and I admit that. But that's not where we want to end up ultimately.","I think will maintain the operating ROEs. Our internal range is to hit somewhere in the 16% to 24% range that's what we get paid on. So that's what we're managing for and quite frankly 20%'s is our target. And if we don't get that we get penalized financially. That's where I'm trying to keep things.","Dan Paul Amos","Colin, I will give you a couple observations from my perspective. First, we always want to try to drive those core valuation metrics nor where we can and if we can, but interestingly enough what I think is also happened over the last several years with Aflac is our cost of equity has come down, as a company is gotten bigger, stronger, stable and not quite honestly, I'm looking across the table at Eric Kirsch.","Eric has grabbed on to the general account and managed the risk more carefully around the exposures that we have. The volatility and prospects of volatility for the company are down considerably and so I think ROE may have trickled down over time but certainly cost of equity has also come down too where we're still generating the kind of value that you would expect. And I would second that Kriss is talking about in part some comments I made when I was first talking with the company.","Kriss Cloninger","All candidates just made them. It was important to us...","Dan Paul Amos","Well, it's true though. But the thing that interesting about that is it goes back to also Dan's comments on M&A. I mean the bar is set extremely high here at Aflac. Because right now when we buy back our stock we are effectively buying back into a high returning company at zero premium.","And that 's a very valuable thing to do. And when we look at deploying excess capital build often wins over by when you're looking at a premium. And really what we are excited about is driving more competition for investing organically in our growth model. And that's a very promising thing when you're driving good returns. So it's \u2013 were in a good position I think all the way around.","Colin Devine","Just to clarify one thing Kriss, you mentioned the 16% to 23% ROE range were you talking pre or post-tax?","Kriss Cloninger","Post.","Colin Devine","Okay clarification is important. Thank you, because we were on pre-tax.","Kriss Cloninger","And net tax income over equity as defined in the financial.","Colin Devine","A feel of that just might of had a heart attack when you were talking pre, so thank you.","Kriss Cloninger","While I don't talk pre-tax. Well I guess profit margins are pre-tax but ROE is always after tax.","Colin Devine","Yes okay. Thank you.","Operator","We have the next question is from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. I guess in a similar line of questioning just wanted to go down the path of earnings growth. And Dan if I think about what's happening with Japan sales right now it seems like things have reflected in a positive way, certainly from a pure number standpoint. And if I go back historically Aflac has had, we'll call it at least a year lag between when sales start to influence earnings. Now I think you have a new wrinkle here though in your model in that you have this first to third sector sales transition which is clouding that connection. So I guess taking all that together, do you think we have -- we may also see an EPS inflection along with this Japan sales growth inflection, or do you think that's still several years out considering this other transition that is occurring?","Dan Paul Amos","Well, let me just say, let's don't forget that life sales were down 11% and you can't breakout just ways because it is all part of it together. So I want to point that out. Kriss said he wants to take it so I'll since this is the last one will let Kriss take it and if you have a follow-up, I will answer.","Kriss Cloninger","Tom all I wanted to do is to point out that a lot of our costs are step costs and major. They don't directly vary with the production of the business. They are very similar between first and third sector of products and certainly some percentage of the costs are in fact very bold, but the way we manage cost particularly with in Aflack, Japan is, I will say, independent of the source of the production etc. etc. are staffing models are built around certain things and we don't have a lot of fluctuation in personnel or staffing levels over say a six month period.","We'll adjust depending on trends and the like, but I can pretty much count on the Aflac Japan management team to come in with their expense plan we established at the beginning of the year.","And one of the ways I disciplined that expense plan is by setting the growth in their general operating expenses generally at about an increased level of about one half the increase in the premium income. That's my objective, that's we'll start out with them. And so that adds some discipline to the process.","It gives them some variability in their premiums. If premiums vary, I let their expense targets vary. But, in general, more of our costs are step in nature and not directly variable. So that tends to lead to some stability of profits regardless of variations and production over a short span of time, which I'd say is six months or so.","Dan Paul Amos","As we end this call I want to say one thing, because Aflac Japan is on the other end. Because you are all analysts and shareholders, I couldn't be prouder of the job that Aflac Japan is doing. I mean, to realize the market share we have, to realize a profit margin we have and to realize the sales increase we have now pulled for the fourth, first and second quarter is just stellar. I hope all of you will take note of that and realize, because I will put them up as bragging rights against anybody.","There's always in a quarter some good and some bad and sometimes you have really bad news. Fortunately we've had very little over our history but sometimes you really have good news and I'm here to say we've got good news about Aflac Japan and what's going on and we are proud of them. So with that we'll turn back to Robin","Robin Wilkey","Thank you and I appreciate everybody participating today. If you have any follow-up questions I will be in the office so please give me a call.

[Operator Instructions]. Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Young, Vice President of Aflac investor and Rating Agency Relations.","David Young","Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter call. This morning we will be hearing remarks from Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated, about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Then, Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated, will follow with more details about our financial results.","In addition, joining us this morning during the Q&A portion are members of our executive management team in the United States, Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; Eric Kirsch, Global Chief Investment Officer; Rich Williams, Chief Distribution officer; Al Riggieri, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary; and Max Broden, Deputy CFO and Treasurer. ","We are also joined by members of our executive management team in Tokyo at Aflac Life Insurance Japan; Charles Lake, Chairman and Representative Director, President of Aflac International; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director; Todd Daniels, Director and CFO; Koji Ariyoshi, Director and Head of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. The earnings release is available on the Investors page of Aflac's website at investor.aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP U.S. GAAP measures.","I'll now hand the call over to Dan.","Daniel Amos","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by saying that the third quarter of 2019 concluded in another strong first nine months of the year for Aflac in terms of earnings, capital generation and overall financial strength. ","Financially, Aflac is as strong as we've ever been in our 64-year history. Pretax margins are stable and as strong as any in the industry. Our capital provision by any measure is robust. Our investments are high quality and diversified and we have among the highest return on capital and the lowest cost of capital in the industry. Our strong earnings results in the first nine months prompted us to upwardly revised our 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share outlook, yet we still face some challenges to the top line. We addressed some of these challenges at the financial analyst briefing last month, and they are some was evident in the third quarter sales results. ","Turning to operations, Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor, generated strong financial results. In the yen terms, results on an adjusted basis were better than expected for the quarter with Japan segment posting strong profit margins. Brad will provide more information. As you know, we take a longer-term perspective when it comes to our business. Our focus at Aflac Japan remains on maintaining our leadership in third sector insurance products that are less interest-rate sensitive and have strong and stable margins. At the same time, we complement this core business with similarly profitable first sector protection products. ","To that end, we will continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduce innovative new products that our policyholders want and need. We are also continuing to fully engage our wide-reaching distribution network. Our traditional agencies have been and remain viable to our success as do our alliance partners. We continue to be Japan's number one provider of cancer and medical insurance, insuring one out of four households. ","As you saw in the quarter, sales for the third sector and first sector protection products were down 21.5%, largely driven by the decline in cancer insurance sales, which were down 37.7% relative to the third quarter of 2018. As we reiterated on September 30, Aflac Japan released the results of a voluntary review of cancer insurance sales through Japan Post. While this matter includes issues related to a 0.006% of policies reviewed, we know that even one issue with a policy is one too many. As such, we continue to work tirelessly and steadfastly to resolve these matters with the customers who were impacted. ","As we communicated at the Financial Analyst Briefing last month, we've experienced a significant decline in applications through the Japan Post channel. Assuming a continuation of the trend to date for the rest of the year, we anticipate that sales in Japan Post channel may decline as much as 50% from a very strong 2018 given our refreshed cancer product. Keep in mind that Japan Post Holding plans to report on its investigation at the end of December. While it is challenging to have full visibility into the time line for recovery, we look forward to working with Japan Post Group to continue our efforts to provide Japan's citizens with peace of mind and financial health Aflac's cancer insurance protection offers.","With respect to Aflac Japan's medical insurance products, we began the year with a strategy to attach riders to the whole life medical product and then refreshed our existing nonstandard medical policies in June of this year. As a result, we are pleased with a 24.5% increase in medical insurance sales relative to the third quarter of 2018, and we expect a positive trend to continue into the fourth quarter. ","Taking factors -- all factors into consideration, we continue to expect full year Aflac Japan third sector and first sector protection sales to be down in the mid-teens with earned premium growth in the range of 1%.","Now turning to the U.S. operations. We are pleased with the financial performance. The pretax profit margin exceeded our expectations both for the quarter and for the first nine months of the year. This is particularly significant because these results continue to reflect ongoing investment in our platform, distribution and customer experience. ","With respect to sales, they too have been somewhat challenged in 2019 coming off a record sales performance in '18. The third quarter was weaker than expected. As a result, we anticipate full year results to be flat to down slightly for the year. Ultimately, we seek to grow profitable earned premium, which we expect to be in the range of 2% in 2019. There are clearly macro elements at play. Strong employment means fewer people are willing take an independent commission sales role. This dynamic continues to constrain both sales agent recruiting and ultimately, sales to some degree. ","Additionally, the review of the partnership in the second quarter resulted in some short-term disruption. But keep in mind, workers continue to convey a significant need for Aflac's benefit solutions in the workplace and we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. Our broker strategies are working well and we are growing at a much better rate than in the industry. We have been encouraged by the advancement in our direct-to-consumer platform and associated partnerships, which are still in the initial stages. Taking all factors into account and to put this in perspective, we expect to recover in 2020, which is important to the overall long-term health of our distribution platform. ","As we said, we remain focused on initiatives designed to drive growth in both the U.S. and in Japan. Our announcement to acquire Argus Dental & Vision is a prime example of build to -- of buy-to-build strategy to do just that. This planned acquisition is also consistent with our approach to balancing our financial strength with reinvesting in our business, increasing the dividend and repurchasing shares. ","Aflac historically has been known for its organic growth. However, we recognize that prudent investment is critical to our growth strategy to driving efficiencies that will impact the bottom line for the long term. ","With this in mind, we look for other opportunities to accelerate growth through measured buy-to-build transactions that enhance our opportunity and core competency in supplemental insurance and leverage our powerful brand and distribution strengths without requiring extensive amounts of capital. At the same time, we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our bondholders, shareholders and policyholders. Of course, it goes without saying that we treasure our record of dividend growth. ","With the fourth quarter's declaration, 2019 will mark the 37th consecutive year of dividend increases. As we move through a period of market volatility, our dividend track record is a nice reminder of the relative stability of our business model and earnings. As we communicated last year, the Board reset the review cycle of the dividend increase for the first quarter of each year and reserves the right to examine the dividend on a quarterly basis. We continued to be on track to repurchase in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion of shares in 2019. This range allows us to be more tactical in our deployment. ","Looking ahead, we believe our strong earnings growth will reflect on the underlying earnings power of our insurance operations in Japan and the U.S. It also reflects on our prudent approach to deploying excess capital in a way that balance the interest of all stakeholders. As always, we are working to achieve our earnings per share objective, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. ","Now I'll turn the program over to Fred, who'll cover the financial results. Fred?","Frederick Crawford","Thank you, Dan. Results for the third quarter set the stage for a strong year on the earnings front. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.16 represents a 12.6% increase over the 2018 quarter. Earnings benefited from continued strong margins both in Japan and the U.S. with the year-to-date core ratios performing consistent with forecast provided at our September Financial Analyst Briefing. Our reported results were impacted by strengthening of the yen as compared to the 2018 period, increasing earnings by $0.02 per share in the quarter. ","There were two notable earnings items in the quarter. We negotiated a partial call on a single legacy private placement that had been previously impaired. Thus, reducing a concentrated below-investment-grade exposure and producing outsized call income of $25 million pretax in the quarter. In addition, our building alternative investment portfolio had another strong quarter, generating approximately $8 million pretax in variable income above our planned expectations. Together, these items contributed roughly $0.03 to the adjusted earnings per share. ","Turning to our Japan segment, earned premium for our first sector protection and third sector products increased 1.2%. We are focused on maintaining growth recognizing near-term weakness in the Japan Post cancer sales and to pay medical policies sold in 2017 reaching paid-up status. We are focused on the quality or value of new business in Japan and continuing to grow third sector and first sector protection earned premium. As Dan noted in his comments, we expect full year third sector and first sector protection earned premium to grow in the range of 1% to 2%. ","Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 70% for the quarter. We continue to enjoy strong third sector benefit ratio trends and associated reserve adjustments. The majority of impact in the quarter can be attributed to a continued shift in business mix from first sector towards third sector, which carries a lower benefit ratio and higher expense ratio. Our expense ratio in Japan was 20.6%. We expect our expense ratio will rise in the fourth quarter with anticipated timing of technology investments and sales and marketing spend. ","Net investment income contributed to our strong results of 4% in yen terms. The quarter's favorable calling come ran through the Japan segment, along with the majority of alternative investment income. The build in our floating rate portfolio over 2018 also has contributed to our results in 2019. Recall from Eric's comments at our Financial Analyst Briefing, we previously locked in approximately 75% of Japan's floating rate income and 91% of our hedge cost for 2019. Overall, in Japan, we reported a very strong pretax profit margin of 21.4% and towards the high end of our forecasted range. ","Turning to U.S. results, earned premium was up 1.3%, reflecting weaker sales results and a modest decrease in persistency. We see reduced persistency as temporary and a result of a large case volatility and replacement of an administrative partner. Both impact persistency in the short run, but are designed to ensure profitable earned premium growth in future periods. ","Our total benefit ratio came in at 49.1% and while at the low end of range, generally consistent with recent claims trends and our mix of business. Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 35.9%. Year-to-date, we are running below the midpoint of our range. However, we expect our fourth quarter expense ratio to come in above the high end of our range due to timing and the pace of investment in the platform. The full year is expected to remain within the range.","Net investment income in the U.S. is running a bit ahead of our plan for the year due to part -- due in part to higher allocation to corporate bonds and variable investment income. We've done a nice job of defending income in the face of lower rate environment and the reduction of excess capital in the U.S. subsidiaries. Overall, in the U.S. segment, we recorded a strong pretax profit margin of 20.6% at the high end of our forecasted range. ","In our Corporate segment, the main driver of improved earnings is higher levels of invested capital and liquidity and amortized hedge income driven by corporate hedging program. Amortized hedge income contributed $21 million on a pretax basis to the quarter's earnings with a notional position of $3.5 billion. ","Turning to capital, Japan's estimated solvency margin ratio remains in the 1000% range. Our estimated U.S. risk-based capital ratio is approximately 660%. We continue to target an RBC ratio of 500% in the U.S. for the year-end 2019. ","We ended the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of capital and liquidity at the holding company. Subsidiary dividends for 2019 are concentrated in the second half of the year, so we are building excess capital above our $2 billion minimum capital and liquidity policy. ","In the quarter, we repurchased 5.9 million shares for approximately $310 million. There is no change to our guidance for repurchase of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion in 2019. In terms of our EPS outlook, as Dan noted, we have revised our 2019 guidance, increasing the range to $4.35 to $4.45 per share. ","Reflecting on the year, this range includes $0.05 a share of notable items that has benefited EPS thus far in 2019. While this solves for a wider range in the fourth quarter, we are assuming investment income normalizes and expenses come in at elevated levels both in the U.S. and in Japan. As we make our way through the planning process and prepare for our 2020 outlook call, I'd like to reiterate some of the key messages from our Financial Analyst Briefing and how they influenced earnings and earnings per share heading into the next year.","In terms of revenue, earned premium faces headwinds in the form of a declining book of Japan first sector savings business, the dynamic of paid-up policies impacted reported earned premium and weakness in third sector sales during the period of recovery in the Japan Post system. In the U.S., we expect sales results in 2019 and into 2020 will be a headwind to earned premium growth in the short run, but expect higher growth rates beyond 2020 as we gain traction in dental and vision and direct-to-consumer. ","In terms of investment income, with derisking activities and the low rate environment, we will be working hard to defend investment income at normalized 2019 levels. We do not think it's a good time to be aggressive in the search for yield. In fact, in some cases, our efforts to de-risk the portfolio provide a bump to current earnings and reduce run rate income, for example, this quarter's outsized call income and reinvestment of proceeds. Core benefit ratios are expected to remain strong and a contributor to margins. However, investment is needed to build -- to both digitize and -- our platform and address revenue growth. Our strategy of buying to build lowers the capital at risk of large-scale acquisitions, while at the same time weighing down on margins as we invest in organic growth. For example, in the U.S., if we are successful in our direct-to-consumer and dental and vision build out, you should expect some margin pressure in the early years followed by measurable earned premium growth. ","Capital generation is expected to remain strong with a building level of excess capital. This affords us the capacity to invest in growth initiatives and opportunistic investments without disrupting our plans to return capital to shareholders. Therefore, absent compelling alternatives, we see 2020 repurchase activities supporting EPS in the face of any margin pressure. In closing, earnings have performed very well throughout 2019 and again, in the third quarter, but we need to actively invest and deliver on growth. We'll spend more time on the 2020 drivers with associated detail during our December outlook call. ","I'll hand the call back now to David to begin our Q&A. David?","David Young","Thank you, Fred. We are now ready to take your questions, but first let me ask that you limit yourself to one initial question and one related follow-up to allow other participants an opportunity to ask a question. We'll now take the first question, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","First question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMC.","Jamminder Bhullar","I had a question on first the Japan Post, then Dan or someone else, maybe if you could comment on your thoughts on whether sale through the Post will return to a more normal level within the next year? Or do you think volumes through the channel are going to be depressed for a lot longer given the negative publicity and potential changes in sales practices at the Post?","Daniel Amos","Well, of course, that's the hard -- difficult question for us to be sure about. My gut tells me that it will go back to the normal production levels because in today's world, new cycles are relatively short compared -- because there's so much news out there today that what used to be important is just doesn't last for as long. My sense is in Japan, it's quiet right now in regard to these issues until the December report comes out. When the December report comes out from Japan Post, there'll then be activity for a period of time and hopefully, they will have addressed all the issues which I expect them to do and then for it to calm down and go back. ","We've seen no changes in persistency at Japan Post level that makes me think that the brand has been hurt in any way. Certainly, we know that people want these answers to their questions resolve in what did take place. But all in all, my sense is that they will go back, but when and how, I'm not exactly sure. I think it's not going to be -- remember that in December, the report will come out, probably the end of December, then you're going to have a little bit of period of time where there'll be discussions about, well, the enactment, all those issues. And so I would think first quarter still may have softness to it and then hopefully, we'll see it kick back up in the second quarter, maybe the second half, and then I'm hoping it will move back to more normal channels for the long term. Anybody from Japan want to comment on that?","Unidentified Company Representative","We do not have any additional comment.","Jamminder Bhullar","Okay. And maybe if I could ask just one more, on your U.S. sales, they've been weaker than expected in the past couple of quarters, but it seems like from your guidance, you're assuming that you'll see a pickup with the broker channel in the fourth quarter. On that channel, do you have enough insight so far, like we're halfway through the quarter already, do you have any enough insight to be confident in your projections? Or do more of the sales actually come in the later part of the year, so you'll have to sort of wait and see?","Richard Williams","As we shared at the Financial Analyst Briefing, we did experience weaker than expected sales in the third quarter, primarily driven by faster decline in average weekly producers, which is really the net effect of decline in recruiting in the first half of 2019. Some positives that we did see, we saw recruiting growth pick back up in the third quarter on top of recruiting growth in the third quarter of '18 and productivity continues to be an area of growth. ","In terms of the fourth quarter and the full year, just as a point of context Dan shared, flat to down slightly for the full year. And what that would mean to get to flat is 3.3% growth in the fourth quarter. And as context, in the fourth quarter of '18, we had 4.2% growth and in the fourth quarter of '17, we had 6.7% growth. So again, we work with quarterly sales guidance, but that gives you a sense of reasonables.","Daniel Amos","One other thing, Jimmy, I wanted to point out about the brand and your interest and Koide can respond to Japan Post. But I can tell you, from our perspective, our other sales projections outside Japan Post are right on target. So we've had no deterioration in anything that we can see from a new sales perspective in the other channels.","Operator","Next question is from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Dally","Just on Japan Post, again. I think in the past, you've been talking about 2009 as being a planning year to develop other strategic relationships or initiatives, 2020 being an execution year. Would we right to think that those initiatives are now being pushed back? 2020 is more about the sales recovery in Japan Post rather than executing on anything else to drive additional growth?","Daniel Amos","Yes, I think that's going to be the case. Koide, any comments you would like to make?","Masatoshi Koide","This is Koida. In regards to the third pillar of our strategy alliance of the four initiatives. And in terms of joint investment, be it Japan Post and, of course, with Aflac, there are some results. So there are fruitful results of the two companies, Japan Post and Aflac, making investments to start-ups in September and October and this has been publicly announced and these are to the two companies of the start-ups. And in terms of other initiatives, as we've been saying, we are still continuing to our discussion. That's all from me.","Daniel Amos","But Nigel, one thing I will say is, it's pretty obvious, but first half will be the biggest challenge because we're going against the hardest comparisons. And the second half going to be relatively easy with Japan Post, because were going against such poor sales in the third quarter and we expect it to continue into the fourth quarter.","Nigel Dally","Great. Second quarter question kind of related. Just the regulatory response to Japan Post. Clearly, the regulators have been involved throughout this process, but are you hearing anything from the regulators that would suggest that they're trying to push forward some changes in the way that insurance products are generally distributed that could have an impact on your distribution channels going forward?","Daniel Amos","Koide?","Masatoshi Koide","Could you please repeat the question again? This is from Japan.","Nigel Dally","Your question is on the regulatory response, to what's been happening at Japan Post. Are the regulators looking to change in any means the way that insurance products are being distributed, trying to push through some changes in the regulations as to what's appropriate with regards to sales practices?","Masatoshi Koide","Well, first of all, what the regulators are saying to Japan Post is not something that we know. We were not in a position to be mentioning about it. However, what we know is that there is no change that we know so far in terms of the insurance solicitation based on what has happened this time. Regulation, there's no regulatory changes that we know.","Daniel Amos","And I have been with FSA this year and there's no major issues other than the fix issue there with Japan Post, which, as Koide says, we don't know all the details or how they're handling that. But no one's mentioned to us that there is anything on the horizon that we need to do to change our sales practices in any way.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore.","Thomas Gallagher","Dan, as you go through this transition in Japan, would you expect cancer sales to fall further as the medical sales ramp up? Or do you think you've bottomed out with cancer here? And I guess, relatedly since Japan Post only sells the cancer product, is there a new product that you've planned for that channel after they get through their review?","Daniel Amos","Well, as you know, we've said all along, we would like to get a new product or rider or something and we are working on that prior to these issues that came up. I think we'll pick that back up as soon as this is resolved in December. I won't know when exactly. But again, I'm expecting things to go back to normal, except corrected from the standpoint of what the FSA is required. So I do think that any way you look at it, Japan Post is Japan incorporated. It's so much a part of society that it has to be fixed and it will continue. So I do expect that to happen. ","In regard to cancer sales, Tom, as I said, I expect cancer sales to be lower in the first half, my guess is, and then to be higher in the second half, and the balance is just too early to tell. I can make a guess, but that's all it is. And I don't think it would behoove you and\/or me to do that, but better to delay it out and show you what the situation is and you can come to your own conclusion. But my conclusion is, it will resolve itself and we can give you much more clarity at the end of the fourth quarter when January result -- I mean we closed out the end of the year and that date of January, once passed, and the reports are out, we'll give you much more of a sense of it.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Here's again on japan Post. Are you sort of through conducting your own reviews of their sales practices or you still pursuing such reviews?","Daniel Amos","No, we're not doing their practices. It's not our responsibility per se. We have to let the FSA, who's already in the process of doing that, from their own. And for us to get in the middle of it, I think, would cause us problems. We have, as you well know, reviewed any issues concerning policies that were written. And as I told you, it was 0.006%, so a very small fraction. And so we are confident that there is not a big problem based on that alone, but we will wait till their report is out. And if the FSA wants more, we'd be glad to help them, but we do not see this as being our issue but really their issue that they are handling.","Operator","Next question is from the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","As you prepare for the rollout of the 10 states with the Argus product next year, how would this change the dynamics in your own conversations with maybe existing broker partners and potential new partners as we reach year-end 2019?","Richard Williams","John, really this further expands our value proposition to be number one distributor of benefits solutions. It gets us on the discussion of front page benefits. And so not only with brokers but also with small businesses with our existing associates. So we are actually excited about it. Obviously, it's measurable route, so that we can get a good sense on how to roll this out nationally in 2021. But it is definitely further expanding our value proposition.","Teresa White","And certainly, this is one of the things that I hired Rich for. Rich is absolutely working with not just the brokers, but the career agency side to ensure that this Argus -- the Argus transition works well. So I'm very excited about that.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","I'm curious about the competitive landscape in the United States and how that's affecting your -- how pricing is being affected? And when you're going up to renew accounts, is there a potential persistency issue?","Richard Williams","Thank you, Andrew. So first of all, in the U.S., we continue to see an abundance of opportunity and need for our products and services, so we're very encouraged in the marketplace by that. In terms of just pricing and competitive nature, that tends to be more on the broker distribution marketplace and really more upmarket. And we've said it like in the prior quarter, we experience large case volatility from time to time because there will be some irrational pricing in the market, and we're going to be measured and we're not going to make poor decisions there. So -- but overall, an abundance of opportunity, lots of opportunities in the mid-market and then we will be selective upmarket, but again, very encouraged.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just a question for -- in terms of the buy-and-build appetite. So looking at your current product portfolio, what areas would you be interested in those buy-and-build opportunities? And how should we think about any kind of in terms of buys, like what is your appetite for those?","Frederick Crawford","Yes, let me make -- this is Fred, let me make a comment and then I'll welcome Teresa or Rich to comment. But -- the areas of interest on buy-to-build play off of Rich's comments and that is we have concluded that it is important for our overall core business to have good solutions on the so-called first page of the benefit enrollment platform. And this would include dental and vision but also would include areas of True Group Life and Disability, where we currently have partnerships in place but would look to advance the ball in that area. And so that's where we tend to look. The important dynamic of buy to build is that we don't think it makes sense to be writing big checks on large-scale platforms. And the reason for that is because we bring so much to the table in the way of client list and brand and distribution capability and brokerage relationships that it's far more economic for us to build that value organically once we have the platforms in place and the expertise. ","The other dynamic I would tell you that's unique to Aflac is of the 470-or-so thousand businesses that we do business with in U.S., the vast majority of them are small businesses. And one of the things you'll find characteristically when you move towards the first page of the enrollment platform is you also tend to be moving up into not only the brokerage space but into the large case space. That business tends to be dominated in the 1000 and up category of workforce and we have built the company on the basis of small businesses. ","And so the reason why buy to build makes particular sense for us is because we are often needing to shape or reshape the platform to be particularly interesting, if you will, to go down market. And the vast majority of these platforms are built for the upmarket, large case, and quite honestly, there isn't often a lot of growth there. It's more exchanging cases between competitors, whereas the small business dynamic in the U.S. is a pure growth opportunity. ","So there's a lot of strategic reasons as well as financial reasons why buy to build makes sense. As I said in my comments though, the good news, perhaps as an investor, is you avoid things like large goodwill and execution risk and integration challenges, and that's good news when it comes to the balance sheet and use of capital and capital at risk. The \"bad news\" is you have to saddle up to a level of expense and margin compression in the short run, while you go to organically build up that platform. And what we are charged with doing is defining that spend as well as the benefits or the growth in incremental earned premium that comes from the investment.","Teresa White","I'll just mention a couple of things. Fred talked about the small business and the number of small businesses that we have relationships with. I also feel that buy-to-build strategy gives us unique opportunity to develop an ecosystem that will help us to better serve the small business as well. And so those are things that we look at as we look at this strategy.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs.","Taylor Scott","Actually, I had my question answered, sorry about that.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","On U.S. earned premiums, I think they dipped a bit sequentially, which I believe was related to both sales as well as some producer actions you took. So can you just provide a bit color there? And then based on Fred's comments, am I right to see these as modest headwinds persisting into 2020?","Teresa White","Do you want to start with the sales piece and then I'll pick up on the producer?","Richard Williams","Yes, absolutely. So as we said, at the end of the second quarter, obviously, we made some business decisions around partnerships to exit that were not profitable and that certainly impacted not only persistency but translates into earned premium as well as some large case volatility. So that right there, sort of, took our trajectory short term down. So Teresa, I don't know if you want to comment.","Teresa White","Yes, I'll be a little bit more specific. We stopped doing business with a billing partner and this partner provided unique services for Aflac. At the end of the day, we just did not see the economics work for our business. And so you'll see that go through our persistency; you'll see that go through our premium. And, again, we believe it's a right decision to make for the enterprise and for the platform, but you will see some short-term volatility in those numbers.","Operator","Next question is from the line of John Nadel of UBS.","John Nadel","My focus this morning is on U.S. sales. And I guess, I have a couple of questions that are all related and I'd like to get them all in before the operator cuts me off. But I guess -- I'm trying to understand, in a down 4% or 4-and-change percent year-over-year quarter, and I guess, for the year, you are slightly down on a year-to-date basis, can you bifurcate for us, either over the short term, the discrete quarter or on the year-to-date basis or both, what the performance looks like for the broker channel versus your traditional or historical agent channel? ","And then, along with that, how much of an impact is this single partner relationship that you've exited and how can we think about the impact that, that is having on sales just given that partnership is no longer in place and I assume contributed some level of sales to the year-ago period and will have done so through what the first quarter of 2020 or second quarter of 2020? I guess if you could speak to those couple of issues then I think, it would help just maybe get a little bit of confidence on -- the fourth quarter is so important at this point given the contribution from the broker channel.","Richard Williams","Okay, so I'd also like to take those two questions. So first of all, of our sales holistically are impacted really by the average weekly producer year-to-date. Dan has alluded in his comments that we've seen our broker distribution continue to perform above the market, and so that's really how I would bifurcate that.","And again, average weekly producer is really impaired or impacted just by the decline in first half of the year on recruiting. So I think recruiting is about a six month lag and so I think that's how you can think about what's happening there. As we think about the partner and the exit of that particular relationship, fortunately, the sales are not a significant percentage of the overall sales of Aflac U.S. However, they do impact our associates who have existing clients and re-enrollments. And so that does take some of their focus off of that. And obviously, the exit of that partnership, because it's been a partnership for several years, has enforced premium ramifications. And so that's how -- why you see it working itself through earned premium.","Daniel Amos","I want to say one thing about the broker business. Our agents are still key because they represent 2\/3 of our business, but the broker business for us is doing great. I mean it's growing at twice the rate of the industry right now, and so we're very pleased with that. And we believe that -- and our focus is not just on broker, our focus is on our agents and our distribution channel there as well and the point being that when you're at full employment, it is harder to recruit people from a commission standpoint. And I've experienced that over the years. And that's why I've always said there is a balance. When it's a bad economy, there's not as many people at the worksite working, but it's easier to hire. When it's a full economy, which we haven't seen very often, there are plenty of people at the worksite, but it gets the people to call on them that we can hire. So it's a mix bag. So I do think we're doing all the right things. And there's some similarities with this and Japan and that the corporate agency structure has been the slow part but it has been these outside like for example, Japan Post, that has driven the growth. What's really been driving the growth, even though not as much as we want, has been the broker channel. And this other partner thing is a small detail that only because this is all in one quarter that you noticed it as much, it won't -- next year, you won't even see it.","Teresa White","And it'll just arrive through our 12 month rolling persistency and that's where you'll see it go through the numbers. But you're right, you won't see from a sales perspective.","Daniel Amos","Yes, you won't see it from a sales perspective.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Ian Ryave of Bank of America.","Ian Ryave","Just first on hedge cost in Japan. They went up sequentially. Is it just really a function of growing out the dollar investment portfolio? And I realize you locked in a lot of those hedge costs. Is it really a change in the hedge ratio? Or is it a factor in the market environment? What are the key drivers that they get higher or lower?","Daniel Amos","Ian, you did a great job actually. You hit it on the head. There's nothing from our perspective really unexpected. It ties back to our investment plan and the growth of the dollar assets, particularly the loan portfolio throughout the year. So in our investment planning, we knew as we progress throughout the year and buy those assets, come around the third quarter, our hedge costs would be higher. So it is volume related but planned volume. The other thing I should mention, just to attach to that, as a reminder, if hedge costs go up and the way it went up because it's related to volume, it also means our income went up attached to it. So our net of those two numbers is more or less precisely within our planning throughout the year or so. That's exactly what it is.","Operator","Last question is from John Barnidge of Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","So as we look towards next year, Tokyo is having Olympics, is there planning around marketing? And do you view that as a good platform to engage with potential audience to buy the products? And what your plans are for that?","Daniel Amos","Koide or whoever would like to take that question?","Masatoshi Koide"," And in terms of Olympics, there is really no plan [Technical Difficulty].","Frederick Crawford","I think we can probably finish the answer to the question for you. There'll be a very modest level of normal activity that takes place from a marketing perspective with groups of individuals and key clientele and all that, but there is no major plan dynamics around the Tokyo Olympics at this time that would be any sort of measurable impact to our financials.","David Young","At with that, I think, that is our last call and our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And remind you that we will be having our 2020 outlook call on December 2nd. That morning, we will provide more details of the coming weeks. And please feel free to contact our Investor and Rating Agency Relations department for more information and with any questions that you may have. We look forward to speaking to you soon.

[Operator Instructions]. Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Young, Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations.","David Young","Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. This morning, we will be hearing remarks from Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated, about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Then Fred Crawford, President and Chief Operating Officer of Aflac Incorporated, will follow with more details about our operations. And Max Broden, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated will discuss our financial results. ","In addition, joining us this morning during the Q&A portion are members of our executive management team in the United States. Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; Eric Kirsch, Global Chief Investment Officer; Rich Williams, Chief Distribution Officer; and, Al Riggieri, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary.","We are also joined by members of our executive management team in Tokyo at Aflac Life Insurance Japan; Charles Lake, Chairman and Representative Director, President of Aflac International; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director; Todd Daniels, Director and CFO; Koji Ariyoshi, Director and Head of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. The earnings release is available on the Investors page of Aflac's website at investors.aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-U.S. GAAP measures.","I'll now hand the call over to Dan. Dan?","Daniel Amos","Thank you, and good morning. Thank you for joining us. Let me start the morning off by saying that the fourth quarter rounded out another great year for Aflac in terms of earnings, capital and overall financial strength. I'm especially pleased with the company's financial performance in 2019. Financially, Aflac is as strong as we've ever been in our 65-year history. Our capital provision by any measure is robust. Our investments are high quality and diversified and we have among the highest return on capital and the lowest cost of capital in the industry. Total pretax adjusted earnings increased 2.5% which is even more meaningful when you consider that we have continued our extensive investment in our core technological platforms and initiatives to drive future earned premium growth and efficiencies. Investing in growth and innovation will continue to be critical strategic focus for 2020. Brad and Max will provide more detail in a moment. ","In 2019, Aflac Japan generated strong overall financial results. As we anticipated, full year third sector and first sector protection sales were down in the mid-teens, predominantly reflecting reduced sales of our cancer insurance through Japan Post following the strong launch of our revised cancer insurance in 2018. Earned premium growth for third and first sector protection products was 1.3% which was in line with our expectations.","As you may have seen last Friday, the new management of Japan Post Group held the press conference in regard to the submission of its business improvement plan to the Japanese government. This update includes additional measures that Japan Post Group management is undertaking to restore the public trust and address concerns raised by the sale of Japan Post insurance products. Understandably, the new management of Japan Post Group has placed this plan as a top priority management issue. And we would expect sales of Aflac Japan's cancer insurance through Japan Post distribution to be secondary, especially during the first half of the year. Based on comments from Japan Post and our review of monthly trends, we expect very little production in the first half of 2020. The level of recovery in the second half of the year is uncertain. But we will provide updates as we learn more. ","Importantly, we assume the possibility of low production with slow recovery in our forecast. Therefore, our guidance for Aflac Japan's earned premium and pretax earnings does not change materially from our 2020 outlook call. We continue to expect to decline in the range of 0.7% in the third and first sector protection earned premium for 2020. As we think about distribution, we look forward to working with Japan Post new leadership to continue deepening the strategic alliance relationship for the long term. To that point, Aflac Japan's executives met in January with Japan Post new leadership as part of the established strategic alliance framework. The discussions were positive and the Japan Post Group presidents expressed their desire to further enhance the strategic alliance to the benefit of both organizations over the long term. In addition, Brad and I will be meeting with the CEOs of Japan Post Group in March.","As I said earlier, we look forward to working with Japan Post new leadership to continue deepening our strategic alliance for the long term. Aflac Japan's medical insurance focused upon a rider strategy in 2019 while various factors affected sales that Fred will address shortly, the positive medical insurance sales results reinforced my confidence and our position as Japan's #1 provider of cancer and medical insurance ensuring 1 out of every 4 households. As we have discussed in the past, the government of Japan is debating social security reform for all generations as part of its growth strategy plan for dealing with the shrinking and aging population under the concept of 100-year life society.","The government is debating key social security issues including potentially increasing co-pays by elderly. As this debate continues, the public will be even more focused on the need for supplemental insurance. And the environment in Japan will continue to evolve. ","Against this backdrop, we take a longer-term perspective when it comes to our business and we will continue to focus on maintaining our leadership by leveraging the experience, expertise and scale and efficiencies developed over the last 45 years in Japan to bring value and protection to our policyholders.","At the same time, we are continuing to fully engage our wide-reaching distribution networks. Our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success as do our alliance partners. ","Now turning to Aflac U.S., we are pleased with our strong financial performance which was consistent with our expectations and reflected elevated expenses as a result of the ongoing investments in our platforms, distribution and customer experience.","While sales were slightly down for the year coming off record sales in the prior year, our premium growth was 1.8%. Ultimately, we seek to grow earned premium growth. It is evident that there are macro elements at play. Strong salaries and employment means fewer people that are willing to take independent commission sales roles.","This dynamic continues to distrain both sales agents recruiting and ultimately sales to an extent. But keep in mind, workers continue to convey a significant need for Aflac's benefit solutions in the workplace and we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.","Our broker strategies are taking hold, opening the door for more sales opportunities at larger accounts. Additionally, we are fortunate to have such a strong independent field force which is truly distinctive within our industry. We will continue to work with our agents to equip them with the tools that they need to be productive and to have a successful career with Aflac.","We have also been encouraged by the advancement in our direct-to-consumer platform and associates partnerships which are still in the initial stages. Taking all factors into account, we continue to expect Aflac U.S. to generate earned premium growth in the range of 1% and maintain stable persistency in 2020.","We will continue to invest in product development and efforts to facilitate producer growth and productivity, including the measured rollout of Aflac Dental and Vision that was initiated in January.","Aflac has historically been known for its organic growth. However, we recognize that prudent investment is critical to our growth strategy and the driving efficiencies that will impact the bottom line for the long term. With this in mind, we will look for other opportunities to accelerate growth through measured buy-to-build transactions. ","We balanced reinvestment in the core business with a focus on increasing the dividend and repurchasing shares. I am pleased with the board's decision to increase the first quarter 2020 cash dividend by $0.01 per share which is 3.7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase is coming off the 37th consecutive year of dividend increases in 2019 where we increased the dividend $0.01 each quarter generating a 3.8% dividend increase for the year. ","These increases recognize the stability of our earnings and capital generation and demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders. We expect share repurchase will be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion in 2020 with the range allowing us to be more tactical in our deployment strategy. As always, this assumes stable capital conditions and the absence of any compelling alternatives. We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios and maintaining a strong risk-based capital ratio in the U.S. and solvency margin ratio in Japan on behalf of our bondholders, our policyholders and our shareholders. ","Through Aflac Incorporated subsidiaries in Japan and the United States, we have the privilege of helping provide protection to more than 50 million people. In both countries, we have earned our position as the leading supplemental insurer by paying cash fast when policyholders get sick or injured.","Looking ahead, we believe our strong earnings growth will reflect the underlying earnings power of our insurance operations in Japan and the United States. It will also reflect our prudent approach to deploying excess capital in a way that balances the interest of all stakeholders. As always, we are working to achieve our earnings per share objectives while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders.","Now I'll turn the program over to Brad who will cover more on the operations and then Max to cover our financial results in more detail. Brad?","Unidentified Company Representative","Thank you, Dan. I'll focus my comments on market color and key areas of execution in Japan, the U.S. and global investments and connecting to our 2019 results and outlook for 2020. Let me first start with Aflac Japan. While the focus has been understandably on Japan Post in cancer sales, there have been additional market developments during 2019 that have shaped our product and distribution strategy for 2020. ","As Dan noted, we were pleased to end 2019 with an increase in medical sales. This is noteworthy as the medical product marketplace faced natural headwinds, specifically a change in corporate tax law late in the year that impacted products sold as part of a company benefit program and a measurable increase in competitive pressure as the traditional life players continue to pivot towards medical products after being hit hard by the low rate environment.","These same dynamics continue in 2020. And as a result, we have adjusted our product and marketing strategy accordingly. Our 2020 product launch plans include the introduction of a fresh approach to cancer riders that greatly simplifies the product design by bundling coverage riders for ease of sale and meeting customer needs.","This enhancement is also available in the Japan post system and is tailor-made for their unique distribution model once returning to full strength. We decided to accelerate our medical product refresh from 2021 launch into 2020, launching in the fourth quarter. While this will have a modest impact on 2020 sales, it positions us better as we head into 2021. The refreshed product expands coverage and fills a gap with nonexclusive agencies that offer higher premium and more expansive benefit structures to their clientele. This move accelerates approximately JPY 3 billion of product launch spend into 2020. ","As discussed during our outlook call, we have also set aside funding to strengthen the associate channel, our largest sales contributor. Investment includes technology and marketing spend in order to leverage our 22 million policies in force and 30,000 corporate groups to upsell and cross-sell more effectively. Finally, in an environment of low interest rates and related pressure on premium growth, we continue to work on our long-term expense structure. We are building out agile teams focused on customer experience enhancements, administrative efficiency and go-to-market productivity improvements. For example, the work of our agile teams have successfully reduced Japan's product launch cycle by over 3 months.","Separately, we have a medium-term plan to go paperless in our main operating centers and ongoing digital initiatives that require continued investment over the next few years. We believe the most accurate way to track our expense ratio is when adjusting for paid up policies. We anticipate our adjusted expense ratio will trend down gradually beginning in 2022 time frame.","While we are early in the year, Japan's accelerated investment is not expected to change our guidance range for the segment's 2020 pretax margins. Turning to the U.S., as medical and group benefit carriers pursue voluntary business and attempt to go down market, we believe it's important to build out a presence on the first page of the employee benefit marketplace. ","An initial step in that direction is our entry into Network Dental and Vision. Along with entering a growth market, we believe this portfolio expansion will increase producer productivity and assist with recruiting and retaining agents and expand broker access. We are taking a methodical approach beginning in 2020 with introduction in select states following by a national launch in 2021. We expect to generate $300 million to $500 million in incremental revenue over the next 5 to 7 years.","Argus, our recently acquired dental and vision TPA platform ended the year with annual revenue of $84 million and normalized pretax margin of approximately 5%. We expect this to be a growth area for the company as Argus has a strong reputation for servicing Medicare and Medicaid dental and vision members. In fact, last week, we issued a press release under the Argus brand announcing the awarding of 4 new partnerships administering dental and vision benefits to new Medicare Advantage members. ","Like any TPA model, this is a scalable business with strong return potential that has naturally reset our reported expense ratio by approximately 60 to 80 basis points. We are actively investing in a consumer markets platform for the digital sale of insurance direct to consumer along with partnerships that leverage lead generation for agent assisted sales. We are up and running with sales of $45 million in 2019. We are making important investments in a fully digital experience from acquisition to administration to policyholder experience including a digital claims capability.","We expect production through this platform to double in the next three years. Our U.S. outlook has assumed roughly 40 to 50 basis points of expense ratio drag in 2020 as we build out Network Dental and Vision and consumer markets platforms. We continue to invest in our operating platform in the U.S. with two critical deliveries anticipated in 2020. The first is an upgrade to our enrollment platform used by our agents and focused on the small business market. Upgrades are expected to provide more intuitive functionality and speed. The second is a successful migration onto a modernized platform for Aflac Group, which is our fastest-growing segment. Modernization includes scalability and automated back-end processing and billing functions. We just recently began placing new groups on our modernized platform. These projects along with other key initiatives are also supported by an agile work environment.","Overall, we anticipate expense ratios will remain elevated in 2020 and '21, then trending down beginning in the 2022 time frame, as the top line response to our key initiatives and we begin delivering on expense efficiencies. Turning to Aflac Global Investments. As Eric noted at last year's analyst briefing where it makes sense, we will explore team lift outs, joint ventures and equity stakes in asset managers that will then manage a portion of our assets. In January, we closed on a minority investment in Varagon Capital Partners, a leading direct lender to middle market companies. Our equity stake includes a mandate for up to $3 billion invested in middle-market loans over the next 3 years. The mandate is consistent with our overall general account investment strategy. Our minority equity investment will be held within our U.S. investment subsidiary with any associated returns running through the corporate segment. At this early stage, we do not expect a measurable impact on our 2020 outlook for investment income or earnings.","I'll now hand off to Max to cover our financial results. Max?","Max Broden","Thank you, Fred. We finished the year with a solid Q4, reporting adjusted EPS of $1.03, up 1% year-over-year. Underlying earnings continue to come through strong with no significant items to call out in this quarter. As previously guided, expense ratios ticked up in both operating segments due to seasonality and as Fred detailed in his comments, our continued strategic platform builds. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share increased 6.7% to $4.44. The strengthening yen benefiting earnings for both the quarter and the year by $0.02. As a result, adjusted earnings per share on a currency-neutral basis, rose 6.3% to $4.42 per share which was at the upper end of our upwardly revised guidance of $4.35 and to $4.45 at the end of Q3. Adjusted earnings per share including foreign currency translating gains and losses, grew 10.6% in both Q4 and for the full year. The adjusted ROE excluding the foreign currency impact was a strong 15.1% for the full year 2019.","Turning to our Japan segment. Total earned premium for the quarter declined 1.6% reflecting first sector policies paid-up impact and to-pay medical policies sold in 2017 reaching paid-up status as well. However, we continue to focus on driving the quality and value of new business. As a result, our earned premium for the first sector protection and third sector products increased 0.6%. ","Japan's total benefit ratio came in at 70% for the quarter with third sector benefit ratio coming in at 60.1%. Both of these ratios are up on a year-over-year basis as these ratios will naturally bounce around a bit on a quarterly basis and the comparable benefit ratios last year were very low. Looking at the full year numbers, we are reporting a stable third sector benefit ratio and a decline in our total benefit ratio supported by mix shift.","Overall claims trends are still tracking favorably but we're less of a tailwind this quarter. Digging into the details, a lower lapse rate on our cancer insurance block led to an increase in future policy benefit reserve and we also experienced a slight uptick in incurred claims. We do not see this as a trend but rather quarterly noise. ","Our expense ratio in Japan was 21.7%, 90 basis points higher than in Q4 last year due to technology investments as well as sales and marketing spend. The ratio is also impacted by lower reported earned premium. Net investment income declined 1.4% in yen terms. Unlike the previous few quarters, there was no significant call income or alternative investment returns in this quarter to call out. The pretax margin for Japan in the quarter was 19.8%. For the full year, we recorded a very strong pretax profit margin of 21.3% toward a high end of our forecasted range. ","Turning to U.S. results. Earned premium was up 1.1% despite weaker sales results and 100 basis points decrease in persistency which we view as temporary result of a large case volatility and replacement of an administrative partner. Our total benefit ratio came in at 49.1%, in line with recent claims trends and mix of business shift toward our accident product. ","Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 39.9% while the fourth quarter is a seasonally higher period for expenses. The increase of expenses in Q4 is due to lower unit cost capitalization, higher DAC amortization and the inclusion of Argus which carries a structurally higher expense ratio in its benefits management business. ","Net investment income in the U.S. declined by 1.6% due to onetime benefits -- sorry, due to onetime benefits from call income last year that did not recur this year. Maintaining consistent net investment income is a very good result on the back of sending excess capital up to the holding company as the final step in our planned RBC drawdown.","Profitability in the U.S. segment was impacted by the previously discussed elevated expense ratio, which pushed down the pretax profit margin to 16.8% in Q4. For the full year, the pretax profit margin held up well and came in at 19.4%. In our corporate segment, the main driver of improved results is higher levels of amortized hedge income driven by our enterprise corporate hedging program. Amortized hedge income contributed $27 million on a pretax basis to this quarter's earnings with an ending notional position of $4.9 billion. As a reminder, this program reduces the exposure to the yen, lowers the absolute level of hedge costs and reduces our exposure to volatility in hedge costs, ultimately improving the risk-adjusted return on capital for the group.","For 2020, we would expect the segment pretax profit for the full year to be a loss of $55 million to $65 million. This is $5 million higher than communicated on outlook call due to an updated and refined internal allocation of expenses with no impact on our total earnings.","In December, we successfully executed a $38 billion of global yen issuance with a weighted average coupon of 80 basis points. The proceeds will be used to redeem $350 million of 4% senior notes maturing in 2022, reducing our run rate interest costs by $11.2 million on a pretax basis and extending our debt maturity profile.","Turning to capital. Japan's estimated solvency margin ratio remains above 1,000% and our estimated U.S. risk-based capital ratio at quarter end was north of 500%. With the announcement of our Japan branch conversion to a subsidiary, we pledged to remove excess capital out of the U.S. entity targeting 500% RBC by the end of 2019. The fourth quarter marks the successful completion of our RBC drawdown plan where we moved $1.75 billion of capital from Aflac Columbus to Aflac Incorporated supporting our capital deployment and risk management activities. As we've noted previously, we have room for additional capital optimization as the risk profile of our U.S. business suggests an RBC closer to 400% is more appropriate. ","We ended the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of capital and liquidity at the holding company, net of prefunded debt. This is slightly lower than previously guided form. The deviation is primarily driven by a voluntary pension fund contribution to maintain strong funding levels on the face of lower discount rates and our decision to tactically buy back some additional shares. In the quarter, we repurchased 8.9 million shares for approximately $470 million. There is no change to our guidance for repurchase of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion in 2020.","Finally, let me comment briefly on guidance. With our full year 2019 results in the books, there are no material changes from our 2020 outlook call this past December. While there are natural movements in our plan, we affirm all material segment margin contributors including ranges for benefit ratios, expense ratios, net investment income and pretax profit margins. In addition, we affirm our range for share repurchase and EPS guidance recognizing we have adjusted a currency-neutral range for a final average exchange rate of JPY 109.07 to the dollar. As you may recall, our outlook call guidance was set at assuming JPY 110 to the dollar, thus we have adjusted our guidance accordingly to $4.32 to $4.52 per share.","Now let me turn the call over to David for Q&A. David?","Question-and-Answer Session","A - David Young","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take the first question, Nicole. ","Operator","First question is from the line of Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Dally","With medical, Fred, you highlighted the competitive nature of the medical market. From what I understand, medical has been competitive for some time for years. But from your comments it appears conditions have heated up some more. I just wanted to make sure I got that right? And if so, is it just more crowded, more participants? Or are we also seeing some companies that actually get more aggressive with pricing as well?","Frederick Crawford","Yes, thank you, Nigel. It's not more competitors, really, more specifically, what we've seen is some of the large and respected domestic life insurance players have moved towards refreshing their medical products as well as enhancing compensation or basically incentives, if you will, around the sale of medical product. We think this is understandable given that the interest rate environment has made it very difficult to sell yen-based life insurance products. And so that's really what we're starting to see take place. We have distribution -- unique distribution through exclusive agency arrangements and so most of what we see in the way of competitive dynamics is in the nonexclusive agencies that we sell-through and perhaps to a lesser degree, some of the banking channel which is very small for us right now. ","And so that's why the new product refreshment is meant to be more competitive but also particularly make us more competitive in nonexclusive agencies. Interestingly, it's not really a pricing war. It's really more enhancing and enriching benefits going after a marketplace that's able to pay more premium for enhanced and broader coverage capability. And so that's the gap we're looking to fill, and that's where we see the competition.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Andrew Kligerman.","Andrew Kligerman","Just going back to capital, I mean, so what would be the timing, I guess, for Max's commentary of getting the RBC down to 400%, now being in excess of 500%? What would be the timing of getting that figure down? And I guess, your guidance implies about a 71% -- 70-ish percent capital return this year. Why not pick it up a little bit more?","Max Broden","So Andrew, first of all, let's step back and realize that we just finished the drawdown of the capital that was generated through the branch conversion. And we are now in a position to, for the first time, have a clean blue book that we are printing that we then can take to regulators, to rating agencies, et cetera. So we will then have clean financials on a statutory basis that we can discuss with these constituents. So we will have these discussions throughout the year. And we don't feel that we have a rush to bring it down to the 400% range. Right now, given where we are in the cycle, we feel that holding strong capital levels is a benefit to us. So I would expect the -- to travel downwards towards 400% over time. We will not initially pull capital out, but rather, we would like to see that the growth of the business will consume that capital and take us down to the 400%.","Andrew Kligerman","I see. So growth of business, not so much extracting the capital?","Max Broden","Correct.","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. And I think, Fred, you were alluding earlier to group business. Could you talk about some of the initiatives there and the potential to impact premium in the United States?","Frederick Crawford","So the reference that I made in my comments was, what we have been seeing for a while now, not surprisingly, and particularly if you listen to other True Group carriers calls, we're seeing competitors in that space look to move into the voluntary space and look to move down market, sometimes with success, sometimes without. That also leads to a level of bundling at times where true go True Group players and even health players will bundle voluntary product with their core offering. And so what we have been doing is looking at -- making sure that we have an answer to that type of competitive dynamic. First and foremost, our voluntary benefit programs on a group basis tend to be very competitive and desired by employees and HR professionals. And so we tend to do very well in that space. It's the fastest-growing part of the company. But in order to combat bundling type dynamics, we need to have a broader solution that includes Dental and Vision and also True Group Life and Disability. Right now, we have a partnership on True Group Life and Disability where we offer the product and partner with DRMS on the administrative side. And we need to involve that plat -- evolve that platform so that it's more competitive and able to fight off that type of dynamic. So again, we are competing very well in that space but we think we have more opportunity to grow if we build out those programs.","Andrew Kligerman","And Fred, do you think that at some point in the next 2, 3 years, you could see a very material impact on the top line from the group product like Group Life and Group Disability?","Frederick Crawford","Too early to tell on that topic. I think right now, our focus primarily is driving earned premium growth in the Dental and Vision space because obviously we've made a transaction in that space, built out the platform and we're starting to -- starting to build out that state-by-state platform to generate $300 million to $500 million of premium over the next 5 to 7 years. And so that's right now the focus, I would say, to a lesser degree, we would expect to pickup earned premium over the next 3 to 5 years on the direct-to-consumer and lead generation platform. Those are incremental adds. Remember our core business, we still intend to grow earned premium there through the blocking and tackling of building out our platforms in group voluntary as well as the individual voluntary business. But incrementally, it's focused right now on Dental and Vision and on consumer markets. True Group will evolve over time but it's too early to pinpoint earned premium on that at this point.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jammi Bhullar of JPMorgan.","Jamminder Bhullar","I had a question on Japan sales. And obviously, you had mentioned and everyone expected cancer sales to be fairly weak given the post situation. I thought medical sales were a little weaker than expected as well. And you mentioned the tax change that might have hurt demand. What's your view on how that product is performing? And then also, given that you're updating the product later this year, should we assume that as the year goes on, sales growth will moderate because people might or our agents might wait till the new product to start pushing it again?","Daniel Amos","I think Aflac Japan can take that question. So let's see over there, who would like to, Koji or Koide, how would you like to do this?","Koji Ariyoshi","Okay. This is Koji. I will speak. So let me explain a little bit about the medical insurance. So for our exclusive agency, the new rider that we've implemented last year has worked very well for the coverage for our existing policyholders.","And so this has worked positively. However, in nonexclusive agencies our competitors have expanded their coverage and that has really been hitting us hard. So that is the reason why the positive or the increase of the medical has slowed down and it comes to a weaker sales. And because of this, the current situation where nonexclusive agencies are expanding and that negative impact could also impact our exclusive agency. So what we will do is to make improvements in our new medical insurance by having a more enriched coverage to really be able to be competitive. And in terms of the actual coverage that we plan to offer. Since this is before the filing to the FSA, we are not able to disclose the details. However, what I can say is that we would like to increase our competitiveness to the top level. That's all from me.","Jamminder Bhullar","And Fred, anything on just likely weakness as you go through the year, people, agents -- the agents sort of holding back from pushing the product in anticipation of the new offering?","Frederick Crawford","I don't think we expect any material dynamic in that respect, either holding back or what have you. I think, right now, our cancer product, particularly with the right -- I'm sorry, medical product with the rider strategy remains very competitive in our core associate platform. I think, I would remind everybody that since we moved to a rider strategy, the reported sales naturally declines because you're selling a rider and we only count the rider premium as a sale as opposed to the full policy. So please keep in mind that we continue to add economic value throughout the year by maintaining policies, having better persistency and then adding riders to our core policies. So economically, we continue to push forward on medical even though the sales look a bit dampened due to the rider strategy. That hasn't changed. That will still remain popular. We just think this particular gap in our product is a good one to fill, so we've accelerated into 2020.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","I have a question related to U.S. sales. So in your prepared remarks, you talked about sales being a little bit soft. And I understand it's the dynamics of some of the agency and broker relationship kind of management that you've done throughout 2019. But I was just wondering, have you seen any kind of changes in competitions as well? And kind of how you -- we should think about it as you are kind of going into 2020?","Daniel Amos","I'll ask Rich Williams to take that for us.","Richard Williams","Okay. Thank you, Humphrey, for your question. So first of all, as we've discussed at fab in September, our results finished the year as expected. And we had shared the drivers in 2019 being exiting partnerships, large case volatility and some headwinds with average weekly producer. On a positive note, our broker sales growth as well as our consumer markets contribution are 2 areas that we're very pleased with. And also, as we finish the second half of the year, as we focus on producer growth, we're encouraged to see career recruiting grow in both those quarters. From a competitive dynamic, as Fred alluded to, with medical and group benefits carriers getting into the space, this is another opportunity for us to be at the table and we're excited about our progress with Dental and Vision and the ability to also offer life and disability. So what I would say is we're seeking balance, both on our core supplemental products and also being able to provide benefit solutions on the front page benefits.","Humphrey Lee","Understand. And then in terms of the elevated expenses in the coming couple of years. Like should we think about it in terms of elevations, more like towards the upper end of your guidance range for 2020 and 2021 before kind of normalizing in 2022? Is that the way that we should think about it? Or could the elevation be above and beyond what your kind of guidance range is upper end?","David Young","I would say, we certainly don't see it above and beyond the upper end of our range. It will naturally fluctuate within the range. But usually when we set those ranges, it's plus or minus around our actual financial plan target. Those plans can evolve, and of course, performance can evolve. But I would not fix a rate at some spot within the range. What I can say with confidence is we wouldn't expect to be above it. And again, these investments are all, I think, where you're going to see eventual benefit in the expense ratio is really driving the top line. Most of the investments that we're making, both operationally as well as, of course, in the incremental projects that we have around Dental and Vision and direct-to-consumer are meant to drive the top end or the revenue side of it. And that's where I think we'll start to achieve a turnaround in the expense ratio.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","First just one follow-up, I think, on Humphrey's question. Fred, you mentioned no change to 2020 Japan margins despite bringing in some additional product launch spend related to accelerating the medical product timing. Is there something offsetting this? Or does it just push you a little bit towards the lower end of the range?","David Young","We do have a little bit of an offset in the sense of a little better revenue dynamic as persistency was a bit better coming off of 2019. But also locked in a little bit better net investment income coming through Japan. And that has helped us to accelerate some of that spend without impacting the bottom line that much. But again, most of the commentary is really important around the range, meaning we don't see really any change in the ranges. But again, we'll naturally fluctuate within the range.","Erik Bass","Got it. And then can you comment a bit more broadly on your aspirations for investment management. Do you want to, I mean, potentially explore commercializing your offering at some point and looking to manage assets for third parties or other insurance companies? Or do you see the investments in properties like Varagon more as a way to source assets and just participate in their growth.","Frederick Crawford","You know, I'll make a couple of comments. But then ask Eric to expand on it. I think we have not made a fundamental decision to commercialize our institutional asset management capabilities. But we're absolutely looking to leverage what Eric and the team have built over the better part of 8-plus years now in New York and in Tokyo. And really what you should think of these strategies as is a natural extension of our external manager program. It's -- if you think about it, we've moved assets that we have less of an expertise into external managers and it's quite naturally that we will, from time to time, run across teams and managers that we find attractive enough to where we want to hold an equity interest along with mandating them on investments. So that's really more the strategy as a natural extension of what we have in the way of our core capabilities. But Eric, I don't know, if that covers it or if you have anything else you want to add from your perspective?","Eric Kirsch","I think Fred covered it perfectly. No aspirations in the traditional sense, Erik, as you stated it, commercially for our teams to be a third-party asset manager. That's a very tough business. There's a lot of players. But where we can differentiate ourselves is in the selection of asset managers for our balance sheet and how we earn income for Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. But if we're able to lever that into examples like NXT, Varagon and potentially others in the future which we see those opportunities, will not only improve the income of the balance sheet for the 2 insurance operations, but will create revenue streams from owning those equity stakes and eventually, potentially some upside as well. So -- so in that way, we kind of had exposure to the third-party asset management business indirectly through those joint ventures or equity ownerships.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi.","Suneet Kamath","This is a question about Japan. Historically, you guys have done a lot of market research on brand and trust and a lot of those dynamics. And so my question is, given everything that's been going on with Japan Post, has your research pointed out any impact on Japan Post brand in Japan? And if there is, do you worry about some kind of spillover effect on the Aflac brand?","Daniel Amos","This is Amos. Yes, let me just say, and then I'll have him follow up. That -- of course, we worry a little bit but all indications from everything we've seen, it had no effect on our brand because as you've seen in the media, we were excluded from any of the issues concerning that. So I feel good about that. I think the longer it goes on, the more potential there for issues. But I do believe that the Japan Post is on these issues, resolving any issues with the consumers. And I think the change in the management team and their focus right now has been viewed very positive by the public. And so I think it will all take care of itself in the next 6 months or so. But Koide or -- I think might want to speak on this.","Masatoshi Koide","Okay. This is Koide from Aflac Japan. Let me just add a little bit. In January, we have conducted a consumer survey on our brand. So among the people who recognized that the media coverage on Japan Post insurance issue since last year.","There were very few people who thought negatively about Aflac as a brand based on that -- the media coverage on JPI? In specific, there were only 2% who thought there was a negative impact on Aflac's brand. So in other words, we have confirmed that there has been no impact on Aflac brand based on JPI, Japan Post Insurance product issue. That's all from me.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. My follow-up question is just on the copayment increase that you talked about in your prepared remarks, I guess, for the elderly population in Japan. We've heard about this in different periods in the past in terms of the government wanting to do that. Does it feel like it's got a little bit more length at this time in terms of actually happening? Or any color around that would be helpful?","Daniel Amos","Yes. Well, what I would say is there seems to be more activity in that regard, predominantly about people living to be 100 and as you probably remember from the past, they kind of send out trial balloons to see what the reaction is publicly sometimes. And it's too early for us to tell. But my gut says that there's more of an interest now than there has been in quite a while. We'll have to wait and see. But they do have issues with budgets and their deficit that they've created and how they're going to control that. So certainly, I think they're trying to find out where and how they will attack those issues. And this is certainly one way to do that by increasing the copays or deductibles. But don't walk away from this call thinking that this is a done deal and it's going to happen. We don't know any more than you know from what we read in the newspapers. But in talking to our people, I think it's a reasonable thing for them to be considering and one I think that has a much higher probability than in the past few years when it was a much lower chance of it happening.","Masatoshi Koide","Once again, this is Koide from Aflac Japan. So with the backdrop in Japan with the government funding, the government is in financial -- is facing financial issue from the increasing medical cost in the social welfare system. So what Abe administration is trying to do is under the name of health care reform for all generations, what the administration is trying to do is to motivate the elderly population who is still willing to work and secure employment of those people and have them support the social warfare system instead of being the recipient. And that is the reason why at the same time, the Abe administration is trying to increase the copay of medical fee of elderly population.","So this is something that is being covered in the media right now. As a result, many of the consumers are becoming interested in this type of media coverage. So the focus of the discussion right now is whether there will be any copay increase for the population aged 75 or above. But because this is a very difficult reform as this will require copay increase of elderly.","So my assumption is that this discussion will continue for some time. But then, the government's intention is to want to address this issue by the time the baby boomers reach this age group from 2022. That's all from me.","Operator","Next question is from the line of John Barnidge of Piper Sandler.","John Barnidge","Productivity as listed on Page 19 of the supplement materially increased. I get there's a seasonal nature to this. But it was definitely higher than the last couple of years. Know what the strong economy, recruitment and engagement may be harder given the commission nature. So I was just curious, in the commentary you had on that?","Daniel Amos","Teresa, you want to?","Teresa White","Yes, I'll start and then I'll hand it to Rich. One of the things that we've been working on that we've talked about in the fab and in other calls is our enrollment tool and we have invested a tremendous amount in those tools to drive productivity for our agency force. We're also investing in third-party tool for enrollment so that we can increase the productivity of those enrollments as well. So that has been a focus for our administrative side to support what Rich and his team is doing from a growth perspective. Do you have any other comment to add, Rich?","Richard Williams","The only other comment that I would say, Teresa and John, is that in the fourth quarter, we see productivity spike. So productivity in 2018 in the fourth quarter over '17 was up 5.1%. And in 2019 in the fourth quarter, it was up 4.8%. So the productivity we see is pretty consistent where most of our field force is working and that's the larger part of our sales for the year.","Daniel Amos","I think it's [indiscernible] tell them about the change in compensation at the management level to try to push productivity from new associates.","Richard Williams","Absolutely. Good point, Dan. So first and foremost, we communicated to our field in the fourth quarter of 2019 that we were aligning all compensation from associates through their management hierarchies, all the way up to our highest levels towards producer growth. That is something that had been missing for several years and you've seen it in sort of our inconsistent recruiting and producer growth results. It's not a quick fix, but it's on that we believe, it's going to have positive effects and we're seeing the near-term positive indication.","Teresa White","And that will drive that average weekly producer growth.","Daniel Amos","Yes.","Teresa White","That's sure.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Scott","Dan here, first one I had was just on the third sector benefit ratio in Japan. Here I was just interested in light of the comments you're making about the competitive environment, some of the domestics pushing a little harder on the medical, in particular. I mean, what's being priced in the new product in terms of like hospital day-stay on the cancer side? I mean, and what's in medical relative to the trends you're seeing? I mean, can you keep that benefit ratio stable? Or will there have to be a natural kind of upward pressure on that over time?","Daniel Amos","Quite honestly, we have been pricing for quite a while now to mirror the improvements in morbidity that we've been seeing in Japan, but we continue to see actual to expected results run favorable which implies a continued level of improvement in benefit ratios. But we've been saying now for a while that, particularly around medical, that we would expect some level of stabilization of benefit ratios. In other words, there's a point at which you would expect that to normalize to some degree. And so there's been a slowing down gradually of movement in the third sector only better ratio that is improvement in the benefit ratio. ","And we think that's illustrative of both pricing actions as well as a natural slowing down on the pace of shrinking hospitalization stays, et cetera. Having said that, these are still products that are priced at very attractive returns relative to our extremely low cost of capital in Japan and as a company. And so the economic value being added by every policy we put on our books is quite significant given our scale and the performance. So that gap, if you will, between cost of capital and return on capital remains healthy and allows us to be aggressive where we need to be. But as I mentioned earlier, we do see pricing pressure. But frankly, at the moment, right now, it's really product design type pressure which is something we can react to quickly and why we accelerated the medical product refresh into 2020.","Alex Scott","Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the potential social security changes. I mean, is your view still that cancer and sort of medical policies with maybe a nursing care rider takes care of the nursing care piece of this in the best way? Or are you exploring other types of products, maybe standalone nursing or something like that, that would potentially garner more demand from that kind of a change?","Daniel Amos","I'll let my Japan colleagues answer, but from my perspective, I would tell you that right now, our answer is just as you say, it's attaching care or nursing care riders to the medical product that allows the buyer to age with the -- allows he policy to age with the buyer. Everything from the younger side of the cohort which is interested in income or disability type protection to core medical to then as the policyholder age is naturally attaching riders related to nursing care. We think that's the best on a risk-adjusted basis because as you can imagine, that type of risk as well as dementia-type risk is one that we want to stay away from and as a result, the supplemental nature of our policies, the limited benefit structures of our policies, the fact that it's attached to a high return medical base policy, all of that strikes us as the best way to address it. But we have to continue to explore what opportunities we have with an aging population and we'll continue to do that. But it's going to be done in a risk-adjusted way.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Marcos Holanda of Raymond James.","Marcos Holanda","I just want to drill down on U.S. sales. And I was hoping you guys could give us some more color on sales results by distribution channel? And if there was any one channel that exceeded your expectations last year?","Daniel Amos","Thank you for the question. So as we alluded to earlier, the areas where we saw productivity was broker sales and consumer market sales. Broker sales were strong for the quarter as were consumer markets. And then, obviously, with our associate agency distribution channel, it was lower than anticipated. And then I think as we've alluded to also, our mix of business is moving gradually more towards brokerage and that's been doing that over the last 10 years and 2019 was consistent with prior movements.","Marcos Holanda","Got it. And in my follow-up, I think you mentioned the Argus platform generated about $84 million revenue last year. And as I'm looking at your 2020 outlook, I guess, you guys are assuming basically flat revenue growth. And I was hoping maybe you could bridge a gap between that and your long-term target of $300 million to $500 million. Is that just a function of a slow ramp up? Is there anything else you could guys can give us there?","Daniel Amos","Yes. I'm actually glad you asked that question because it allows me to be very clear on this. Don't confuse Argus' TPA or administrative platform with the growth expectations of our Dental and Vision business. In other words, what we bought when we purchased Argus was an administrative -- what we believe to be a top-notch administrative platform that simply administers Medicare, Medicaid, Dental and Vision products on behalf of other large typically health organizations. And that is a traditional TPA administrative-only business and not a conventional risk-taking business. That business, we would expect to steadily grow over time. And in fact, even the purchase price is designed in a way to incent growth rates. Separate and apart from that though is the Dental and Vision business which is the actual insurance business. That is really Aflac's strategy leveraging that platform to build out and sell and grow premium on Aflac Dental and Vision. And that's the $300 million to $500 million we're pointing to.","David Young","And keep in mind that the TPA revenues, that is not running through the premium line. So when Fred talks about earned premium growth, that does not include a TPA revenue, it's coming through fees in the other income line.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore.","Thomas Gallagher","Just looking at the distribution disclosure on channels for Japan in the supplement, it's a little hard to know how important the independent agency channel is, Fred, where you were citing the increased competition in medical. Can you give us a sense for what percentage of Japan sales sails through, through the independent channel where the competition has escalated? How large and how important that is for Aflac? And just relatedly, do you -- would you also expect similar competition with the new rider cancer product launch? Or do you think it's going to be less competitive there?","David Young","I can answer the second part of your question. I'm going to toss to Japan to answer the breakout of exclusive agencies versus independent agencies. But we intend to be competitive in every channel period even on the exclusive front because we think that's important. But obviously, when you get to the non-exclusive channels, there's more of a spreadsheet environment that you have to be constantly conscious of. The fact that we are facing competition in those channels is nothing new. That has been going on for several years now. It's really just more that we need to react and react more quickly to product development moves as we see the competition turn their attention to more proactively going after medical product. That's where, for example, closing down or shrinking the product launch cycle by three months really helps because we're going to need to be more nimble as we move forward. And that's -- and this is an example of being nimble. ","The cancer rider, we think, is actually a very interesting dynamic on the cancer product and will be interesting to track how we see sales going there. That rider is meant to simplify a series of riders that address different types of cancer and cancer treatment to really simplify the offering. And we think that could help both in the sales process as well as in ease of the buying public understanding, the risk benefit, if you will, or the benefit of what they're paying for. So we think that could be a very good rider. It's also a rider that adjusts with the amount of risk you have as you age. So as you know, as you age in Japan, a greater proportion of your medical costs are covered under the National Medical System and this product will adjust accordingly which makes it more affordable and more practical as you age in Japan to buy the cancer rider. So again, it's an example of both putting out a very marketable product but also adjusting to the aging population with our products. Koide-san or Koji, if you want to comment on the relative proportion of independent versus exclusive agencies if you have that data handy.","Koji Ariyoshi","So this is Koji. Looking at the fourth quarter performance, independent and individual agencies account for more than half of the medical sales. But then most fierce competition is, of course, in the nonexclusive independent individual agencies. However, as you may know, we are very strong in cancer insurance market. So we are not facing a fierce competition in cancer insurance market. And in terms of cancer insurance revision this time, this product will be very easy to sell and that would expand our sales because even new sales agents will be able to sell this product because it is a simplified product. So the meaning of launch of this product is not to really win over competitors but rather expand our sales and our positioning in the market. That's all for me.","David Young","Tom, I hope that answers your question. I want to just thank everyone for joining us for this extended call today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. We'll do what we can to respond and look forward to speaking to you soon.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may now proceed.","Robin Wilkey","Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2016 call. Joining me this morning in the U.S. is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Joining us from Tokyo is Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan and Koji Ariyoshi, Executive Vice President and Director of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release of some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.","Now, I am turning the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Fred will follow up with some brief comments about our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the year. Dan?","Dan Amos","Thanks, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let me begin by saying that the first quarter of 2016 was a great start for Aflac. Let me first provide an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. You will recall that the last quarter that we anticipated sales of third sector products would be down mid single-digits for the full year, following very strong production results in 2015 and that is still the case. However, sales of Aflac Japan\u2019s third sector products were up 1% for the quarter, which means we are running ahead of expectations for the third quarter sales. No one aspect of our business is contributing to the outperformance. It\u2019s simply stronger than expected productivity across all key distribution channels. We continue to believe the long-term compound annual growth of third sector products will be in the range of 4% to 6%.","Consistent with our expectation, sales of first sector products were elevated in the quarter. As discussed on our fourth quarter conference call, steps to control the sale of first sector products are being taken and we continue to implement various substantial actions later in the second quarter. These include a combination of production caps, commission restructuring, product re-pricing and in select cases, product discontinuance. As a result of these planned actions, we anticipate seeing at least a 50% decline in first sector product sales, namely WAYS and Child Endowment in the second half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015. Managing through the low interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. Paul and the team from Aflac Japan are going to cover this in more details next month at our Financial Analyst Briefing.","From a product perspective, we work hard to remain in step with the wants and needs of the Japanese consumer in our distribution channels. In doing so, we continually enhance our portfolio of products. This quarter, we introduced a cancer insurance product designed for those who have previously been diagnosed with cancer and been cancer-free for 5 years just as we do in the United States as well as an enhanced nonstandard medical insurance product. We will continue to be innovative and are providing options that millions of Japanese consumers are looking for as they struggle to bear the financial burdens of higher medical expenses.","From a distribution perspective, our traditional agencies have been and remained viable contributors to our success and this was certainly true in the first quarter. Additionally, all of our alliance partners continued to produce strong results and I am especially pleased with Japan Post and their 20,000 plus postal outlets selling our cancer insurance. Our goal remains to be where the people want to buy and our various distribution outlets broaden our reach.","Turning to Aflac U.S., you will recall that 2015 was the year of building out our business through our carrier and broker distribution channels. In doing so, we established the foundation for greater long-term growth opportunities. We see 2016 as the year of stabilization and growth and continue to execute on our strategies. With Aflac generating new annualized premium sales of 3.7%, we are off to a good start toward our expectation of the 3% to 5% sales growth for the U.S. in 2016. I do want to again emphasize that we anticipate our sales will be increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter, but what we achieved prior to that time lays the groundwork for our ultimate success.","As you all well know, success and opportunity breeds competition. That, combined with a clear need for voluntary products, has resulted in a number of other companies entering the voluntary supplemental insurance market. These have included insurance carriers who sell voluntary insurance as well as companies involved in various aspects of the healthcare management. As a result, we are executing on strategies designed to increase Aflac\u2019s importance to the employer and employees in an effort to drive further growth and penetration in our core supplemental voluntary products. But keep in mind, Aflac\u2019s singular focus on supplemental voluntary products has greatly contributed to our dominant position in the worksite insurance industry and I believe we will continue to drive us in our competitive edge. Teresa will cover this in more detail at the Financial Analyst Briefing.","One Day Pay also remains a key differentiator for Aflac. We will continue to promote One Day Pay to consumers, which we believe will help drive increased brand loyalty and account penetration. Here is an amazing statistic. In 2015 and continuing through the first quarter, 100% of the eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within 1 day. I think that we will process more than 2 million One Day Pay claims in 2016. Independent research continues to show that there is no doubt that American consumers need cash quickly and paying clients fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition and I believe will really drive our sales.","Turning to capital deployment, Fred will provide more details shortly, but let me just say that we continue to view growing the cash dividend and purchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particularly in the absence of compelling alternatives. Despite recent market volatility, our capital position remains strong and reinforces our plan of repurchasing $1.4 billion of shares, with the majority concentrated in the first half of the year.","I will conclude by reiterating that I have been in this business now more than 40 years, and I am more excited today than I have ever been, because the future is so bright at Aflac.","Now, let me turn it over to Fred for our financial results. Fred?","Fred Crawford","Thank you, Dan. You have all had a chance to review the details of our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, our first quarter results certainly gave us a great start to the year and achieving our 2016 earnings guidance. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan. The only notable item in the quarter was an unfavorable expense item running through our corporate line of approximately $8 million after-tax or $0.02 per share. This item represents an acceleration of stock compensation expense in order to properly reflect our guidelines for retirement-eligible employees. We would not expect this portion of the expense to repeat in future quarters and the expense itself is largely a timing issue.","Our Japan segment margins were solid in the quarter with continued strength in benefit ratios. Routine adjustments to reserves contributed modestly to the performance in the period and reflect favorable claims trends. Our expense ratio came in as expected and generally in line with our outlook called guidance.","In the U.S., benefit ratios were considerably better than last year\u2019s quarter, but fairly consistent with our seasonal expectation for a strong first quarter. Benefit ratios tend to be lower early in the year as policyholders manage deductibles and are less likely to experience routine injuries that come with outdoor activity. Lapse rates also tend to be modestly elevated in the first quarter, which has the effect of driving the benefit ratio down and DAC amortization higher. Our overall expense ratio in the U.S. was in line with our expectations as general expenses were down, offset by elevated DAC amortization. In Japan and the U.S., we would expect both our benefit and expense ratios to trend within our December outlook called guidance ranges as we move into the second quarter and for the remainder of the year.","Turning to investments, new money rates in Japan were influenced by the pre-bind of our annual budget of JGBs, which serve to depress our purchase yields relative to our full year expectation. This tactical strategy was critical and that we purchased the majority of our JGB budget prior to the BOJ\u2019s action, allowing us time to fully implement measures intended to curb the sale of certain first sector products while defending profitability. As we move forward, navigating the rate environment in Japan will involve allocations to long-dated JGBs, which while low yielding, provide certain ALM and capital benefits. We will continue our work to develop alternative yen investments and support our hedged dollar program. U.S. new money rates were influenced by the continued build out of our strategic asset allocation and were modestly elevated relative to our full year expectations due to a concentration of purchases in higher yielding middle market loans. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher long-term returns.","Let me comment for a moment on hedge costs and know that I will go into some more detail on strategy at our Financial Analyst Briefing in May. We have experienced an increase in hedge costs as compared to last year. This is not only market driven, but somewhat the result of our tactical efforts to extend the average duration of the forwards backing the dollar program. As you know from our previous comments, the rise in hedge costs was fully expected as recent years have experienced abnormally low costs relative to historic norms. As indicated in our press release, we recorded $29 million after tax or $0.07 a share in hedge costs for the quarter. We record the full cost of forwards upfront in the quarter purchased. Thus, the timing of what is rolling on and off the program can make a difference in any one quarter. We have approximately $13 billion of dollar bond program hedged with forwards at an estimated full year average pretax cost of roughly 110 basis points. While early in the year and recognizing the accounting treatment, the 110 basis point range is a practical pretax estimate for our full year cost expectations on our existing portfolio, this assuming no material change in our hedging strategy or market movements.","Our capital and liquidity position remained strong. We have only estimates on SMR and RBC at this time, but expect both to remain strong and generally consistent with recent periods despite a return to volatility in the quarter. Impairments in the quarter were modest and prices in our energy portfolio have recovered somewhat after a volatile January and February. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned $773 million to our shareholders in the quarter. Depending on overall capital conditions, we expect to repatriate 80% to 100% of FSA earnings in 2016 or roughly \u00a5120 billion to \u00a5150 billion. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company, in part driven by repatriation of 2015 reinsurance proceeds and are on pace to achieve our $1 billion share repurchase target for the first half of 2016 and $1.4 billion in repurchase for the full year.","Our business model is resilient to market volatility and our overall cost of capital continues to decline in contrast to industry players with more exposed business models. We have made no adjustments to our earnings guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 per share assuming the same average exchange rate as last year, which was roughly \u00a5121 million to the dollar. Given strength in the yen during the quarter, we have provided in our press release an EPS range for the second quarter assuming a yen to dollar of \u00a5105 to \u00a5115. While important to recognize exchange rates with respect to cash flows and capital ratios, we focus on EPS progress on a currency neutral basis. We believe our performance in the quarter certainly bodes well for 2016.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to Robin to begin our Q&A session. Robin?","Robin Wilkey","Thank you, Fred. Before we begin Q&A, I wanted to remind everyone of our upcoming Financial Analyst Briefing meeting to be held in New York on May 25. Additionally, we will have our mini FAB meeting in Tokyo, September 12. We all hope to see you there. Now we are ready to start taking questions. But first, let me remind you to be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one initial question and only one follow-up that relates to the initial question. We are now ready to begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Speakers, we have a question coming from the line of Erik Bass of Citigroup. Sir, your line now is open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. I guess how does the year-to-date strengthen the yen, coupled with the BOJ\u2019s focus on weakening the currency, influence your thinking around repatriating capital from Japan or hedging future repatriation?","Fred Crawford","Sure, Erik. Thanks. It\u2019s Fred. There are a couple of components to be mindful of in a strengthening yen. One is because we, of course have a dollar program where we are generating dollar based income from an investment perspective, on a cash basis you are needing to convert that dollar back into yen and as it converts, it will actually be a headwind to FSA earnings. And so when it comes to looking at repatriation, for example, just FSA earnings themselves would typically see some modest headwind related to yen strengthening. Now you couple that also however, with looking at the overall condition in your SMR ratio and what\u2019s happening in capital conditions. And as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to have stability in our SMR ratio, meaning that exchange rates aside, the spread gap \u2013 gap in spreads and lower interest rates have actually provided a little bit of a modest lift to SMR ratio. So when you combine those two, the capital conditions by SMR and looking at any pressure to FSA earnings, I would expect to hold steady on our repatriation efforts. Now the other end of your question is a good one and that is well, don\u2019t you have an opportunity to then convert that yen back into more dollars in the U.S. through your hedging of repatriation activity. And the answer is yes, but there is a lagging effect. And the reason there is a lagging effect is because our strategy on hedging repatriated yen is to really roll forward, if you will our dollar cost average our way into hedging typically about five quarters to maybe as much as six quarters out in advance. So eventually, we start locking future cash flows into more attractive exchange rates on a yen to dollar basis, but for a while it lags. So for example, in 2016, we have hedged effectively all of our repatriated \u2013 repatriation plans at least on an FSA earnings basis and the average hedge exchange rate that we have converted dollars into is about \u00a5117 \u2013 of about \u00a5117 to the dollar. So that gives you an idea. So we are on the negative side, if you will compared to current exchange rates, but realize over time, that will all flow together in dollar cost averaging. There will no doubt be a time where we are actually on the attractive end of converting yen to dollars as exchange rates move around.","Erik Bass","Got it. And what you think about \u2013 I guess for next year then, you are potentially repatriating more given that you would be locking in a more favorable exchange rate?","Fred Crawford","I think the important thing to note on that Erik, is that my first stop in terms of thinking about repatriation strategy is really on capital quality, capital conditions and what types of risk and issues and performance is taking place in the business. Only then do I think about exchange rate strategy. And that\u2019s really \u2013 exchange rate strategy in my view, is the tail that wags the dog. It\u2019s not the major dynamic. So if you were to for example, assume stability in capital conditions, which currently we think conditions are relatively stable, then what we may do on the margin is go out a little further and lock in more of that yen coming back home into dollars. We may also toggle between that 80% and 100% of FSA earnings based on \u2013 somewhat on the value of the dollars or the yen to dollar that we are bringing back, but that is a very, very minor component to the overall decision, which is hey, what\u2019s going on with the capital conditions in Japan.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. And if I could just sneak in one last one that\u2019s related, you mentioned that you were spending down some current excess capital. Can you just help us think about how you would quantify current excess capital?","Fred Crawford","Yes. What my comment is referring to is, in 2015, as you know, in March of 2015, right, prior to my arrival, Aflac executed on a reinsurance transaction that generated after-tax about \u00a590 billion, if you will, in FSA earnings. And as you recall from last year, over the course of the year, but most predominantly in the fourth quarter, we effectively brought the majority of that \u00a590 billion, if you will, back to the U.S. or let\u2019s call it $750 million. That served to really kick up the level of excess capital that we had at the holding company at year end and we have been essentially spending that down through the combination of accelerated repurchase into the first quarter, but also we will gradually feather down that excess capital over the course of 2016 and also 2017. So, the important point to note is that there is the true free cash flow of the company and then there is the cash flow or excess capital that\u2019s been generated through reinsurance. And last year\u2019s exercise is a good example of that. So, as we spend that down over the course of 2016 and \u201817 that\u2019s what\u2019s supporting some of our deployment \u2013 deployable capital estimates that you have seen historically in previous FAB discussion.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you for the comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line now is open.","Nigel Dally","Great, thank you. Good morning. With first sector sales, I had two questions. First, can you discuss the margins you are generating on those products given the current interest rate environment? And second, you talked about managing down sales, is there anything to stop you from just discontinuing those sales? Thanks.","Fred Crawford","So, let me talk a little bit about \u2013 let me hit your margin first and then I am going to toss to Paul to clarify also or expand on some of the actions we are taking. But just on the margins, first of all, these products have been priced to exceed our cost of capital and obviously drive economic value for the company realizing that in many cases, we are selling the product in combination with third sector distribution relationships and so we think in terms of sort of a blended economic value driven off the distribution. Where there are distribution partners that are more dominant in the first sector and much more say lump sum dumping or interest-sensitive type sales, that\u2019s where you particularly want to take more decisive action. Now, I mentioned that early in the year, we bought \u2013 pre-bought JGBs. We bought JGBs at around a little north of 1% at an average duration of around 20, 22 years. And obviously, pricing these days, you are talking about yields more down around 30 to 40 basis points. That has gone a long way to defending our returns in the product over the course of this year. It doesn\u2019t completely immunize the returns, but it gives you a great start to defending and allows you or buys you time to take not only actions on the distribution front, but also actions on the investment front as flows come in over time.","And so right now, keep in mind that we tend to price these products out with an expectation for yields in the roughly 1.25% to 1.4% range. And just to give you an idea, in the first quarter alone, even with the heightened allocation to JGBs, we, after hedge costs, generated around a 2% or so yield net of hedge costs. And so we have got some room in our pricing to suffer the natural low interest rate environment over time and still defend yields, but we have got to be diligent in shutting down the flows, because over time, clearly, these are much less attractive and we need time to re-price and recalibrate. Paul, maybe I will toss to you then on some of the actions we are taking.","Paul Amos","Sure. Nigel, first and foremost, I want to go back and revisit the fourth quarter outlook call for this year when we basically differentiated between first sector savings products and first sector products that are level premium products. And so I am going to differentiate a little bit here, because we are obviously making significantly higher profit margins on the level premium than we are with savings products. So, to get into the specific measures that we are taking, we are suspending sales of our lump-sum WAYS product, while we are restricting sales on our level premium WAYS product. We are also going to move up the re-pricing of our WAYS product into this year. Additionally, for all of first sector, we are going to re-price our products effective April 2017 and so we believe that, that would put the portfolio back in a much better place.","In terms of channel and distribution partners, because as Fred said, this is a critical component to the decision of lot of stake in the market. From a bank channel perspective, effective May 2, we have suspended all WAYS and lump sum Child Endowment from a nonexclusive agency perspective, which are some of the largest growing agencies throughout Japan. April 1, we have put in caps for WAYS and Child Endowment. And finally for the traditional agencies, we are lowering commission. Now again, as what I have said in the past, when we have these exclusive agencies who sign a contract to basically offer only Aflac products, they do so with the belief that we are going to provide them not only third sector products, but also first sector products. And as a result, we make sure that we offer those products and that prevents us from discontinuing them altogether.","Now that said, I know you want us focused on third sector. And as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, we are heavily focused on the two new products given they are smaller products that we have just put out our cancer for cancer survivors and our revised nonstandard medical. And even though it was only the last couple of weeks of the quarter that those were out, we are very happy with how those were starting. Finally, we are going to be launching a new product this summer and we can\u2019t go into all the details yet. Hopefully, by FAB, we will be able to cover some of the details about that new third sector product line that we have never been in before, but we are refocusing the attention of our distribution partners on third sectors to the extent we can. We did anticipate this spike in first sector as a result of these discontinuances and sales restrictions that we are putting in place. And we believe the second half of the year, we will be having some substantial reduction in first sector because of the changes that we are making and we have accounted for all of this.","Nigel Dally","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line now is open.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning, everybody. I want to start with U.S. benefit ratios or the claims experience there, I think you noted that it was pretty much in line with what you would have expected in the strong quarter. But going back several years, I don\u2019t remember seeing such a strong quarter and I was hopeful that you maybe could give a little more color as to what exactly drove these very strong results?","Fred Crawford","Sure. Yes, in my comments, I do want to be clear that what definitely is expected when we play out the seasonal dynamics of our business is that we would experience stronger than normal and in fact typically the strongest quarter of the year is the first quarter for the reasons I mentioned on my calls. Natural seasonality, some of the natural lapsation that comes off of a strong 4Q sales into 1Q sales and the enrollment periods and everything that plays into the natural rolling of our business, that all plays into a better benefit ratio in the first quarter. However, I would tell you that this benefit ratio is certainly a bit lower than we would have naturally planned for. This is still doing a little better than what we would expect. And I think as we go through the numbers obviously and dive into the actuarial performance in the business, we are seeing a few things. One is obviously some of the continued positive trends we have been experiencing in recent years in terms of just overall claim activity. When you couple that with the natural adjustments or, in some cases, lack of adjustments in IBNR as your actual to expected continues to perform well, you can essentially hike \u2013 enhance, if you will, the impact on your benefit ratio in any period. In other words, couple just good old-fashioned positive claims activity with positive IBNR adjustments once you\u2019ve studied the business long enough to make the adjustments.","In past few years, I would tell you that even though we have experienced strong first quarters, there were at times where we made certain IBNR adjustments on select lines of business where we felt as if there was modest efficiencies, for example, when looking at actual to expected. And now having caught up with those reserve strengthenings, we are not seeing as much of that anymore. And so you tend to highlight the first quarter, but I want to remind you that we also had actually quite a positive fourth quarter relative to our expectations. So, we will develop perhaps a little more dialogue around this at our FAB meeting in May. And what I would tell you is that our practice here, as it takes quite a bit of time, of research and looking at the trends before we would declare victory, if you will, on resetting our expectations for benefit ratios. We fully expect second quarter benefit ratios to rebound back if you will towards our outlook guidance that we gave in December and you should anticipate that as you think about modeling our results.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up question actually goes back to the series of questions you got earlier about first sector sales. As you discontinue the \u2013 some of the WAYS product and curtail some of the other first sector products, is that factoring into your expectations that third sector products would come under pressure this year as well or is that purely a factor of the strong sales growth that you had last year?","Paul Amos","This is Paul. It is factoring into our third sector thought process. The reality is, first quarter third sector sales were better than we anticipated. But the additional reduction that we are taking and the measures we are taking to pull back on first sector are accounting for Dan\u2019s continued comment that we expect to be within the range in terms of third sector sales. So I am very positive about the first quarter, but I recognize these additional measures may have an impact in the latter part of the year. Therefore, we want to reverberate our range of sales as what it was in the December outlook call.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. Sir, your line now is open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on profit repatriation, Fred you talked about you are benefiting from some of the reinsurance that\u2019s already been done, can you talk about what your expectation would be on a more normalized basis for profit repatriation just from ongoing earnings that the Japanese business generates on an FSA basis?","Fred Crawford","Yes. It\u2019s really implied in some of my outlook comments. And that is, as we sit here today based on our planning we have suggested FSA earnings and associated repatriation in the range of \u00a5120 billion to \u00a5150 billion. Let me also clarify something just to make sure we are all on the same page and that is I am talking about 2016, just realize that we print our FSA earnings on an annual basis at 03\/31 year end. You don\u2019t need to necessarily concern yourself with that, but we really trap things in terms of year end to year end 03\/31. But when focusing on repatriation that\u2019s effectively our estimate right now is \u00a5120 billion to \u00a5150 billion and that is essentially 80% to 100% of our FSA or our annualized FSA earnings estimate for the year. And we will have to see how things play out. What would cause you to go from 80% to 100% is entirely on the overall dynamics of capital development, key ratios that we look at, of course investments and investment risk and performance. It\u2019s all the things you would expect. Again, conditions seem to be moving forward nicely, but we have to be careful. There were some yellow lights flashing if you will on the first quarter with market volatility, energy prices, etcetera. And so we had to pay very careful attention. Things have stabilized a bit, but I don\u2019t think anybody would declare a victory. We can still see periods of market volatility and need to be careful.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. But just on a more ongoing basis, longer term, I should basically take the profit repatriation guidance for this year and exclude the benefit from the reinsurance and that would be more of an ongoing normalized expectation?","Fred Crawford","That would be more the run rate and you have to recall that I think in total, we have done roughly \u00a5300 billion, from a reserve perspective, reinsurance transactions, over three transactions that has resulted in approximately \u00a5200 billion in FSA profits. And we have retained about 40% of those proceeds and repatriated the rest, so give or take \u00a5120 billion. And so when we go out reinsurance, we have a blended approach of retention to support our capital ratios and defend our capital ratios and repatriation where it makes sense to repatriate and deploy. And so over the last few years, supporting our deployable capital measures has certainly been the rolling through reinsurance transactions. If you were to subtract out those benefits and move to more of a true cash flow, it\u2019s typically more essentially the repatriation estimates in any given year plus what I would call free cash flow in the U.S. and\/or the movement of excess capital in the U.S. up to the holding company. We will give you a little bit more color around this for sure as part of our comments at the Financial Analyst Briefing in May.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, thanks. And then just a follow-up, your debt to cap ratio is 21.5, obviously debt costs are very low in Japan right now and I think your target is up to 25%, do you see any opportunity to add some additional leverage at this point?","Fred Crawford","At this time no specific plans and certainly nothing in our outlook, if you will. So the guidance we have given relative to EPS and the like, we don\u2019t have any levering up, if you will in our plans. We have some refinancing and pre-funding, if you will. We tend to go out early. And over the course of the end of this year and into the early part of next year, we have in a range of $800 million to maybe as much as $1 billion of refinancing related activity or pre-funding activity. So we do have those in our plans, but we don\u2019t have an outright levering up in our plans. I think it\u2019s true that there is a certain amount of what I would call debt capacity or leverage capacity at the holding company at Aflac. But again, I want you to be careful about any potential market volatility and also want to defend our strong ratings. Part of the reason we have a very low cost of capital, in fact in recent periods, our cost of capital has been drifting actually below 8%, which is tremendous. Part of that reason is we maintain extremely strong ratings and can access the capital markets at very aggressive rates, both yen and U.S. dollar. And so we want to make sure we protect that. Our coverage ratio is essential. In fact actually there is only a two notch separation between our financial strength ratings and our holding company ratings and part of that is because of the very strong interest coverage ratios we have. So we pay attention to that, Ryan. But I would argue yes, we have some level of debt capacity, but no immediate plans to leverage up.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg of RBC Capital. Sir, your line now is open.","Eric Berg","Thanks very much. Good morning to everyone. Fred, you mentioned in your \u2013 I think it was in your prepared remarks or maybe an answer to a question, pardon me, that the FSA earnings would face headwinds due to yen strengthening as dollar investments get converted back to yen, I would understand that in the absence of hedging, but given that you have such a large and well developed hedging program, why is there this earnings \u2013 FSA earnings headwind in the face of \u2013 in the presence of a hedge program?","Fred Crawford","Well, I mean some of it is that we have a meaningful un-hedged portion of the dollar program. And so be mindful of that. We run for example, about a $22 billion or so U.S. dollar program in Japan and we tend to maintain a hedge ratio of about 65% of that. So you have an un-hedged portion that\u2019s tossing off dollars to be hedged back into yen. So it\u2019s that dynamic. And Eric I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add.","Eric Kirsch","I will just add a number of our private placements or what we call the versatile currency bonds where well, the principal is in yen, the coupon actually comes in dollars. So that also would contribute similarly to the un-hedged portion that Fred mentioned.","Eric Berg","Okay. The other question I had relates to the first sector programs and I just want to place a sharper point than we have on the problem here, of course we are all aware of the extremely low interest rates indeed on the short end of the yield curve, negative interest rates in Japan, but if you are able with your dollar investment program and associated hedging, paired with long dated JGBs, to produce target rates of return, if you can earn north of 2% at present in the multiplicity of ways or approaches that you are using and you are able to earn target rates of return as you would say you did in the March quarter on the new products, why do you nonetheless feel you must cut back? Thank you.","Fred Crawford","I mean I will give you my financial perspective and then certainly welcome any comments from Paul strategically. But this is a product set in general that even though we can achieve and cover for example, our cost of capital and arguably add economic value, this is not just a lower return of capital relative to third sector, but it can also be a potentially and more volatile return on capital, meaning think of it as the spray of potential return outcomes on the product can be quite a bit wider and less predictable, if you will, less manageable, if you will than third sector. This relates to things like lapse rates, buyer behavior. As you know, the WAYS product for example, converts into several different options of products, so who converts and who converts into what can play into it. So you have a lot of dynamics at play that really, in my mind raise the stakes on the return expectations. In other words, if you were to describe a broader spray of potential returns to me, I would have a higher expectation of returns in general. And that\u2019s not the case given the rate environment. So what I would say is, remember, we are remaining in the game. It\u2019s just at a greatly reduced level. And we are remaining in the game for the very reason you point out, Eric and that is we can certainly re-price and cover our cost of capital in such a way that we remain offering the product and support our distribution partnerships in Japan, which is critical to third sector. It\u2019s just that from a relative use of capital, we will want to grow and support and build third sector all day long and would rather pullback a little bit on first sector, which should by the way over time, now over a long period of time, should by the way bring gradual lift to FSA earnings and cash flow and allow us to repatriate and redeploy capital in other higher returning opportunities.","Dan Amos","But Eric, you have been around a long time as I have and the fundamental things of what\u2019s built our business, is right in third sector. The life insurance was always a door opener to help put our agents in a position when they went to the table to meet with people and go over things, if they wanted life insurance, it was there, but we still want our focus on third sector and that\u2019s really the driver.","Eric Berg","Alright, thanks to everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz of Raymond James. Sir, your line now is open.","Steven Schwartz","Thank you very much. Good morning everybody. Question for Eric. I just want to follow-up on kind of what you did in the quarter with JGBs kind of what percentage of JGB buying that you expected to do and your plan was done in the first quarter. And given that presumably a lot more would be done in the dollar program where we could see new money yields throughout the rest of the year?","Eric Kirsch","Sure. That\u2019s a good point. About 70% of our full year expectations for JGBs were purchased in the first quarter. And that was a tactical move on the investment group\u2019s part partly because one, we were aware of the cash flows related to WAYS and had an expectation of them being more overweighted in the first half of the year. And second, we have obviously always talked about macro factors like the DOJ and we were pretty strong in understanding that the likelihood was \u2013 JGB as we continue to go down. So, we made that tactical move which turned out to be a good one. But you are right, as we go to the rest of the year, dollar assets, growth assets will be 70% probably of our allocation, with JGBs being about 25% or so or JGB-like investments as part of our plan.","So when you look at it in that regard, in the first quarter, this is gross hedge cost and other numbers, 214 net of hedge costs, as Fred mentioned, about 201. For the rest of the year, we would expect that new money yield based on that allocation differences to be about 320, take off about 5 or 6 for a hedge cost depending on the exact makeup of the asset. So for the full year, our expectation now based on market conditions, cash flows that we know would be about 270 before hedge cost and again, knock off about 5 for average weighted hedge cost in that new money yield with respect to the rest of the year. Now for us, as you know, the markets are dynamic, things are moving quickly. So, we certainly reserve the right based on where markets are, asset classes are to change those allocations, but based on plan, that\u2019s our expectation.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. Thank you, Eric. And then a follow-up for Fred, on the hedge cost, I was trying to do some quick math while you were talking. Given you mentioned 110 basis points on the existing $13 billion that\u2019s being hedged and the costs that were incurred in the first quarter, I am coming out to about $0.23 for this year, would that be in the ballpark?","Fred Crawford","Your math is good. So for example, you take 110 basis points on $13 billion, that\u2019s $143 million pre-tax, for example. Tax affected divide by our 420 million shares outstanding and you are in that $0.22, $0.23 a share. Now, couple of things. If you noticed and remember my comments, I said hey, timing is everything as you move quarter-to-quarter because of the way in which we account for that. We had $44 million pre-tax, $29 million after-tax, $0.07 a share in the first quarter. If you look at a run-rate basis, you are thinking about more in terms of $0.05, maybe a little north of $0.05 of share. And so I made the comment that, hey, I would expect, for the year as we roll the whole year together and look at it, that it\u2019s something in the 110 basis point range, but realizing the first quarter that was ticked up a little bit because of the simple buying pattern.","Now one other thing to be careful about, right, is I am holding essentially all else equal. I am holding the size of our portfolio equal. I am holding our hedge strategy effectively equal and I am holding the markets in and around where they are at today. Markets have stabilized a little bit. No one is getting excited or anything, but after a March rise in hedge costs over the last year, there has been a little bit of stabilization as we see markets calm down. But I think we are about what 12 hours away from a Bank of Japan meeting or so, if not short of them to add. And so things can change. We will have to watch it carefully and carefully manage it.","Steven Schwartz","Alright, thank you. Understood, Fred.","Fred Crawford","Yes.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath of UBS. Your line now is open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks and good morning. Appreciate the comment about the first sector products being above your low cost of capital, but can you just remind us what the expected returns are on the first sector and how those compare to the third sector products you are selling?","Fred Crawford","Yes. We \u2013 it\u2019s very, very assumption-dependent, which is why you tend to see us back away a little bit from giving you precise point estimates. I mean, it has an awful lot to do with the nature of the product, Child Endowment versus WAYS, the nature of the WAYS product and very importantly how that WAYS product plays out. So, that\u2019s my point about the spray of returns. Returns \u2013 and remember, in Japan, you have an even lower cost of capital technically in Japan than you do on a consolidated basis for obvious reasons. But these products, based on the runs I have seen and on various interest rate assumptions, they can range from the high single-digits to as much as low 10% plus range, but we can build this out a little bit more for you and talk a bit more at FAB. I want to just caution that it has everything to do with what the verdicts passed are for these products along with sensitivity in interest rates.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, got it. And then my follow-up question that\u2019s related is can you give us an update in terms of your Aflac Japan pre-tax earnings in terms of the mix between first sector and third sector?","Fred Crawford","I don\u2019t have that particular mix handy. As we talk about it, we talk about the difference in benefit ratio and expense ratios between the products as you know. The benefit ratio on first sector products, you will tend to have a much higher benefit ratio and much lower expense ratio than you do on third sector. And so we would need to give you a little bit of commentary around the relative premium between the two so that you could do the math. Kriss, I don\u2019t know if you...","Kriss Cloninger","This is Kriss. We will update that at FAB. As I recall from last year\u2019s numbers, first sector profits comprised roughly 20% of our total Aflac Japan. Profits in the third sector were the balance. I don\u2019t know if I am remembering that exactly right, but it\u2019s short of that order of magnitude. The premium income was skewing up toward the first sector products, but the profit margins being lower, diluted overall profit as a percent of the aggregate total, but we showed you that in a chart last year and we will update it again in May.","Suneet Kamath","And is your expectation that that portion from the first sector will now start to decline maybe starting from that 20%?","Fred Crawford","It\u2019s going to be glacial in terms of its impact. And I would say that because you are talking about a product that tends to have maybe a little better than a 1% lapse rate, particularly first sector products like WAYS, Child Endowment, etcetera. So over time, as you throttle back on the new sales, you would expect to see it become less and less of the percentage of your earnings simply because we would fully anticipate to continue to grow our third sector business at a more significant compounded annual growth rate. So that will happen, but in terms of say near-term modeling-related issues over the next few years and so forth, you are not talking about a material impact or swing in that dynamic.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Your line now is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. I was wondering if Dan or maybe Paul could just talk about competitive trends in the Japanese third sector market and your confidence in your ability to improve third sector sales to your 4% to 6% growth guidance longer term over time. And the reason I am asking is a lot of companies with JGB yields being depressed have been talking about pulling back from life insurance, selling more third sector products. So are you seeing that now? Is that affecting your view on what the expected pace of growth in your sales will be longer term as a result?","Paul Amos","Well, let me start by saying historically if you went all the way back to deregulation in 2001, which Dan can comment on, everyone has always said they are going to come after our business and our profit margins. And this has been happening for 1.5 decades. In reality, we have been able to fend those off and continue to grow our business. And I think there is no better evidence of that than the sales we saw from our cancer plan, which many people thought could be a saturated market, but in reality, we see it as a growth market as it continues. We think that our resurgence up above 70% market share at one point as we launched the product and now staying above 50% is very positive for us. In terms of medical, there is no doubt that the markets \u2013 there are a high volume of competitors that it is a highly competitive situation and that we continue to focus on making better and better product. I think the factor that we have to place on this is quicker product launches. We are more likely going to see a more periodic launch of a new product with new benefits based on healthcare changes as well as competition in the marketplace, but we have not seen substantially lower margins put on by other companies. And so we feel like we can still, with the brand that we have, with the products that we have put in place and the distribution outlets that we have that are pretty much comprehensive as compared to most of our competitors who will focus on one or two distribution channels, we feel like we are in the right places to grow this business. Additionally, I mentioned that we are going to launch a new third sector product and category later this year. And we believe that\u2019s one more benefit to our overall third sector portfolio. I will let Dan make some comments.","Dan Amos","Well, the only thing I would say is in all the years with Japan, certainly now is not the time I have been the most worried about competition. I was much more worried in 2001 and other times probably, but it\u2019s never going to be one person or one company that comes after us. It\u2019s just a lot of little ones. And again, I think most of them spike and then it goes back down. And so I believe, because it is our major product and that\u2019s what we do all of our concentration on that we have got a distinct advantage. And although these life insurers that talk about getting into third sector, if that\u2019s all they have got to look forward to, they are in big trouble. So, they have got to solve their life insurance issues one way or another and have got to find other ways. We can \u2013 they could get in third sector for a little bit, but it\u2019s not going to solve their problems. And so I feel pretty comfortable with the way we are doing it. And at the same time, I don\u2019t want to be cocky because anything can happen. But I think we are better prepared with new products, new ideas and continue to pretend like we are number two instead of number one, where we are always fighting to stay on top and that\u2019s going to be our mode as it has been in the past.","Jimmy Bhullar","And as you think about your sales progression through the rest of the year, would you expect the decline in sales or weaker sales in anticipation of the new products that you are launching or should that not have an impact on the rest of the business since it\u2019s a new type of product?","Dan Amos","I think our overall sales is a result of such a strong year last year. Double-digit \u2013 above the double-digit growth makes this year much harder for us. So, it\u2019s that more than anything else.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Okay. The next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan of Macquarie. Your line now is open.","Sean Dargan","Thanks and good morning. I have a question about the trajectory of book value per share for investors who think of the world in that way. The jump between fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter you have been on an ex-FAS 115 basis was pretty meaningful. I am wondering if there is some FX remeasurement impact perhaps tied to the hedge that is affecting that number. And is there a way we should think about it excluding that?","Fred Crawford","Yes. What you \u2013 it\u2019s a decent question, because it goes to book value. It also goes to ROE implications in terms of the way we report it even a little bit related to leverage in terms of how you define shareholders\u2019 equity. But just note that in the way in which we calculate it, while we removed unrealized gains and losses on funds from traditional pricing issues or traditionally what most insurance companies do, in our calculation remains an unrealized gain and loss on foreign exchange, on FX. And what you saw here with the strengthening of the yen is that line item in our shareholders\u2019 equity, which has in recent years been a large negative number, has become less of a negative number, with yen strengthening, i.e., adding to shareholders\u2019 equity. And so it has served to, both year-over-year and on a sequential basis in particular even if you just look at fourth quarter to the first quarter actually kick up your shareholders\u2019 equity and therefore pops up your book value per share a little bit more than usual. Obviously, we bought back a good amount of stock as well. But then also, it weighs down mechanically, if you will, on the ROE reported sequentially and year-over-year, but also can also play into your leverage calculation as well. So, as we go forward and as investors pay more attention to that book value, book value growth, ROE and the like, we will want to take some more time in understanding the mechanics of the calculation and make sure you understand what\u2019s being done to move ROE forward. Obviously, coming off the earnings in the first quarter, our buyback of stock, we certainly pushed ROE forward, but you do have some FX-related denominator impacts in those ROE calculations.","Sean Dargan","Thanks. More clarity would be helpful. That\u2019s all. Thank you.","Robin Wilkey","Thank you very much for joining us today. If you want to follow-up with any questions later on, Investor Relations will be in the office and we look forward to taking your call.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded.","And I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. David Young, Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Sir, you may begin.","David Young","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me this morning from the U.S. are Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S., and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Chief Global Investment Officer. Joining us from Tokyo is Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan; Masatoshi Koide, Deputy President of Aflac Japan; and Koji Ariyoshi, Executive Vice President and Director of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our Annual Report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. The earnings release is available on the Investor Page of aflac.com and also includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Dan.","We\u2019ll begin with Dan.","Daniel Amos","Thank you, David. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin by saying that the first quarter 2017 kicked off a good start to the year for Aflac. I will lead off by briefly highlighting two changes in the senior management, you've probably heard about. Earlier this month, we welcome Max Broden to Aflac as Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","We also announced earlier this week that Koide-san, Deputy President of Aflac Japan will assume the role of President and Chief Operating Officer of Aflac Japan on July 1. As Yamauchi-san assumes the Vice Chairman's role. Fred and Paul will comment more on this shortly, and you'll hear from Koide-san as well. We are excited to welcome them both into the new roles and we look forward to their contributions to Aflac.","Now turning to the results and operations. We are pleased with the Company's overall performance for the first quarter. Our results are consistent with what we communicated on the December outlook call. From a segment perspective, I'll start with Aflac Japan our largest earnings contributor. Despite the persistent low interest rate environment Aflac Japan generated solid financial results. In the end-terms results on an operating basis were consistent with our expectations for the quarter.","I'm also very pleased with Aflac Japan better-than-expected third quarter sales increase of 7.6%. Production was solid across all channels, which further affirms our leading position in the third sector market. Sales in the quarter benefited from the February 20 introduction of our revised EVER and get products. Results also benefited from sales of our latest third sector product called income support insurance.","As you may recall, this product provide fixed benefit amounts should a policyholder be unable to work due to significant illness or injury. It was developed to supplement the disability coverage provided through Japan\u2019s social security system. Our income support insurance targets consumers in their 20s through 40s, which is a segment of the population where we\u2019ve underrepresented. Income support insurance has been favorably received and we believe this product can potentially develop into a new product pillar over the long-term.","Turning to the first sector savings products, you will recall that we proactively pulled products from select channel and aggressively re-priced our wave and child endowment products, factoring in the reality of a prolonged low interest rate environment. Aflac Japan continue to make notable progress limiting the sale of first sector savings products reflecting a decrease of 81.3% in the quarter.","Regarding distribution channels, our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success. Our alliance partners has also made significant contributions to our sales results with such an extensive distribution network that includes Japan's post 20,000 plus postal outlets, selling our cancer insurance, we are furthering our goal to be where people want to buy insurance.","As we look ahead Aflac Japan's focus will remain on selling our third sector products along with first sector protection products, both of which are less interest rate sensitive and have strong and stable margins. We will continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduced innovative new third sector products to maintain our market leadership. As we communicated, we view Aflac Japan's long-term compound growth rate in the third sector is being in the range of 4% to 6%.","Turning to our U.S. operations, we are pleased with the financial performance and continued strength in profitability. Our financial results on an operating basis are in line with our expectations, which is particularly notable and they are reflected in ongoing investment in our platform.","We began to see our platform payoff in the form of improved persistency and customer satisfaction. Whopping 95% of our policyholders who use one-day pay say they likely to refer people to Aflac which will encourage us to continue to differentiate and reinforce our strong brand and policyholder trust. Independent research continues to show there is no doubt American consumers need cash quickly and paying claims fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition.","With respect to career agent activity, we continue to focus agents on groups with fewer than 100 employees. I believe this market is Aflac's to grow because our career sales agents are best positioned within the industry to reach and therefore succeed with these smaller employers. We also increased our career sales agents\u2019 adoption of our Everwell enrollment platform, which in turn has increased our account penetration in our accounts with less than 100 workers.","In terms of our broker activity, our team of brokers, sales professionals had made great progress in successfully expanding Aflac's relationship with the large broker community. Based on the positive results we've seen in the large broker space, we are extending our broker sales team with new roles designed to focus on the mid brokers space. While our sales increased 1.7% in the quarter is below our target of our long-term CAGR increase of 3% to 5%.","We believe the strategy for growth we implemented in both career and broker sales is right one. We also will continue to make tactical adjustments to meet our long-term growth objectives. I want to reiterate that we continue to target for the long-term compound annual growth of 3% to 5% we provided on our December outlook call.","Turning to our capital deployment, Fred will provide more detail shortly, but let me just say that we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of the stakeholders. We continue to anticipate that will repurchase in the range of $1.3 million to $1.5 billion of our shares in 2017 with the majority taking place in the first half of the year.","As is always the case, this assumes the stable capital conditions and the absence of any compelling alternatives. As we shared last week, last year was the 34th consecutive year in which we increased cash dividends. Our objective remains to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency.","You've heard me say that my job is the balance between the interests of all stakeholders. Just as we've done a good job of that in the past, I believe we're going to do it again in 2017 by delivering on our promise to our policyholder and enhancing shareholder value. I\u2019ve conclude by reiterating that and I'm more excited today than I have ever been about the future of Aflac.","And now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Fred.","Frederick Crawford","Thank you, Dan. Our earnings results for the first quarter were in line with our expectations and consistent with the guidance provided on our December outlook call. Operating EPS came in at a $1.67 per diluted share. There were no items worthy of calling out in the quarter. However, there were a couple of items running through net income and outside our definition of operating earnings.","We recorded a $14 million pretax charge associated with guaranty fund assessment on Penn Treaty or approximately $0.02 a share after tax and we booked approximately $6 million in pretax costs associated with our Japan branch conversion. The conversion remains on track and there is no change to our original guidance on conversion costs of $120 million to $130 million pretax through mid-2018.","We anticipate conversion costs picking up pace in the second quarter and we will continue to disclose them as part of our quarterly reporting. Our Japan segment margins were solid in the quarter and reflect the inclusion of amortize hedge costs as part of investment income.","As we have communicated, commented on over the past few years, premium weakness in the period was largely attributed to our first sector five-pay WAYS products hitting paid up status, which alone contributed to nearly \u00a510 billion decline in first sector premium in the quarter.","As a reminder, while the paid-up product impacts revenue, we have booked a deferred profit liability that amortizes into earnings and service to largely mitigate any bottom line impact. Benefit and expense ratios in Japan were in line with our outlook call guidance. The decline in investment income reflects our fourth quarter switch trade selling higher yielding bonds and investing proceeds in JGBs as we build out our floating rate portfolio with 2017 cash flows.","Hedge costs were up as expected over the 2016 quarter and we have locked in over 90% of our anticipated costs in 2017. We are now on track to come in at the low end of our full-year guidance range of $250 million to $270 million pretax.","Turning to U.S. segment, Dan noted improved persistency, up nearly 1% over the previous year's quarter and supporting a premium growth rate of 1.7%. Benefit ratios were solid recognizing last year's performance was particularly favorable. Our expense ratio was at the high end of our guidance range and reflects progress on certain platform investments, including our group administrative platform and enrollment platform and related technology.","Overall, our U.S. pretax profit margin of 19.7% is strong by historical standards and in line with our guidance. Before commenting on capital, the first quarter was an active period a successful execution on our tactical investment strategy to build back net investment income after our 2016 switch trade and stabilizing near-term hedge costs.","We announced an alliance with NXT Capital to build out our middle market private debt portfolio. These assets have attractive yields in the floating rate structure is an attractive asset to hold in our Japan dollar portfolio as they are efficient to hedge. Along with allocating NXT an initial $500 million portfolio, we invested $50 million in the equity of NXT Capital and look forward to developing a strategic partnership as we build this important asset class.","In addition, we lengthened the duration of our hedge program through purchasing 1.5 billion of long-dated five-year forwards and have now locked in nearly 50% of hedge costs for 2018. While hedge costs have resin over the past couple of years, a flattening of the costs curve in favorable market conditions offered us an opportunity to lock in future costs without pressuring 2017 net investment income.","These strategies are all steps in building out of three bucket portfolio approach to managing the U.S. dollar program in Japan. Those buckets include first, unhedged dollar investments where capacity is guided by our view of the risk-adjusted economic value of our Japan branch and capital volatility.","Second, a disciplined approach to building out a short duration floating-rate loan portfolio where LIBOR-based yields are correlated to hedge cost and are primarily hedge was short-dated forwards. Finally, a diversified debt portfolio where we are actively extending the duration of our hedge instruments reducing near-term exposure to rising hedge costs. Early execution on this strategy has reduced investment income in the short run, but once fully developed, will build back income with less volatility.","Our capital ratios remain very strong. SMR is estimated to be in the mid-900% range and RBC estimated in the 875% range at quarter end. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of excess liquidity at the holding company, which includes $500 million of contingency capital. Leverage remains at the low end of our policy range of 20% to 25% consistent with securing our strong ratings.","Overall credit conditions and asset quality remained strong with only a modest level of impairments in the quarter. Including dividends and share repurchase, we returned approximately $773 million to our shareholders in the first quarter. We repurchased $600 million of stock in the first quarter and on track to repurchase between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion for the year.","This again assumes repurchase of the optimal use of excess and deployable capital. Including our common dividend we are reaffirming our guidance of deploying $2 billion to $2.2 billion to shareholders in 2017. We announced a few weeks ago, the launch of Aflac corporate ventures.","We expect to invest approximately $100 million over the next few years in early stage companies with focus across the insurance value chain, insurance and benefits digital innovation and customer experience. While a modest commitment of capital, we are already actively investing in select properties in the U.S. and Japan and expect our investments will generate solid returns and contribute to Aflac's future growth.","Finally, I want to reiterate our 2017 earnings guidance of $6.40 to $6.65 per share on a currency neutral basis. Looking ahead, we remain well positioned in terms of our core margins and capital strength, consistent with our December outlook call comments.","Before we have hand call back to David for Q&A. Paul and I want to comment briefly on two notable senior management announcements that Dan referenced earlier. First, I want to welcome Max Broden to the team here at Aflac as our new Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Max is known to many of you and his previous position as Global Insurance Portfolio Manager for Norges Bank. Max brings great experience and perspective to Aflac and optimizing our capital allocation and deployment strategies to drive long-term value. Max is responsible for Treasury, Corporate Finance, Investors and Rating Agency relationships and partnering with Teresa and our team on U.S. corporate development opportunities.","I'll now hand out the Paul on our Japan leadership announcement. Paul?","Paul Amos","Thank you, Fred, and good morning. As you're probably aware from our release earlier this week. We announced the Hiroshi Yamauchi who currently serves Aflac Japan's President and Chief Operating Officer will be assuming the role of Vice Chairman of Aflac Japan in July as it passes the torch of President and Chief Operating Officer of Aflac Japan to Masatoshi Koide.","When someone has impacted the Company as much as Yamauchi-san hasn't impacted Aflac Japan starting in the first recruited class of college graduates 41 years ago, when our Aflac Japan operation was in its infancy. It is astounding to consider the changes he has seen and the initiatives. He has been a vital part of implementing. We will certainly continue to benefit from his support of Aflac Japan from a broader perspective as he assumes the role of Vice Chairman of Aflac Japan.","This transition also highlights one of the many major strength and that is Yamaguchi-san\u2019s leadership and his vision for succession planning. When he assume the role as President of Aflac Japan two years ago his main goal was to identify and prepare a successor. And that's exactly what he's done by identifying and preparing Koide-san\u2019s to be President and Chief Operating Officer of Aflac Japan effective July 1.","Now let me turn the call over to Koide is on to make a few comments.","Masatoshi Koide","Thank you, Paul. I am Masatoshi Koide effective July 1, I will assume the role of Aflac Japan President and Chief Operating Officer. I would like to take a moment to introduce myself and talk a bit about how I plan to approach my role as Aflac Japan President. I started by professional career in the Japanese banking sector in 1984 and joined Aflac Japan in 1998. I first worked in investments and the moved to legal and compliance, since then I have been working in various areas. In recent years as Executive Vice President, I have been overseeing corporate planning and have worked with Dan, Paul, Charles and Yamauchi who designed and developed our Aflac Japan\u2019s business strategy.","In addition, I support all as the Japan owner of the overall project to convert Aflac Japan to our subsidiary. Our Deputy President currently oversee all Aflac Japan divisions and serve as Yamaguchi-san is Deputy. In this context, I also have had the owner of leading the team that drafted Aflac Japan\u2019s long-term strategy beyond 2024, which I presented at the Financial Analyst meeting in Tokyo last September.","Beyond 2024, days out by mid to long-term direction for Aflac Japan by the end of 2024, which will mark its 50th anniversary, against the backdrop of business environment change driven by a rapidly aging society and information technology innovation. Aflac Japan is committed continuing to create new value and growth by adapting to and embracing change.","Aflac Japan is currently implementing its three-year medium-term business plan under Vision 2024. And from this July, it would be my responsibility as President to ensure these efforts produce sound result. As Aflac Japan\u2019s President, I am determined to ensure that Aflac Japan continues to be the leading company that supports creating dealing in your own way. Thank you.","I will now turn the call back over to Paul.","Paul Amos","Thank you, Koide. I know Koide-san will continue to do an exceptional job in his new role as President and Chief Operating Officer. Koide-san\u2019s shares Yamauchi-san\u2019s same dedication and work ethic. He has been driving force and guiding our Japan branch conversion.","Now I'll turn the call back over to David, who will bring us to Q&A.","David Young","Thank you, Paul. Now we are ready to take your questions. But first let me remind you that to be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to one initial question and only one follow-up that relates to your initial question. We will now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session at today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Dally","Typically in the past when you've introduced new product, sales of that product benefit, but it comes at the expense of lower sales of other products. That didn't seem to be the case this quarter, medical sales benefited, but cancer plan remains strong remained strong. So hoping to get a little color as to what was different this quarter?","Paul Amos","Yes. This is Paul. I\u2019d be more than happy to answer that Nigel. The reality is as we've talked to you about 13 weeks of sales are sometimes difficult to predict. In this particular case, we felt like sales had the potential to be down for multiple reasons that we mentioned on the previous call, and one of those was our key alliance partners who primarily focused or solely focused on selling our cancer plan, we felt we're going to focus on their own internal products more than they were focusing on selling Aflac products. For our benefit that didn't so return out to be the case.","We saw that many of our alliance partners continued to sell well and our cancer line of business for that primary reason was propped up by those sales. In terms of our other products, as you may have seen the income support product was down slightly sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. Part of that had to do with the increased focus in our agency channel and traditional channel on selling our new EVER plan. So we believe that the quarter results from a sales perspective exceeded our expectations. Our sales of EVER launched more quickly than we anticipated.","This was in part due to the launch of not only the traditional product, but also an additional two-pay and five-pay version of the product, which has similar profit characteristics to the overall \u2013 that only added about an additional 2% of sales up 5% versus up 7%. But overall, we've felt that sales for the quarter did an exceptional job. Koji and his team performed across all channels and we were very happy to see our alliance partners performed in the cancer line of business.","Nigel Dally","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. First, I just had a follow-up on just Japan sales. Has the growth in sales in 1Q affected your view for the rest of the year and specifically if you think about the new \u2013 the device EVER that you launched in February. To what extent has it fully ramped up or do you expect that to happen in the second quarter and provide a lift to sales in the near-term?","Daniel Amos","Do you expect so much for the question. The reality is that we are not ready to make any change to our sales thoughts in future so far. First quarter did however exceed our expectations, but it's difficult for us to tell over \u2013 the remaining three quarters of the year, how that will bear out. We are happy with where we stand in terms of the launch of EVER at this time and we do believe that will be a boost to our second quarter.","However, we had already been planning forward to be a strong boost for our second quarter. We didn't however expect it to sell so well in March. So the reality is as it's ramped up, we expect to do well, but I want to be cautious just because I believe that we have tough comparisons coming later in the year and I don't \u2013 I'm not yet ready to commit to any change in our guidance.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then you had a fairly large derivative loss, I think around $90 million \u2013 $92 million this quarter. Could you discuss what the drivers of that were?","Frederick Crawford","Yes Jimmy, this is Fred. So there is a few things running through that number that really are somewhat non-economic in nature and that is we have treasury swaps on our books, which do nothing more than swap dollar to yen and those swaps are mark-to-market. There is a portion of the swap. It's actually recorded through investment \u2013 interest expense, as you would expect, but then there's a mark-to-market portion. And so as there is movement in the yen, you will sometimes have wide marks on those swaps.","The second component is that we've been ramping up a commercial mortgage loan and middle market loan portfolio in Japan and we hedge those portfolios, but in the way the accounting works under GAAP is you don't have the mark-to-market dynamic on those loans on our books. But you do mark the hedging instruments and that separation in the treatment between the loan approach and the derivatives will create some noise and so we had some losses related that again not economic as it's meant to be part of a long-term strategy.","And then we also have some remeasurement that takes places. This is nothing more than U.S. dollar cash and related liquidity that's in Japan that gets remeasured if you will, as U.S. dollar assets held in Japan. So that's really the noise running through that number. It will fluctuate from period-to-period, sometimes it will add to net income, sometimes take away, but largely uneconomic and nature.","Jimmy Bhullar","And shouldn't really affect your free cash flow or dividends from the business?","Frederick Crawford","That's right. That's essentially what I mean by economic. It's not having implications on free cash flow.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the hedging costs. So you mentioned right now, you're looking at towards the lower end of your guidance of $250 million for a full-year 2017. So comparing these at $52 million in the quarter, this seems to be still kind of below what the quarterly run rates were implied based on the lower end? How should we think about the trajectory of the hedging cost for the balance of the year?","Frederick Crawford","Yes, so you're right to point this out. If you recall on the fourth quarter of last year, we recorded a little north of $60 million. Now in the first quarter, you're seeing that amortized level step back to $52 million. That's nothing more than really two basic components. One is recall to switch trade that we executed on in roughly the November time period last year that resulted in a move out of bonds, which were hedged into JGBs and as a result of that, we brought the notional down pretty considerably. That was a $2.5 billion switch trade.","So that brought the notional down and so somewhat of what you're seeing in the first quarter is a natural ramping up then of the floating rate portfolio, which is starting the process of ramping up. It won't pick up steam until we move into the second half of the year.","So you're going to see a natural rise in the hedge costs throughout the year as we build out that portfolio. Now realize while that is taking place, you\u2019re also seeing rise in net investment income as we put to work the money in the floating rate investments, but that's how it will move forward.","The other element of it, that's worth noting is that we did actually proactively bring the hedge ratio down a bit. We currently run around the $22 billion market values U.S. dollar portfolio of currently and we have as you know from our disclosures, not quite $11 billion of that hedged with forwards about $10.7 billion. We brought that hedge ratio down a little bit and we use the economics of bringing that down to execute on the $1.5 billion five-year forwards that we purchased.","So think of it this way on the money we saved by bringing some of the hedge ratio down we spent that economics to extend the duration of the hedge program, it made sense from a risk management and market perspective. However, when we did buy those long dated hedges we got amount pretty good prices, better than we thought, because the market had cooperated on the long side so we took advantage of it.","So those things are actually favoring our hedge costs and allowing us to be comfortable with the low end of the range. But the build-up is more naturally going to take place as we build the portfolio.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Thank you. And then [indiscernible], so there is some discussion about the changing mortality table in Japan. Can you talk about how that would affects your in-force business and new product pricing, especially given my understanding is that the change in the mortality table would suggest higher pricing for the third sector product?","Frederick Crawford","I'll ask that Todd to comment on developments on that front.","Todd Daniels","Yes, thanks Fred. For the in-force business, the more changed mortality table would not have an impact, but when you start selling new products. Obviously that table would have to be reflected in your reserve assumptions. We would review the table relative to where we are with our current assumptions with pricing, but we don't have to reflect that table with the new premiums, but we will investigated and I think that's coming out April 2018. So we have a little bit of time.","Humphrey Lee","Basically my conversations with some of the Japanese insurers. They talk about because of the competition in the marketplace it will be difficult for them to pass through some of the required price increases to the marketplace. Do you get a sense the discounts similar to what\u2019s you're seeing over there?","Daniel Amos","I think we're still going to have to review the assumption relative to where we are with premiums and capital strain with those products. So hopefully later in the year, we would be able to comment further on it.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning, everybody. Just want to go back the second to third sector sales in Japan. So the pressure from partnership sales did not really manifest suppose as you'd expected do you think it's something that could still pop-up later in the year?","Paul Amos","Well, as you may recall, Japan's fiscal year runs April through March. And so what we believe was that our partners we\u2019re going to primarily focused on finishing the Japanese fiscal year with that transition and they have obviously not finished in the year in a different way. I mean somewhere internal product but also sold our.","We do believe that the sales of our two paid product help add some benefit to the quarter and could continue to do so going into the next quarter. But the reality is that as we go into the next Japan fiscal year we've renegotiated as we always do with all of our partners and we are hopeful and continue to believe that our alliance partnerships will continue to yield good results going into the next Japanese fiscal year which began April 1.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. And then my follow-up question, I realize this framework is still a work in progress , but I think industry ESR levels actually came in quite a bit given the low rate environment. And then Japan you maybe give us an update on where Aflac stands there?","Daniel Amos","Yes, actually what we have seen - the last we commented on again the economic solvency ratio is but we've goes by different names in Japan, but effectively that that ratio was that our fab meeting in Tokyo and you might remember at that time I'm going to guess you're quite honestly, I don't have it in front of me, but 30-year JGBs were very low at that time they had actually recovered a bit by the time we got to our conference but they were still, I would say, certainly I think sub-50 basis points if I recall right.","Today, the 30-year JGB is upwards of north of 80 basis points. I mentioned the 30-year JGB because that has an awful lot of directional impact if you will, on how to think about these economic ratios. At that time, I'd mentioned being in the 160% range asset ratio, which is quite strong. Today given the rates having recovered a bit in Japan, we are pretty consistently recording a ratio in and around 200%, which is quite strong.","I would note that the mix of our business tends to make us happy \u2013 tends to yield a much better ratio than many that are more concentrated in first sector business. The other very important thing to remember if you recall, our comments at the conferences that don't lose sight of the fact that that's also assuming in ultimate forward rate recovery that is put into.","It's really a long-dated recovery rate that's assumed in the formula which contributes to it, but is believed to be the type of practice that would be eventually adopted. Now again, remember, this is in testing phase. It's still a bit unclear as to the precise of the calculation once adopted if adopted and the pattern or method of adoption. But we've been tracking it and we continue to be very healthy.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks, good morning. Fred, on the 50% of the hedge costs locked in for 2018. Could you disclose at what level of cost in base points that is in, and then where forward hedge costs are running at this point?","Frederick Crawford","I will pass to Eric, on the forward hedge cost. And I don\u2019t know Eric if you got anything on the cost going out into 2018, I would suspect it's approaching 198-ish basis points in that range, maybe a bit north of that.","Eric Kirsch","Yes. It's a bit north of that because in 2018, as Fred mentioned earlier, we executed on five-year forward, so when you think about the forward curve for hedge costs, those are higher going out five years then say one-year hedge cost or two-year hedge cost, but what I can share with you is based on that 50% locked in and sort of looking at forward markets for the other 50% estimates of our cash flow, we would be running at about 224 basis points for next year. Again, that reflects the lengthening of duration, locking in a five-year forward on those hedge costs.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. Okay, thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on the excess capital. I guess the $1.7 billion of excess liquidity at the holding company. How much of the U.S. excess capital has been upstreamed at this point?","Frederick Crawford","So we have not \u2013 if what you're referring to is the excess capital that we would expect to unlock as part of our Japan branch conversion. We have not moved any significant portion of excess capital up to the holding company at this point. It would be a little premature to do that. We are however though proactively moving, what I would call excess cash flow or free cash flow generated on our U.S. property up to the holding company. But we have not necessarily started into the movement of the excess capital that we expect to create mid-2018 upon conversion.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, great. Thank you.","Frederick Crawford","One other thing I would say about 2018 hedge cost that's worthy of note two, is recalled that we are ramping up the floating rate portfolio as part of our strategy. And remember that floating rate portfolio will be largely hedged and largely hedged with very short-dated forwards which depending on the nature of the curve should be less expensive. And so ultimately we'll have a blended cost structure as we go into 2018, but our forecast is for rising hedge cost and until that changes it's good to be certainly prudent on the estimate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. Here is a question for Teresa. On the fourth quarter call you outlined a number of initiatives to boost sales and address the areas of weakness from 2016. So just hoping you could provide an update on those and which are already starting to have an impact versus which ones will kick in later in the year?","Teresa White","Thank you, Eric. In the fourth quarter, I talked a little bit about four areas and those areas where career agent sales and specifically veteran engagement. We talked about the middle market, broker sales, sales leadership and then public sector. And so I'll just kind of go through each of those. From a career agent standpoint, we're seeing better than expected new associate conversion to producer, which is a positive underlying metrics.","We're also seeing better veteran engagements and a lot of that we believe is due to some of the compensation strategies that we have in place. So we do see and actually a large part of our increased for the first quarter was the veteran engagement piece of that. So we do see that working for us.","Then we talked about in the broker sales side and we specifically talked about the mid-market, we are hiring 25% increase in our broker sales professionals and as we do that we've already hired about 50% of that number and we've onboard at those folks and we're continuing to hire and up through the second quarter and we really don't expect a positive result of that until the second half of the year. And so that \u2013 but that's going well for us.","And then on the public sector side, I believe talked about additional competition that we were seeing in the public sector market. And we've also had a department here over the public sector arm of the business and we have a large book of business public sector. And so we are making sure that we protect our book of business, but we're also building out strategies that our tools and services for the public sector market and so that is well on its way as well and we expect to see results with that in the second half of the year as well.","Erik Bass","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Seth Weiss","Great, thank you. Just a follow-up on Erik's question, it sounds like there will be a lot of expense initiatives on the average turn around in the U.S. sales channels that may yield sales in the back half of the year into 2018. How should we think about the expense ratio for the U.S. with regard to your guidance within this context here?","Frederick Crawford","Yes, this is Fred. There will be quarter-to-quarter some ebb and flow in the pace of expense because these are projects that will naturally move around a bit, but our guidance remains the outlook call range on expense ratio of 34% to 35%. So we're running a bit high as I mentioned in my comments in the first quarter, but we would expect that to moderate as we go through the year. It's the first quarter and so as we move through the year, we see some difference in that will of course communicate that to all of you. But as it stands right now, our plans are for to be running in the essentially the middle of that 34% to 35% range.","Seth Weiss","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","Great, thanks. Just wanted to circle back to U.S. again, when you first entered the broker market in the large case side of the business, you ran into this channel conflict with the career agents. So as you expand the broker market into the middle market, what are you doing differently to avoid any future channel conflict in that area of the business?","Teresa White","Thanks for the questions Suneet. This is Teresa. The primary driver or the primary success measure for us is ensuring that in that market if we have a employers that have brokers that we honor that and we work with the broker side. We have sales leadership. Our sales leadership quite frankly just have been very impressed with because that leadership is working from the career side and the broker leadership side are working together to tackle this mid-market space.","The strategy that was put together, it's really put together by those leaders and certainly there are going to be still be conflict with those leaders are working to manage through that complex and a lot of the \u2013 what we're really trying to do is we're trying to put compensation where we want each of those channels to play and I think we\u2019ve seeing some success and doing that. And so we hope to see that same success in the middle market as well.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then I guess maybe bigger picture question for the U.S., I mean you continue to target this 3% to 5% long-term sales growth. And if you look over the past five years or so, I think you\u2019ve only been there in that range one. So I guess at what point do you think you'll be able to get into that range on a sustainable basis.","Daniel Amos","Well, again we actually are looking at this for the long-term, we are continuing to progress towards that long-term 3% to 5% and at this point, what we're doing is we're rebuilding some of our strategies, we are assessing the underlying metrics and I do believe that we're actually seeing progress towards our longer-term goal. So we expect to continue to progress toward that long-term CAGR.","Paul Amos","I would like to make a comment on that I believe that the foundations that we're setting right now give us an opportunity, and we should be able to do that, whether it's going to be when exactly I'm not sure, but I know the new systems we're putting in is going to give us a big competitive advantage on the group insurance. And frankly we've been evolving into that as you know over the years and we're getting better at it broker strategy is beginning to what - the challenge has been much like it was an Aflac Japan as we have shifted from just being corporate agency driven in Japan to add the alternative distribution system is the corporate agencies what kept to support for many years.","Well, our field force is still key to keeping it growing or at least flat while these new areas specifically broker are growing our business and so that's been the challenge, but it's, it gets closer our field every year and once it does. I think we'll see take back off do well and I'm encouraged with the things we're doing.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Fred or Eric, I just wanted to make sure I understood what you guys said about the hedging costs and that would imply at least as in the initial run rate of overall hedge cost for 2018. The 224 basis points I'm just not sure notional amount to compare that with because I know that moved around a bit. With that be, can you give us ballpark range, is that going to be meaningfully above the $250 million to $275 million 2017 run rate hedge cost?","Frederick Crawford","A couple things I would say Tom, one is this sort of creeping into 2018 outlook comments around earnings and earnings drivers is a bit premature. And so I would suggest you that we would hold to refine those types of comments and guidance. More specifically, as we approach fab in September and are able to outline it together with the strategy in a course the outlook call. So I don't want to front run our traditional pattern of guidance. What we do plan to do those built that U.S. dollar portfolio throughout the year.","As I mentioned, we're running at about $22 billion now that will build to approximately $25 billion at the end of the year. We're currently running at about a 50% hedge ratio using forwards only remember we do use collars on the unhedged portion, but just forwards, which drives the cost. We run around 50% hedge ratio, so you would expect the notional decline throughout the year to approaching between $12 billion and $13 billion and then you start applying your cost. But it's a little easy to move in. It's a little early rather to move into forecasting hedge cost ranges next year.","Also remember we're disclosing this is part of our net investment income for a reason. And that is, don't just isolate hedge costs remember, in part they're building because we are proactively building out a floating rate portfolio that has very attractive yields. So while we see some rising hedge cost we're also building net investment income in the process and we need to be mindful. We will provide greater detail as we start to move into really 2018 comments more broadly.","Tom Gallagher","That's helpful perspective Fred, because, yes, so it sounds like it's going to be against the smaller notional amount. So wouldn't if you just took the nominal increase in basis points it would imply like a spike and hedge cost, but it sounds like there will some offset. I just wanted to understand directionally that point?","Frederick Crawford","Yes, it\u2019s really, really the best answer is just it takes a holistic understanding of where you going to be U.S. dollar portfolio and its mix, what is your hedge ratio philosophy and why. This is the three buckets we're talking about. And then of course, execution, which includes the pricing and market pricing. And that's the type of color and backdrop that we will provide when really we start into the planning process around 2018 and can give more refinement, namely an outlook calls and some strategic color at our FAB.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then just a follow-up on \u2013 there were higher incurred claims in Japan during the quarter. If you look at the mix, how the benefit ratio played out, you had lower future policy benefit reserves being put up and you had higher incurred claims. Was there a mix shift something going on there that you could explain?","Daniel Amos","Let me just pass one thing before we answer that. Eric do you want to add something?","Eric Kirsch","I just wanted to emphasize, Fred's mentioned the three buckets and the build-out of the floating rate portfolio. Keep in mind the strategic reasons besides liking the asset class from a credit perspective. Floating rate assets or short duration, their coupons float with LIBOR, which has a high correlation, not a perfect one to hedge costs. So was this floating rate portfolio grows, you guys will be able to see that the net margin for the net income, gross income from the floaters less hedge costs becomes much more stable in our net investment income.","It won\u2019t be a perfect match for quarter-to-quarter because the floaters may reset on different dates and hedge costs, but that's the concept. So that's just important to note that notional couldn\u2019t jump as the floating rates build. Net investment income will go up with the exchange for the switch trade build that back up and becomes much more stable in the future.","Daniel Amos","And then Tom, I\u2019m going to turn to Todd. I know the interaction you are talking about there in a way of paid claims and FBR on the P&L this quarter, so Todd any color you are able to provide.","Todd Daniels","Yes. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color on that. There is normal seasonality that happens in the first quarter and the benefits in Japan with extra lapses that happen around, what I'll call retirement or leaving your employer that happens at the end of March. So you have incurred claims are going to include your cash surrender value. And when we pay that cash surrender value, we typically release the reserve associated with that policy. So you would have a lower change in FPB for the quarter.","Tom Gallagher","So really it's just related to lapsation and releasing the reserve due to that.","Todd Daniels","That\u2019s correct.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We have one more in the queue and it is coming from John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Nadel","Thanks for sneaking me, and good morning. Maybe a question for Teresa, just a little bit more follow-up on the U.S., I think you sort of hinted at the veteran agents having a bit more of a \u2013 bit better production this quarter. Can you give us a sense when you breakdown the 1.5% year-over-year growth in sales where the real drivers were. I mean we know it from a product perspective, it looks like the short-term disability product was the key driver. But can you help us understand which of the pieces of the distribution mix drove it?","Teresa White","Certainly, you're right, we benefited from higher than expected short-term disability sales in Q1. But the other piece of this is Everwell adoption. We also benefited from higher Everwell adoption. And if you remember, I\u2019ll recall Everwell is our small business solutions and we get higher policyholder participation rates with Everwell versus our FNG unit. So many of our state organizations have adjusted their training, they\u2019ve engaged the veterans and training of the Everwell unit.","And so we see a lot more of our adoption of Everwell. I think we had about, around 28% adoption of Everwell this quarter and that was well above what we had anticipated that we would have. So the increased productivity of those veterans, we also had a couple of initiatives to specifically and these were compensation initiatives where we were driving veterans to go back into some of our existing accounts to offer additional product and services. And so we saw success with that initiative as well. So again, if I sum them up, it\u2019s the veteran engagement and it would be technology with our Everwell unit that increased our productivity.","John Nadel","And maybe can you just touch on what you saw from the broker channel as well?","Teresa White","From the broker channel, we were relatively flat when you look at the mid case market and the large case market. And we expect to see a lot more from our broker side in the second half of the year.","John Nadel","And then, Fred, one last one, just on the ratio of hedged to unhedged U.S. dollar investments added the Japanese arm. How should we think about your risk limits there and I know you're not really leaving the other 50% on the hedge, but how do we think about risk limits there?","Frederick Crawford","Yes, I think the way to think about is for quite a long time Aflac as always had a level of unhedged U.S. dollar portfolio a long time and it tends to be myriad up to the GAAP equity if you will that we had allocated to the Japan branch and I want to recall that travel to say in the $7 billion to $8 billion territory for example, perhaps a little less than that.","But nevertheless it was always in that category. So the idea of it unhedged portion, if you will of the portfolio is frankly nothing new. Really what we're introducing is more what you're seeing from a number of companies that operate in Japan and go down this type of a portfolio strategy, which is becoming more common and that is particularly U.S. companies that have Japanese branches or subsidiaries.","What is the economic value that's driven in that branch? The theory being that value over time comes back in dollar form. And so as a result, what really is an amount of unhedged that you can make an economic case for and risk case for. And as is always the case with a Company that's performing very well and as we are in Japan, your economic value tends to be quite a bit north of what you may be holding in the way of GAAP book equity. And so it allows you to think more about a higher dollar amount that you can hold unhedged.","Now however, there are risk limitations to that and the risk tends to be revolving around SMR volatility, potential FSA volatility and you do to some degree depending on the collar structure, need to be thinking about carrying more capital against that type of a strategy, and so we have to think about a capital adjusted value proposition of going more unhedged.","So that's the way in which we think about it, there is some fairly good signs and stress testing about what you can tolerate. But it's allowing us to drift up if you will in an amount unhedged, but protecting the outer limits of movement through collars. Hopefully that helps, but it's \u2013 that's what I mean by an economic value driven approach, but again very importantly it's a stressed economic value. Don\u2019t confuse it with what you might post or calculate. It's also got to be under stress conditions.","John Nadel","Understood, and then one last one, since on last I'll sneak one housekeeping item in. How much was repatriated during the quarter?","Frederick Crawford","I think we repatriated a bit north of \u00a530 billion if I recall right, let me see if I can get that number.","John Nadel","Thank you.","Frederick Crawford","I have it handy, but let me actually should be able to gather if you just give me a minute, got it right here, \u00a531 billion year-to-date.","John Nadel","Perfect, thank you so much.","Frederick Crawford","And operator, are there any other calls in queue?","End of Q&A","Operator","I see no questions in queue at this time sir.","Frederick Crawford","Thank you.","David Young","Thank you. For those of you that have questions after this call, please feel free to contact our Investor and Rating Agency Relations Department. We will be happy to answer your questions and look forward to speaking with you then. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. You may begin.","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Ken Janke, President of Aflac U.S., Executive Vice President, and Deputy CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer, and also joining us from Tokyo are Paul Amos, President of Aflac and Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac, Japan.","Before we start, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of Federal Securities laws. Although, we believe these statements are reasonable, we give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate, because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discussed today. We encourage you to look at our fourth quarter release for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and year as well as our operations in Japan. I will follow up and then we will take your questions afterwards. Dan?","Daniel P. Amos","Thanks Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2014 concluded another good year for Aflac. I am excited about the incredibly strong fourth quarter sales results in both the United States and Japan and on top of that we have finished the year at the high end of our expectations for operating earnings per share growth. ","Let me begin with some highlights related to the Japanese operations. Aflac Japan's impressive 28.5% increase in third sector sales in the final quarter of 2014 is particularly remarkable to me considering the significant growth follows two years of excellent sales results in the fourth quarter. Sales of cancer insurance surged following the launch of the new cancer WAYS [ph] product which also included an exclusive product sold by Japan Post. Cancer insurance sales through all distribution outlets were up an outstanding 176% for the quarter. This dramatic increase in cancer insurance sales was critical to Aflac Japan reaching the high end of the 2% to 7% annual target. ","On the distribution side, our traditional agencies have been and remain key to our success. Additionally I consider our strategic alliance with Japan Post to be enormously advantageous. This alliance merges the broad consumer access of Japan Post with Japan Aflac's status of an industry leader of cancer insurance. Tremendous progress has been made in increasing the number of postal outlets that offer our cancer insurance to our customers. I would remind you that Japan Post has the largest distribution network in Japan. I believe Aflac Japan and Japan Post will continue to be mutually beneficial as we make cancer insurance available to more and more Japanese consumers. Our goal is to have a presence in all the outlets where consumers want to make their insurance purchase decisions. ","In Japan, I think about sales for a 12 month period from October 1st, 2014 through September 30th, 2015. For the nine months of 2015, we project a 15% increase in third sector sales. When you add the 28% increase from the fourth quarter we could be close to a 20% increase over the rolling 12 month period. Please note that this 12 months rolling period will be the biggest third sector increase in more than 10 years. We are reviewing fourth quarter sales and the difficult comparisons it will experience in 2015. At this point we believe sales for the fourth quarter could be down sharply but as always we will be working to find ways to minimize that decline. At the end of the second quarter we will have more insight and will give you additional guidance on the fourth quarter. ","Aflac Japan has also performed extremely well in the fourth quarter with $454 million in new sales or 14.1% increase exceeding our expectations. The strong fourth quarter sales drove our total new sales to 1.4 billion which is approximately 1% increase. Which also significantly exceeded our most recent sales expectations for the year. I believe the changes we made to our sales organization in the third quarter are showing promising results but I am not willing to say yet that the sales have turned around until I see the first half sales results in 2015. Saying that I am still encouraged and I believe we should be or have an increase of somewhere between 3% to 7% with a target of 5%. ","I also want to mention that we have a ground breaking new marketing campaign that I mentioned on CNBC this morning. We\u2019re kicking it off at the Grammy\u2019s on Sunday. And on E-Entertainment channel, the preshow the Aflac Duck will be the first ever advertising icon to walk the red carpet. During the Grammy\u2019s, a new commercial will feature the Aflac Duck but it will focus on one day pay, which highlights our new accelerated claims payments. One day pay is an industry first that allows us to process, approve, and pay in just one day, which would be about 70% of our eligible claims. ","Through one day pay we expect to pay more than a million claims in 2015. I hope you all get a chance to see the commercial and the campaign. I am very excited about it and I think it will set us apart in the industry thus increasing our sales. You can also go to our website and see more about it. ","Having covered operations let me turn to a topic on those top of mind with our shareholders and that\u2019s capital deployment. I believe dividends are our important components of the value we provide to investors. In 2014, our capital strength enabled us to increase our cash dividend to shareholders in the fourth quarter for the 32nd consecutive year. Our objective is to grow the dividend at the rate it\u2019s generally in line with the earnings per share growth before the impact of the yen. ","Additionally we believe that share repurchase should continue to be the largest component of our capital deployment. I am very pleased that in 2015 we plan to repurchase $1.3 billion of shares which exceeds the 2014 repurchase. As we\u2019ve said for many years, when it comes to deploying capital for the benefit of our shareholders we still believe that repurchasing of our shares and growing the cash dividend are the most attractive means and those are the avenues we will continue to pursue. ","Let me reiterate what I said in the press release last night. I am very pleased that we ended the year with our operating earnings per share at the high end of the 2014 estimate. And although the results creates a tougher comparison when we look at 2015, our objective remains to grow 2015 operating earnings per diluted share before the currency at the 2% to 7% range. Because overall financial markets are currently very challenging and interest rates are at significantly depressed levels, it\u2019s difficult to invest cash flows at attractive yields. Therefore we will be very disciplined in selling per sector products in Japan which will reduce cash flows to investments. ","I will also remind you that the progression of this year\u2019s benefit ratios in both the United States and Japan which have seen favorable trends could also have significant impact on our results. As always we are working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objectives while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policy holders. Just let me in by saying how proud I am of the how hard our people in both Japan and the United States have worked to pull out such phenomenal fourth quarter results. Everyone involved has been relentless and disciplined in their pursuit of excellence. ","I am also pleased with Aflac\u2019s position in Japan and the United States, the two largest insurance markets in the world. First and foremost, we are focused on protecting our policy holders and providing value to our investors. We are fortunate that in the process of doing so we have the privilege of providing financial protection to over 50 million people worldwide. Now I will turn the program back over to Robin, Robin?","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thank you Dan. We now run on a tight time frame this morning and we will have to end sharply at 10 o'clock. So in lieu of the numbers I normally give, we are going to go straight to Q&A. But please remember that we are available in the office for any specific numbers that you want to get following the call. So we will start now with our first question please. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Alright, thank you and our first question is from Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley. ","Nigel Dally","Right, thanks and good morning. In the U.S. clearly encouraging sales, but the one area that was somewhat weak was recruiting. So two part question, what was causing the pressures and what initiatives do you have in place to turn that around?","Teresa White","Nigel, this is Teresa White. In the U.S. we actually expected a slight decline in recruiting. As you are aware, recruiting includes the career recruit and broker recruit. So as we made changes to our model that we spoke about six months ago, we realized that what we wanted to do is focus on broker productivity, so really managing the relationship with the broker. So we are looking up the quality of that relationship versus the quantity of recruits from a broker perspective. However on the career side, we are continuing to work with our sales organization to increase the recruits in sales. But we did expect a slight decline in recruits this year in 2014. ","Nigel Dally","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from Randy Binner of FBR Capital. Mr. Binner if you are on mute please unmute. And we will go on to Steven Schwartz, Raymond James and Associates. ","Steven Schwartz","Hey, good morning everybody. Can you hear me. ","Daniel P. Amos","Yes, we can. ","Steven Schwartz","Okay, great. Dan, I want to talk about kind of your fourth quarter 2015 thing in Japan. It looks like the fourth quarter cancer sales were driven by affiliated corporate agencies which I believe is where Japan Post is located in terms of your financial statements and I don\u2019t think there is any particular reason for non-Japan Post affiliated corporate agencies to really have surged in the quarter. So I guess I am interested in your worries with regards to 4Q 2015, I mean I understand being conservative and all but are you indicating maybe that Japan Post is kind of one in dime like maybe Dai Ichi or the banks where they pick up the low hanging fruit and then they are pretty much done and the growth is over?","Daniel P. Amos","No, I am not. But I just want to say, the increase again [Technical Difficulty] cancer sales were broad based. There is no question that Japan Post was significant but let me just say that it is the best increase in cancer sales in our existing channel that would probably add in, I can't remember how many years. So, I will let -- Kriss want to say something. ","Kriss Cloninger","I just want to point out Steven that it is the growth rate in the fourth quarter that we are more concerned about, it is the comparison not the absolute value. Japan can comment and affirm it but I believe that the projected sales in absolute terms or similar in the fourth quarter is to what they were, would be in the previous couple of quarters. And it is just the growth rate that will decline. So I want to clarify that. Now Paul or anybody else in Japan might want to elaborate. ","Paul S. Amos","Yes, first of all I would like to say that Dan and Kriss are correct that our channeled growth was across the board. While Japan Post was significant and provided significant growth around our cancer plan, we also saw significant growth not only in the corporate affiliated agencies but also with our independent agencies as well as our associates and all channels across the board. So we feel confident that, that growth was not about a single channel but about a broader environment where the Japanese consumers saw the need for our cancer product. We believe that will continue, thus our 15% increase projected over the next three quarters. ","As Kriss mentioned, he is correct, sequentially the numbers will remain the same as the rate of growth that we believe will really drop off in the fourth quarter. That said it\u2019s very difficult to tell this far out with all of the different things that we are monitoring how that\u2019s going to go. But, the outstanding fourth quarter that happened here in Japan happened due to a consorted effort by our sales team. It capped off on incredible career for Tohru Tonoike as our President who had everyone aligned and ready to execute. And we\u2019ve just gone through a wonderful succession here at Aflac Japan with Hiroshi Yamauchi coming on as the President. And I\u2019d like to just let him make a quick comment before we turn it back over. ","Hiroshi Yamauchi","Good morning. I am Hiroshi Yamauchi. As you know I assumed the position of President and COO of Aflac Japan as of January 1st this year. I joined Aflac Japan in 1976 as a member of the first group of new [indiscernible]. For the first 39 years including one year in Columbus I have been advancing my career with Aflac Japan\u2019s growth. Some of you may recall my name since I have given presentations in the Financial Alliance Briefing before. I look forward to seeing you all at the Alliance Meeting in May. Thank you. ","Steven Schwartz","Hey Paul, if I may one follow up. One day pay in Japan, is that a possibility I would think with the mis-selling stuff that\u2019s going on in the past this could be a really big thing?","Paul S. Amos","We are acutely focused on what our customer wants here in Japan and currently we believe our payment of claims in Japan is the fastest among all of the competitors that we have here in Japan. So while we are not doing the one day pay, we do believe we are ahead of the competition in terms of claim payment and we constantly monitor what our consumers want and if we deem that is where we want to go we would consider doing it. ","Steven Schwartz","Okay, thank you guys. ","Operator","Our next question is from Randy Binner, FBR Capital.","Randy Binner ","Hey, great. Good morning. I wanted to talk about the reinsurance, the retro that happened at the end of the year. Two part question; one is can you explain how the economics of that work and how that may have offset the upfront cost of the most recent reinsurance deal? And then secondly I am kind of interested in the outlook for you to do more deals and potentially more retrocessions back to -- I assume the retrocession was back to the Nebraska sub, thanks?","Daniel P. Amos","Let me start on that and Kriss may want to add something. We did execute an agreement to retrocede 50% of the second tranche. You recall that the second tranche released about 55 billion yen of FSA based reserves and that was executed on October 1st of last year. And so then we retroceded roughly half of that to actually our company that is domiciled in Columbia, South Carolina, CAIC or Aflac Group. And it effectively serves as an offset to the cost that we incurred for the reinsurance. So we\u2019ll pick up about $8 million or about a penny a share in this year from the retrocession which will reduce the cost of the second tranche which was probably around $0.025 a share still annualized. ","As far as the extent to which we might do this going forward, as I indicated at the analyst meeting we conducted in Tokyo last September, we are working on a multiyear capital plan, we are building out the framework for that plan and should be able to discuss more details at the Analyst Meeting in May. But I\u2019ll tell you we have been pleased with the reinsurance agreements we\u2019ve executed. It\u2019s an effective -- efficient and effective tool for us to use to release FSA based capital and we found that the retrocession is also a tool that we can use to try and minimize some of the cost of that transaction. So those are things that we\u2019ll consider as we go forward and build out our plan. ","Kriss Cloninger","The only thing I\u2019d add is that technically we said we retroceded, we Aflac Japan ceded a block of business to Swiss re and Swiss Re retroceded to our South Carolina company. It\u2019s an independent risk sharing transaction, it\u2019s a two legged transaction in Japan. Aflac Japan doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the retrocession. It doesn\u2019t impact their financials in anyway, they weren\u2019t involved in the transaction at all. The retrocession transaction was arranged between Aflac Incorporated and Swiss Re with an Aflac Incorporated subsidiary. So, just to clarify the technicalities of that. ","Randy Binner","And I guess just two quick follow ups, so why the assumption or the implication there would that Japan FSA is comfortable with this and further deals? And then the other one is just any characterization you can give us on the kind of slower activity or interest you are getting from some of the global reinsurers?","Daniel P. Amos","Well, the FSA recognizes that there is no arrangement between Aflac Japan and the retrocession arrangement at all. That's solely between the assuming party from the Aflac Japan Reinsurance and Aflac Incorporated through the South Carolina subsidiary. So, the FSA recognizes Aflac Japan is not party to the retrocession, therefore they aren\u2019t involved in it. So that's no problem. Remind me what the second part of the question was. ","Kriss Cloninger","The interest among reinsurers. ","Daniel P. Amos","Oh, well there are significant interest among reinsurers. This reinsurance is a very competitive market. There are a number of companies that took notice of the first tranche that we arranged with Swiss Re. We have had a number of calls, we have talked to some others. Swiss Re is an important partner to us but we are talking with some others just to test the market and the waters and we believe we will have relationships with multiple reinsurers as a possibility going forward.","Randy Binner","Alright, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Yaron Kinar, Deutsche Bank. ","Yaron Kinar","Good morning everybody. Just a couple of questions, first just looking at the sales growth momentum some are up here in growth and even the retrocession, is there any expectation now that EPS growth year-over-year will not necessarily come in at the lower end of the guidance range?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, this is Kriss. I will say that -- you have heard me say in prior years there are a lot of moving parts to our earnings estimates. And clearly we are in recognition of the fact that the historically low interest rate environment is a headwind to us both in new sales in Japan. We don\u2019t want to sell products that don\u2019t have appealing profit margins and at today's yen denominated interest rates it is hard to get an appealing profit margin on our first sector sale. ","We have been doing some alternative investment strategies to mitigate that and we will continue to pursue those alternative investment strategies for the business we do sell. But the fact of the matter is that new sales will be a drag, first sector sales will be a drag a bit. The ability to invest current cash flows at attractive investment yields is a challenge. Eric can talk to that if appropriate. And then you get to the benefit side of things. ","We benefited from a decline in benefit ratios for a number of years now and the way we do our earnings estimates, we take a look at where we are today. We tend not to anticipate any further improvement in a step to be conservative. We have experienced improvements and therefore we have been able to be in the mid to high end of the earnings range for the last several years. ","In 2015 if we continue to get improvement, it will move us towards the high-end of the range. If things stay about the same, then we will probably stay in the mid part of the range. If things deteriorate a bit, in terms of no additional improvement or some modest deterioration, things might move towards the low end of the range. But that's why we have got a range. It is just a lot of moving parts and we don\u2019t have a lot more insight, well we don\u2019t have total insight into that. So, that is why we give a range. ","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then my second question is going back to the third sector of sales. So if you use kind of the guidance that was offered last night of 15% growth for the first three quarters of the year and then sounds like you\u2019re basically expecting a similar absolute number of sales in the fourth quarter, ultimately I get to about 2% growth for the full year and third sector sales which is still at the low end of the guidance range both in 2014. So I am sorry to be -- to push on what seems like a good sales quarter at the end of the day. So I guess I am so much surprised that would Japan progress with the deal or partnership and with the new cancer product out in the market that we wouldn\u2019t see more robust growth over the full year?","Daniel P. Amos","Of course we don\u2019t know what the fourth quarter will be at this particular point. As I said in my numbers, I looked at it for the last -- the rolling 12 months and I think they are going to be close to 20% and the fourth quarter will give you more insight at the end of the second quarter. But at this particular time, we are still unsure anytime. We feel confident with what our existing channels will do but how we roll out and the way they roll out with Post is just too early to tell. So we\u2019re not willing to go out at this particular point and give a number but we will at the end of the second quarter where we got more information. It\u2019s not something we control. It is kind like Dai Ichi Life when we had them. We have to wait and see, but I would say we are still optimistic about our relationship with Japan Post because it\u2019s been an outstanding relationship with them. And no one else has got anything like this and we are going to continue to grow it and work on it. ","Yaron Kinar","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar, JP Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. So I\u2019ll just ask given the confusion on sales, so maybe if you could talk about just the ramp up in sales via the Japan Post, obviously the growth rate should slow down from the recent pace, but do you expect the absolute amount to continue to go up through 2015 and then I have couple of other questions that I\u2019ve written down?","Paul S. Amos","This is Paul. Unfortunately we are not allowed to disclose the specifics around the sales for Japan Post or the projections for Japan Post. What I can tell you is that we are at three prong approach to our overall success within our partnership with Japan Post. Number one, we wanted to expand to the number of post offices which equaled number of 10,000 through end of last year. Beginning in October we wanted to expand selling through combo the Japan Post Insurance Company and we also wanted to make sure that we offered a new product that was exclusive to the Japan Post network. We\u2019ve been successful in achieving all three of those and we know that we are going to continue to expand the number of post offices overtime as that is the objective of the overall relationship. And we believe the combination of the additional product for just a pay and post along with the expanded number of post offices will continue to allow us to foster growth in that relationship and access new customers that we would not have been able to access otherwise. So I am in no way pessimistic about the relationship but we cannot go into specifics around a numbers or the projections. ","Jimmy Bhullar","Sure. And then on the U.S. business, the expenses are obviously elevated in the fourth quarter. Could you discuss what the or quantify what the expenses related to the U.S. sales force restructuring were and what your expectation is for that number as you, should the expenses remain elevated as you go through 2015?","Kenneth S. Janke","Jimmy, this is Ken. In the fourth quarter we had about 26 million hit the U.S. P&L, excuse me, that\u2019s for the full year. There is about a million in the third quarter so about 25 million in the fourth quarter. For 2015 we expect it to be around 88 million for the full year fairly evenly spread on a quarterly basis in the $21 million to $22 million range net of capitalization that would run to the U.S. segment. ","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and lastly if you could just comment on capacity and\/or likelihood of additional reinsurance fields you talked a little bit in response to previous question but are you still actively pursuing additional deals, reinsurance deals\u2026?","Kriss Cloninger ","This is Kriss. I will take that. First of all let me say that these increased expenses in the U.S. are built into the projections. We had a pretty good estimate of them and they are cranked in there, so -- and they are predicated on a 5% sales increase for the year, which is our objective. Okay, that is why as far as our capacity and interest and additional reinsurance, that is going to be dictated by our capital management planning. We are taking a more comprehensive approach to doing capital management planning including identifying potential uses of capital and discussing potential sources of capital. And we don\u2019t want to act precipitously in just doing reinsurance deals for the sake of doing reinsurance deals because we can't free up some of the additional reserves that are available in Japan. We want to have and identified appropriate use for that capital to the extent we choose to repatriate some of those proceeds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S. and subsequently to Aflac Incorporated. ","There are uses for capital other than share repurchase partly to make sure we got squared up on our tax cash flows in the U.S. and some other things like the position of the U.S. operation from a capital perspective where we have been forcing the U.S. operation to kind of pay the shareholder dividends for some time. And there is a modest imbalance if you just looked at U.S. only versus Japan that we are trying remediate. It is not a source of concern among ourselves or among the regulators. But it is something we are trying to do some advanced planning on. And there are certainly potential other uses for capital. ","So, we are trying to do a more comprehensive program and we will have more to comment on, mostly likely at FAB in terms of the progress we are making in that regard. But I just want to emphasize we are not going to do reinsurance for the sake of doing reinsurance because we can. We have to have a disciplined approach about this and that's what I am trying to do and put in place. ","Paul S. Amos","And just one follow-up to that too, let me mention our FSA based earnings clearly benefited from the reinsurance transaction we had secured in October of last year. As we commented on the third quarter, that influenced our thoughts as we formulated our objectives, earnings objectives and capital deployment plans for 2015. So we are looking right now at an amount that we would repatriate of somewhere around 150 billion to 170 billion yen. This year 50 billion yen of which we already received in December and that puts us in a good position in terms of executing on the capital deployment objectives we have for this year which is increasing the cash dividend and buying back $1.3 billion of our shares. So that is why -- that in conjunction with our comments Kriss has made and what we talked about last September, we are really thinking of longer term plan. ","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, that is helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Berg, RBC. ","Eric Berg","Thanks very much and good morning. Dan, from looking at your early history in Japan, Aflac was heavily if not exclusively I believe a cancer insurer. Then during your tenure the company has diversified really quite a bit and for many years you had a broad line of products between cancer and medical riders that mentions long term care and so forth annuities. But now it seems we are back to cancer only or at least that is what it seems in the December quarter. I think it was the only product that showed that sales increased with the other showing declines, what is your take on sort of what the next couple of years will bring in terms of new business production. Will Aflac be a one product company or will there be breadth to the sales?","Daniel P. Amos","Well, the one thing that it has been rather consistent is whatever the new product is that is ultimately where the sales go. And the new product for 2014 was cancer insurance. I do believe we have a distinct advantage in Japan when it comes to cancer insurance over any other product we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s what started our company, it\u2019s what all consumers view as us being dominant in the market. And so from that standpoint, I think we\u2019ve learned that cancer insurance is still very important. But I think medical will be important and I think as we introduce the new medical product, we will be -- we\u2019re still number one in that and so I think it will just vary. Let me ask Paul of Aflac Japan if they\u2019d like to make any comments. ","Paul S. Amos","Yes, remember we launched our new medical product toward the end of 2013. So the comparison for medical sales in conjunction with the strong emphasis we had on launching of our new cancer plan certainly put the emphasis on third sector products on the cancer plan itself for that particular quarter. The other comment I\u2019d like to make is really about the discipline that we\u2019re holding in first sector because of the record low interest rates we\u2019re seeing today and the profit margins that have already been mentioned around certain products. We are certainly restraining the total number and total volume of first sector sales given the current conditions. ","Given the large volume of exclusive agencies we have at Aflac, we are certainly going to continue some presence within selling first sector products. But in terms of broadly going after the first sector in the current environment, we are restraining those sales and looking to see a fairly significant decline in first sector sales in 2015 if these trends continue. I will be closely monitoring just as we did in the fourth quarter and will be monitoring our sales. If conditions changed for the better we\u2019ll move in that direction, if condition stay the same or worsen, we would react accordingly. But we have measures in place to affect our sales based on the type of business we want to be selling in Aflac.","Kriss Cloninger","But I will also and let me add some to that, this is Kriss again. We are making some modest investments to protect all of our distribution relationships. All of our distribution relationships are important to us particularly the bank channel where there are limitations on what we are going to sell in the first sector. But we are making accommodations in selling a certain amount of business in order to protect those relationships for the longer term. ","Eric Berg","I have one follow up question then I\u2019ll be done for the U.S. team. In the U.S. it seems that there has been a stabilization, a stabilizing in the number of productive agents number of monthly average producers. Maybe the U.S. team could address where they see that headed because it seems to be at the end of the day what matters is not how many people you recruiting, not how many people you are losing indeed not how many people you have but how many productive people you have. So I am focused on that productive number and I\u2019d like to know where its headed? ","Teresa L. White","This is Teresa White again. We\u2019re absolutely headed, we\u2019re continued to recruit but we also are wanting to make sure that we have productive recruits. So we see growth in that number, our goal is to grow that number in 2015. We are also looking to grow the number of what we call district sales coordinators and those are the field trainers, those are the people who assist those recruits and ensure that they increase their productivity. So short answer to that, you are absolutely correct, the goal is to continue to increase the average weekly producer number. ","Eric Berg","Thanks to everyone. ","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thank you Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Gallagher of Credit Suisse.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. My question is on the new product and given that it is more than cancer WAYS product and then similar product that\u2019s being sold exclusively to the Post. I guess last time we saw a sales surge to this level where that product is now almost 50% of sales in the quarter there were some issues with margin in the future. So I just want to get a better handle on your level of comfort around the margin in the product and in particular I recall you are highlighting some of the cash accumulation features within the product and I might not have that exactly right but it sounded to me like this was a bit of a hybrid product. So I want to know is there an interest rate component that we should be mindful of but if you could just address that question in general?","Kriss Cloninger","Tom, this is Kriss. The cancer product that\u2019s created the surge in sales as an annual premium long duration product, not that as sensitive to interest rates. I think at the FAB meetings I\u2019ve shown that third sectors products are relatively insensitive in terms of profitability to levels of lifetime net investment yields associated with the cash flows, associated with that product. We do bills from reserves. The old blocks have some cash to render values and long duration benefits that we are selling the cash value rider this time out. But it\u2019s not that sensitive. And we have diminished some of the long duration benefits that tend to bill reserves a lot. So the cancer product is not nearly as inter sensitive as a first sector product and in fact I don\u2019t absolutely know it but I think its profitable at zero percent interest. So that would tell us something there. Let me see what else did I want to say. ","Daniel P. Amos","About WAYS?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes. ","Daniel P. Amos","That\u2019s what he was telling now. ","Kriss Cloninger","Well WAYS was where we had the surge previously and clearly that was inter sensitive both in terms of it being limited pay. We got most of the funds up in the short term and the intra spread made a lot of difference in the profitability over the long-term. So this was near that plus we don\u2019t have things like discounted advance premium where we have to invest at today\u2019s rate. And basically the third sector products Tom, the claims pay out more quickly over the term of the contract. They payout periodically during the term of the contract as opposed to all at the end of the contract. So basically the new third sector products, the cancer products aren\u2019t nearly as inter sensitive as the first sector products because of the surge in 2011 and 2012 going into 2013.","Thomas Gallagher","That\u2019s helpful Kriss, thanks. And just my follow up is just given what looks to me like is a fairly radical product mix shift that we\u2019re seeing between first sector significantly falling off, the cancer really ramping up here, why shouldn\u2019t we see a reversal and an improvement in margins going forward here, because I know we had the opposite happening when WAYS had become a much bigger part of the hole here. But now that we are likely to see a real shift in the other direction, is there -- should we be thinking over the next several years that we\u2019re going to see any kind of meaningful lift in profit margin?","Daniel P. Amos","Well you\u2019ll see a lift in profit margin but it will be more gradual than the first sector of business impact because a lot of the cash flows associated with the first sector business came in at the front end of the product and closer just most of the premiums were paid within a 5 to 10 year period. Whereas these health products, the cancer products premiums were paid over the life of the business. So the impact on premium income and the recognition of profit, well the recognition of profit will be over the life of the policy as it was in the first sector of business. But the revenues will come in over a slower period of time and more gradual period of time. But we should see a kind of a diminishment, we will see the impact of the first sector premiums on the margins tend to diminish as the level of first sector volume declines. ","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I guess just so I am clear on this, is it -- if you look out over the next two, three, four years just given the mix shift here, would you expect margins to go up or is there still a bit of a drag from the first sector and it is less clear at this point given where interest rates are?","Daniel P. Amos","I don\u2019t expect margins to rebound immediately Tom but I think there will be gradual trend of increasing margins. The first sector business, that was about on a per policy basis 10 times the premium of a third sector policy. So there is a major, major impact on the mix shift of revenues associated with that surge in first sector of business. This is a big surge in third sector business by itself but we\u2019re still volume wise going to write, I don\u2019t know, the exact number but say around 70 billion of premium on third sector business right now. And we were right in the like 120 billion or something like that in first sector in those prime years. So it is just not quite. ","On a policy basis we\u2019re writing a lot more policies than we did on first sector but the premium on the first sector was so much more that I think it will be more gradual impact Tom. I\u2019ll tell you what, we\u2019re going to have the updated projections and the like if the FAB meeting in May and I\u2019ll be able to update those forecast we give you on margins by product category first sector and third sector as well as an estimate of the impact on the aggregate margin for the next three years, we will be updating math. ","Robin Y. Wilkey","And this is Robin. I would add that if you look at the presentation from the FAB meeting Aflac Japan outlook by product category, the total overall profit margin that we\u2019re seeing for 2015 is going to be right in the middle of what we projected. So the projection was 19% to 22% and for 2015 we\u2019re seeing 20.3%. So I wanted to make that clear. Also when you look at the day stay, the number of days per hospital stay in Japan we\u2019re continuing to see that decline which has been helping our benefit ratio also. ","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, thanks guys. ","Operator","And the next question is from Ryan Krueger of KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hey, thanks good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about investment allocation in Japan between JGBs and U.S. dollar corporate in 2015?","Eric M. Kirsch","Sure, hi. It\u2019s Eric, Ryan. Prior to all this volatility as we do our budgets and planning and consistent with the SAA work that we completed, it would have been about 25% to 75% ratio. Though I should also say, as we think about the U.S. dollar allocation it\u2019s not necessarily confined to U.S. corporate anymore. We certainly have widened the scope but we do call it dollar assets. ","However as you know we are being very tactical, rates have dropped particularly in Japan because in the U.S. while treasuries have fallen we have seen some credit spread widening that somewhat offset that. So the absolute yield levels hadn\u2019t really dropped that much in the U.S. But in light of these very low yields as you know on the 10 year hit about 23 or 24 since popped up, the 10 year JGB has popped up to about 38. At these low yields we would be inclined to underrate that allocation to JGBs. ","Meaning, to buy a 20 or 30 year maturity JGB which is typically where we focus at an average of perhaps of 1% or so, we\u2019d rather underweight that allocation this year at those low yields and put that money to use whether in dollar assets and traditional fixed income or perhaps we do expect this year to get going with some of the growth assets that I had spoken about. So we\u2019re going to monitor that closely. As you guys know, the global macro conditions are changing drastically. We\u2019re cognizant of that but at those low levels for JGBs we would underweight our allocation relative to the original budget. ","The other thing I might mention as well and as we continue to evolve in our transformation we are being tactical on our asset allocation. So as an example because we have seen this dislocation in the credit markets going back to about November, December we firmly believe there is good fundamental credits that are still very strong in the U.S. So one of the things that we did late December and we\u2019re completing soon is what we call a billion dollar asset allocation or switch trade. So we have moved out about a billion dollars of our investment grade corporate that we own, and reallocated that about half to bank loans. We think that sector has gotten hit from tacticals, not necessarily from credit quality and liquidity from the retail market. But given our long term nature we can take advantage of that. ","And the other half of that into double dip credits in the high yield sector but the higher quality part of high yield where we think on a relative value basis that\u2019s a good long-term place to put our money. So, we are not only focused on the new money that\u2019s coming in and Kriss has talked about. There will be less cash flows this year that\u2019s associated with how we view the product side, but we\u2019re also looking internal to our portfolio. What else can we do amongst our own assets to rotate, to take advantage of this and everyone\u2019s heard me say we are in a great position around our capital levels. ","As you all know we\u2019ve cleaned up the past in terms of the portfolio. So we are positioned for when there are disruptions in the market, if there are asset classes and strategies that fit our SAA we will seek to try to take advantage of those. And of course all of those things I\u2019ve just mentioned are always within the risk limits. We have risk limits around all of these asset classes, around different credit quality and duration, and we\u2019ve had capacity because we weren\u2019t de-risking the portfolio over the last few years, so now is the time for us when these disruptions occur to take advantage of those risk limits and average into the markets. ","Ryan Krueger","Thanks, that\u2019s very helpful. One follow up on that. In the fourth quarter you have blended in money in Japan was 2.47%. Certainly things have -- rates have come down since then, can you just give us some sense of I guess given where we are today in the current environment what type of new money rate you think you can get in Japan at this point. ","Eric M. Kirsch","For the blended portfolio, so that would basically look at not only whatever JGB assets we would buy but the dollar type allocation. If we based it based on sort of the initial percentages by plan, it would probably be something in the 2% area. If we underrate those JGBs then that number would go higher. So it will depend on how we invest and of course it will depend on where the yields are when we do invest that money and I don\u2019t need to tell everybody those yields are continuing to be volatile. ","Ryan Krueger","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Alright, and the next question is from Erik Bass, Citigroup. ","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. I guess other than the sales improving, are there things that you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. business that may not be as clear to us but that give you confidence with the changes you made are having the desired impact and that momentum should build in 2015?","Daniel P. Amos","Well I am optimistic. I felt good about the third quarter, I felt good about the fourth quarter. I think what Mike Tomlinson, our new Director of Sales is doing, is working I think what Teresa is doing and her involvement with sales in terms of managing the people has been good. I am just overall very pleased. I think Dan Lebish and what he\u2019s done with Aflac Group has been good. So it all seems to be working but one thing I will say about this new structure is it pays for performance. So there are going to be some very good bonuses in the fourth quarter. If they don\u2019t perform well they all go make a lot less in 2005. ","So I\u2019ve always said put the money where you want it and the people will flow that way. I was in sales for 10 years. So I know that to be true, so I am cautiously optimistic but I want to wait until the end of the second quarter before I am willing to declare victory on what\u2019s going on. Because frankly we were going against a pretty easy quarter. The fourth quarter was an easy comparison for us, so we should have done well. Now we did better than I even thought. But still it was an easy quarter. Our easiest quarter in 2015 will be the second quarter. First quarter is a little harder because we had some carry over business in 2013 so, we\u2019ll just have to see. But I am still very encouraged that we\u2019ll make that number and I am really not satisfied with that. ","I really won't higher our numbers and I think especially with this one day pay it just opens the door for us because there is nobody in the industry that\u2019s going to be able to process, approve, and pay in one day. And that\u2019s what is important. It is at the time of claim that people need their money the fastest and we\u2019re going to give it in their hands and yes, there will be some we can\u2019t because of like short-term disability but the accident, the cancer all of the main product lines we sell we\u2019re going to be able to give it to them. And I just think it\u2019s going to set us apart and so I am optimistic but I still at the same time want to be cautious because I am sales man at heart. So I want to be careful here. ","Erik Bass","Got it, thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one follow up on the U.S., can you talk about the sales breakdown in the fourth quarter between individual and group products. ","Teresa L. White","Well what we look at really is the distribution of the product breakdown and so in the fourth quarter what we saw was really increase in sales on the broker side. We saw as far as the breakdown, about a 69% from career, 31% from broker is the breakdown. But what I really kind of want you to look at from our perspective is really the channel and we look at the channel from the perspective of the career channel being focused on the less than 100 market and the broker channel and the broker sales executives basically selling to and servicing the large case brokers. Now when you look at the product set, the products are looking more like 87% of our business is traditional, 13% is group. And we of course think of that\u2019s going to continue to grow. ","Erik Bass","Got it and how does that 13% of group sales compare to what it was in the fourth quarter of 2013?","Teresa L. White","Fourth quarter of 2013, well around 10%. So we have seen a modest growth in the group sales. But one of the things, the reason I look at it from a career distribution versus broker distribution is because even in our broker -- with our brokers, 63% of what they sell is the individual product. So the larger case brokers are the ones that are selling more of the group products but the more regional and local brokers are still selling the individual product. So you really can\u2019t get a good feel when you\u2019re looking at it group versus individual are the traditional products. [Technical Difficulty]","Erik Bass","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","[Technical Difficulty].","Unidentified Analyst ","Allocations within the existing portfolio is there a point which you take a really hard look at the available for sale portfolio within Japan and start to sell some JGBs and reallocate given where yields are. I know obviously you have generated some significant capital gains but might you not be happy to pay those taxes to get a lower allocation at JGBs particularly given the downgrade in December to a single WAY level?","Daniel P. Amos","Sure and thank you for that question and please be assured we look at all sorts of modeling of our portfolio and opportunities from yen to dollars. There could be a day when we preferred dollars to yen and we take a look the credit quality issue and your point, the JGBs we own we will be looking at in the single A category instead of the double A category given the Moody\u2019s downgrade. ","But having said that keep in mind we are balancing a number of factors. So, for example, when we look at the JGBs they do provide us with yen interest rate protection versus our liabilities because the liabilities are all in yen. So that\u2019s a very important factor and we look at the SAA, our JGB allocation is what I would call at the lower end of the range. It could be a lot higher if we wanted even better matching characteristics where the privates help with that as well because they are yen denominated. So we will take a look at that but I don\u2019t think there is an infinite amount of capacity to say JGB is down by 10% of the total portfolio and reallocate. There may be some opportunities around the edges. And then finally just for clarification, most of our JGBs are in either HGM or what we call PRM, policy reserve matching. We have very affluent AFS but even within PRM there are some opportunities to do asset allocation and rotate. I just wanted to clarify the accounting designation.","Unidentified Analyst ","Yes, no that is why I was focused on the AFS. And then I guess maybe it is a question or comment and maybe to both, if I look at your overall U.S. sales in 2014, they are only about 7% or 8% below your all time high which I believe was 2007. You know now I recognize that competition has grown and probably the market opportunity has grown since 2007 as well. So, you have lost ground but isn\u2019t it possible that you are back within the next year or two to essentially all time at least in absolute dollar terms production levels at highest?","Daniel P. Amos","Teresa and I both, 8.9 is the number. That is what we have to do to beat the all time record. ","Unidentified Analyst ","I knew you would know it. ","Daniel P. Amos","Yes, I know it. What I have told them is if we want to beat records, that's what we are after. Teresa and I both know the number by heart and we are keeping it in front of them constantly. And the sooner the better, but that's a strange call that I am keeping back there. But as I said, 5 is the number. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Understood, okay, thank you very much. ","Kriss Cloninger","It is Kriss, I just wanted to tell you that Dan and Teresa's motto this year is no whining. No whining.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. You may now begin.","Robin Wilkey","Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter conference call. Joining me this morning from Columbus is Dan Amos, our Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S. Also joining us from New York, Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also joining us this morning from Tokyo is Hiroshi Yamauchi-san, President and COO of Aflac Japan; and Koji Ariyoshi-san, Executive Vice President and Director of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some statements in our teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of the federal securities guidelines. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan this morning who will begin with some comments about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the U.S., then Fred will follow up with some brief comments about our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the year. Dan?","Dan Amos","Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that second quarter rounded out a good first of the year for Aflac. I\u2019ll lead off by providing an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor.","From the distribution perspective, our traditional agencies have been and remain viable contributors to our success. This was certainly true in second quarter. Additionally, all of our alliance partners continued to produce strong results. I am especially pleased with Japan Post and their 20,000 plus postal outlets selling out cancer insurance. Our goal remains to be whether customers want to buy in our various distribution outlets, broaden our reach to support this goal.","From a product perspective, our priority is to remain in step with the wants and the needs of the Japanese consumers in our distribution channels. Managing through the low interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. This entails working through our taxable approach on several fronts, including strategies for product, investment and risk and capital management. Fred will cover more of the financial aspect, but let me expand on our efforts related to products, starting with first sector products.","We are encouraged that the actions that we have taken throughout the second quarter to limit the sale in first sector products has been yielding the desired results. First sector product sales decrease 24.7% in the quarter. These actions include the combination of product caps, commission restructuring, product re-pricing in select cases and product discontinuance. Recognizing that many of these actions were initiated in the second quarter, we continue to anticipate a sharp decline of at least 50% in first sector sales in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2015.","Turning to the third sector products, you will recall that last quarter we introduced a cancer insurance product designed for those who have previously been diagnosed with cancer and have been cancer-free for five years. This is similar to the product we offer in the United States. Last quarter, we also introduced an enhanced nonstandard medical product. We are pleased with the reception of both products in the marketplace.","You will recall from the May financial analyst briefing that we anticipated sales of third sector products would be in the range of down 3 to up 2 and that\u2019s still the case. With Aflac Japan\u2019s third sector products up 11.2 in the quarter and 6.4 year-to-date, we are running ahead of expectation for third-sector sales. But there is no one single aspect of the business that has contributed to our outperformance. It\u2019s simply stronger than expected productivity across the majority of the distribution channels.","Keep in mind, sales in the bank channels have been moderate by restricting our sales of the first sector products. We continue to believe that the long term compound rate of third sector products will be in the range of 4% to 6%. We will continue to be innovative in providing options that millions of Japanese consumers are looking for as they struggle for financial burden of higher medical expenses.","Turning to Aflac U.S., as we indicated before, we see 2016 as a year of stabilization and opportunities as we continue to execute on our strategies. Our efforts are focused on enhancing the relationships we\u2019ve established with brokers and providing our career agents with the tools to increase productivity.","While sales in the second quarter were below expectations, keep in mind that sales in second half of 2015 contributed to 55.6% of the total sales. Our projections show that we are still on track to achieve our target of increasing Aflac sales 3% to 5% for the year. I do want to emphasize once again that we anticipate our sales will be increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter. But what we have achieved prior to that time, lays the ground work for our overall success.","As you all well know, success breeds competition. U.S. health care reform has been highlighting and clarifying the need for the products we sell. This has resulted in a number of other companies entering the voluntary supplemental insurance markets such as traditional major medical carriers and companies that sell voluntary insurance. As a result, we are executing on strategies designed set Aflac apart and further enhance our awareness and relevance to the employer, the employees and brokers. Aflac\u2019s single focus on supplemental voluntary products have greatly contributed to our dominant position of selling voluntary insurance at the worksite. And I believe it will continue to drive our competitive edge. Keep in mind that so far this year, we have written more business than the other two competitors combined.","One Day Pay also remains a key differentiator for Aflac. We will continue our promotion One Day Pay to the consumers, which we believe will help drive increased brand loyalty, account penetration and production.","Here is an amazing statistic. In 2015 and continuing through the second quarter of 2016, 100% of eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within one day. We have processed, approved and paid over 1 million One Day Pay claims in the first six months of 2016. And get this, 96% of our policyholders, that used One Day Pay or SmartClaim, as we call it, said that they are likely to refer other people to Aflac. I am convinced that this will result in more new sales going forward. Paying clients fast and fair sets us apart from the competition.","Turning to capital deployment, Fred will provide more details shortly, but let me just say that we continue to view growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particularly in absence of the compelling alternative. We believe the capital strengths position us to repatriate in the range of 120 billion to 150 billion yen, for the calendar year 2016. Despite market volatility, our capital position remains strong and reinforces our plan to repurchase $1.4 billion of shares of our stock with the majority being concentrated in the first half of this year.","One of the messages I am sending as CEO is we are laser focused on leveraging opportunities for the future. I\u2019m letting everyone know that innovation and challenge are vital aspects of the business environment here at Aflac Japan. And that\u2019s what continues to propel our long-term growth and our success. We have maintained our focus on controlling the things that we have the power to control. We can and we will control our efforts to build our business and to take care of our customers, our employees and our distribution network. By doing this, I believe we will continue to enhance shareholder value while delivering on our promise to our policyholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Fred who will cover the financial results. Fred?","Fred Crawford","Thanks, Dan.","You\u2019ve all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. And as Dan noted in his comments, the second quarter represents the continuation of the strong financial results we reported in the first quarter and executing on key initiatives covered at this year\u2019s financial analyst briefing in May. Second quarter showed continued progress towards achieving our full year 2016 earnings guidance. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan. And there were no notable earnings items to speak of in the quarter.","Our Japan segment margins were solid with both benefit and expense ratios coming in as expected and generally in line with our guidance. In the U.S., benefit ratios performed within our expected range after a seasonally strong performance in the first quarter, our expense ratio was modestly favorable in the quarter. Consistent with previous years, we fully expect our expenses to pick up in the latter half of the year as we progressed on certain strategic initiatives and increased promotional spend entering the enrollment season. In both Japan and the U.S., we would expect our benefit ratios, expense ratios and overall margins to trend within our December outlook call guidance ranges for the remainder of the year.","Turning to investments, new money rates in Japan were understandably down in third period as we navigated the low yield environment but also influenced by a tactical strategy of temporarily investing in low-yielding but high-quality and liquid securities, pending development of more attractive long term investments. We continue to be on plan in terms of Japan\u2019s net investment income for 2016.","U.S. new money rates were influenced by an increased allocation to corporate investment grade purchases which served the lower new money rates in the quarter. You may recall in the first quarter, we had elevated new money rates, as we contracted investments in higher yielding middle market loans, so to some degree, the second quarter purchases are balancing out our allocations.","Let me comment for a moment on market developments, since our FAB meeting in May and its influence on our investment strategy, as we look forward in 2016, specifically the negative rate environment in Japan and movement in hedge cost, supporting our U.S. dollar investment strategy.","Post-Brexit announcement, we experienced another move down in rates as JGBs and U.S. treasuries continue to be the world\u2019s flight to quality currencies and investments. While having modestly recovered in the past few weeks, we have seen 30-year JGBs grind down to near zero at times.","Curtailing interest-sensitive premium flows is essential. And, as Dan noted, we\u2019re taking further action to reduce the sale of first sector savings product, namely eliminating the sale of product in certain channels and accelerating pricing actions. We will continue to sell, re-priced savings products in support of our excusive relationships where the ratio of third sector to first sector sales is significantly in favor of third sector. Specific to investment strategy, we remain in good position for 2016 asset flows and defending net investment income, but we\u2019re undertaking a review of our strategic and tactical asset allocation and associated risk limits in preparation for 2017 flows. We hope to provide additional color at our September FAB meeting in Japan. But at a high level, the plan explores developing alternative high quality yen investments, a majored entry back into yen private placements and U.S. dollar investments where we can hedge effectively and optimizing investment income consistent with our risk limits, ALM and capital objectives.","Turning to U.S. dollar program, our hedge costs in the second quarter were essentially flat with the first quarter at $0.08 share. However, hedge costs have continued to increase in recent weeks with market volatility and speculation on BOJ and Federal Reserve actions. At our May FAB meeting, we guided to a realized hedge cost of a 110 basis points on 13 billion notional investment in forwards, assuming no movement in pricing or change in our hedging strategy. In the week leading into Brexit decision, post-Brexit and anticipation of last night\u2019s BOJ announcement, one-year forward pricing is now closer to a 160 basis points. As you know from our previous comments, the rise in hedge costs was fully expected as recent years have experienced abnormally low costs relative to historic norms. Note also that we currently record the full cost of forwards up front in the quarter purchased, instead of amortizing the cost over the life of the hedge, thus the timing of what is rolling on and off the program to make a difference in our reported costs.","In addition to market pricing, as we move into the second half of the year, we intend on executing on a couple of tactical moves that will result in an increase in our reported hedge costs. First, we have done some rebalancing and have moved to hedge additional dollar asset classes and expect to increase our net notional forward position by roughly 2.9 billion, including 1.9 billion in bank loans hedged in July. Bank loans are ideal to hedge, as these are floating rates and better match for shorter-dated forwards. In addition, we will look to cover a building equity and promotional real estate loan portfolio under our hedge program.","Importantly hedging these additional U.S. dollar asset classes along with other related rebalancing activities are expected to strengthen our SMR ratio once completed. We estimate in the range of 30 to 50 points at a net cost of approximately $10 million to execute on the overall strategy. Isolating the increase in the cost of hedging and our move to cover additional asset classes increases our hedge cost to the 215 million range for the year.","Finally, we have seen the forward pricing curve flatten, thus making it more economical to lengthen the weighted average tenure of our forwards. Together with our house view that hedge cost may rise, we are exploring lengthening the average maturity of our forwards by rolling a portion into longer-dated positions. This strategy may increase our estimated costs in the 40 million to 60 million, recognizing our current method of reporting costs at the time of purchase. This strategy may evolve as market\u2019s move and we will continue to guide accordingly as we proceed through the year. While increasing our reported cost, these moves are favorable from a risk and capital management standpoint.","Importantly, the dollar program overall and expanded asset classes continue to perform well, even when considering rising hedge cost and when compared to low yielding yen alternatives. This is why we\u2019ve seen a surge in dollar and currency programs among Japanese insurance players over the past few quarters. As we move forward, we will update our guidance accordingly and as is always the case, our guidance could change based on precise asset flows and market conditions.","Turning to capital SMR remains in the mid 800% range with unrealized gains up significantly in the quarter. RBC remains strong despite FX impacting the ratio negatively with the yen strengthening and realizing our Japan branches embedded in our U.S. statutory results. Impairments in the quarter were modest and primarily related to our Japan equity portfolio where market declines have triggered impairments in accordance with our internal accounting policies.","Overall credit conditions remain stable, and we have seen a recovery in energy names including our below-investment-grade holdings. We do not see any immediate risk with respect to Brexit and our European holdings.","Overall capital and liquidity conditions are strong and support our continued return of deployable capital to shareholders. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned $570 million to our shareholders in the quarter. Depending on the overall capital conditions, we expect to repatriate 80% to 100% of FSA earnings in 2016 or roughly \u00a5120 billion to \u00a5150 billion. We continue to spend down access capital held at the holding company and are on pace to achieve 1.4 billion of repurchase for the full year.","We have made no adjustments to our earnings guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 per share assuming the same average exchange rate as last year, which was roughly \u00a5121 to the dollar. Given strength in third eyen during the quarter, we have provided in our press release an EPS range for the third quarter assuming a yen to dollar of 100 to 110. When annualizing our performance year-to-date, we are poised for strong performance in 2016. However, we are mid-way through the year and we need to be conscious of the low rate environment, headwinds to investment income and associated actuarial review of select interest sensitive closed blocks of business in Japan.","In addition, from a corporate perspective, post retirement benefit liabilities are sensitive to long term rate assumptions and we typically review these corporate liabilities in the fourth quarter. Overall, we remain well-positioned in terms of our core margins and capital strength. Thank you.","And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Robin to begin Q&A. Robin?","Robin Wilkey","Thank you very much, Fred. And as Fred just said, we are ready to begin Q&A. So, we are ready to take the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Nigel Dally. Your line is now open.","Nigel Dally","Fred, with the hedge costs, you went through a number of different changes, increasing the size of the program, chasing the costs given market conditions, extending the duration. Putting all those together, what do you expect to be the overall negative impact on the earnings for 2017? And also, why not report these costs on an amortized cost basis rather than all up front? It would seem to be a more economic way of reporting them.","Fred Crawford","Sure. So, couple of comments. Let me handle the last -- second part of your question first. We are in fact putting under review our definition, really our non-GAAP definition of hedge cost and how we want to report it in our definition of operating earnings. And in fact it\u2019s a very likely Nigel that we go to exactly what you are talking about. And that is more of an amortized cost approach, very similar to how you would expect coupons on bonds to behave or interest costs on debt. And so that\u2019s really where we are going to move. We will give more detail on this, more precise detail on this during our outlook call along with recognizing that we would have to some degree adjust, if you will, our previous year results so that you can see really the comparables year-over-year. But ultimately the goal is exactly what you are alluding to and that is we want to get to a definition hedge cost that moves logically with how you would expect. If pricing is increasing, we would expect hedge cost to go up; if we are lengthening the tenure and it\u2019s a steep curve, they would go up and vice versa. And of course, if we are doing more volume, covering more national, they would go up or down depending on the strategy. What we want to avoid is what we are seeing right now is we don\u2019t want any mark-to-market noise, nor do we want the sheer timing of what rolls to influence it.","Now, to your first question, as we roll into 2017, of course what I just talked about will play into what I\u2019m about ready to say. But you will generally find a more smoother and logical approach to the cost. So, a good way to think about it is, if we are covering now moving from roughly 12.7 billion notional forwards to upwards 5.7 billion or 5.6 billion notional forwards, you would expect as you move into 2017 to roughly apply the pricing or average -- weighted average pricing you would expect on those forwards.","Now, the pricing depends on the market. So, it\u2019s very difficult for us to estimate what that would be. As I mentioned in my comments, we have seen pricing rise, a one year forward for example right now; if you went out and purchased, it would be about 160 basis points. What you could expect is that when we get to our outlook call, we will provide these types of details and ranges and sensitivities as part of our operating earnings, but that will give you I think a little color.","Eric Kirsch","Fred, sorry; it\u2019s Eric. I just wanted to correct something. It\u2019s at year-end 15.6 billion of forwards. I think you said 5.6.","Fred Crawford","Oh, I don\u2019t know. I thought I 15, but sorry. My apologies.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Berg of RBC. Your line is now open.","Eric Berg","What would you say would be a general trajectory for? I realize you\u2019re not going to project your statutory earnings, but what would you say would be, given the growth of the in-force at this point, both here and in Japan, would you expect statutory earnings to continue to increase? And if so, in the absence of strong premium growth, strong in-force growth, why would that be the case? ","Fred Crawford","So, statutory results is an interesting conversation with us, right, because, really what you\u2019re talking about is bifurcating between Japan and the US. So, in Japan, you\u2019re talking about essentially FSA earnings. And you can -- sort of implied in our guidance, if you will, where we talk about repatriating 80% to a 100% of FSA earnings, or that being a \u00a5120 billion to \u00a5150 billion, that gives you an idea of our expectation around FSA earnings for this year, okay. So, what are the types of things that will cause trend lines in those statutory earnings? You\u2019ve mentioned a couple of them growth rates, realized over time, because we\u2019re seeing growth in third sector, which would way down on FSA earnings. We\u2019re also seeing a gradual decline obviously and frankly more than a gradual decline in first sector sales, which would really promote or help, if you will, FSA earnings. So, I expect those would probably largely level out. ","Now, you do have some other things playing into FSA earnings. You do have foreign exchange that plays into it, as we convert dollar based coupon income, if you will, in Japan, back into yen; you will see some headwinds, if you will, related to a strengthening yen from that prospective. We have some of that factored into our guidance, as you can imagine. But nevertheless that place a weight on it. And then, hedge costs, I always remind folks; hedge costs are in fact brought through FSA earnings. And so, as those rise, they can be weighing down on your FSA earnings as well. I would note however that interestingly enough, even with the rise in pricing here this year, we actually had planned for hedge costs coming in right around where we\u2019re seeing than we\u2019re projecting them today. So, I don\u2019t see the recent rise in hedge cost as having implication for our 2016 cash flow.","When you roll over the U.S., it\u2019s a bit of a different matter, right? So, starting with just isolating the notion of U.S. only statutory income, we don\u2019t drive the U.S. only statutory income, so it ends up being sort of excess cash flows produced in the U.S. And those have remained relatively steady. I would say, we\u2019re seeing some growth rate in the U.S., and we\u2019re also investing in the U.S. platform in the form of technology improvements and infrastructure. So, some of those are headwinds to statutory earnings but otherwise our sheer margins in the U.S., generally favorable benefit rations, expense ratios generally under control have been really helpful to stat earnings. So, I don\u2019t see any sort of what I would call, capital related or growth or lack thereof related pressures on statutory earnings in the U.S. I would see it more to do with the pace of investment in the platform.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is now open. ","Ryan Krueger","I had a follow-up on the hedge costs. Fred, you talked about 160 basis points for a one-year forward, but then I think you were talking about potentially extending the duration of the book. Can you give a sense of how much more it costs on the longer-duration hedges you are potentially considering?","Fred Crawford","Yes. So, one of the things that\u2019s happened in the marketplace is while we have seen hedge cost rise, also the curve is flattened. And so for example, in really just the last few months, the difference between a six-month forward and an 18-month forward has narrowed by some 25 basis points. And so, if they cost you upwards of 150 basis points to lock in a six-month forward, it may cost you more in the 170, 175 basis-point range to do an 18-month forward. And so, as a tactical strategy, you may want to take advantage of some lengthening where you can. And that\u2019s what I was alluding to in my comments. The reason why that results in a more acute cost in 2016, this 40 million 60 million range I mentioned in my comments, is recognizing that we would pull that whole 18-month cost righty into the current period. And so, again as Nigel pointed out, as we move to a more amortized approach, you won\u2019t have that type of fluctuation. And so, that gives you an idea of the relative difference and curved difference of extension.","Something to remember is that at FAB we talked about 110 basis points, and remember that is a realized cost estimate. That was talking roughly 13 billion or so of notional and $140 million or so of expected cost. So, when you think about $215 million of cost, setting aside the duration extension, that\u2019s right around the 140 basis points. So, there is a difference between the actual pricing in the market and our realized cost because of course we\u2019ve locked in certain costs and have this accounting issue.","Ryan Krueger","Then, just to clarify, does the 215 million, does that -- that does not include the 40 million to 60 million additional that was from lengthening the duration?","Fred Crawford","That\u2019s correct.","Ryan Krueger","And then, just a follow-up on the 30 to 50-point benefit to the SMR from repositioning the portfolio. I guess a couple questions. Is that just due to lower risk charges associated with locking in the hedges there? And then, I guess, is this anticipated in the three year capital plan that you provided at FAB?","Fred Crawford","Yes. So, the answer to your first question is yes. And that is when you put those hedges on, you just gather more favorable SMR treatment, if you will, as opposed to not having it due to essentially what amounts to ALM related issues, i.e., a dollar investment backing a potential yen liability. So, you gain certain benefits. We also are covering asset classes that could be of a higher charge orders, such as bank loans for example, which will tend to be lower rated, if you will, in general. So again, makes it even particularly healthy.","And as I mentioned in my comments, what I really like about the bank loan coverage which took some time to qualify, right. And you are talking about floating short-dated investments and short-dated investments that are being managed by third-party asset managers, it took some time to work through the system and qualify for the all the appropriate hedge treatment. We were able to get that done here in the last couple of months, and so we could expand the asset class. So, it\u2019s a particularly all-in beneficial asset class to hedge. And so, we are really happy with the progress we have made there. But that\u2019s where you pick up the SMR benefits. In terms of factoring into our capital plans, yes, yes, in the sense that one of the missions of the hedge program, only one of the missions is in fact to stabilize and secure our capital dynamics in Japan such that we can be as confident as we can on the steady repatriation of cash flows for deployment. So, no matter what the magnitude, it is helpful to our capital plan. I\u2019d not view it though as some sort of just boost or jump to the capital plan, more playing good defense.","Operator","Next question is from Suneet Kamath of UBS. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","I wanted to just move to sales, if we could. Just in terms of Japan third sector, you are reiterating your guidance for down 3 to up 2. Obviously, year-to-date, you are running above that, as I think Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks. And I see that the comps get a little bit more difficult, but I don\u2019t know if they are dramatically difficult. So, just curious if there is anything in the second quarter that maybe was particularly favorable that we should think about adjusting for as we think about the balance of the year in terms of third sector sales?","Paul Amos","This is Paul, I\u2019ll follow up and start on that. And then, I will ask either Yamauchi-san or Koji to comment as well. First of all, as Dan mentioned in his comments, second quarter represented just an outperformance by almost all channels excluding the bank channel, and strong performance in both the cancer and the medical lines of business. So, I do not believe there is anything you should be removing, and you should just see straight -- a strong performance across our channels and a desire by Japanese consumers to purchase our products. In terms of the second half of the year, the comparisons are there and we do have to go up against stronger numbers. That said, we are running ahead of where we expected to benefit. And I think at the mini-FAB meeting in September, we will be in a better position to comment on whether we thought sales would continue to trend better than they have.","As you know, we have launched our MIT product this past week. And so, by the time we get to our mini-FAB meeting in September, we should be able to give you some idea about the receptivity of that product. But as I have told you in the past with any new product line, we are always tentative about how it will be received and how long it will take to Japanese agencies to adopt it and begin selling it. We are very -- it seemed very favorable results out of both our cancer for cancer survivors insurance as well as our revision of our nonstandard medical plan. So, I remain very optimistic, but at this point, we are not ready to change that range, Yamauchi and Ariyoshi, would you like to comment further?","Unidentified Company Representative","Nothing particular, however what I\u2019d like to mention is that JP channel is going as planned. And as Paul just mentioned, our nonstandard medical is doing well.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, thanks. And then, I guess maybe a bigger picture question for Fred, obviously lots of moving pieces in terms of product mix shifts and hedging costs and all that. But if we just take a high level view of Japan in particular and we think about your new business returns or your marginal ROE, how would you say that compares to your in-force returns?","Fred Crawford","Well, in-force returns have been very strong, and that\u2019s in part because what we had historically priced for, if you will, has moved over time favorable to our pricing expectations. So, in general, this is I think part of the Aflac story frankly over the years, both in Japan and in U.S. that we have a generally very profitable in-force overall. In terms of some of the new pricing, obviously we try to remain very disciplined on that front. I think in Japan, there hasn\u2019t been much movement on that. We have been growing the old fashion way, which is expanded distribution, new product launches, and we remain somewhat consistent in my view on our approach to pricing. One difference of course is really focusing in on first sector and first sector savings. I would say when you turn your attentions to those products, not surprisingly from an in-force perspective, those products are a bit more under pressure, because the opposite has happened. What we had priced for has not played out quite as well in terms of obviously yields and investment income on those products. So, that certainly offsets my comments, and it\u2019s why we\u2019re taking significant actions to make sure that we reduce the flows and shift the balance of sales and then eventually in-force over time. So, that\u2019s the I would describe it. But obviously, from the in-force perspective on the third sector side and really be entirely the U.S. platform, it continues to be a very strong story.","Suneet Kamath","And I if I could sneak one more in, just a clarification, I think Fred in your prepared remarks, you talked about the channels where you continue to sell first sector, and I think you said the mix in those channels is skewed towards third sector. When you think about that mix, is that based on number of contracts or is that based on annualized premiums?","Paul Amos","This is Paul. That is based on annualized premium. So, we don\u2019t -- in terms of the size, relative to size of first sector contract and their strength, we\u2019re thinking about the ratio in terms of premium itself.","Operator","Next question is from Humphrey Lee of Dowling and Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Shifting gear a little bit to the U.S., the productivity continues to see a good improvement on a year-over-year basis. Given the ongoing investments, how sustainable is the current pace of improvements and how should we think about it going forward?","Teresa White","This is Teresa. So, I want to make sure, I understand your question. You\u2019re speaking in terms of the productivity from a producer\u2019s standpoint or profit standpoint?","Humphrey Lee","The profit standpoint, the production divided by the agent count?","Dan Amos","So, that would be the agent productivity. ","Teresa White","Okay. So, I do still feel that there is opportunity with the agent productivity. As I spoke about in May, I think in the May FAB meeting, we are continuing to see a number of great indicators, new account growth is increasing, the productivity for producer is increasing. And the whole goal here is to ensure that when we bring new agents into the business that we\u2019re able to get them trained, ensure that that they stay with that class, so that they can have a good career with us. So, we\u2019re seeing that happen, we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re seeing in the numbers. I\u2019m somewhat concerned about the recruiting as a whole. And I think our comparisons -- we expected recruiting to be down for this quarter or this year and really I think a lot of that is some of the noise that were in the contract last year, as we change the contract this year to say not for recruiting but for producers. And because that\u2019s how we\u2019re compensating our sales organization, I think we\u2019ll continue to see growth in productivity. ","Fred Crawford","And one thing I would add is to some degree, your comment was how to sort of drive down to the bottom line, just a couple of comments. One is of course when you are talking about sort of relative spend on distribution and productivity, you\u2019re now getting into sort of adaptable if you will expenses. And so, you wouldn\u2019t see typically much in a way of big sort of bottom line movement. I think from an overall investment in the U.S. platform, I\u2019ll just call your attention back to our comments at FAB and in particularly some comments and some projections we showed around the group business where we are actually investing in the platform and expecting there to be an improvement in profitability on just a group side over the course of that next three to five years. That continues on plan, continues on pace; there\u2019s been really no material adjustments from our comments at FAB.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. And then, maybe more a strategy question for Dan. In your prepared remarks, you talked about greater competition in the voluntary product side coming from other players. And I recall in the FAB meeting, you guys talked about you may consider providing a more full suite of group solutions in the U.S. Any updates on what you\u2019re thinking about and what type of opportunities you are seeing?","Dan Amos","Yes. What I would say is that we are trying through our Everwell platform, which is an enrollment platform. We are positioning ourselves to where we are trying to be the solution for the human resources department. And in doing so, for example, through this Everwell platform, if it\u2019s an account under 50 in size and they want to go to buy Obamacare products, then, they will be able to do that through our platform to go in and do that. So, it also allows us to see everyone on one-on-one basis. And so that ultimately should increase our enrollment.","As far as other products, we are looking at other products; Teresa is studying that right now. We haven\u2019t made any final decisions. But, the type products would be group life. And if we did something along those lines, some of our competitors offer that. And we feel that we will either have to offer it as through another company, and bring it on in some form or fashion. But we want to make sure because its\u2019 a lower profit margin product that we don\u2019t have our sales force concentrating on it, but rather it\u2019s a product that opens the door for higher sales of our third sector product forward, I\u2019m used to seeing that because of dealing with Japan, of our supplemental products in the U.S.","Operator","Next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Jimmy Bhullar","The first question is for Teresa on U.S. sales. So, like it was also getting better, I think first quarter you had almost the 4% increase in sales and this quarter they got worse. So, wondering, if you could just give us a little bit more detail on what happened to U.S. sales and how second quarter results affect your outlook for the rest of the year?","Teresa White","So, I\u2019ll handle the last comment first. We continue to believe that the outlook 3 to 5, will materialize over the year. As Dan said in his comments, we do expect that to be closer to the fourth quarter, so skew there. One of the things in the second quarter what we are seeing is we saw really favorable comps for the -- not favorable comps but favorable performance in the broker business. We basically grew the broker business by about 15%. So, we felt good there. The weak spot was our career size. And we have some markets that have underperformed. And we are confident though that we have some the leaders, the right leaders in place to address those issues that we have in those markets. But at this point, I feel good about 3% to 5% for the year.","Dan Amos","I\u2019ll make one other comment. As we have told you at FAB and other places, our struggle is trying to bring brokers on in a -- we are probably the only organization who has a -- well, I know we are, that has such a dynamic field force. And so, we are trying to push our field force into writing the accounts of 100 or less. The overlap is between the 100 and the 1,000. And over 1,000 we tend to see brokers now. Our brokers are also using our field force as enrollers. So that doesn\u2019t break out exactly that because that shows us broker productivity. But all in all, it is beginning to evolve in a way that will ultimately I think increase our production. But it\u2019s been a struggle. And Teresa has done an exceptional job in bringing those together. When that\u2019s really clicking, that\u2019s when you are going to see it take off. And that\u2019s what we continue to work on is that -- and the production being off a little bit is because of our field force. So, we think with Everwell and our way of enrollments increasing dramatically up to 40% if you go through that process, that\u2019s going to help our field force and the tools that we give them. So, it\u2019s a delicate balance here but we are getting closer and closer. And the thing they told me that was in a recent meeting I had when some of our managers at our field level said that they wanted the managers at our broker level to meet their needs. They didn\u2019t use to want to get together and now they are working together as a team. And I think it\u2019s only going to get better as we move forward. And I am very encouraged about that, but it is slower than I like.","Jimmy Bhullar","And you had made a lot of changes in your field force. So, I would have thought that as we get further and further away from the disruption because of those changes, your results would actually slowly trend higher. So, I recognize that it\u2019s one quarter, but it\u2019s a little surprising that they went in the wrong direction?","Dan Amos","I\u2019ll say this again. It takes time to field force and again time to move them to -- you should look at the overall number. And the overall number I understand what you are saying but the field force will continue to make up the small accosts but the big accounts are going to be coming in. And in the second quarter, our broker business was way up. So, it was our field force that was down slightly there. And of course, they account for two thirds of our business. So, that\u2019s the other thing that\u2019s driving this fact. But I think long term, we\u2019ve got a solution for that and it will continue to improve.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then just one more for Eric on Japan new money yields, they dropped this quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us some details on what exactly it is that you are investing in the Japanese portfolio; how much are you allocating to U.S. dollar investments? And if JGB yields remain where they are, what would you expect your allocation to be roughly as you look into 2017?","Eric Kirsch","Sure, thank you, no worries. There is a few different components to that but, obviously as you know, yields have been trending down, both in the U.S. and Japan. So, that\u2019s partially the decline for the second quarter new money yield. But the bigger attribution of the decline was and Fred referenced this in his speech, as we\u2019re entering into new asset classes, such as infrastructure, commercial mortgage loans, those take time to fund, unlike when we buy investment grade bonds, we get into the market and fund those pretty quickly. Now, since we\u2019re turning those assets classes on for the first time, we knew that there\u2019d be delay in funding them. And therefore, during the quarter, we had a buildup of cash, because it is taking us a little longer for our first time entering those asset classes.","When we\u2019re sitting on cash, that doesn\u2019t go into the new money yield in the way we\u2019ve defined it. But nevertheless, sitting on cash was not optimal for us and we didn\u2019t want to do that. So, we did put little over $1 billion to work during the second quarter and to yen assets, mostly Japan residential mortgage backed securities and some JGBs as a temporary home, if you will. So that when the infrastructure and commercial mortgage loans are ready to be funded as our managers call us up and say, we\u2019ve circled deals for your portfolio, will then shift out of there and put into those assets.","But because we put that cash to work and we did keep it in yen for now, we didn\u2019t want to move it back and forth between yen and dollars, that as a result of on average being invested at a 30 basis-point yield or so. So for the quarter that impacted the new money yield and brought it down. But, as we redeploy that money in the future, from yen back to dollars, later on, whether it would be later on this year or early next year, you will see the new money yields go in the opposite direction and be higher than it normally would be.","I should also mention by putting that cash to work, we are earning for this year, based on estimates of timing or reversal, about $2 million extra net investment income versus just sitting idly in cash. So that explains most the decline for the second quarter versus our planned new money yield.","More broadly speaking, for the second quarter, about 50% of the assets that we had to invest in the second quarter, and I\u2019m using Aflac Japan numbers, which was about \u00a5 224 billion, did go into asset, because of that extra money that I just referred to and the other half went into dollar assets, U.S. equity, investments grades, commercial mortgage loans, bank loans. The nice thing is , as you look at the mixture, we continue to diversify the asset base, which gives us as investors a multitude of choices, not only from a risk return standpoint but in this very volatile environment, particularly of negative rates in Japan, as our SAA and our outsourcing program and our in-house program build out, those choices are opportunistic for us to balance out those things.","Then very lastly in terms of the view of JGB yields and impact to next year\u2019s cash flow. Let me say this, at negative rates, which the 10-year is still negative, about three weeks ago, the 20-year and the 30-year JGB were both under 10 basis points. We put a moratorium on buying JGBs. And if they should stay at those low levels, we would not be buying JGBs. But as Fred has mentioned we are actively exploring other yen investments because we do need yen investments certainly from an ALM standpoint, our liabilities as you know in Japan are in yen. And there are some promising things on that front, perhaps restarting our yen private placement program, but if we do, it will be in a measured pace. And obviously with a global credit team with much stricter risk limits than we had in the past, bringing down our private placements to about 24% of the portfolio, we do feel that there is some capacity there. But we still have to test the market in terms of supply and whether or not the structure of those types of things will meet our requirements.","There are yen corporate bonds that we could be looking at, there are some ratings, regulatory things we need to explore. But all of that is a way to say that the ultimate weight on those assets would be based off the JGB yield curve, but we\u2019d be earning a credit spread. And that is something that we like because we are very bullish and confident of our credit analysis and ability to analyze credit and therefore get the right return for the risk we\u2019re willing to take.","So looking at next year, this is just so early, but consistent with prior SAA, it would probably be about 30% to 40% yen assets, 50% to 60% dollar assets. But Fred mentioned earlier, we are right now reviewing SAA in light of negative rates and how that -- the implications of that to the program. And then from a tactical standpoint, as we look at these new asset classes, that will be bear into our ultimate decisions for next year. So, very preliminary view and outlook for next year.","Jimmy Bhullar","In terms of infrastructure for the new asset classes that you are going into, both in Japan and in the U.S., are you fully staffed or would these require either more spending on your part, or are you outsourcing some of the assets?","Eric Kirsch","Infrastructure would be outsourced. And as you recollect, we\u2019ve built our external manager platform team. So that\u2019s been built. And therefore, we\u2019ve got the leverage of being able to decide gee, we like an asset class, now let\u2019s go to market, find the best managers, do RFPs and those sorts of things. And we are in the final stretches of that and about to make some selections which either by min-FAB or perhaps by the next quarterly earnings call we can tell you more about that. But we are committed to that and that\u2019s in the legs of going on line.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Robin Wilkey","As we reached the top of hour, we have got time for just one more question, please.","Operator","Last question is from Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Tom Gallagher","Fred, I just wanted to ask a question about how you are thinking about capital adequacy right now. I know your SMR ratio is quite strong, but I\u2019m guessing with negative rates, SMR is no longer the best measure of capital adequacy here. And so, in that regard, can you talk about just broadly how you are thinking about valuing capital adequacy; are you using some type of internal economic capital model? And if so, what is it telling you right now?","Fred Crawford","I would not discount SMR; it remains critical and really arguably the most critical measure in Japan. I think what\u2019s more important is be realistic about your understanding of what\u2019s moving SMR. In other words, there is a difference between SMR rising because of sheer retention in build of capital and SMR rising because of unrealized gains in your portfolio. So, you know from following us, we\u2019re quite I will use the term sober in terms of understanding that our SMR may go up at times but it\u2019s driven by unrealized gains. That doesn\u2019t necessarily give way to the release of additional capital et cetera. So, we look at it on that basis but pay careful attention to it.","I think in addition to that we look at just sheer cash flow performance and I commented earlier on dynamics involving our FSA earnings. The reason why we have 82% to 100% of FSA earnings repatriation as a policy is that in times of stress, we may retain more capital. Right now, as I look at the risk as we go forward, I mentioned in my comments that we do have to be conscious of a couple small close blocks of business that are more sensitive to low for long interest rates and actuarial sensitivity. I think it\u2019s really too early to tell at the moment whether we\u2019ll see any impact from that. We\u2019ve of course got other blocks of business that tend to be somewhat \u201crich\u201d with respect to reserves and ID&R and so forth. And so, there could be offsetting issues. So, at the moment I think we are just being cautious and looking at those issues.","I do think that if you think about where we are in the credit cycle, if you think about the interest rate environment in Japan and associated volatility, I think it is in fact the time to be cautious about the notion of sizing, if you will, excess capital, deployable capital on a purely Japan basis. Cash flow remains good. I would not really move off of any of the comments I made at FAB. But we are more carefully watching it. Now contrast that with the U.S. where if you were to look at a U.S. only basis, our business remains very strong, very stable. It\u2019s by definition of low risk profile business. We run it very high RBC levels, if you were to look on a standalone basis. And so, I continued to promote the notion that while we are moderating our views of excess capital in Japan, we continue to be bullish on the notion of there being excess capital levels in the U.S., and we will try to balance that out as we go forward.","Tom Gallagher","And Fred, just a follow-up, are you using some alternative measure whether that\u2019s just for your purposes as another cut looking at the economics of your Japanese business or are you really relying on SMR now to determine capital adequacy?","Fred Crawford","No. Tom, thanks for asking the question because I am -- let me just step back and say that everything sort of starts at the route of our capital planning with just our view of the risk not a formula\u2019s view of the risk. And by that I\u2019d say, we have developed, as you can imagine, certain economic capital approaches to stressing our business looking at capital adequacy both in Japan and the U.S., although more of an issue in Japan given the low rate environment. And very, very importantly don\u2019t lose sight of the stress testing. We do pretty extensive stress testing both in Japan and the U.S. looking at all the variables you are accustomed to in terms of moving our ratios around. And under those stress tests, that can guide us to some degree and how much capital we carry. So, I got my partner, if you will, Todd Daniels right next to me, and he is our risk manager globally. And he and I work in very close contact along with Eric in looking at these stresses, looking at economic capital oriented capital ratios as well as the stated ratios. So, you are right to ask that question, we do do that and it guides our behavior.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And even -- I\u2019m sorry, one last follow-up -- when you consider economic capital, you feel like you are in good position, all things equal. Is that fair to say?","Fred Crawford","If you follow Japanese insurance companies, you will note that on their economic value analyses that they have lost, economic value related to the very low interest rate, remember that their business models tend to be much more heavily weighted towards the types of businesses that will take it on the chin, so to speak with respect to low for long rates. Now, we\u2019re not immune from that. We have business that is most notably first sector savings oriented businesses that we\u2019ll get to depressed, some of the longer duration businesses can get depressed related to low for long rates even on the third sector side. So, we\u2019re not any different than the Japanese\u2019s companies in the sense that we\u2019ve seen headwinds on those ratios, but realize on a relative basis, we tend to perform much better, we tend to model out more favorably because of the sheer strength and size of our third sector business in dominant positions. So, no question, there have been headwinds to those types of what I call additional economic capital positions, but we tend to do well on a relative basis. And that helps us out.","Robin Wilkey","Before we end the call today, I would like to take the opportunity to remind everyone of our upcoming Tokyo financial analyst briefing to be held on September the 12th. For further details, please don\u2019t hesitate to call us. And we look forward to seeing you there. And thank you again for joining us today for the call.

Please be advised that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to, Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Robin Wilkey","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Ken Janke, President of Aflac U.S, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also joining us today from Japan are Tohru Tonoike, President and Chief Operating Officer of Aflac Japan; and Charles Lake, Chairman of Aflac Japan.","Now before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although, we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature.","Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who\u2019ll begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and our operations in Japan and the United States. I\u2019ll then follow up with a few financial highlights for the quarter and then we will take your questions. Dan?","Dan Amos","Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased that we met and in many cases exceeded our financial target for the second quarter. Let me began with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. Pre-tax earnings in yen were up 20.1% for the quarter, primarily reflecting lower benefited expense ratios. Additionally, revenues continue to be strong growing by 10%.","Given these results, we expect expense ratio to increase in the second half of the year when we step up our spending. With the new medical product launch in August we\u2019ll be increasing advertising and promotional expenditures. Additionally, we anticipate increasing spending on projects that improve our business over the long run.","Consistent with our expectation, Japan\u2019s new annualized premium sales in the second quarter were down 43.1% to 30.3 billion yen with waste production down sharply in the quarter. We anticipated this decline for a couple of reasons.","First, you recall, that at the beginning of the quarter, premium rates for the first sector products, including waste increased to reflect lower assumed interest rates. Second, improved investment returns prompted many of the customers at banks to [turn from wave] type insurance products to investment trust. As we\u2019ve said, we expect the sales of the first sector products primarily wave, will continue to be down substantially for the reminder of the year. However I want to remind you that for this year our sales target is based on Aflac Japan\u2019s third sector products which include cancer and medical insurance.","Third sector sales were down 4.9 for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations and an improvement over the first quarter. Remaining, the leading provider of third sector products is important to us and is the foundation of our product portfolio. We believe consumers will respond favorably to the new medical product we\u2019ll be introducing in mid-August. We expect this product will appeal especially to consumers in their twenties to forties, an area which we\u2019re currently underpenetrated. ","I believe our 2013 objective of flat to up 5% increase in third sector sales is reasonable and achievable. As we look ahead with regard to cancer insurance sales, I am pleased with new alliance agreement Aflac Japan signed Japan Post group last week. The new agreement will further expand our partnership with Japan Post, which was initially established in 2008, enabling each economy to maximize synergies in the insurance business. ","Japan Post has a nationwide distribution network that has earned trust of Japanese consumers and Aflac Japan is the industry leader in cancer insurance. Through this alliance Japan and Post intends to expand the number of post offices that offer Aflac\u2019s cancer products, gradually increasing from a 1000 post office outlets to 20,000. Also subject to regulatory approval Aflac Post insurance also known as Kampo will enter into an agency contract with Aflac Japan to begin distributing Aflac Japan\u2019s cancer insurance products at all the Kampo\u2019s seventy nine directly managed sale offices. ","A firm consultation with Japan Post group, Aflac Japan will also consider developing an exclusive cancer product for both Japan Post and Kampo. This new alliance agreement enhances our distribution and allows us to reach new consumers with the cancer insurance products. I believe Japan Post can and will become a meaningful contributor to our sales over the next several years. ","Let me remind you that cancer is the leading cause of death in Japan with an ageing population the average instant rate of cancer will only increase in the future and cancer is the most expensive illness to treat. We believe our products can be a part of the solution for people battling cancer and the related out of pocket expenses and this at last will help us reach more people. ","Now, let me turn to the U.S. operation. Pre-tax earnings were up 9.9% reflecting an improved benefit ratio. Keep in mind we will increase spending in the second half of the year especially with the initiatives related to the preparation of the implementation of the affordable care act. Premium income rose 3.5% with policy persistence to remaining strong. Aflac US new sales increased 1.4% for the quarter and for the first half of the year they were down 1.9. As you\u2019ve heard say many times before we don\u2019t want anything to give between us and the customers. Our job is to be multi passage in our distribution to make sure we have a presence where consumers want to purchase our products. There are different distribution possibilities we continue to work on including creating profit exchange that will help employers, our field force and the brokerage community. While we\u2019re busy laying the ground work for the future, we\u2019re still working hard to achieve our annual sales target. Having covered operations, now let me turn to investments. ","I\u2019m very pleased that for the first six months our net investment income is ahead of plan. Our new money yield for the first half of the year in Japan was 3.02%, which is significantly higher than our new money yield of 2% in the first half of 2012. Currently we\u2019re pursuing several strategies to accommodate the impact of the changing rate environment on the SMR, which we mentioned in our press release last night.","Additionally, we are re-weighting the current asset allocation for new money investments in Japan. You\u2019ll recall at the analyst meeting, we discussed that our plan was to designate two-thirds of our new money to U.S. corporate bonds and one-third to JGBs.","Our investment team is revisiting our asset allocation for new money investments and expressed to allocate the majority of the third quarter cash flows to JGBs and underweight in the allocation of the U.S. corporate bond hedge.","Just as the markets are fluid, we remain agile to respond properly, appropriately to the changing investment landscape. We will continue to consider diversification and liquidity as we approach various investment options. We also expect to come in close to our budget for the new money yield for the year.","Turning to Aflac Incorporated, our consolidated financial performance was very strong for the quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency, operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.3% for the quarter and 9.9% for the first six months of the year. While this puts us significantly ahead of the annual operating earnings per share objective, the comparison for the operating earnings per share in the third quarter will be difficult to the tax benefit of $0.10 per diluted share recognized last year in the third quarter.","I also want to remind you of what I said earlier, we will increase spending in the second half of the year in both, Japan and the United States. As such, our target remains to increase operating earnings per share in the range of 4% to 7%, excluding the impact of the yen. Within that range though, we anticipate operating earnings to increase approximately 5% for the full year before the impact of foreign currency.","As we\u2019ve communicated, given our capital structure our ability to repurchase shares is largely tied to profit repatriation. Just last week, we repatriated 76.8 billion yen. You\u2019ll recall that we entered into a hedging transaction with the vast majority of our anticipated repatriation at weighted-average exchange rate of 96.04 yens to the dollar.","In dollar terms, this profit repatriation was $795 million. As we've said for many years, when it comes to deploying excess capital, we still believe that growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares are the most attractive means and those avenues, we will continue to pursue.","Our objective remains to grow the dividend at the rate that is in line with our operating earnings per share growth before the impact of the yen. Aflac repurchased approximately $129 million or 2.3 million shares of its common stock in the second quarter. For the first half of the year, the company purchased $279 million or 5.3 million of its shares.","We have a lot of flexibility at the parent company in terms of liquidity and it\u2019s still our intention to repurchase $600 million of our shares for the full year. Additionally, our current plan remains to increase our share repurchase next year by repurchasing $600 million to $900 million of our shares.","Generally, generating an industry leading return on equity, excluding the yen impact is also important. On an operating basis, our second quarter annualized ROE was 22.1%. Keep in mind, Aflac\u2019s ROE is sensitive to current fluctuations because we are largely hedged our equity in dollars but not all of our earning.","That means that when the yen weakens, our ROE declines. As the yen remained unchanged since the end of March, operating ROE would have been 26.4% in the second quarter. Based on our year-to-date returns, I expect to meet or exceed our ROE target of 20% to 25% excluding the impact of foreign currency for the full year.","Overall I'm pleased with Aflac's position in Japan and the United States, the two largest insurance markets in the world. First and foremost, we are focused on protecting our policyholders and providing value to our investors. We are fortunate that we have the privilege of providing financial protection for more than 50 million people worldwide in the process.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back -- the program back over to Robin. Robin?","","Robin Wilkey","","Thank you, Dan. Let me get through some brief numbers for the quarter starting Aflac Japan. Beginning with the currency impact, during the quarter, the yen weakened against the dollar 18.8%. For the first six months of the year the yen weakened against the dollar 16.4%. In terms of topline growth in yen terms, revenues as reported were up 10% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of currency, revenues were up in the quarter 8.6%. The annualized persistency rate excluding annuities in the quarter showed strong improvement at 95.1% compared to 94.7% last year."," ","Net investment income as reported increased 16.6% for the quarter. If you exclude the benefit of the weaker yen in the quarter on Aflac Japan\u2019s dollar-denominated investment income, our net investment income rose 6.8%. In terms of the quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio as total revenues declined over last year, going from 62.0% a year ago to 61.5% in the second quarter. Excluding the impacts of the weaker yen, the benefit ratio for the quarter was 62.3%. ","The expense ratios for the quarter were 17% down from 18.4% a year ago. As a result of the lower expense ratio, pre-tax earnings increased 20.1% in the quarter. Excluding the impacts of the yen, pre-tax earnings in the quarter increased 13.5%. ","Now let me turn to a few highlights for Aflac U.S. The benefit ratio to total revenue decreased over last year, going from 51.1% to 49.1% in the second quarter. This was primarily the results of a favorable industry-wide healthcare usage trend during the quarter. The annualized persistency rate for the first six months remained strong at 76.3%. The expense ratio for the quarter was 34. -- 31.4%, up from 30.6% a year ago. However it was slow compared with expectations for additional spending later in the year. The profit margin for the quarter increased to 19.5% compared to 18.3% a year ago.","Turning to investment activity for the quarter, starting with Aflac Japan, for the quarter approximately $3 billion of Aflac Japan\u2019s new cash flow was invested in our hedged U.S. corporate bond program for gross yield of 3.51% at an annualized hedge cost of 22 basis points. The yield net of hedging costs were 3.29%. This brings the year to date total cash flow invested in the U.S. corporate bond program to approximately $4.9 billion with a total yield on the corporate bond portfolio of 3.59% excluding hedged costs. ","Since the inception of the program, the total cash flow invested in the U.S. corporate bond program is approximately $11.8 billion, which is with a total yield of 3.44% excluding hedged costs. This is in line with our annual allocation expectation for this program. Approximately 27% of new cash flow was invested in JGB\u2019s in the second quarter with an average yield of 1.68%. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 3.70, an increase of one basis point from the first quarter. The yield on the portfolio at the end of June was 6.11%, down eight basis points from the first quarter and 43 basis points from a year ago. ","Turning to some other items in the quarter, non-insurance expanse in the second quarter was $48 million compared to $45m a year ago. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents at the parent company level were $1.3 billion. On an operating basis, the tax rate decreased from 34.4%. Operating ROE as reported for the quarter was 22.1% and excluding the impact of the yen, operating ROE for the quarter was 26.3%.","During the quarter, we also executed on a securities lending transaction of $1.2 billion. This was a short-term transaction that will mature in the third quarter. One of the strategies that we are pursuing to accommodate the impact of the changing rate environment on our SMR is policy reserve matching of PRM.","The PRM investment strategy is gauge up accounting treatment that considers the financial characteristics of insurance company and is widely used in Japan by other companies. The PRM also promotes asset and liability management. This method provides better liquidity and is not subject to the mark-to-market accounting treatment of the available for sale.","Lastly, let me comment on our earnings outlook for the remainder of 2013. You heard us affirm our annual objectives to increase operating EPS of 47% with the expectation of a 5% excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 95 to 105 for the full year, we would expect to report operating earnings of $5.83 to $6.37 per diluted share for the full year. For the third quarter, using that same currency assumption we would expect operating earnings to be in a range of $1.41 to a $1.51 per diluted share.","Now, we would be happy to take your questions. Let me remind you that to be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up only that relates to that initial question. We\u2019re ready to begin now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) First question, Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Good morning everybody. I wanted to touch a little bit more on the Japan Post deal. And first of all understand if the 0.5% guidance refer to third-party fair growth in sales. Is that -- did that at all impacted by that deal?","Dan Amos","No. That does not include anything with Japan Post.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Dan Amos","But Charles Lake and Tohru on the line and the three of us were at the news conference on Friday. So let me see if they want to add any to that.","Tohru Tonoike","This is Tohru Tonoike. And that is correct. Our original expectation of 0.25% growth for the south sector does not include anything from the Japan Post. And at the same time, I have to remind you that we start our operations under the new agreement beginning October 1st this year. But we will start by adding not all of the 2,000 --20,000 offices, but just only a part of it because we want to make sure that we will -- half the Japan Post offices start selling our product.","Also both Japan portion, we are comfortable that we have provided sufficient training to the employees regarding the features of our product and the new market conduct rules. So we will begin that operation rather smaller than increase over time.","Charles Lake","Let me make a couple of comments by Japan Post. Number one is, it is the largest insurance company in the world with over a trillion dollars in assets. It also has -- is the largest company in terms of employees and remember that the 79 agencies at the insurance company of Japan Post is never sold for us. And these agencies would be equivalent to mega agencies in the United States. So as I said on CNBC this morning, this is a game changer for us in terms of what can take place in the future. Charles you were very instrumental in this, any comments from you?","Charles Lake","","I think you outlined everything, but I think the important also is to talk about the fact that, this is a corporate group, Japan Post group, so just Aflac deal was not only with Japan Post, the network in Japan Post insurance, but Japan post group as a whole. Dan you signed that document with the CEO of the Japan Post group, so that makes the agreement even stronger in my view.","Does it answer your question?","Operator","","Our next question comes from (inaudible) from JPMC.","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi, Good morning. Just a question on U.S. sales, Dan you mentioned you are still comfortable that sales will pick up in the second half of the year. I would have assumed that with the healthcare reform coming on, the smaller employers would be more pre-occupied with that and wouldn\u2019t really want to put or enhance their offering and put on new products on the self. ","So I just was wondering what gives you the comfort that sales in the U.S. won\u2019t actually deteriorate in the second half, which has given all this uncertainty that health care reform is going to create.","Dan Amos","","Well, as I said, I still -- because right now we\u2019re within 1% I think down, I think it\u2019s a reasonable assessment that we can achieve it. I do not have the comfort level with the U.S. as I do with Japan in terms of achieving the objectives. I am very comfortable even though Japan looks like it\u2019s coming further from behind because of this new product, that they are getting this month, I feel very good and Paul could relate more to that, because he has been more involved. ","But with the U.S. Jimmy, I am concerned that because of the delays and the other things, it can have an impact. But we\u2019ve got some things that we are working on like for example we have a toll free number that will go online affected the middle of August to where our agents can call in and ask questions. I think some of our agents are a little bit reluctant to go out and talk about healthcare reform with the fear that they won\u2019t know all the answers, but will have this safety net of this watch of this toll free number I can call that will allow them to feel more comfortable calling on the employers, new and old, old for re-enrollment, new for -- to do that, that may help us in the second half. ","So I am counting on that has been something that will help us. But your concern is something we too worry a little bit about.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just -- you had mentioned that you\u2019ve already obviously you have started to edge capital repay creation and you (inaudible) amount for 2013, but what are your thoughts on capital [repay] creation for 2014 and whether you want to hedge that for currency most? ","Ken Janke","Jimmy, this is Ken, let me comment on that. As I\u2019d mentioned at the Analyst meeting in May, we had begun to hedge a portion of our expected 2014 [repay] creation. You may recall that I talked about the possibility of about 96 to 97 billion Yen in repay creation next year. As of today, and we\u2019ll probably hold with this for the time being, we\u2019ve hedged 47 billion Yen and as far as what we ultimately pull out, the same commentary that we would have said a year ago applies to now. Maybe, we have to see how the macro market, macro environment changes between now and next June. And what the impact might on realized or unrealized gains in making the financial determination about how much we fall out, but that\u2019s where we stand today.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","","Thanks so much. Good morning. I guess, I\u2019m trying to better understand the investment strategy in kind of the capital interplay here. I mean, obviously the bond program was successful you have up to 150, 200 basis point pick up relative to JGB\u2019s which I think you felt good about given the access liquidity that gave in the diversification. But now, with the move up in rates, shifting back to that JGB strategy, so just some additional commentary there?","And then thoughts on kind of the BMR type strategy versus available for sale at health to maturity. I think others have looked at this, but what are some restrictions that, I think potentially things need to be sold and then re-bought, which you might not want to do kind of given the move up in rates. So, just any thoughts there on the interplay? Thanks.","Eric Kirsch","Sure. Hey, Chris. This is Eric. I\u2019ll grab that one and then kind of Kriss might jump in on the SMR side. But to take a step back on the investment strategy, just to remind everybody. We did a very thorough strategic asset allocation project back in 2012, which took into account liabilities, assets, our surplus, and basically created our guide post in terms of an optimal portfolio. But economically over the long-term would help us grow the surplus with minimal volatility.","But in FAS, as you know, there is a guide post that the long-term range plan, important in our investment decision is what we call tactical asset allocation. So just because we have the guide post, we have to sit down as investors in that group and think about the macro environment of the world, credit fundamentals and whether or not any particular day, month, quarter keep into that exact guide post make sense or making some adjustments.","And I think we\u2019ve already said, part of the build out of our investment function is to be more flexible, so that we\u2019re not buying whole but rather buying manage and be able to adapt the different market environments.","I think it\u2019s no surprise to anybody on the phone that we have just gone through in the second quarter, one of the highest rates of volatility relative to rates that we have seen since 2008. So if you go back to the financial crisis and you look at treasury volatility options, you\u2019ll see the greatest amount of volatility when the Fed came in and plunged trillions of dollars into the system and at that time you saw rates decline was their intent. We\u2019re seeing the unwinding of that as we saw the Federal Reserve coming to the market in May or so and announced the potential for cap bringing the QE3 programs and that cause from peak to trough the 10-year treasury to go from $170 to $270.","So in our view from a tactical standpoint we\u2019re in a volatile interest rate environment and I should say, Japan as well, because of their Central Bank policies we saw deals on April 5th plum it and then come back up, and they think if Japan is successful there\u2019ll be some pressure on their rates too.","So with that in mind and with the growth of the corporate program which is grown on the trajectory we expected in fact it\u2019s a little ahead of our projection, with the fact that from the standpoint, as Dan mentioned, our investments in sales, net investment income, we\u2019re actually running ahead of budget. We made the tactical decision to sit on the sidelines for now, re-weight that allocation more heavier towards JGBs for the third quarter and let\u2019s see what happens with the Federal Reserve in September.","As you know, today, economic numbers on GDP were strong and treasury is backing up. Tomorrow, we may get some weak economic numbers. So our standpoint is rather stand on the sideline to the volatility because we\u2019re performing in all -- on all of our metrics and even if we stayed at this new allocation, we still expect the range of the percentage allocations of the corporate program by the end of the year to be very close to our expect ranges because we are a little ahead in terms of the funding of that. So that\u2019s all the background on the decision around the asset allocation.","Now, let me turn to some of your questions on PRM, AFS, HTM and SMR. So historically here at Aflac, as you know, we\u2019ve used HTM health to maturity both for big portion of our JGBs and historically, our private placements, a large percentage went in HTM. On the outlook that as you know, we have low liquidity needs. We don\u2019t have a lot of liquidity needs and we really can\u2019t afford to hold assets for a long time.","Nevertheless, we did learn as we went through the financial crisis, particularly with non-JGBs, HTM is very difficult because if you do need to make credit adjustments, the accountants really put colors on you in terms of your ability to get it out of HTM and make an adjustment.","So the corporate program really was designed to be an AFS so we can buy and manage it, not have that on us going forward. Where SMR is today in the large rate rise that we saw, U.S. rates and rates rising in Japan in terms of the impact to SMR, we fully anticipated with that kind of rate rise, we would say our SMR dropped to where it is today, but as Dan mentioned and Kriss as well it\u2019s within the range we expected 5% to 600%. ","Nevertheless, our sensitive now to, kind of, rates continue to go up as higher from our standpoint and the sensitivity to our available for sale portfolio feeds into the SMR calculations going forward. So in that respect, we are pursuing a couple of hedging strategies if I could call it that, so that if ratio continue to raise whether in Japan or the US we have some built in protections to the portfolio, which will directly impact and benefit the SMR, so specifically Robin has talked about PRM, Policy Reserved Matching.","Now, PRM for most of our Japan peers is the more commonly used method as opposed to HTM. PRM is favorable in that. Unlike HTM, we do get the favorable atomic treatment that we have in asset, JGB\u2019s, in PRM we don\u2019t have to mark them to market for purposes of SMR. However, we\u2019re allowed to trade those JGB\u2019s for asset liability management purposes. That\u2019s a valuable tool task. Our liability can change as rates go up and down, so that gives us more flexibility than HTM. So to mitigate interest rate risk to the end market, it is our plan to move a number of JGB\u2019s from the existing AFS into PRM and that will help mitigate interest risk. That will happen over the next few months as we certainly want to be cognizant in our transaction costs. ","With respect to US rates, we are exploring interest rate hedging strategies, we can\u2019t really put US corporate assets and PRM that\u2019s not an appropriate place where PRM was built and the rules are around JGB\u2019s. So we\u2019re looking at more interest rate in hedging strategies and it\u2019s all of you collected tab, I talked about currency hedging strategies, which we\u2019re now moving into our pilot program and colors and different operations that stay in concept as what we\u2019re applying to interest rates. So we\u2019re working carefully with our management and team in Japan, our management here in the U.S. to collaborate the sensitive of SMR if you will the changes in these different risk factors yen rates and US rates primarily to come up with the right percentages of these hedging techniques. Once (inaudible) PRM hedging strategies for US will be more economic if you will that give us the flexibility of rates raised, will have protection against declining values in the AFS security. So let me stop there and see if anybody wants to add anything or any other questions on that.","Ken Janke","This is, Ken. I think that\u2019s a pretty thorough answer. The one thing I\u2019d point out is not only are the dollar -- corporate dollar asset\u2019s not an appropriate investment for PRM. It\u2019s been our policy to historically to not put them in HTM as well. Our dollar assets are typically kept in AFS and that\u2019s one of the reasons that the unusual spike in rates had the impact it did on SMR because we had more exposure to AFS.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Understood, very helpful and then just one follow up question here on the August product. I guess can you comment a little bit about maybe pricing changes there? Some of the presses report that I guess 30% declines in rates for maybe a younger consumer, which I think is maybe a bit more than we would have thought but consistent Dan comment said, the FAB meeting that maybe the [younger age probably] used to pay a little less and the older group needs to pay a little more. So just some pricing comments around the different age cohort would be helpful thanks?","Ken Janke","Tohru?","Tohru Tonoike","Yes, I think our -- that\u2019s his [question], new product is focused on the relatively young aged customers. So we have chosen the characteristics which we think that would be -- would appeal to that age group. So there are some adjustments in the pricing that they are based on the (inaudible) stuff. Overall profitability are pretty much the same as before, so we do not expect any say sub essential trends in the -- on the overall profitability.","Kriss Cloninger","Now, this was Kriss, a second Tohru\u2019s comments on that. I think what we\u2019ve found is that relative to competition, we think we\u2019ve perhaps overcharged the lower premium rate classifications and undercharged the higher premium rate classifications for expenses. You can spread expenses any number of ways but we found that we tend to be more competitive at the higher premium rates and less competitive at lower premium rates. We try to move toward a better balance between the higher and lower premium rate relative to our competition.","So the lower rates went down some and higher rates went up some in the aggregate based on the distribution, we expect to sell, we all have about same profitability on the new product as you know.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question, John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Thank you. Good morning. Just in, real quick numbers question, so the 76.8 billion yen repatriation this month that were just shy of the $800 million, that seems like -- if I recall that\u2019s a bit above where you were expecting that repatriation to come in. Can you just help us understand what drove the upside and then can you just level set where is parent company cash including the repatriation, is that $2.1 billion?","Dan Amos","John, this is Dan. First off, at the analyst meeting, we said then that we estimated repatriation would be 70 billion to 75 billion yen and\u2026","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay.","Dan Amos","\u2026and that compensated 80% of estimated FSA earnings. So FSA earnings came on little bit better. I can\u2019t point to any specific reason why but we retained the 80% remittance. That\u2019s what drove it up to 76.8 billion.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay. In the cash of the holding company then, I just add the $800 million to the 1.3 at the end of the quarter and we\u2019re there?","Dan Amos","Well. It\u2019s not all at the parent at this point. So right now if you look at on an operating basis, we had $576 million at the parent company at the end of June. Now, that excludes the net proceeds from the debt issuance we had because that\u2019s basically pledged for debt servicing in future periods.","The repatriation that we brought back $795 million right now is warehouse at Aflac and then on the quarterly basis as we dividend up for the parent company\u2019s needs, it will be moved up to the parent company to support things like share repurchases and dividends. So it\u2019s not all there right now.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Then I guess, the second is if I just take a setback and think about this quarter and your delivering operationally I think on every single metric or exceeding on every single metric, maybe there is a little bit touch weakness on sales but seems like you\u2019ve got confidence in the back half.","So your stock is down and I think that\u2019s all about the system. I mean, can you just help us understand, I know you just went through the strategy, there is PRM maybe a few other things, you\u2019re considering on the U.S. sided that hedge against rate. How much urgency is there inside the company to get this done and help your investors be very confident that SMR is going to be stable at or near the upper end of your targeted range from here? 10-year treasury yields are up, eight basis points today just top of the GDP et cetera. So that\u2019s moving quickly, I just wonder how quickly Aflac is moving?","Kriss Cloninger","This is Kriss. I\u2019ll take a stand at that. It\u2019s a little ironic to me, John, as I was reflecting on last quarter\u2019s conference call, where you\u2019ll all given me greek, the SMR was too high and we needed capital. How Japan this quarter as Eric summarized we have the significant spike in interest rates, so that drove the value of AFS assets down from the level it was at March 31. But I do want to point out that the fair value of the yen are nominated AFS assets are still right at par. We had a significant unrealized gain at the end of the first quarter, that basically went away in the second quarter and I try to tell the investment community on the first quarter call that we don\u2019t tend to count on unrealized gains as a major source of capital. We know there are variably fluctuate. They go up and down, they went down this quarter. So instead of being way over the 500 to 600 target, which we were at the end of the first quarter, we\u2019re down at the high-end of the 500 to 600 target. All that being said, we do feel some sense of urgency to protect our SMR levels from further deterioration associated with marking AFS assets to market. I will say, getting on a soap box a little bit, this is more of an accounting issued to me than a capital adequacy issue. If you look at our RBC ratio, little over 700% at June 30th. ","Now I know you all are going to give me great through how can you lift RBC grow over 700% and it was SMR they on it. If RBC is up and the answer is it's all related to accounting for those AFS classified assets and marketing one group to market for FSA purposes and carrying the same group that amortized costs for U.S. statutory purposes. So, all that being said, we got to pay attention as tomorrow we\u2019re doing it in addition to the accounting issues, not to let accounting grab economics, but I\u2019ve got to be mindful that accounting is important. We are -- we\u2019ve got multiple levers that were analyzing in terms of the cost benefit relationship of exercising some of our option to insulate SMR to any further significant declines beyond our target range. And what we are trying to do is get comfortable that we\u2019re pursuing the most efficient approach from a cost to capital point of view. Some of the strategy has don\u2019t cost anything that\u2019s the PRM that Eric summarized the other strategies have some modest cost, but relatively, relatively immaterial and then some other strategies we would probably only look at if we felt pressed, so I say. So we\u2019ve got a number of levers, we\u2019re trying to evaluate\u2026 John and I know, you know that this what we\u2019re paid to do. So we\u2019re after it.","","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","","And just, real quick, so if we fast forward to this time three months from now and we\u2019re on the conference call, is it fair for us to assume that one or more of those levers would have involved? ","Dan Amos","Yes.","","Operator","Thank you. Next question, Mark Finkelstein from Evercore.","","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore partners","I guess maybe if we think about it this way, a 100 basis point movement rates is roughly 200 or some other points give or take? Based on these strategies that you are undertaking, how would you -- what is your target for that same sensitivity?","Dan Amos","","I think one of the things we are doing is working on what the people are calling risk appetite statements and I think within the framework of risk appetite statements, we will provide guidelines to our operating people regarding our target values -- minimum target values for items like SMR. And 500 to 600 range we\u2019ve quoted it have been kind of an informal statement of risk appetite. So we\u2019re just kind of I mean we\u2019ve communicated a lot of financial targets in the past and that\u2019s pretty much where we operate them. So, we\u2019re going to try to stay in those zones. We obviously want to avoid concern on the part of the regulators. So that\u2019s an overriding objective too. Ken, you got anything?","Ken Janke","","I don\u2019t know that I can answer that.","Dan Amos","","Okay, Mark I don\u2019t know that was responsive intake.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore partners","","Well I guess maybe just, if you don\u2019t want to give a number, can we say that, that sensitivity will likely be substantially reduced when we look at kind of March 31st ?","Dan Amos","","That will be our objective, yeah that will be our objective. We use to reduce the sensitivity. But the overriding objective is to keep the SMR within the 500 to 600 target at various interest rate scenarios both yen and dollars, that\u2019s what we are looking at. What keeps it in that range?","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore partners","Okay. And I think, I heard Kriss say that, the cost on the JGB side is nil and the cost to, I guess, execute the strategy on the corporate bond side is immaterial, I think, I heard you say that? I guess, the obvious question is, why haven\u2019t we\u2019ve been doing this all along then?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, we haven\u2019t seen the volatility of interest rates. For example, I think, the thing we are looking at on the corporate bond strategy is probably interest rate hedging strategies that has cost associated with it depending on the level of risk and sensitivity, we want to retain or going through kind of cost effectiveness modeling exercise on that strategy.","The PRM does have some cost to it, because we won\u2019t have to do some JGB transactions, you can\u2019t just reclassify accounting wise, you\u2019ve got to classify when you acquire them, so we would have to sell some JGB\u2019s and buy similar replacements and alike, get them reclassified. But the cost didn\u2019t material, considering overall affect, I think it somewhat 1 to 2 basis points on the trade. Eric, do you have any other comments?","Eric Kirsch","Yeah. I\u2019d like to add, Mark, just a couple of comments to put in context and we\u2019ve been very, very open since I\u2019ve been here around our transformation. So taking the step back, as you know, historically, before I got here, the investment strategy, we are just very focused on either JGB\u2019s or private placement and HTM.","The tools and the sophistication and the intellectual capital to do interest rate hedging strategies, which obviously encompassed doing derivative type strategies, modeling your portfolio, understanding these sensitivities are quite complex as you can all appreciate.","Two years ago when I got here, we were just not equipped to do that, whether it would the systems, the technology, having the appropriate operation set up to do all that, the legal agreements with broker dealers of this, et cetera. But part of our transformation program, a big part is design, so we can do all the investment techniques in the market that are necessary to run a large balance sheet.","The good news that I can tell you is, we do have that intellectual capital now. We have the systems capabilities to do the modeling and we are doing that with the highest priority which is what Kriss commented on before.","But these are new for Aflac, so it has to go through the appropriate governance procedures. We have to ensure the appropriate operational capabilities to set up to hit that aspiration. And in all those things a good news is, we are well along in our transformation, where we can impact, we are working on these things. But we\u2019ve got a little more to go before we can prepare to execute.","But as Kriss said, by the time we have this call in the third quarter we\u2019ll be able to tell you about the progress with PRM because that\u2019s live and that\u2019s moving along as we speak. And the analysis and ability to do the interest rate hedging on the U.S. portion is well along, and analysis and in the few weeks we\u2019ll be able to move our ability to execute and do transactions to do that. So I think we\u2019ll have good news for you by the end of the quarter, but that gives you the answer to why hasn\u2019t it done before hopefully.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore partners","Okay. One very, very quick follow up, I know that on waste sales, you kind of gave a couple different reason, one of which was shift to kind of [trough]? I\u2019m just actually curious, if you\u2019ve seen any changes in surrender activity on the product you saw in \u201911 and \u201912, was just that kind of change in Japanese market?","Dan Amos","No. We haven\u2019t, I think, it\u2019s too early to see that, our products have significant surrender charges in them prior to the time they become paid out that really won\u2019t occur until 2016, 2017?","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore partners","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Schuman from KBW.","Jeff Schuman - KBW","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more big picture perspective on Japan Post. I think it\u2019s pretty widely understood that Japan Post wanted to manufacture their own cancer product. I\u2019m wondering if we should think of your arrangement is, maybe a temporary one until the IPO at which point they might reconsider competing against you with their own products or how should we think about it, the relationship in a longer term?","Dan Amos","I\u2019m going to let Charles Lake to answer that.","Charles Lake","","This deal is structured as a long term relationship deal and it is deep down in that regard. It is an exclusive agreement that makes it very clear that Japan Post group including Japan Post Insurance will be offering Aflac to cancer products. And again I maybe repeating what Tohru and Dan talked about, but Japan Post group has Japan Post Insurance as well as Japan Posting Network Company. That network company has 20,000 post offices that has 100,000 licensed agents.","As Tohru, talked about, we will be training them and so on, but there are already insurance agents that are trained. So they are going to be selling eventually when we reached 20,000 that is 100,000 agents gradually down the row Aflac Insurance and Aflac branded insurance that will gently develop within. The third component of this deal that was announced again makes that very clear that is, it is a long term relationship that we have structured here. This is a special product that we will work with them. Here are their views and then develop, but it is an Aflac branded product.","So in many ways as Dan talked about this deal, it is a game changer. It is indeed a president setting. Other insurance companies have had some access to the channel. But we are making in many ways setting a president here in a way that makes this a very, very big deal in Japan. The media coverage in Japan, all the front page articles that appeared when these deal was announced with any indication, all prime time news covering this deal with any indication, but that kind of a deal is not going to be a two year or three year deal that only was structured for the IPO so.","Hopefully, I\u2019ve given you enough or some of the flavors of the nature of a deal in a way and why we believe it\u2019s a long term.","Jeff Schuman - KBW","","Thanks, Charles. That\u2019s all very helpful. Just to be crystal clear, so when you say exclusive, that clearly means they won't sell products and other third parties. But are they precluded from manufacturing their own product?","Charles Lake","","It is an exclusive deal that Japan Post Insurance will not be developing its own cancer product.","Operator","","Thank you. Next question is Steven Schwartz from Raymond James and Associates.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","","Probably a follow-up on that one, I guess two things. The original deal was structured in 2007. Obviously, this deal has more of the post hours. But I think the assumptions had been that you\u2019re going to expand from the original amount. I guess my first question is, this didn\u2019t really sell well the first time around. I guess -- what's different this time?","Dan Amos","I want to answer this.","Charles Lake","","Okay, Dan.","Dan Amos","","And then, you can Charles. If you remember when we announced, I specifically said, don\u2019t get your hopes up too high on Japan Post. I specifically said that the banks would be much bigger than would be the post office. Everyone got real excited and our stock hit all highs at that time. I was always felt that we needed to temper it because we did not have the network or the group as we call it.","We only had one part of it and the insurance company and these agencies were not a part of it. So we never knew exactly what would happen, would the post develop their own product, would they not. This is now totally different. Now I\u2019m willing to say this is a big deal. So I\u2019m very excited about that.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay. Unless something else is going to trend in, back in 2007, if I remember correctly Dan, and I do remember, you\u2019re talking about the banks versus the post office and banks being much bigger. But I do think that you were thinking at the time that the post office might be as big as Daiichi back in the day which was about 10 billion yen. Is that reasonable to think about?","Dan Amos","","We\u2019re not going to make any comments on numbers at this point. We\u2019re in too early stage, but as I\u2019ve told, as said on CNBC, this is a game changer and I\u2019m willing to make that comment, but I can\u2019t quote numbers at this point. We\u2019ve agreed to wait and see with Japan Post and so it would be improper at this time.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks guys.","Robin Wilkey","We\u2019ve got two minutes left. So we\u2019ll take the last call, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question today comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Quick follow-up on Japan Post and then another one on the SMR, on the Post, it seems like another difference this time around is the 79 direct sales outlets that come with the deal. So what is your expectation that you\u2019d start to sell-through those outlets?","Dan Amos","Charles?","Charles Lake","Yeah. Should I answer that?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes.","Dan Amos","Yeah.","Charles Lake","Yes. That's a arrangement, that would be an agency cont arrangement between two insurance companies and that just as it was the case with Dai-ichi it requires an approval from FSA. So we will be working on that. So pending approval for FSA, as soon as we receive that approval, we will begin that process.","And again, I think, Dan, hit all the key points and maybe I\u2019m repeating, what he said, but this deal was the entire group with the holding company that ultimately makes it an integrated deal, makes it special. So, it's not just the Japan Post agency, Japan Post Insurance agency, but the Japan Post network both combined in a coherent strategy to implement as a group in exclusive deals to sell Aflac Cancer product. That's what makes it a game changer","Dan Amos","Charles, you might mention about new management.","Charles Lake","Yes. That\u2019s a very important point. Mr. Nishimuro, the new CEO of Japan Post Holdings, one of the most highly respected international business persons in Japan, former CEO of Toshiba and former CEO of Tokyo Stock Exchange and he has taken on this leadership role and he has expressed his vision for the IPO and working together with different companies and were one of the first companies to have structured the deal and made the announcement. He also made a very kind statement in the press release that we issued. So this is a private sector seal with demonstrated record of success in a global economy and Dan and Nishimuro had a wonderful meeting and we are looking forward to that strategic cooperation in that regard as well with this new management team.","I also want to mention Mr. Ishii who is the President of Japan Post Insurance, Mr. Takashi from Japan Post Network Company, all are combined working together as a team with us. Tohru and I had a number of meetings with them and we are very much looking at this as a long term and working in a way that will make this a big success. So all of this is very positive in our view.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Okay. And I guess, maybe I\u2019ll just follow-up on Japan Post. So when we went down this road with the banks, it turned out that the banks wanted a really different product than what you guys were selling through the other channels, both in terms of how the product was structured, I believe, also in terms of how they were paid commission wise.","So, I guess that initially you are going to sell, I believe what you are going to sell through Japan Post is the same cancer product that you are selling today, but I guess as we think about Japan Post wanting to create their own product, also going public and wanting to be profitable, could we see something similar as we saw with the banks in terms of, maybe a modified product that may not be similar to the cancer insurance products that you guys have sold through other channels?","Dan Amos","No. It will be similar, but it will -- it will have Japan Post stamp on it, that is what they want. But it will be same profit margins and much similar -- it will still be a cancer policy. It's not like we are all of sudden going to in wait or somewhere else. This is going to be very similar, how you would view it from an analyst perspective.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Got it. So, same margins, same benefit ratio, all that stuff.","Dan Amos","Exactly.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Perfect. Okay. Thank you.","","Robin Wilkey","Hi. Thank you very much. I appreciate all of you joining us today. If you like to follow up with any question, I will be available. So thank you very much. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the conference call.

Joining me this morning from the U.S. is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S., and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Chief Global Investment Officer. Also joining us from Tokyo is Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan, and Koji Ariyoshi, Executive Vice President and Director of Sales and Marketing in Japan.","Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some of the statements in today\u2019s conference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.","The earnings release is available on the investor page of Aflac.com and also includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with comments about the quarter and the year. Kriss and Paul will follow with an update on the operations in the U.S. and Japan respectively, and Fred will discuss our financial performance for the quarter and the year before we start taking your questions. ","We\u2019ll begin with Dan.","Dan Amos","Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let me start off by saying 2016 was another great year for Aflac. What\u2019s been an advantage for more than six decades and what sets us apart from every one of the competitors is our distinct product focus on voluntary and supplemental insurance in both the U.S. and in Japan. That focus has been a major factor in our success and I believe it will continue to drive our leading position in the future. ","I\u2019m especially pleased at our operating earnings per share growth before currency exceeded our expectations for the year, rising 4.7%. I think this is especially worth noting given the historically low interest rates and the disciplined investment in our U.S. and Japan platforms, with the goal of driving future growth and operating effectiveness.","Because we are reporting year-end results, you will hear from Teresa and Paul today about the two operating segments, Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan; but let me first say that I\u2019m pleased with the overall results of 2016 and I\u2019m proud of the hard work and accomplishments our management team, the employees, and our sales distribution in Japan and the United States. I believe both business segments are well positioned to achieve the performance goals communicated on the December outlook call.","Turning to the capital management and deployment, Fred will provide more detail shortly, but I will share a few highlights. First, as we\u2019ve said, we view growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particularly in the absence of any compelling alternative. Our plan for 2017 is to repurchase in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of our shares. ","As I said last quarter, 2016 was the 34th consecutive year in which we\u2019ve increased the cash dividend. Our objective remains to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increase in operating earnings per share on a diluted basis before the impact of foreign currency.","You\u2019ve heard me say that my job was a balance of the interests of all stakeholders. I think we did a good job in 2016, just as we have in the past, and I believe we\u2019re going to do that in 2017 by delivering on our promise to the policy holders and enhancing our shareholder value.","Now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Teresa, who will give you an update on Aflac U.S. Teresa?","Teresa White","Thank you, Dan. 2016 was the most profitable year in Aflac U.S. history in terms of pre-tax earnings. This was particularly notable as we invested over $20 million in our group technology platform. We\u2019ve begun to see our platform investments pay off in the form of improved persistency and customer satisfaction. Ninety-five percent of our policy holders who use one-day pay say they are likely to refer other people to Aflac, which will continue to differentiate and reinforce our strong brand and policy holders\u2019 trust. We\u2019ve also increased our career agents\u2019 adoption of our Everwell enrollment platform which in turn has increased account penetration in our accounts with less than 100 employees. ","Despite our progress and profitability, I am disappointed in the U.S. sales results for 2016. While we wrote almost $1.5 billion in new premium, we did not achieve our 2016 sales growth target of 3 to 5%. The career agent channel underperformed for the majority of 2016. Sales to groups with less than 100 employees, which is the focus of our career agents, were relatively flat for the year; however, over the past 18 months, I\u2019ve witnessed the positive correlation between sales and compensation, so those sales leaders who have done really well have been rewarded, and those who have not done well have caused significant turnover. This results in a short term disruption; however, these changes are better for Aflac in the long run.","Moving into 2017, we\u2019ll continue to focus our career sales agents on groups with fewer than 100 employees. I believe this market is Aflac\u2019s to grow because our career sales agents are best positioned within the industry to reach and therefore succeed with these smaller employers.","We will also continuing improving the productivity of new recruits, as we did in 2016. Recruiting fell more than we would have liked, but I continue to believe that this approach will not only continue to improve the productivity of our recruits but also their retention. Ultimately, our efforts will lead to longer, more productive Aflac careers.","Looking to broker business, while we did have an increase in the broker business, the broker pipeline did not materialize as we expected. Sales in the middle market of groups of 100 to 999 employees were negative, whereas broker sales to groups with 1,000 or more employees experienced double-digit percent growth in 2016. In the end, the final few weeks of December were just not strong enough for us to achieve our sales goals.","Based on this success that we\u2019ve had in the large account market, we plan to expand our broker team by 25% by adding more than 30 positions in 2017 to include additional roles designed to focus on that midmarket space. This was an area that we struggled in in 2016, especially as we made a conscious decision to be a bit more selective in the sale of our group product in smaller account segments. With the additional roles designed to focus on this midmarket space along with process efficiency gains, we believe we can profitably grow this segment. ","While disappointed in 2016 sales growth, we remain committed to the fundamental strategies designed to balance growth and preserve our margin. It\u2019s important to realize the fourth quarter 2016 was the second largest sales quarter behind fourth quarter 2015 in absolute dollar terms in Aflac U.S. history. ","As we continue to evolve from one channel focused on the small case market to a multi-channel operation with the emphasis on growing the broker channel, I\u2019m reminded that it does take time. The broker channel has a three-year compounded annual growth rate of 12%; however, it only represents 30% of our business. Sometimes our size masks the progress that we\u2019ve made in that channel. Our goal is to grow it fast while maintaining the stability of our career force. ","In closing, I want to reiterate that we continue to target the long-term compound annual growth rate of 3 to 5% that we provided in our December outlook call.","Now let me turn the program over to Paul.","Paul Amos","Thank you, Teresa. Next, I\u2019ll provide highlights from Aflac Japan\u2019s operations, which had a profitable year in terms of pre-tax earnings. We did, however, face headwinds due to the persistent low interest rate environment and absorbed a fourth quarter reserve adjustment which impacted overall profitability. Fred will discuss the financials in detail later, but I would note that we anticipate that low interest rates will remain one of the biggest issues facing the Japanese life insurance industry in 2017.","I\u2019m very happy with Aflac Japan\u2019s strong annual third sector sales increase of 4.1%, which is at the high end of the 2016 expectation of flat to up 5%. These results were impressive considering we upwardly revised our sales targets twice in 2016. Aflac Japan produced solid results across all channels and further affirmed its leading position in the third sector market.","On the product side, we\u2019re excited to report that cancer insurance sales were up 8.5% for the year. Second half sales results also benefited from the July introduction of a new third sector product called income support insurance. As you\u2019ll recall, this product provide fixed benefit amounts should a policy holder be unable to work due to significant illness or injury. It was developed to supplement the disability coverage provided through Japan\u2019s social security system. ","Our income support insurance targets consumers in their 20s through 40s, which is a segment of the population where we\u2019ve been underrepresented. Income support insurance was received favorably and has the potential to gradually develop into a new product pillar over the long term.","Turning to the interest rate sensitive first sector products, you will recall that we proactively pulled products from select channels and aggressive re-priced our wave and child endowment products, factoring in the reality of a prolonged low interest rate environment. Aflac Japan made notable progress in 2016 to limit the sale of first sector savings products. As planned, our actions prompted a 57% decrease in sales of first sector products in the second half of the year.","Regarding our distribution channels, our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success, and this was certainly true throughout 2016. Our alliance partners also made significant contributions to our sales results. I am particularly pleased that in October, Japan Post began selling our new cancer insurance product designed exclusively for cancer survivors. Our traditional agencies started selling the product in March of 2016. We anticipate the sales of cancer insurance for cancer survivors will provide marginal benefit to our overall sales, but more importantly it will bolster our brand, trustworthiness and reputation that we worked hard over the years to establish. Being there for Japan\u2019s consumers when they need us most is our top priority. ","Our strategic alliance partners have been successful at selling Aflac products in 2016. Given current results that prompt an intense focus on moving their own products to meet Japan fiscal year-end goals, sales of Aflac\u2019s third sector products in the first quarter will be impacted. As we look ahead, Aflac Japan\u2019s focus will remain on selling our third sector products, which are less interest rate sensitive, and on strengthening our leading presence in places where people make their insurance buying decisions.","We\u2019ll continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduce new innovative third sector products to maintain our market leadership. Near term, this includes the February 20 launch of our revised EVER and GIFT [ph] products. As we communicated on our December outlook call, we view Aflac Japan\u2019s long term compound annual growth rate at 4 to 6%.","Now let me turn it over to Fred.","Fred Crawford","Thanks Paul. First, let me say that I\u2019m pleased with the overall financial results of the company for both the quarter and the year. Our earnings results for the full year exceeded our expectations going into 2016. Operating EPS on a currency neutral basis was up 4.7% for the year and within the increased guidance range communicated on our third quarter call. Our earnings results are particularly noteworthy considering proactive investments in our business model, the Bank of Japan\u2019s actions early in the year, and a fourth quarter reserve strengthening.","Turning to the fourth quarter results, there\u2019s a few items worth calling out that negatively impacted the reported earnings. First, as mentioned during both our third quarter call and our outlook call, we completed our year-end actuarial review of interest-sensitive blocks of business in Japan. There are two smaller blocks of legacy third sector business that have been subject to strengthening in the past years due to continual interest rate declines. The specific strengthening in the quarter was on a closed block of business we refer to as super care, and resulted in a charge of 6 billion yen or roughly $0.08 per share. It\u2019s important to note that this is a GAAP only impact and does not affect FSA reserves, cash flow, or core capital ratios.","Additional items that negatively impacted the quarter include corporate expenses, which were elevated as a result of stock compensation expense and accelerated amortization due to retirement eligibility; in addition, elevated interest expense related to our debt issuance in September, which prefunded maturities in February. Together, these items amounted to roughly $0.03 a share in the quarter. If you exclude only the reserve strengthening in Japan, our fourth quarter operating earnings per share were within the expected range provided in the third quarter.","Our Japan segment margins were solid when adjusted for the reserve strengthening. Benefit ratios, expense ratio, and pre-tax margins were all in line with recent results and our outlook call guidance. I would note that going forward, our ratios and margins in Japan will reflect hedge costs on an amortized basis related to Japan\u2019s dollar investment portfolio.","U.S. benefit ratios continue to trend favorably for the quarter, and our expense ratio was in line with our guidance and reflecting progress on certain strategic initiatives and increased promotional spend. Overall, our U.S. pre-tax profit margins exceeded our annual guidance range for the year, coming in at 19.6%.","Turning to investments, results for both the quarter and the year were aligned with our expectations as we continue to navigate the low yield environment in Japan and further diversify our portfolio. As we discussed during our outlook call, we successfully executed on a comprehensive plan to address strategic and investment challenges: first, as Paul mentioned, curtailing interest-sensitive premium flows by reducing the sale of first sector savings products; second, timely execution of a successful switch trade designed to shift our U.S. dollar investment strategy more toward floating rate assets in order to more effectively hedge and optimize investment income; and finally, we lengthened the duration of our hedge program through purchasing longer dated forwards. This proved to be of good timing as we locked in 90% of hedge costs for 2017 and just over 30% of 2018 costs prior to an increase in costs coming off the presidential election. These moves result in lower investment income in Japan in the near term while we work to reinvest into higher yielding and floating rate assets, but are designed to reduce volatility in quarterly earnings, cash flow, and capital ratios. ","With respect to Japan\u2019s dollar program and hedge costs, our reported fourth quarter costs were $62 million pre-tax on an amortized basis. As discussed on the outlook call, we adopted an amortized approach in the fourth quarter to reflect a full year 2016 and to adjust past periods. As mentioned earlier, we are moving these costs into our operating earnings definition for 2017. We are maintaining our guidance for 2017 pre-tax hedge costs in the range of $250 million to $270 million, assuming no change in our strategy.","In terms of our capital position, despite market volatility in the quarter, we ended the year with strong capital ratios with SMR and RBC estimated in the mid 900% range and mid 800% range respectively. We ended the year with $1.5 billion of excess liquidity at the holding company, which includes $500 million of contingency capital. Overall credit conditions and asset quality remain strong with only a modest level of impairment in the quarter.","I\u2019m pleased to say we continue to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. Including dividends and share repurchase, we returned approximately $2.1 billion to our shareholders in 2016. As we mentioned on our outlook call, we expect to deploy capital in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion to shareholders in 2017. This includes $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of share repurchase with approximately $800 million to $1 billion of repurchase in the first half of the year. As is always the case, this assumes share repurchase remains the optimal use of excess capital in driving long-term shareholder value.","Finally, I want to reiterate our 2017 earnings guidance of $6.40 to $6.65 per share on a currency neutral basis. I would note that our final currency neutral exchange rate came in at roughly 109 yen to the dollar, or one yen lower than the 110 we used on the outlook call. Similar to last year, we did not adjust the rounded range for the few pennies of additional annual earnings. To be clear, our planned earnings are essentially unchanged and it\u2019s safe to assume we added a few pennies to our actual forecast accordingly.","In addition, our sensitivities to a given change in yen were updated as we refined our modeling of the foreign exchange impact on locked-in hedge costs in preparation of installing into our reported operating earnings. Looking ahead, we remain well positioned in terms of core margins and capital strength consistent with our December outlook call comments.","I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Robin.","Robin Wilkey","Thank you, Fred. Now we\u2019re ready to take your questions, but please let me remind you that to be fair to everybody in the queue, limit yourself to one initial question and only one follow-up that relates to your initial question.","We\u2019ll now begin taking the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question is from Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, sir.","Nigel Dally","Great, thanks, and good morning. This question is on guidance. When the yen is at 115, the midpoint of the EPS guidance seems to have declined $0.09 from what you provided back in December. Just hoping you can discuss what drove that change.","Fred Crawford","So a couple things, Nigel. Your comment is really relative to sensitivity. What\u2019s changed is in the course of working towards installing hedge costs into our operating earnings in 2017, we refined our model to reflect having locked in those hedge costs effectively prior to entering 2017. What happens is that has the effect of essentially locking in a dollar-based expense at the time of that transaction, and so the way our actual results end up playing out because we\u2019ve locked in those hedge costs is effectively reducing the dollar coupon income, if you will, in Japan. This has the effect of increasing the relative yen earnings to dollar earnings, and therefore increasing the sensitivity.","This is a very nuanced issue, but it has less to do with the nature of hedge costs and amortization and more really to do with the fact that we have locked in those costs with a fixed exchange rate that therefore does not float throughout the year, so it has the effect of increasing our relative yen revenue and earnings, if you will, relative to our total.","What I would tell you is this - both the hedge costs in our operating earnings as well as the strategy of locking in longer dated hedges are both new strategies, and as we go through the year, we\u2019re going to watch very carefully these sensitivities, and obviously as we see them move around, we\u2019ll adjust if necessary; but this is our best estimate at the moment.","Nigel Dally","Okay, got it. The follow-up is just on U.S. recruited agents. You touched on it briefly in the earlier remarks, but they seem to have dropped to the lowest level we\u2019ve seen in many years. Just hoping to get some additional color as to what\u2019s going on there and whether that\u2019s also a contributing factor to the sales challenges.","Teresa White","Nigel, specifically on recruited agents, if you recall in my comments last year, we talked about making sure that we drove agent productivity, so we\u2019re looking at this from a long term perspective. What we saw as our focus was on productivity was an increase in the productivity of the agent. We saw an increase in new associate APs. We saw an increase in new accounts, and so those were all positives that we saw as it relates to recruited agents. What our data supports is that we know that we have a strong correlation between lifetime tenure with Aflac if the agents get started off and they start off well, so that was really the focus there. ","We did have broker recruiting as well. We actually increased our penetration in our current brokers as well, so we focused on that. Now, that\u2019s not to say though that in 2017, we have a focus on recruiting, but what we wanted to do is we wanted to fix that front end funnel so that we could make sure that the people who were recruited in had a likelihood of staying with us, and we are seeing the retention of an agent coming in going to year two increase, so that\u2019s really what we were solving for.","Nigel Dally","Very helpful, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Your line is now open, sir. ","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. First, Fred, I just had a question on if you could give us some color on your forward rate assumptions that you\u2019re using in the super care block in terms of reserves, and under what situation would you--could the charge that you saw this quarter beat, and just give us some idea on what you\u2019re assuming and how often you reassess reserves.","Fred Crawford","Sure. So this is an annual process that as you may recall has gone on for years, and of course I don\u2019t have the history but many around the table here do, and so do many of you as analysts. But over the past 10 years or so, we\u2019re periodically added to reserves both on this block but also on a dementia block, and typically for similar reasons with the persistently lower interest rate environment in Japan. So that to degree, it\u2019s not unusual - these tend to be blocks we focused in on in low rate environments, not surprisingly.","What we did more specifically is we took the long term new money rate assumption down around 22 basis points. We took it down from roughly 175 to 150 - 1.5%, and realize that the new money rate assumptions include both the yen investments as well as the dollar program, and also incorporate hedge costs which back off those dollar coupons, so it\u2019s really looking at the investment strategy.","What\u2019s very unique about Aflac and somewhat a testimonial to the conservative nature of the company is that we also tend to have a practice of leaving those low rates long forever; in other words, we don\u2019t assume a recovering rate out into the future, which would make a difference in the level of charge, and we do that simply to be conservative but also to some degree to put this type of risk behind us as we look at the assumptions. So that amounted to the charge, so in other words your portfolio yield eventually grades down to the 1.5%.","In terms of future rate risk, of course, that\u2019s going to be dependent upon what we see going on in Japan. We\u2019ll do the same thing we do every year, which is test the reserves according to the rate environment. We\u2019ve seen some very recent recovery, but as is often the case, we tend not to be shifting around our assumptions based on short-term moves in rates down or up. But we felt the Bank of Japan action earlier in the year was fairly significant and it somewhat recast a new rate environment for us, and so we felt it really prudent to recast our long-term rate assumptions. That\u2019s not always going to be the case.","The only other thing I would tell you is that realize that on this particular block, it\u2019s 4% of our reserves. Together with dementia, that\u2019s less than 10% of our reserves, and there is really no rate risk with the majority of business that we have in Japan. There is very little, if any, rate risk in the U.S., and really what we\u2019re talking about here is a GAAP testing process. While we do test statutory and FSA, the reserves are quite adequate there. The margins are strong and we don\u2019t see risk in our core capital ratios.","If that helps you out, hopefully it gives you the information you need.","Jimmy Bhullar","Sure. Then maybe just for Teresa, there is a lot of talk obviously of changes in the healthcare landscape in the U.S. What\u2019s the risk that the whole uncertainty about what the changes are going to be pressures your sales this year as small businesses sort of defer the decision to add additional benefits? Are you seeing some of that in the market, and do you expect--is that factored into your assumptions for sales growth this year?","Teresa White","Well, I\u2019ll tell you there is a lot of talk about it, but I don\u2019t have enough evidence to say whether it will impact sales or not. I have some meetings in the next couple of weeks with various broker partners, and I\u2019m also talking to various folks in our field force to really just understand what they\u2019re hearing and what they\u2019re seeing, but at this point I think it\u2019s still early yet, and I don\u2019t know that I can assign that as a cost or put any factor on that as it relates to U.S. sales.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Just to follow up on the U.S. sales, can you talk a little bit in terms of why you are seeing the weakness in the mid-case market?","Teresa White","Certainly. So we saw the less than 100s relatively flat. Mid-case market, as you are aware, is really serviced by both our veteran agents, and we have a number of veteran agents who have existing accounts in that mid-case market, but also it\u2019s serviced by our broker partners. We\u2019ve seen a lot more brokers move into that space.","A couple of things that we\u2019re doing in 2017, I explained that in 2016 our focus was on new and building that front end of the funnel. I think that we took the eye off of that mid-case market specifically from a veteran perspective, and so we\u2019re driving some incentives to the mid-case market from a veteran perspective to allow them to be able to go back into their existing accounts and drive sales there. ","The other piece of this is that as brokers have moved into that mid-case market, what we found is we were really underpenetrated from a broker sales professional perspective, so we call the people who are sales people for Aflac broker sales professionals, and we need to make sure that we actually can execute in that market, so we\u2019re going to increase the number of people--25% increase in the number of people in that broker--as broker sales professionals to basically target the mid-case market.","So I think it\u2019s really more about under-penetration in that area.","Dan Amos","I\u2019d also like to respond on that one moment. One of the things that we made a decision on, and Teresa played a big role in this, is the 100 to 250, we made a conscientious decision not to write that on a group platform. Now, one reason we did is our manual--so much of our systems over there is manual, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve spent $25 million to invest in the future. We found out the 100 to 250, we were making basically zero profits or losing a little bit, and it was also taking time away from our accounts of 1,000 or more from a service perspective, so she made the call to concentrate on the 1,000, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen a 12% compound growth in the 1,000 or more.","So will we eventually go back to the 100 and 250? Yes, when these new systems are put in starting January 1 of next year. But we have moved away from that unless we have such a big block of business from a certain broker, and then we are taking that on as an entire block to keep them happy. But service is the issue there, as well as profitability.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thank you for the color. Then maybe shifting it to Japan a little bit, the cancer sales continue to be pretty strong throughout 2016, and I know part of it is because of the new cancer survivorship product being well received. How much would you consider this just because the reception being better than expected, or would it be partly because of Japan Post continuing to be delivering better than expected production relative to your baseline assumptions?","Paul Amos","Humphrey, thank you for the question. This is Paul. I will tell you that it\u2019s a combination of all factors. First of all, cancer sales are not up just because of Japan Post or just because of the new product. No doubt the new product was additive and Japan Post has continued to produce in a manner that is in line with what we would expect and want. We can\u2019t go into the specifics about any of their numbers, but what I can tell you is that the Japanese consumer continues to see cancer as a productive line of business that is positive for them, and continues to see--we continue to see across the board demand for the product, so we remain optimistic. Obviously as the numbers on this particular product and this particular launch of our cancer product over time will dissipate, but as you know, we always are looking to reinvent our products and launch new versions of those, and so just as we\u2019ve announced on February 20 we\u2019ll launch a new medical as well as a new first sector protection product in our GIFT plan, we will look in the future to eventually launch a new cancer plan, and we have every belief that the long term viability [indiscernible].","Humphrey Lee","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open, sir.","John Nadel","Hi, good morning everybody. A question on the U.S. market. So clearly a shift for the larger case market. I\u2019m just curious whether we should expect that the margin on sales generated to 1,000 lives or bigger groups should be similar, or probably I\u2019m guessing lower than the margins you would generate at the lower end of the market, just given the pricing competition at the upper end.","Teresa White","This is Teresa. One of the things that we\u2019re looking at is we\u2019ve said that the group would have slightly--it\u2019d probably be very similar, but slightly less than our margins on the individual side, and today as Dan talked about, what we\u2019re really trying to work on is the thing that\u2019s depressing the margin right now is more about administration. So as we work on administration, I think we can move the margins back to where we priced them.","Paul Amos","That\u2019s right, and I would just add to that that there is a competitive landscape - no question - in the larger case market in general, and we\u2019ll have to be mindful of that but realize that the types of returns we\u2019re generating are quite comfortably well above our cost of capital and additive. But Teresa is exactly right - what you\u2019ll find at a lot of companies is pricing for your aspirational expense base as opposed to pricing for your actual expenses, and Aflac\u2019s practice is to price according to what we\u2019re seeing in the way of administrative expenses, so many of the investments that Dan mentioned and Teresa just noted are designed around solving for a more efficient platform that creates the dynamic of improved returns going forward.","John Nadel","Just as a quick follow-up on that, how big is the differential right now in sort of priced foreign margin?","Paul Amos","You know, Todd, I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve got a view on that in terms of the differential in margin? I\u2019m going to say at least a few hundred basis points.","Todd Daniels","Yes, that\u2019s about right.","Paul Amos","I don\u2019t want to guess, but Todd is nodding, so something in the neighborhood of 200 to 300 basis points would not be unusual.","John Nadel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then a question for Dan. Dan, you--","Paul Amos","Realize by the way--hey John, you realize, by the way, that\u2019s starting from a very high return base on our core business, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking 10% to 7%. We\u2019re talking about mid-teens and seeing a 300 basis point differential in pricing.","John Nadel","Yes, I understand. Then Dan, just a question for you on the outlook for dividend growth, common dividend growth. You\u2019ve talked for a long time now about targeting increases in the dividend over time in line with operating income growth, ex-currency. But I think by your own guidance for 2017 and certainly by our estimates, your operating income will be flat to down, EPS may be modestly up given the buybacks. Should we expect that maybe 2017 is a year where the dividend moves flat?","Dan Amos","No, I think you should look for an increase in the dividend. Where or how, I\u2019m not exactly sure where it will end up, but as you know, we tend to be a little on the conservative side, and we always are very attuned to individual shareholders, and that is--of course, we have much more institutions today, but they are still a part of our company, so we\u2019re always trying to find ways to make sure the dividend is growing.","John Nadel","Okay, and if I could follow up with one more quick one. If you didn\u2019t hedge 90% of the costs, if you didn\u2019t lock in 90% of the costs for the hedge program for 2017, how much higher today versus pre-election would those hedge costs be running?","Fred Crawford","I\u2019ll toss to Eric on that, John, and we can comment on what we\u2019re seeing.","Eric Kirsch","From election to now, I\u2019d say it\u2019s about, on a one-year basis, 20, 25 basis points. Keep in mind, the long end of the curve went up a lot since the election; the short end really has not moved all that much because it\u2019s still based on short-term rate differentials, and on that basis with the Fed\u2019s actions that they did in December were very much expected by the market. But the increase was more or less in line with our expectations in either event.","John Nadel","Got it, thank you so much.","Dan Amos","One other thing I just want to mention. One thing also that drives our interest in that dividend is we\u2019re an elite group of people with going 34 years of continuing increases in the dividend, so I wouldn\u2019t want to stop it for that, either.","John Nadel","Understood.","Operator","Our next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. First just for Teresa, you\u2019ve given some of these numbers, but was hoping you could just provide a couple more. In the U.S., can you just give the sales growth detail for groups, I guess both 1,000 lives as well as the midmarket, as well as what the growth was for the individual or small case? Then also, roughly how much does each channel contribute to your overall sales volumes?","Teresa White","The midmarket was actually our negative. We were in the negatives there, negative single digits, flat in the less than 100, and we had double-digit increases in the greater than 1,000. I can get specifics offline. Now, the other thing is the large majority of our business sits in the less than 100 category, so that\u2019s where we have the majority of our business and then we go up to the mid-case and then the larger case. ","Our challenge right now is from a broker perspective, whereas Aflac is very heavy - 70% of career, 30% broker production. Most of our competitors are just the opposite, and so our base is a lot bigger as far as the core, which then drives us to have to overcome that big base.","The other thing is just when you look at the 100 to 999, if you just pull that out and you look at 250 to 999, that was relatively flat as well, so there\u2019s a specific area within that 100 to 250 that we saw the level of decrease, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re really focusing. We believe some of that was primarily the instance that Dan talked about, which was the 100 to 250 space where we decided to be very selective in what we sold from a group perspective in those smaller case markets.","Dan Amos","It was self-inflicted, to a great degree.","Teresa White","Yes.","Erik Bass","Got it. Then just one follow-up for Paul. You mentioned the new EVER product you\u2019re coming out with. I don\u2019t know how many details you can give at this point, but would you characterize it as sort of a major revision, or just minor tweaks to the product?","Paul Amos","Yes, this is more of a major overhaul. We traditionally, over about a three-year period, will do both minor revisions or additions of small riders, as we did about 18 months ago. This particular revision is one that is more significant in nature. That said, as we\u2019ve talked about both at MiniFab [ph] and otherwise, the competitiveness of the medical market continues to be strong, and so we feel that while this product will be additive to sales, I\u2019m tempering excitement somewhat in the overall product launch but I feel that for most of our channels, it will be strong.","Keep in mind, however, as we think about our strategic alliance partners, be it Daiichi, be it Japan Post, [indiscernible] and others, they don\u2019t sell our medical product, and such a large percentage of our sales continues to be focused on cancer, and that\u2019s something you have to keep in mind as you look at a product launch of EVER itself.","Erik Bass","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Krueger","Hey thanks, good morning. I have one for Fred. Do you have an update on how much of the $2.5 billion floating rate U.S. dollar portfolio that you\u2019ve added so far?","Fred Crawford","Yes, so I think you\u2019re referring to the switch trade that we did last year, where we sold out of U.S. dollar bonds, went into JGBs, and are now feathering our way back into a floating rate portfolio. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what your question is?","Ryan Krueger","Yes, [indiscernible].","Fred Crawford","Yes, so very little, very little. It will build throughout the year. In fact, and I\u2019ll give you some additional detail, our estimate of the drag to net investment income in 2017 related to the switch trade is running right around $0.08 to $0.10 for the full year. The difference in that range will have to do with the pace of putting that money to work. We\u2019re actively engaged in both qualifying and starting the process of preparing to fund as good loans come in our direction, and really emphasis on that last piece, and that is the pace of it is not--we\u2019re not in a rush, if you will, to put money to work ignoring, if you will, the credit fundamentals. These tend to be by definition double-B-ish type investment credit ratings, and so you want to be particularly careful that you put it to work in a measured way.","So we\u2019ve been somewhat conservative and practical in that build of the portfolio, and expect it to go on throughout the year.","Eric, if you\u2019ve got something to add, please do.","Eric Kirsch","Yes, I would just add a couple of comments. In our planning, because we are forming more partnerships with lenders, if you will, both for middle market loans and transitional real estate, and I should mention that transitional real estate by and large is investment grade versus the middle market loans that are double-B. But in our planning relative to the guidance that Fred\u2019s previously given to you is an assumption that we start to fund by the end of the second quarter. To the extent we\u2019re able to get them online sooner, that will be a net positive to our earnings for the year; but we were conservative because as Fred said, we want to be conservative on the underwriting. We like underwriting, we like credit risk. We think we do that well, but because it\u2019s a larger core allocation, we also have to be just as careful around onboarding and starting the process of more volume of those.","So it\u2019s conservatively estimated, but it will be a net positive to our net investment income after hedge costs, so while we took a short term decline in net investment income, long term this is a very good relative value proposition for our program.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks, then one more for Teresa. I guess you have a long term U.S. sales target of 3 to 5% growth. Given some of the initiatives you\u2019re working on for 2017, do you think that\u2019s achievable this year?","Teresa White","I\u2019m certainly still--I feel like we\u2019re still going to be within the range of CAGR that we provided, so absolutely.","Ryan Krueger","Great, thank you.","Teresa White","Now I\u2019m going to tell you, we\u2019re going to have a tough first quarter. I do want to say that. But I feel pretty good about the--what we\u2019ve already talked about, the guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Partners. Your line is now open.","Randy Binner","Hey, good morning, thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the benefit ratio and kind of loss margins in Japan. That benefit ratio is higher in our model than it\u2019s been several quarters just on a core basis, and my understanding was that utilization trends have just been very favorable in Japan, and that I kind of expected that benefit ratio to stay where it had been, maybe even work lower. So the question I have is, was there anything unusual in the benefit and loss activity in the fourth quarter, outside of the super care charge? And can I get an update on how loss trends and utilization is going in Japan? Hospital utilization is mostly what I\u2019m referring to. ","Fred Crawford","Yes, I\u2019ll answer a couple of the questions, and then certainly welcome Todd Daniels to comment on sort of utilization trends if he has more color to add. But just a couple things, and you hit on it, Randy, so first recognize that the reported benefit ratio to premium, the 74% that if you adjust for the reserve strengthening, that comes down to around 72.5%, 72.4%, and is actually consistent sequentially with what we reported in the third quarter. Now, it is a tick up from the fourth quarter last year, but that\u2019s not unusual that you\u2019ll have those types of fluctuations as you\u2019re doing IB&R adjustments and the like every quarter, frankly. So that\u2019s what I mean by saying that core benefit ratio, when adjusted for the reserve strengthening, is in line with our expectations in Japan.","In terms of utilization and overall trends that are driving the benefit ratio and hospitalization trends, they have indeed been favorable, albeit that over time they naturally start the process of plateauing a bit, meaning that you eventually start to see it stabilize but at these favorable rates. So we do see pockets of improvement, but maybe not as material as they have been historically. ","Todd, do you have anything you want to comment on?","Todd Daniels","Yes, I\u2019ll just mention too that for the year-to-date benefit ratio when adjusting for the super care adjustment was 72.2% as a ratio to premium, and that\u2019s still trending lower versus what we saw in \u201914, \u201915. Regarding the utilization, we are continuing to see hospitalizations trend in a positive manner, so we are reflecting that periodically as we do our reserve testing.","Randy Binner","Just as long as I have you on utilization, on the U.S. side the margins were pretty good. Any update on utilization trends there, because that\u2019s also been a tailwind, I think, the last couple of years.","Fred Crawford","Yes, I think there, it\u2019s a slightly different story. There are those fundamental trends that have been positive, but there\u2019s also a mix of business dynamic playing into it. Todd, again I\u2019ll ask if you have anything to add.","Todd Daniels","That\u2019s right - there\u2019s some mix of business playing into it. As Fred mentioned, I think in the prior quarter, we have tended to sell more products with these guarantee issue features, and as we went into some of these products, we were relatively conservative with these--pricing these during these guarantee issue periods. We\u2019ve seen some favorable experience with that, so as our mix of business has shifted to more products with those features, we have seen the benefit ratio come down.","I will say as we look at things on an overall lifetime basis, we do see these ratios moderating a bit. I wouldn\u2019t expect an increase in 2017, however; I think we\u2019re still going to see a continuation of the benefit ratio we saw in 2016.","Fred Crawford","I think one thing I would add, and again I realize that any particular quarter does not tell that full story, but just don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that there is some level of correlation between record U.S. profits and profit margin and our sales progression, and that is one thing that we have let our guard down on, is really a couple things. One is pricing with a level of conservatism, focus on high quality business, and we\u2019re not going to chase competitive dynamics in pockets where we think it\u2019s not the right kind of business for us.","So again, it\u2019s a long term plan of that type of discipline that yields the kind of earnings results in the U.S., but there is a correlation.","Randy Binner","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Sid Camus [ph] with CD [ph]. Your line is now open.","Sid Camus","Thanks and good morning. Just wanted to ask a couple more on the U.S. Teresa, in your prepared comments, you talked about some turnover disruption, I think associated with some of the senior leadership. How long do you think that\u2019s going to take to fix?","Teresa White","Well, we put in the performance management plan end of 2014, I think is when we started it, so we had a full year in 2015. 2015, we basically are correlating sales growth with our compensation, and those that are in those roles--we also had some retirements as well, so I need to say that. But our goal is to make sure that when people move into those roles, they understand the dynamics of the market, they understand how the market--what they need to do within the market, and so obviously when something is just put in, you\u2019re going to have a cycle of more moves than you have ongoing, so we hope to stabilize within 2017 to see what we have.","We\u2019ve been seeing a lot more competitors wanting to come in, come to join the markets as well, and so we\u2019re hoping to see that stabilize within 2017. But you know, again, it\u2019s really all about whether there is--whether the performance is where it needs to be.","Dan Amos","Let me make a comment about that. In the last 18 months, we\u2019ve had a turnover at the MKD level, which would be equivalent to what we call in charge of the state, of 50% of the people. As Teresa said, it was either due to retirements or it was due to lack of income that they were used to because their sales were not where they should be, and therefore they made a lot less money.","Because of all these openings, we\u2019ve had opportunities not only to fill them with our people, but we\u2019ve had a lot of competitors come our way and interested in those slots. Teresa has filled those slots with some key people that are growing our business, or that we expect to grow our business in 2017.","But anytime you\u2019ve got a lot of changes like this, it does take a little time, and as Teresa said, it makes it a little bit harder the first quarter because of all these changes, and so hopefully we\u2019ll see it--","Teresa White","--stabilized in the year, yes.","Dan Amos","Okay?","Sid Camus","Yes, that\u2019s fine. I had one follow-up actually, Dan, either for you or for Teresa, I guess. A couple years ago, we spent a lot of time talking about channel conflict between the brokers and the traditional agents. Some of the comments you made earlier, particularly in that mid-case market, it sounds like both of those distribution channels are participating in that mid-case market, so I guess the question is are those channel conflict issues behind us now, or is there still some of that stuff going on in the U.S.?","Teresa White","Well you know, I don\u2019t know that channel conflict will ever be totally behind us from that perspective, but it\u2019s not at a fever pitch. I think that our directors of sales, both on the career side - Andy Glaub, who is looking at it from a U.S. perspective, but focused on the career side, and then Drew Niziak, who is on the broker side, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of collaboration that\u2019s happening, and quite frankly in various markets, we see that our broker teams are working collectively with our career teams to enhance what we deliver to brokers as enrollers, etc. ","So we\u2019ve seen it work, we see it working, but are there still pockets where we have channel conflict? Absolutely, there are pockets. Really, I think that\u2019s where--it really becomes a matter of understanding where the market is taking us and making sure that we deliver tools and services for each of the market sets, so both of those markets, especially from a career perspective, can grow. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do.","Sid Camus","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Tom Gallagher","Thanks. Teresa, just a follow-up on what\u2019s going on, on the distribution side. Just to be clear, is the high turnover in some of the underperforming regions for the agency channel that you\u2019re referring to, is that because they\u2019re getting picked off and recruited away by competitors, or are those people that you\u2019re firing, that you\u2019re pushing out?","Teresa White","The majority of the people that have moved out of those market positions have moved into sales positions, so many of them have decided to move back down into a coordinator-type position within Aflac. So I\u2019ve not heard of many of them going to competitors, if that was your question.","Tom Gallagher","Yes, it is. Thank you. Then--so from the standpoint of this turnover and the impact on sales, was a lot of this happening later in the year and that\u2019s why 1Q is going to be affected? Can you talk us through the--","Teresa White","Right, so if you think about it from a sales perspective, we\u2019re looking at sales targets by quarter, and most of the volume is hitting in the fourth quarter. So many of the changes happened within the third and fourth quarter where we started seeing that people were not going to meet objectives. Some of them decided that they would retire, that type of thing, so yes, that\u2019s why we are anticipating a little bit more disruption in the fourth quarter as well as in the first quarter.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. Then just Paul, a question for you. You were referencing the strategic alliance partners in Japan pivoting to their own products into the fiscal year-end as being one of the reasons why 1Q is going to be softer. Can you just comment on your level of confidence that this isn\u2019t the beginning of a weaker trend with the alliance partners, that this 1Q dip is not the sign of some kind of signal for where those sales are likely to go in the subsequent quarter as well?","Paul Amos","I obviously can\u2019t get into specifics, but I can tell you I\u2019m extremely confident. The reality is that for their fiscal fourth quarter, and of course kicking off their year, the beginning of the first quarter for them is the second quarter for us, sales could be slightly light; but we know the second half of the year will be strong. We talk to our partners and make commitments internally on an annual basis. As I\u2019ve said, they outperformed the first three quarters of their year, ending in the end of last year, and as I can\u2019t go into specifics and I don\u2019t want to put us in any kind of a precarious situation, all I can say is that I think this is temporary in nature and is partly reflective of the success that we\u2019ve had with our alliance partners, but should in no way temper future expectations.","Dan Amos","I will make a comment that I\u2019ve seen this with Daiichi Life - once they make their numbers, they tend to focus on other things and then set the new numbers for the next year. So the way these numbers will fall out after the first quarter will be a new year, so they\u2019ll be setting the new numbers and making those, and that\u2019s just their way of doing business from a Japanese perspective.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Robin Wilkey","All right, thank you very much. We\u2019ve answered all the calls that came in, so please let me just follow up with a couple comments. I want to share with you today our calendar for 2017 is available on the investor relations page of aflac.com.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations.","Robin Wilkey","Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Ken Janke, President of Aflac U.S, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also joining us today from Tokyo are Paul Amos, President of Aflac; and Tohru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan.","Before we get started, let me remind you that some statements in the teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although, we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they\u2019re prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and the year as well as our operations in Japan and the U.S. I will follow-up with a few financial highlights for the quarter and the year and then we will be taking your questions. Dan?","Dan Amos","Thank you, Robin, and good morning. I am pleased that we met and in many cases exceeded our financial targets for the quarter and for the year.","Let me begin today with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. Pre-tax earnings in yen were up 16.9% for the quarter and 13.6% for the year, reflecting a stronger dollar. Sales of our third sector products were up 15.7% for the quarter and for the year third sector sales increased 4%, which was at the high-end of the annual sales target of flat 5%. The increase in third sector sales largely reflects a favorable response to our newest ever medical product introduced in August and innovative advertising promotions of this product.","As anticipated our largest medical policy has proven especially popular with consumers in their 20s to 40s. Even our under penetration of this demographic, I\u2019m especially pleased that these efforts do appeal to consumers in their 20s to 40s that yield very positive results for us. Consistent with our expectations, Japan\u2019s new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter declined 33.3% for the quarter and 29.1% for the year. These results are largely attributable to the significant decline in the sale of WAYS product following the repricing of first sector products in April.","Reflecting on the expansion of our distribution channels, we\u2019re pleased with our agreement with Aflac Japan and Japan Post Holdings. I believe that in the coming years cancer sales through Japan Post will steadily benefit our business. If you recall the first sector sales particularly WAYS were very strong in the first three months of last year leading up to the premium rate increase that took effect in April of 2013.","As a result, we expect first sector products to be down 60% in the first quarter of 2014 due to very difficult comparisons to last year. However, the second through the fourth quarter of this year we expect the sale of first sector product to be slightly down compared to last year. Most importantly, though, our focus this year will remain on growing the sales of third sector products. As such, we anticipate third sector product sales to increase 2% to 7% in 2014.","Now let me briefly discuss U.S operations. Pre-tax earnings were down 1.3% for the quarter, but up 4.1% for the year. For the year Aflac U.S pre-tax operating earnings were ahead of our target. In the fourth quarter, which typically generate our largest sales production, Aflac U.S annualized premium sales had a disappointing 10.4% decrease. This results contributed significantly to our full year sales decline of 4.3%.","In recent quarters we\u2019ve acknowledged the impact of healthcare reform, especially to the accounts less than a 100, most notably accompanying confusion and problems associated with the federal exchange. We believe this kind of reoccurring uncertainty is linked in the sales process as small businesses, especially are more hesitant to engage in changes to healthcare reform. They want to gain greater access and -- regarding the implementation of affordable healthcare act and how it\u2019s going to affect them. Saying that, a sales decrease of 10% in a quarter is unacceptable to us. The one constant has been and continues to be the need for our products.","There is no plan, not even the best major medical plan that is designed to cover all out-of-pocket expenses. We will continue to drive home the need for our products to businesses and ultimately their employees. You\u2019ve heard us say many times in the past that part of our job is to gain access to employers to ensure our products are conveniently available to consumers.","I'll remind you that about 98% of our products are sold for the work site and more than 90% of those sales come through smaller employers with a 100 employees or less. As such, we\u2019re working on several key initiatives in 2014 that support our multi-faceted distribution network in reaching out to business of all sizes.","With respect to our career agents, first we\u2019re focusing on recruiting and training. Second, we're concentrating on performance management for the territory directors and sales coordinators. Third, we\u2019re in the process of piloting Aflac\u2019s proprietary exchange which is geared to employers of 100 employees or less, but those of 50 or less are our primary target. Fourth, we\u2019re incentivising the management of our career sales agents to focus on smaller businesses, while working with brokers to write larger businesses and to that end in October we\u2019re putting a strategic and tactical focus on businesses with less than a 100 employees by aligning our recruiting, training, compensation and market incentives to encourage specific activity and sales in that segment.","Additionally, we\u2019re continuing to focus with brokers on a regional and national level to give us better access to mid and large markets. We have already represent more than 60 benefit administration platforms, sometimes referred to as exchanges with various brokers. I believe 2014 will be a good year for broker sales as we continue to push to segment our distribution.","Finally, we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our strong brand and relevant product portfolio in an evolving healthcare environment. While some facets of the U.S economy has shown signs of improvement, we continue to see a challenging economic environment in the U.S. Many small employers are still very guarded with respect to their business outlook including their hiring plans. This can impact the universe of potential policy holders we\u2019ve access to.","Taking into account all the strategic initiatives, design to empower our sales force in 2014 along with the challenge in economic environment, we expect the Aflac U.S sales in 2014 to be flat to up 5%. When we look back over our investment performance in 2013, our decision to enhance and protect our SMR by allocating more new money to JGBs suppressed our new money yields. But despite taking a more conservative investment path last year, our average new money yields of 2.47% in 2013 was still slightly higher than 2012 results.","As we enter 2014, we\u2019re reviewing our asset allocation strategy related to Japan new money investments. Based on current capital position and market outlook we\u2019ve resumed purchasing U.S dollar securities for Aflac Japan\u2019s portfolio within ranges consistent with our asset and strategic allocation plans and product needs. We will continue to evaluate the allocation strategy based on investment market dynamics and capital and make tactical changes consistent with our outlook.","Turning to Aflac Incorporated, our consolidated financial performance was strong for the quarter. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, operating earnings per diluted share rose 6.8% for the quarter and 5.2% for the year. This result puts us slightly ahead of our annual expectation of a 5% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency.","While policyholders are top of mind, we also strive to enhance shareholder value through repurchasing our shares and increasing the cash dividend. We believe these are important \u2013 the most attractive uses of capital and those are the avenues we will continue to pursue.","For the full year, we purchased $800 million of shares which greatly exceeds our original target we set at the beginning of the year of $400 million to $600 million. As we said in the third quarter, we expect share repurchase in 2014 to increase over 2013 levels to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. Our advice for 2014 is to frontload our purchases as such we expect to purchase $400 million to $500 million of our shares in the first quarter.","I'm also pleased that we increased our cash dividend to shareholders last year. 2013 marked our 31st consecutive year in which we've increased the dividend to shareholders. Our objective is to grow the cash dividend at a rate generally in line with our operating earnings before the impact of the yen.","Finally, taking into account the headwinds and tailwinds we've covered, I want to reiterate our primary financial objective in 2014 which is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 2% to 5% on a currency neutral basis. We continue to believe that we are well positioned in the two best insurance markets in the world. We're fortunate that we have the privilege of providing financial protection for more than 50 million people worldwide who count on us to be there when they need us most.","Now, I'll turn the program over to Robin. Robin?","Robin Wilkey","Thank you, Dan. I'd like to get through some fourth quarter and annual numbers this morning especially as related to the yen impact which was strong, and I'll start first with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the currency impact for the quarter and the year, during the quarter, the yen weakened against the dollar 19.5% and for the year, the yen weakened 18.2%.","In reference to top line in yen terms, revenues as reported were up 4.1% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of currency, revenues were up 2.6%. Investment income as reported increased 15.7%. Excluding the weaker yen in the quarter, Aflac Japan dollar denominator and investment income, net income rose 5.5%.","In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to total revenues declined over last year going from 63.9 to 61.2 in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact from the reinsurance agreement initiated in the third quarter, the benefit ratio for the quarter would have been 60.8%. Additionally, if you exclude the impact of the weaker yen, the benefit ratio for the quarter would be 62.1%.","Now looking at the expense ratio, it was up 18.9%, up from 18.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012. This increase reflected additional spending in line with our expectations. Reflecting the improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax margin increased during the quarter going from 17.7% to 19.9%. Excluding the impact on currency, the pretax profit margin for the quarter increased 18.8%.","With the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 16.9% in yen terms. Excluding the impact of the yen, pretax earnings in the quarter increased 9.3%. The reinsurance agreement from the third quarter had approximately an $8.2 million pretax income on earnings and a $5.4 million impact on an after-tax basis.","Now let me turn to Aflac U.S., total revenues rose 1.4% for the quarter. Persistency for the year was 76.8% compared to 77.1% a year ago. Looking at the operating ratios, the benefit ratio for the quarter was 52.7% compared to 50.8%. This reflected various reserve adjustments made in the fourth quarter.","The operating expense ratio improved going from 34.6% to 33.1% reflecting less than anticipated spending in the quarter. The profit margin was 14.2% compared to 14.6% a year-ago. Reflecting the increase in the benefit ratio in the quarter, pretax operating earnings decreased 1.3%.","Now turning to investment activities for the quarter, let me first start with Aflac Japan. Approximately 94% of new cash flow was invested in JGBs for an average yield of 1.37%. As a result, the total new money yield in Japan for the quarter was 1.5% down 48 basis points from September 30 and down 121 basis points from a year ago. Portfolio yield was 2.8% at the end of December, down 18 basis points from the end of September and 7 basis points lower than a year ago.","In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 4.32%, a decline of 19 basis points from September 30. The yield on the portfolio at the end of December was 6.01%, down 5 basis points from September 30.","Turning to a few other items in the quarter, non-insurance interest expense was 51 million compared with 50 million a year ago. Parent company and other expenses was 17 million compared to 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. On an operating basis, the tax rate was 34.4% compared to 34.1% a year ago.","As reported, operating earnings per diluted share declined 5.4% to $1.40. The significantly weaker yen decreased operating earnings by $0.18 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the impact of the yen, operating earnings per share for the quarter would have increased 6.8%.","Lastly, let me comment and reiterate some of the statements that Dan's already made. We have reaffirmed our objective for 2014 in the 2% to 5% increase in operating earnings per diluted share excluding the impact of the yen. This year, we estimate that 1 yen move on the average annual exchange rate will equal approximately $0.03 to $0.0325 per diluted share.","Assuming the yen dollar exchange rate remains at the 2013 full year average rate of 97.54, we would then expect 2014 objective of a 2% to 5% growth to be in the range of $6.31 per diluted share to $6.49 per diluted share.","Now we're ready to take your questions, but first let me remind you to be fair to everyone, limit yourself to one initial question and only one follow-up question that relates to your initial question. Now, we're ready to take the first call. Do we have a caller on the line?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","First question just around the outlook for third sector sales in Japan and I guess I'm wondering why the target isn't higher given the momentum you've seen with the medical product, and how underpenetrated that younger age cohort is? And then really no benefit at all to-date from cancer and my understanding is you should the post specific product kind of on-boarded here in the second half of the year?","Paul Amos","This is Paul. I'll tell you, first of all, we do expect strong momentum in the first quarter and the second quarter and that will be a continuity coming from the EVER launch in the second half of last year that drove extremely strong third and fourth quarter third sector sales. It's because of that strong third and fourth quarter that we\u2019re up against difficult comparisons of course, medical product is going to sell in a higher level than the cancer plan in general, as well as the market is growing at a faster pace. That being said, we remain confident about our Japan Post partnership and are continuing ability to grow that. As we said, it is a long partnership that is focused on growing it steadily. We have continued to expand the number of post offices, but doing so slowly and it really been a later half of the year before we see a significant number of post offices begin to come online.","As you stated, the cancer plan is something we are focused on revising at this point pending approval from the government and focused on selling that plan with a specific plan for the Japan Post system. At this point, however, we\u2019re still in the process of developing that plan with Japan Post. I can\u2019t go over the specifics of that, but we feel very optimistic about it. That being -- all of that being said, all of that is modeled in the 2% to 7%. And we\u2019re -- I think that's where we\u2019re and I think we\u2019re confident about the numbers and what we're going to see for this coming year.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Okay and then maybe one for Eric. Can you talk about the decision kind of to get back into the U.S securities asset class and then how we should be thinking about with rates kind of back down here managing the volatility of the SMR when rates should rise again, since this -- clearly isn\u2019t eligible for that PRM category?","Eric Kirsch","Sure. My pleasure. Well, going back in the last couple of quarters when the volatility hit last year and we change the asset allocation, you will recollect I had said that we were going to spend significant time on recalibrating our SMR given the reinsurance, how the capital position went up to the risk factors we\u2019re exposed to, in particular, in the AFS category. And those risk factors being yen interest rate, dollar interest rate, currency and credit spread. So a great body of work has been completed on that, which was our goal during the fourth quarter, so that we could go into the year with a much clear path. And given the higher capital levels that we\u2019ve and all of our modeling, we can sustain if rate should increase that negative impact to SMR, of credit spread should rise, yen yield should rise. So we could still be within the SMR levels that management wants us to be in. So SMR is now at a comfortable level where when those things happen in the market, we can absorb an SMR, that those impacts from unrealized gains and losses.","The other thing I would comment on as well, there is a correlation effect between these factors. So when U.S rates are going up suggesting a strong economic growth here, the dollar is strengthening, the yen is weakening. But we\u2019ve currency exposure in our SMR. So those are risk factors that kind of offset each other. So with all of that modeling and our view of that capital market, that allowed us to go into the year with a view that we can get back on our path of the original strategic asset allocation from Goldman. However, we\u2019re going to be much more tactical on how we implement that.","So the second part of your question is as we\u2019re looking at the year, a few things with respect to our U.S allocation that are based on today's outlook and the capital position. One, we\u2019ve turned on the program. Secondly, we\u2019re not going to think of it just as corporate bonds. It\u2019s a bucket of U.S assets and we will use our discretion within my investment group to swap, if you will, between maybe U.S treasury securities and corporate securities based on typical relative value analysis.","So as an example as you all know in the corporate world, the fundamentals are very rich. On corporate they\u2019re very healthy, but credit spreads are at their tightest, almost at all-time lows. So we\u2019re not expecting a lot of tightening. We're also not expecting this year given our economic outlook for the U.S., the credit spreads are going to (indiscernible) a lot. But I don't really want to overweigh the corporate allocation when corporate spreads are so tight, but I like the yield differential between U.S rates and Japan rates.","So within that U.S bucket throughout the year, we will use our discretion from a relative value standpoint on how to allocate within the U.S bucket. And the other thing I should mention as well, the U.S program last year was targeting more or less at 10-year duration. We\u2019re targeting a lower duration now in light of the fact that our view is throughout the year, rates will rise and certainly in January we saw rates come down quite a lot because of the volatility in the emerging markets. But by putting any new money into a shorter duration bucket of U.S assets, we\u2019re in essence building up protection for the event that rates rise, so our unrealized losses won\u2019t be as great. But over the long-term from an economic perspective, we\u2019re very bullish that these are very positive to the long-term health of our balance sheet and our earnings stream.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks for the thoughts.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Hi, everybody. Dan, I think you briefly mentioned progress on the Everwell platform and on to broker exchanges in the U.S. I was wondering A, if you could give us a little more color on the Everwell progress? I think on the last call you talked about it has been 68. So where does that stand today? And then on the broker exchanges, I think you had mentioned being on 60 today, which seems significantly greater than where you were a quarter ago. So if you can give us any thoughts on both?","Dan Amos","Let me make a couple of statements and then I will have Ken talk a little bit more detail as we\u2019re all working together to do this. The one thing I think is important that all of you understand is we introduced a major change with our field force. As you know we\u2019re probably the only Company out there that is concentrated so heavily on accounts of 100 or less. It\u2019s always been our bread and butter; it\u2019s always worked very well for us. Our agents have also rolled the accounts of 100 or more. But what we\u2019ve seen here as we\u2019ve seen those accounts of a 100 or more shift more to dealing with brokers. So as we started several years ago, we started seeing the brokers coming in and we started to put them in our market to some degree.","But what we did in October is we made a conscientious decision to introduce to our whole management team that we were going to pay for performance by trying to get our agents to concentrate more on the accounts of 100 or less. Well, 90% was already there. So it wasn\u2019t that big, but psychologically tell them that we really wanted them to concentrate there and not doing the 100 or more. The old timers don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s why new recruits are so much better because they understand that\u2019s the way it will be done.","Now we\u2019re not saying you can\u2019t do it, we\u2019re just paying to move you that way. We\u2019re then working with the agents to where these agents will work with brokers to try to enroll what I would call the local brokers more and they end through our plans with Aflac group, we\u2019re doing the national brokers. So this is a major shift that all occurred in the fourth quarter. And at the same time we\u2019re now getting ready as you talked about to move to Everwell with the small businesses, which especially will be 50 and less. And of course we got the delay with the Obamacare that now it won\u2019t go into effect till next year. So all those things kind of hit at the same time, which I think accounted for part being our problem, part being that we arrive more small business, but all in all, unacceptable numbers in my case. So I will let Ken talk a little bit about specifically your Everwell and what we're doing there and then if Teresa wants to follow-up with any comments she is welcome to. Ken.","Ken Janke","Yes. Let me start on the Everwell exchange. We\u2019re right in the middle of the pilot. We had orchestrated an extended pilot from October 1st through the end of March of this year. It's actually in three states, one of which we\u2019ve our appointed agents in that area have access to not only our products, but major medical as well as vision, dental and life and then the other two test states right now. They\u2019re limited to all the products -- they\u2019ve all the products, but not a major medical, because it is such a sweeping change in how we maybe enrolling the small businesses in the future, we wanted to take a very pragmatic and conservative approach to this. So we\u2019ll evaluate after we finish the pilot in March. We\u2019ll evaluate our rollout plans.","We currently anticipate that we\u2019ll be rolling the platform out to the majority of our states throughout the balance of this year, but the exact timing of that rollout is going to be dictated by our assessment of the pilot and we're not quite done or in a position to make that assessment. I can say that generally we're pleased with what we've seen so far. We have seen higher penetration rates than we've seen in our traditional business for accounts of the same size which was one of the success metrics that we're focused on. Over the longer term, we'll focus on things retention of accounts as well as distributors. But we do expect that it will go well and that we will be a position to rollout. That said, we don't expect for it to have much of an impact on sales in 2014. But if our rollout plans meet expectations and we're able to roll it out as we currently anticipate, we should start to see an impact in '15 and beyond.","With respect to the benefit administration or exchange platforms that you referenced, we've actually had those in place for some time now but they're basically, I'd call it one-off arrangements with distributors and accounts and their overall impact to sales last year was not really material. But in thinking through our exchange strategy for the larger case market, that's something that you'll largely see come out of the core broker and then our large national broker efforts through Aflac Group in Columbia, South Carolina. The first step of which and our major focus right now is to build out distribution in Aflac Group.","We're in the process of expanding the number of employed sales people that we have that will bring relationships to us with brokers or establish relationships with brokers so that they can convince those national brokers on the case for voluntary products and more specifically that we should be the provider of choice for those voluntary products. And then we'd look at the most efficient way to enroll those clients and that would likely be through an electronic platform, like an exchange. But the first step right now we're really focused on building out the sales capacity at Aflac Group so that we are in a better position to reach the brokers and then get on those exchanges.","Dan Amos","And Ken is concentrating of course on combining the two both Aflac Group and Aflac Columbus, but Teresa maybe want to make a couple of comments on Columbus because that's still 90% of our sales. And so Teresa, you have any comment.","Teresa White","I'll just echo what Ken said with regard to Everwell. Currently, we have a couple of other platforms that we use today; our SmartApp unit that you all are familiar with. The majority of our activity is basically driving the multi distribution strategy, handing the sales operating guidelines, making sure that we have all of the alignment with compensation and sales targets so that we can migrate everybody to this new Everwell exchange.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","It does. And one quick follow-up on that, if I could. On the national exchanges, with the national brokers, do you think that the investments you're now making in sales and in the platform will be ready to bear some fruit for 2015 enrollment; come in, in October, November of this year?","Dan Amos","Well, we're really positioning this for better growth out of the large case markets for group products in '15. This is really a build-out year of sorts. Again, we're increasing our ability to reach those broker distributors. As you know, there's a very long lead time to large cases, so we're really positioning this for \u2013 while we would hope expect there'd be much growth in the group platform in 2015.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Mr. Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Thank you. Good morning. On the U.S. business maybe if you could talk about just recruiting and growth in the producing agent count because it's been weak for a while and I'm not sure if that's just lack of finding good candidates or are people not willing to give up unemployment insurance or what's going on that you're having a difficult time finding recruits in the U.S.? And then there was a question earlier on \u2013 new money investments in Japan. I don't know if you mentioned how much of your new money you're intending to deploy in the U.S. securities, whether it's corporate or treasuries?","Ken Janke","Jimmy, let me start on the recruiting. We are really focused as Dan suggested in his comments. We're focused on a few very basic activities for our traditional sales force this year. We really want them to focus the majority of their efforts under 100 accounts size. We're also focusing on what we referred to as core brokers, it's really the local and regional brokers that Dan has mentioned, we're focused on asset management which is a fancy way of saying we want our career sales force to make sure they're getting the most out of their book of business, so that in effect they're not leaving business on the table by really calling on their accounts and managing their business properly. And then the other one is recruiting.","Recruiting has always been a core component of how we build our sales force. Newer agents tend to be the ones that bring us the newer accounts where we have opportunities to really grow the business. I think one of the things that we've not only focused the activities squarely on recruiting but also on the type of individuals we'd like our sales force to recruit, because I do believe that there was some effort on our sales force that rather than recruiting the career agent that we typically built this business on, there were trying to recruit brokers instead. So we've really refocused their activities this year. On referral recruiting, nominations and getting the type of sales associates that have long been known to build this business. We have seen a bit of a turn.","I think it's too early to comment with certainty but so far this year with that new focus, we're pleased on the kind of recruiting activity that we've seen. It's still down year-over-year but at a significantly lower rate of decline than what we'd seen throughout 2013. So we are focused on that. By focusing on that and also the training and getting those new agents to focus on the small business area, the accounts fewer than hundreds lives, we think we'll also be successful in pulling up the numbers of producing agents.","Robin Wilkey","I'll just follow-up with three areas of focus. One area of focus really trying to make sure that our people who are recruiting in our career channel that those folks don't compete with trying to recruit brokers as well, so we basically focused the career recruit channel on really recruiting people for that career channel and then we moved a lot of the market, the people who were recruiting for brokers into a core broker channel which really supports the distribution channel or the channel segmentation and it also supports how the market has shifted as well. The other thing that we're doing is recruiting ads and you'll see some of those recruiting ads, there were very successful in the past for us with really getting interest for Aflac and with regard to recruiting. And so we decided to bring those back. The last thing is making sure that all of our goals for recruiting are aligned within the hierarchy. So any contest, any compensation is aligned across the hierarchy with regard to recruiting as opposed to one or two people holding the goal for recruiting. The comp is tied to it.","Eric Kirsch","It's Eric to answer the second part of your question around the percentage allocation of new money. Just a couple of factors that go into that allocation. One is, when we discussed new money what we're discussing is cash flow from operations and maturities and interest from existing assets. But we also consider sort of the target balance of our asset classes at year end which ties back to the strategic asset allocation work. So, with regards to U.S. assets if you will as a target not necessarily meaning we're going to get there, 25% of the Japan assets would be our target for U.S. assets at the end of the year. When we calibrate what I discussed earlier, the new money statistics that we expect, SMR, we would currently expect no less than about 40% of our cash flows to be in U.S. dollars but again that would depend on market factors, SMR. And one other factor is during the year, which has already happened this year we may dispose of some securities like you know about Israel Electric, for instance. Those proceeds came in January, were invested into the U.S. program but that's not counted as new money but it would count towards our year-end target. So there's a variety of factors that go into that. And then finally I would remind you, I can give you some of these estimates, but as I said earlier, we will be more dynamic with respect to the risk factors in the market, what's happening with spreads, what's happening with rates. So, I think you\u2019ll see us be more opportunistic as well as conservative from a safety standpoint depending on what's happening in the market, but certainly we\u2019ll report throughout the year on how it all panned out relative to our expectation.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","And the U.S. investments, those don\u2019t qualify for policy reserves matching accounting treatment rate?","Eric Kirsch","That\u2019s correct. Those go into AFS.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Good. Thank you.","Kriss Cloninger","Let me point out that on a U.S. statutory basis the assets are held at amortized cost as opposed to mark-to-market, so it's not a big factor in RBC.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","It's more the SMR\u2019s would have changed though, right?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes, the SMR for Japan is sensitive to fair value.","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Got you. Thank you.","Kriss Cloninger","All AFS securities, but in the U.S. we\u2019re not on RBC for the U.S. operations.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from John Nadel of Sterne Agee. Sir, your line is open.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Hi, good morning everybody. Just a quick follow up on the investment side. I don\u2019t remember the exact amount out of Japan in terms of the new money investments in total from 2013. If memory serves it was effectively an all time record given the very strong sales in the first sector channel. How much is that overall new money investment going to decline in 2014 given the continued shrinkage of the first sector, the fact that third sector sales clearly require less from the perspective of investment income?","Eric Kirsch","It's Eric. I can give you the numbers from last year and the projections this year in total cash flows and then perhaps one of my colleagues wants to discuss at that second level between sales. But to your comment earlier, last years cash flows were 1,118,000,000,000 yen, but that\u2019s cash flow from operations, maturities and interests from the portfolio. So, there\u2019s a lot of attribution within it. For this year again in total the projections are 771 billion yen.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Got it, okay. And then, I think the only other real question I have is, as you\u2019ve done all this work around SMR sensitivity in calibrating especially post the shift to the PRM classification; can you give us some sense for how much the sensitivity of the SMR has come down especially relative to changes in interest rates?","Kriss Cloninger","This is Kriss; let me say that we have done a lot of work on that, we intent to go into that in some depth at the FAB meeting. I didn\u2019t want to do it on this call. But let me just say that with our SMR at its current level in the mid 700\u2019s, we believe that we\u2019re well protected against the fall below the 500% to 600% which is kind of our overall low level operating objective. The way I am looking at SMR right now is that we don\u2019t want to broach our fallback position which I\u2019ll say is 500% to 600%. We clear like about staying at about 750% in today's market environment.","There are very few scenarios where we\u2019re going to pierce below 500% to 600% for changes in U.S. interest rates, changes in Japan interest rates, changes in currency rates. So, what we\u2019ve done is to insulate ourselves against the low side of the SMR exposure due to volatility in those macro factors. And we believe that enhances our ability to give the investment team flexibility to pursue their plans without significant concern and it just gives us more assurance that we\u2019ll be able to manage SMR levels in a way that will allow us to achieve our plans for profit repatriation, policy holder security and the like. So, we feel like the work we did between the third quarter and fourth quarter last year has well positioned us to manage in a very flexible way in response to significant changes in macro conditions.","Eric Kirsch","I mean one our main objectives here is to never act like we had to do one time on share repurchase, to constantly be increasing it every year. And by having this bottom set we feel comfortable that we can continue to increase it unless something just unheard of happens.","Ken Janke","Hey, John this is Ken. Let me just add, if you just look at the SMR sensitivity to yen interest rates, our -- as Kriss said we will talk more about it in our analyst meeting. It is significantly less than it would have been a year-ago for a couple of reasons. Number one is implementing the PRM category which insulated us from some yen rate risk. The other is that, now we\u2019ve more dollar assets [proportionately] [ph]. So what does that mean, while as we\u2019ve got more exposure to dollar rate risk? So and we\u2019ve taken some actions to try and mitigate that risk on SMR as well. When you think of the market risks that influence SMR we\u2019re exposed to yen rate risk, dollar rate risk, credit spread risk and currency risk. And the problem is those are somewhat correlated. You can\u2019t just aggregate one risk on top of the other to come up with an overall sensitivity and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing a little more work on it to give you a better indication of what kind of buffer we feel we should be maintaining to accommodate those risks.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Perfect, that\u2019s really helpful. If I can sneak one last one in because it's related, it's just -- have you done any incremental hedging particularly around yen versus dollar as you look out to 2014 and beyond to insulate your expected profit repatriation from potential currency moves?","Ken Janke","Yes, let me update you on that. Our current expectation is to repatriate about 97 billion yen. The last time we spoke we had hedged 47.5 billion yen at a little over 100 yen to the dollar. We have added incrementally another 5 billion yen. So we have roughly 52.5 billion yen hedged again a little over 100 yen to the dollar. We\u2019ve elected to take -- use our yen cash flow from repatriation this year to service the 34.2 billion yen debt that we have maturing. And so what that does is that frees up about $400 million that we had on the balance sheet that we had previously year marked for share repurchase. So, when you look at the 52.5 billion yen plus the 34.2 you\u2019re roughly 10 billion yen or so that it remains un-hedged. And I think it's unlikely that we\u2019ll do much more for this year but we have already started thinking about \u201815 and taking actions to insulate against currency risk on that repatriation.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Perfect. Thank you so much for everything.","Ken Janke","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James. Sir, your line is now open.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Thank you. Good morning everybody. I guess this all ties in, but I do want to ask about what is going on, or what can possibly be done in reinsurance. I know, I mean you kind of started it in -- I think it was May at the FAB meeting, Kriss stated that he thought that the FSA was really against doing enforced block types of transactions to free of capital. But you\u2019re sitting there with an SMR of 750, you\u2019ve got PRM and you\u2019re doing some interest rate hedging. There\u2019s a lot of protection there. The reserves are way, way overstated in Japan relative to the U.S. which is probably overstated relative to reality anyway. You\u2019ve got one competitor that\u2019s done -- an American competitor that announced that they did a deal. RGA is saying that they\u2019re seeing a lot of companies do this. I\u2019m wondering Kriss, if you thought more about this or looked at this more?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes, we\u2019re continuing to evaluate Steven. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with all your comments you leashed, maybe I do but maybe not in order of magnitude. But let me just say that the -- the reinsurance we did at the end of September allowed us to achieve our objective of increasing the solvency margin substantially. We don\u2019t feel like we need to do additional reinsurance to accomplish that. Right now we've got it in reserve in case we ever need to do it. What I do have my team exploring is the notion of doing a continuous program of reinsurance of this nature to alleviate to some extent the surplus drain we experienced relative to new business.","And what I think that would do \u2013 what it will do is to minimize the volatility of FSA earnings in responses to changes in production levels. And it would also allow us to monetize to some extent some of the differences between the economic reserves which is how I'd characterize what you're trying to get to and regulatory reserves. Keep in mind though that reinsurance of the nature we did, those have a cost. You are selling a block of business in exchange for a premium and it does have a cost and I've quantified the cost for reinsurance in 2014 at about a nickel a share, about $30 million or so after tax. So it's not like it's free.","Now let me say that relative to other companies, we don't have an internal reinsurance subsidiary where we can do this program on an intra-company basis. We've never been a reinsurance user to any great extent, we haven't needed to, we don't have a reinsurance subsidiary that deals on an arm's length basis with other companies which many companies do. So that's kind of negative for us. That being said, we do recognize the possibility that we could establish captive reinsurer and that's one thing that we're going to look at. That's not a short-term thing, something that's easily achievable in three months but it could be a cost effective or cost efficient way to do some reinsurance and we're going to investigate that further.","So let me just say we intend to evaluate the use of reinsurance. We can do more. We're going to use it to, again, protect \u2013 probably repay for any addition and the like and there will be more to come on that. But we're not just ignoring it, Steven. We're going to be using it effectively.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","All right, great. And then as follow-up to \u2013 on the very, very large cases, I want to try to get a handle on what's changed here in the U.S. with the exchanges you see around the platforms but you've been on the platforms for a while. I mean my understanding has been at least for a year, maybe two years, all the big alphabet houses you've been with them, but the issue seems to have been then getting their people to use you. Is this really just the same situation, they may be selling it in a different way but it's still the issue of getting the rep at Aon or Marsh & Mc [ph] to use you, is that still the issue?","Teresa White","This is Teresa White. Really the issue is making sure that we build out, as Ken said that W-2 sales force that Dan Lebish is responsible for. We're building out because most of these large broker channels which you may know, they really go to market differently and it's not a product sale, it's really understanding how they go to market. And so the importance of those relationships is to really understand how each broker channel deals with the market and then how Aflac fits within the context of that. And so the initial relationship or the initial interaction is more us understanding, Aflac understanding their go-to-market strategy, understanding and educating many of the brokers on voluntary product and then there's a process of selling.","What Ken referred to a while ago was a lot of the plumbing that was built for the six-year or so exchanges our platforms that we have today, there were specific cases that wanted Aflac. They asked for Aflac and they happened to have brokers involved. Now that's some of it but others are really where brokers have brought us in and utilized us against other competitors. So, right now that's why Ken is saying right now what we've got to do is establish that \u2013 work that sales force at Aflac Group so that we can ensure that \u2013 and we call those sales people BDEs, broker development executives, and they'll be regional vice presidents managing that process. But at the end of the day, the relationship is what's important and Aflac understanding their go-to-market strategy and how Aflac product fits.","Dan Amos","The one thing I would say that's very important here is it was somewhat murky in our organization of how brokers and agents and the new things we're all bidding together. Now, what we did in October is we defined exactly the direction we wanted everyone to go. And we cut out certain things like for example these big brokers. They don't want our agents calling directly on them. That irritates them and they control the account and we've defined that better to stop that from happening. So these are things that are major in terms of how we handle it in terms of emotional and trying to motivate our existing field force and we've done that through more commissions and shifting them. And so all of this is just part of something that's unfolding right now that I'll ultimately think will enhance our sales.","I think we're going to be much stronger. I think anyone that thinks that we're not going to be strong in the small market is mistaken because we've done so well. I think anyone things that with the big brand we've got, which everyone knows us in the supplemental industry in the United States will be mistaken when it comes to how well we're going to do with the brokers going forward. We just got to let them know that we understand their needs and we're going to fit products accordingly and that's where South Carolina will come into play with our new president over there, our new executive vice president over there and how he handles it. And Ken will be coordinating those two efforts.","Ken Janke","Steven, I\u2019d actually argue. I think the exchange part is the easy part because that's enrolling the business. The hard part what we have to work on is we have to have the relationships, we have to demonstrate to those large national brokers the value proposition for supplemental products, again why we should be the provider of choice and how we can effectively enroll that business and service that business and get them paid quickly, to have a pain-free experience. So, the enrollment itself through an exchange I don't see that daunting. It's everything that's leading up to the enrollment that we really are working on.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. All right, thank you guys.","Robin Wilkey","Steven, one other thing I want to comment on since we're talking about this new distribution strategy as Dan referred to it, we're going to do a spreadsheet and try to outline the various aspects of this. It will be available online just like we have other spreadsheets out there on investments and the such to help you better understand the market segments, the channels, the products within those channels that they'll be offering, enrolling conditions, et cetera. So that should be available on the website sometime this afternoon, we'll have that up there and I think it will help everyone understand better this new strategy in the U.S.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","All right, I'll take a look. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Mr. Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Thanks. Kriss, I wanted to come back to the comments you were making about exploring captive re and I think the comments you used were to potentially stabilize J-GAP earnings and then dividend repatriation. Should we be thinking about this whole evaluation more as making sure you have stability or would there be a significant enhancement opportunity? For instance, the 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion or J-GAP earnings that you guys are run rating right now. I mean, if there is the possibility from this kind of transaction that you could increase that 50%, if you structured it the right way or is that not the right way to think about this. Is this more of a stability exercise than an enhancement exercise?","Ken Janke","No there\u2019s an opportunity for enhancement, Tom. I think you have to be measured in thinking about how much enhancement we\u2019re going to have to balance cost and the overall results, and we always manage the business for the long-term as opposed to the sort term. So, I\u2019m not looking for a quick pop on profit repatriation and a quick pop on share repurchase. I\u2019m more interested in what we can sustain over the longer term. But there is an opportunity for enhancement and that\u2019s one of our objectives.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Got it. But we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about as you said \u2026","Ken Janke","(Indiscernible).","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Yes. Okay, got it. So more of a measured enhancement?","Ken Janke","Yes, if we got a 50% it wouldn\u2019t be achievable year-to-year. If we went up 50% it would probably have to stay at that level, assuming we could even get there which it might be achievable, but I doubt that I\u2019m going to go that far.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Got it. And then, just a follow-up for Eric. Your comment that you were positioning into shorter duration, securities I guess. I think that was just related on the USD allocations, not sure if that also applies to what you\u2019re doing on the JGB side. My follow-up on that point though is, should we be thinking about this more a short-term tactical because ultimately you have to match your liability and you have very long duration liability. So if you\u2019re shortening the duration today, how long would you be willing to deal with tolerance of the mismatch?","Eric Kirsch","Sure. Now thank you, good questions, and to your first one, yes. That was with respect to the U.S. securities not our JGBs which are long -- the JGBs are longer in duration and more closely matched to the liabilities. The second part of your question, yes. This is more tactical and keep in mind that shorter duration is for the new money to the existing portfolio which is quite large particularly when you take the U.S. corporate program that we started as we called it, and what we used to call the Japan dollar portfolio. We\u2019re now thinking of that as one big bucket. So that big bucket, is it approximately a 10 year duration? And we\u2019re not changing the duration of that bucket, but the incremental new money is going in tactically the shorter duration which will bring the overall duration slightly down, but we certainly have to have that focus on ALM and matching assets and liabilities. So it is more tactical for this year at this point in time.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks.","Robin Wilkey","Well, we\u2019ve reached the top of the hour. If anybody has any follow-up calls, David and I will be in the office. So please give us a call. Otherwise we look forward to seeing everyone at our FAB meeting. The information is out there for you to register and thank you so much for joining us this morning.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to, Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Robin Wilkey","Good morning and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of U.S. Operations; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President, Global Chief Investment Officer; and Tohru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan who is joining us from Tokyo.","Before we start, let me remind you of some statements in this teleconference that are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who\u2019ll begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and our operations in Japan and the U.S. I will then follow up with a few financial highlights for the first quarter then we will be glad to take your questions. Dan?","Dan Amos","Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am very pleased that we met and in many cases exceeded our financial and operational targets for first quarter. Let me began with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. New annualized premium sales in the first quarter were up 2.6% to \u00a553.8 billion. Revenues grew 9.7% and pretax earnings were up 10.7% for the quarter. Sales for the first sector products including WAYS and (inaudible) came in better than expected in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by consumers who wanted to make insurance purchases of first sector products ahead of the rate increase on April 2.","I had said that I would not be surprised if we saw WAYS sales down 40% to 60% following the rate increase. Based on early sales indications for April, that seems like a reasonable estimate. Banks also had a strong sales push in order to end their fiscal year with solid sales results. Additionally, we have seen consumer show interest in a variety of investment type products, especially with JGB yields at historic low rates and the Nikkei having risen considerably over the past several months. As such, we expect the sales of our first sector products, particularly WAYS to be down significantly for the remainder of the year. ","With respect to total third sector products, combined cancer and medical insurance sales, were down 7.1% for the quarter which was in line with our expectations. However, remaining the leading provider of third sector products is important to us and is the foundation of our product portfolio. We anticipate focusing more on third sector product development now that the first sector rerating has been complete.","We mentioned last year that we are currently under penetrated in the consumers who are in their 20s to 40s. I\u2019m pleased to tell you that we\u2019re working on getting approval of a new medical product with the FSA. As such we anticipate very strong second half sales. Taking all these factors into account, I believe that 2013 expectation that Aflac Japan third sector cancer and medical will be flat to up 5% is still reasonable. ","Now let me turn to the U.S operations. As I mentioned last quarter, I wouldn\u2019t be if sales were down slightly in the first quarter, considering our biggest percentage increase last year came in the first quarter. Our results were consistent with that expectation. Aflac U.S new annualized premium sales were down 5.2% for the quarter. We know that small employers are still guarded with respect to their business outlook. In addition some employees have been reluctant to make changes in their benefits in advance of the healthcare reform implementation. ","In terms of relief of small businesses, if there is any recovery at all, it seems to be a jobless recovery. While there are several factors that we can\u2019t control, we are driven to improve the factors that we can influence. We continue to expand our marketing activities to maximize our future growth. With brand recognition at 94%, we continue to leverage our popularity to capture the attention of the consumers with the ultimate goal of driving sales. I hope you\u2019ve seen our new U.S commercials that portray the Aflac duck as a policy holder and claimant. They have been very popular.","We want to continue to educate consumers about our products, while at the same time entertaining them. Additionally, we evaluate and enhance our products to ensure that we are in step with the needs of the consumers, particularly in this economic landscape. We\u2019re also planning some aggressive new individual and group product launches. With a strong brand recognition and reputation for paying claims quickly and fairly, we believe consumers will be more receptive to purchasing our products.","As you know, a lot of changes are taking place in the U.S healthcare environment and we expect these changes to impact how people choose to purchase insurance going forward. We are spending a great deal of time ensuring that we\u2019re prepared to approach this change from a position of strength. Our job is to be multi-faceted in our distribution to make sure we have the presence where the consumer wants to purchase the products. There are different distribution possibilities we\u2019re working on from creating a private exchange to expanding our reach through insurance brokers to empowering our individual agents. ","One thing we know from nearly four decades in Japan is that even with national healthcare system, consumers have significant out of pocket expenses and our products continue to be relevant in their needs. Although there will be more competition, we believe the national healthcare system in the U.S actually presents Aflac with opportunities as consumers become more aware of financial protection Aflac products help provide. As I mentioned, first quarter sales comparisons are the most challenging of the year. We expect sales to be weighted more towards the latter half of the year. We believe it\u2019s reasonable to expect Aflac U.S sales through our traditional and broker channels to be flat to up 5% for the year. ","Having discussed our operations, let me give you an update on the investment function. We made excellent progress in the build out of our investment team and implementation of our investment strategy. I am pleased we did not have any major investment losses in the first quarter. While we still view Europe as an area of investment risk, I believe our portfolio is better positioned than ever to accommodate market volatility in the future. Also, we are optimistic in the future derisking of our portfolio including the sale of 25% of our Tunisian bondholders.","As we have stated for many years, our greatest investment challenge has been to invest Aflac's significant cash flow at reasonable investment yields. The U.S. corporate bond program initiated in July of last year continues to an effective means for enhancing Aflac Japan's new money yield. In addition to the attractive returns, we are pleased with the positive impact to our overall portfolio of quality and liquidity. For the past two quarters we have invested roughly two-thirds of our investment cash flows in U.S. denominated, publicly traded corporate bonds and then hedged the currency risk.","At March 31, this program represented 8.7% of our total portfolio which is well below our strategic asset allocation range. Additionally, as part of our investment strategy, we have said we would invest about one-third of our cash flow in JGBs. However, with 10-year JGB yields hitting historic lows, we want to be flexible in our asset allocation. We anticipate that the bank of Japan will keep interest rates low for the immediate future. Our investment team is carefully monitoring Japan's monetary and fiscal policy. As we have seen significant changes impacting financial markets including Japan interest rates and yen\/dollar exchange rates.","We are evaluating our investment options and looking for alternatives to lower our planned JGB new money investment allocation. We will consider diversification and liquidity as we approach these investment choices. As I mentioned that Aflac's consolidated financial performance was extremely strong for the quarter, excluding the impact from foreign currency, operating earnings per diluted share rose 5.7% for the quarter. I was also very pleased with the increasing strength of capital ratios which demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength and flexibility on behalf of our policy holders, shareholders and bondholders.","While we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements, we estimate our quarterly RBC ratio at March 31 was above our 2012 year-end ratio of 630%. We believe Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio in March 31 will also improve over the year-end 2012 level of 669%. As we have communicated, given the capital structure, our ability to repurchase share is largely tied to profit repatriation. In contemplating profit repatriation, our first consideration is the safety of the policyholders as measured by the SMR.","Next we consider the needs of the parent company and consult with Japan's management in making the determination. We currently expect 2013 profit repatriation to be a bit higher than the \u00a550 billion we communicated last quarter. This assumes we have no additional material investment losses between now and mid-June when we file Aflac Japan's FSA based financial statements. As we have said for many years, when it comes to deploying capital, we still believe that growing cash dividend and repurchasing our share, are the most attractive means and those are the avenues we will continue to pursue.","Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate that is in line with earnings per share growth before the impact of the yen. We have a lot of flexibility at the parent company in terms of liquidity. Given the liquidity and the strength of our capital ratios, we plan to purchase $400 million to $600 million of our shares in 2013. We are off to a great a start with our share repurchase plans for the year. In the first quarter we purchased approximately 3 million shares or about $150 million. I think this shows that we are even more comfortable with this rate. Additionally, we expect to accelerate our share repurchase in 2014.","Maintaining strong capital levels remains a priority for us. At the same time generating an industry leading return on equity, excluding the Yen impact is also extremely important to us and to our owners. Accordingly, the compensation committee of the Aflac\u2019s board of directors made a decision to include operating ROE as a component of the bonus structure for Aflac senior management effective this year. ","On an operating basis, our first quarter ROE was 23.4%. Keep in mind our ROE is sensitive to currency fluctuations because we have largely hedged equity into dollars, but not all of our earnings. This means when the Yen weakens our ROE declines. Had the Yen remained unchanged since the end of the year, our operating ROE would have been 26.1%. So even with the weaker Yen I think it\u2019s still reasonable to expect our operating ROE to range between 20% and 25% for 2013. ","In yesterday\u2019s release we reaffirmed our 2013 guidance of 4% to 7% increase in operating earnings per share, excluding the impact of currency. This range reflects the impact of investing significant cash flows at historically low interest rates. I would also remind you that our 2012 earnings were better than expected. Although the Yen is significantly weaker to the dollar, the fundamentals of our business and our operations are strong. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with Aflac\u2019s position in Japan and the United States, the two largest insurance markets in the world and first and foremost we are focused on protecting our policy holders and providing value to our investors. We\u2019re fortunate that in the process of doing so, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million worldwide.","Now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Robin.","Robin Wilkey","Thanks Dan. Let me go through some first quarter numbers starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with top line, revenues were up 9.7% for the quarter. Excluding the effect of the weaker Yen in the quarter, revenues were up 8.4%. The annualized persistency rate, excluding annuities in the quarter were strong at 95.0% compared with 94.5% last year. Net investment income increased 7.3%. Excluding the benefit of the weaker Yen in the quarter on Aflac Japan\u2019s dollar denominated investment income, net investment income rose 1.2%.","In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to total premiums increased over last year going from 71.5% a year ago to 72.4% in the first quarter, primarily caused by the growth of the net benefit reserves for our ordinary life line of products, most notably WAYS. ","The expense ratio for the quarter was 17.1%, down from 18.1% a year ago. The expense ratio was impacted primarily by lower net commissions associated with the sales of the life products lines. As a result of the lower expense ratios, the pretax profit margin rose slightly from 21.3% to 21.5% in the quarter. ","Turning to Aflac U.S., total revenues rose 3.9% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio to total premiums decreased over last year, going from 55.1% a year ago to 54% in the first quarter. This was generally in line with normal seasonality effects during the quarter. The annualized persistency rate for the first three months was strong but stable at 74.7%. No change from last year\u2019s results. ","The expense ratio for the quarter was up 32.5%, up from 31.4% a year ago and is in line with normal first quarter activity. The profit margin for the quarter was relatively unchanged at 19.5% compared to 19.6% a year ago.","Turning to some investment activity for the quarter, starting with Aflac Japan, approximately $1.8 billion of Aflac Japan\u2019s new cash flow was invested in the corporate bond program for growth yield of 3.72% and an annualized hedge cost of 30 basis points. The yield net of hedging cost was 3.42%. This brings the total cash flow invested in the corporate bond program to approximately $8.8 billion with a total yield on the corporate bond program of 3.41% excluding hedge costs. Approximately 30% of our new cash flow for the quarter was invested in JGBs with an average yield of 1.53%.","The new money yield for the quarter all in was 3.03%, an increase of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter and up 100 basis points from a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was up 3.01%, up 14 basis points from the fourth quarter and 17 basis points lower than a year ago. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 3.69%, an increase of 17 basis points from the fourth quarter. And the yield on portfolio at the end of March was 6.19%, down 16 basis points from the fourth quarter and 42 basis points from a year ago.","Turning to some other items in the quarter. Non-insurance interest expense was $48 million compared to 44 million a year ago. On an operating basis, the tax rate decreased from 34.7% a year ago to 34.4%. The weaker yen decreased the operating earnings by $0.15 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share increased 5.7% for the quarter. Operating ROEs reported for the quarter was 23.4%. Excluding the impact of the yen, operating ROE for the quarter was 26.1%.","As you heard Dan mention earlier, we plan to repatriate more than \u00a550 billion in 2013 in anticipation of our profit repatriation this year and considering the tough market conditions. We have entered into derivative contracts to hedge the majority of our profit repatriation this year against the potential further weakening of the yen. Also, it's part of a continual refinement in our pricing methodology for our investment portfolio, where we have a large number of privately issued securities, we have elected move from an internal modeling method for assessment and valuation of these securities to an outside vendor. As a result of this change in market conditions during the quarter, shareholders equity declined by approximately $582 million from December 31.","Lastly, let me comment on our earnings outlook for 2013 and our upcoming analyst meeting. You heard us affirm our objective to increase operating EPS 4% to 7% this year excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 95 to 100 for the full year, we would expect to report operating EPS of $5.99 to $6.37 per diluted share for the full year. For the second quarter, using the same currency assumptions, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.56 per diluted share.","Now let me take a few moments to remind you that our analyst meeting will be held in New York on May 22. We have given careful consideration and thought to our policy of providing earnings guidance at the analyst meeting. As we look at our disclosure practices, we have made a modification to the way we will discuss our earnings targets. We concluded that it is in the best interests of our company and our shareholders to provide earnings guidance in the third quarter for the following year, rather than projecting earnings a year and half out as we have previously done over the past several years.","We do not expect earnings growth to be materially different than what we see for 2013. We simply feel it is better for us to take the additional five months to gather more data that influences our business before we put out an estimate. This will also more closely align our financial modeling with our budgeting process. So at the analyst meeting next month, we won't comment on 2014 earnings expectations. However, we will discuss our operations in great detail and update you on opportunities to grow our business in 2014 and beyond. Please don\u2019t forget to register if you\u2019d like to attend and now we\u2019ll get back to this quarter and we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. To be fair to everybody, please remember to limit yourselves to one initial question and only one follow-up that closely relates to your initial question. We may begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I guess first question obviously with currency and the impact of the Yen moving all over the place. Have you guys given consideration to hedging the earnings of the company and just the thought process around that?","Ken Janke","Chris, this is Ken. Let me start with that. This has been an issue as long as we\u2019ve been in Japan as Japan has grown to be a larger portion of our business that obviously has affected the sensitivity of earnings to currency changes. But the one thing that I would remind you is that there is a distinct difference between foreign currency transactions and foreign currency translation. We are certainly interested as Robin indicated in hedging economic events like capital being remitted from Japan to the United States. But we don\u2019t think it makes sense to enter into an economic contract to hedge a financial reporting event. Largely Japan is a yen denominated entity that\u2019s self-funded. We collect premiums in Yen. We pay benefits and expenses in Yen. We back our Yen liabilities with Yen assets, but to the degree that this year\u2019s Yen rate differs from last year\u2019s influences how those Yen get reported in dollars. So again when we think about hedging, we\u2019re really focused on the economics of the business as opposed to financial reporting of the business.","Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then one question maybe for Paul. I guess the healthcare reform opportunity that you guys are pointing to a bit here doesn\u2019t take shape by the end of the year. That 0% to 5% sales growth target, where would that possibly shift to?","Paul Amos","Well, there have obviously been certain things that have been delayed within the healthcare reform package. There are questions about when the exchange implementation will occur, whether it will be in 2014 or 2015. Obviously being the proceeding fourth quarter open enrollment period to either of those dates that would have the largest effect. That said Chris, one of the things that we\u2019ve been highly focused on is work within the broker market continuing to have our field force work with brokers, continuing to succeed at the upper end of the broker market and growing that business. One of the reasons that we knew that we would see sales be weaker in the first half of the year was not just the comparisons, but it was also the continued work within that market where we expect to see more fourth quarter enrolments with or without healthcare reform. ","So my overall assessment at this point is that even given the current environment and the information that we are knowledgeable about today that we still believe we will be within that 0% to 5% growth target for  2013. That said, issues and things continue to arise and we cannot predict what those are going  to be. We watch HHS and other groups as well as what\u2019s happening at 50 different state governments on a daily and weekly basis about what they\u2019re doing to implement healthcare reform. Our sales force continues to be out focused on opening new groups and continuing to try to enroll in the marketplace. But as Dan said with a somewhat jobless recovery, there have been minor headwinds. So all of those different factors play into everything that we\u2019re trying to do while we\u2019re simultaneously also implementing our new training system which in effect had a downturn in our recruiting in Q1 which was planned by us. So in reality I think that we are headed towards 0% to 5%, but there are a lot of things that we\u2019re having to balance at this point.","Operator","Our next question does come from Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just one quick follow up on the hedging and then an earnings question. Ken, just to follow up on that question. So I think you\u2019ve hedged probably using three months currency type of hedge, because you mentioned that June repatriation amount has been hedged. Have you guys considered, especially given Dan's comments about accelerating buybacks in 2014, has there been consideration to hedging expected repatriation amount for next year as well or beyond.","Dan Amos","Yes, we have. Again, we have entered into a series of contracts. Our anticipated profit transfer for 2013 will really be towards the later part of July, right around the time we released second quarter earnings. We should be able to give you a better idea of what that number is in a few weeks when we conduct the analyst meeting. But again, we have undertaken a series of transactions to hedge a significant portion of this year's anticipated repatriation. And we are looking at what is available to our disposal and what makes economic sense for us for '14. And we are fine tuning those estimates and we would hope to give you a range of estimates at the analyst meeting about what repatriation in '14 would look like as well.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Dan, just a question about the decision to push out 2014 earnings guidance. Should we be reading into that partly driven by the uncertainty with a very large decline in WAYS sales? I guess my main question is, does the change in what you expect in WAYS, do you think that\u2019s going to have a potential impact on what I think you have been saying previously leading up to this point. You would expect a slow steady earnings growth recovery trajectory over the next several years.","Dan Amos","Okay. Kriss just poked me and he said he wants to answer, but let me say one thing. One of the reasons that I want to do it next year is because I don\u2019t think it's going to be significant. You know I want to do something in a year when it's uneventful. And I think what we have given you guidance for hasn\u2019t changed that dramatically.","Kriss Cloninger","Yeah, Tom, let me just follow up on that. It's not that we are not going to give you guidance. We are going to give you guidance relative to the key components of the model you guys independently develop to estimate our EPS. That is, we are going to give you long-term outlooks, two to three year outlooks for Japan ratios, Japan margins, U.S. ratios, U.S. margins. And that will give you a good basis for populating your models for the operating results. What we are trying to avoid is some of the noise. The favorable or unfavorable tax settlements that might impact the change in EPS and things like that, that we have a \u00a0hard time seeing 18 to 20 months in advance.","So partly, we have been talking about this for several years on the advice of SEC Counsel and what you do in terms of going on the line for long-term projections. And so what we have decided is to focus more on giving you solid guidance what we can best predict and let you reach your own conclusions about some of the things that are not quite as predictable. So I am going to show you what I told you last year in Feb relative to Japan operating ratios and reconcile them to our actual results and update them for another year or so. And so you will get that kind of guidance but you are just not going to get the specific EPS prediction.","Dan Amos","And, Tom, to be specific, last year at this time we didn\u2019t know we were going to have those additional profits that would come in. All of a sudden they came in, we did better than what we thought. In 2012 we have also given you guidance for '13 which ramped up the pressure on us in 2013. So we like to be able to see it. So that it was the positive things that happened last year that really drove this to want us to wait a little bit longer in doing it and then the SEC attorneys as well.","Operator","Our next question does come from Mark Finkelstein of Evercore Partners. Your line is open.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","I have got a couple of questions. I guess just firstly, can you just talk a little bit about the philosophy of repatriation going forward. I mean obviously, historically you\u2019ve looked at FSA earnings, maybe 80% of those. Now you\u2019re in a situation where the Yen has weakened considerably that has capital impacts. How should we think about the interplay of FSA earnings capital levels of similar ratios and repatriation?","Ken Janke","Mark, this is Ken. Let me start with this and I think Dan or Kriss and maybe even Tohru might want to jump in and add something. But the basis thought process is this. Clearly we\u2019re in the business of making commitments to customers and foremost on our mind is that we can fulfill those obligations to our policy holders. We have to protect their interests. So in that regard their protection really is measured by Japan\u2019s capital requirements, in other words the solvency margin ratio is critical. So we do a lot of work around the solvency margin ratio itself, projecting the ratio, stress testing the ratio and both relatively mild scenarios as well as very extreme scenarios to understand what risks there are to those ratios. And as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, unlike the RBC ratio, we also have interest rate risk to the SMR in Japan because the portion portfolio is mark-to-market for FSA reporting whereas RBC does not do that. In both ratios, SMR as well there\u2019s currency risk because we have a fairly significant un-hedged dollar position in the dollar portfolio that we\u2019ve had for more than 20 years. ","So really analysis is around making sure that our SMR is healthy enough to protect our customers and accommodate risks. Once we have comfort with that we do look at our FSA based earnings as a guide and as you point out, generally we have looked at a rule of thumb of pulling out 80% of FSA earnings and that would be FSA net income to include operating results as well as realized investment gains or losses. And then we\u2019ll simply look at what the parent company\u2019s needs are, liquidity needs and we will deliberate internally as well with our management in Japan and come up with a recommendation and agreement on what we\u2019ll repatriate. And that\u2019s basically how we\u2019ve done it for some time. And again we\u2019ll give you more insight into the exact numbers in just a few weeks, but that\u2019s really the process. ","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners","And then just on the Japan margin which was I think stronger than most people had expected, how should we think about that going forward? How would you characterize what we saw in the quarter particularly in the expense side?","Kriss Cloninger","I\u2019ll handle that. I\u2019ll say our margins have been typically a bit higher in the first quarter than the latter part of year, partly because on the Japan side and to the U.S side to some extent, late in the year we have some benefit through ups and stuff like that on accounting adjustments that we\u2019re committed to because of our [socks] process. The first quarter is usually both a favorable morbidity quarter and a lack of extraneous adjustments. So over the last several years our Japan margin has been higher in the first quarter than it has been throughout the year. the other thing is we tend to be heavily oriented toward expenses being incurred in the latter part of the year and we usually start the year somewhat cautiously on expenses and as we gain confidence that we\u2019re achieving the plans we loosen the reins on expenses to the extent we can. So expense ratios tend to be a bit lower in the first quarter than the latter part of the year. ","So I\u2019m just saying overall our margins tend to be a little bit higher in the first part of the year than the latter part of the year. But part of that is management oriented. I\u2019d say my take on this quarter was it was a favorable quarter, meaning that it was in line with expectations. As I mentioned in an earlier response I\u2019m going to give you a reconciliation of FAB. The guidance we gave you on ratios as far as benefits and expenses and the like last May and tell you how that came out in 2012. And then in the first quarter of 2013, I will say on Japan our benefit ratio was maybe on the high end of the forecast because we produced more ways relative to third sector, health, in the latter part of 2012 and 2013. So the benefit ratios were a bit higher than my forecast but the expense margins were a bit lower and the profit margin came in right in the middle of the range. So I consider that to be a favorable outcome.","Operator","Our next question does come from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","First I just want to follow-up on the 2014 outlook. I want to clarify Robin's comments. It seems as if you said that pace of earnings growth in 2014 could be similar to that of 2013. So I am assuming that there is 4% to 7% excluding the impact of the yen?","Ken Janke","This is Ken, Jay. We are not going to go that far. But I know you see this in your model. The vast majority of our revenues are known at January 1 of each year, given the significant persistency of Japan's enforce block, the stable and recently improving persistency of the U.S. block, the investment income combined with the predictability of our expenses and benefits. It's not a catalyst type of story. You see fairly consistent results emerge over long periods of time and I think that\u2019s really what Robin was referring to. Again, we don\u2019t want to get into a specific range but I think her comment really suggests that we don\u2019t expect a material change either upward or downward in the earning trajectory for next year. We are just going to give ourselves a bit more time to fine tune those estimates for '14.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","I see. Okay. And then on the Japan sales, if WAYS sales starting 2Q down 40% to 60%, I just have a little trouble getting to flat to up 5%...?","Dan Amos","Flat to up was only dealing with third sector. And remember, the down 40% to 60% is just for April but I think that trend may improve a little bit because always April is going to be your -- with that rate increase going in into effect. But the flat to up 5% was only for third sector.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","Okay. And the down 46%...?","Dan Amos","Tohru, you want to make a comment?","Tohru Tonoike","Not really. What Dan is right. We are trying to achieve the [2%] to 5% to increase in the third sub-sector that (inaudible) and America combined. And at this point we expect a significant decline in the sales of the WAYS and going forward not as much the degrees in April. Because April is the month right after the rate increase so many people came to us trying to buy this product before the rate increase in March. So as a reflection, reaction to that we will see \u00a0a very quiet April. But later in the year that situation will be improved a little bit but still we expect a difficult year of income to the sales of the WAYS product.","Dan Amos","Paul and I heard the presentation on the new advertising campaign we are holding towards the end of the third quarter and fourth quarter. And I think, you are going to see sales results more in line with '09 where we came on very strong in the fourth quarter. And so I am very excited about what Aflac Japan shows both of us. So that\u2019s very encouraging.","Kriss Cloninger","I want to further add that just because the sale of WAYS is off, doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into profits. Actually it could result in some profit improvement. I have talked to a little bit on the last couple of calls about the impact of selling a higher volume of business at a lower margin, the converse is true too. If you sell a lower volume half margin business, it tends to offset and then you\u2019ve got the impact of higher level non-deferrable costs both on U.S GAAP basis as well as on a regulatory basis and that improves our regulatory financial results profit wise. So lower volumes of WAYS is not necessarily negative for profit expectations. ","Ken Janke","Profit repatriation.","Kriss Cloninger","Right.","Operator","Our next question does come from Jeff Schuman of KBW. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","Just wanted to come back to the issue of I guess capital builds, repatriation and if you could give a little bit of perspective from a different angle. Granted you have to be sensitive to SMR and the FSA earnings, but so I think to look at the statutory capital, your statutory operating earnings were I think $2.9 billion in 2011, 43.3 billion in 2012 and then I have to assume in 2013 given that the business is bigger and you may have less capital strain on some new business that that number just continues to go up. I think you need to probably retain about $0.5 billion a year to fund growth. It just seems like you\u2019re destined to have this enormous statutory capital build. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s inevitable and you continue to be governed by the FSA constraints in the next few years or how we think about what appears to be the destiny for enormous statutory capital build.","Ken Janke","Jeff, it\u2019s Ken again. It\u2019s long been the case that the real source of our free cash flow is profit repatriation from Japan. And as we discussed last year at the Analyst meeting, the U.S has been saddled from a cash standpoint with additional tax payments to the U.S treasury because of the significant derisking that occurred in the Japanese portfolio which simply shifts the U.S export and as you know Aflac U.S as well. The U.S is responsible for all of the interest expense on the debt at the parent company level. So when you\u2019re thinking about -- at least until we see more normalcy and I think we\u2019re getting to that point because the losses have really been diminished recently to the extent that we don\u2019t have realized investment losses in Japan you don\u2019t see that tax burden hurting the U.S segment as much. So we\u2019re starting to see more normalcy there. But it is fair that the constraint for cash flow largely as the SMR in Japan\u2019s ability to repatriate capital.","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","Let\u2019s say the case I think during the periods of extraordinary growth that you\u2019ve just had, but at some point don\u2019t all those accounting systems converge and does that different \u2026?","Ken Janke","They do, but it takes time. If you close the block it would happen more quickly.","Dan Amos","I had that problem when I first became CEO. We had that issue. People -- we couldn\u2019t get money out of Japan they thought, but it was because of the conservatism and the way they viewed it on an SMR basis, but once it hit the maximum it then took off. And the normalcy here is coming back and I think over the next few years you\u2019re going to see it go back. Assuming we don\u2019t have any more major losses and we don\u2019t foresee them in the future, although we continue to be cautiously optimistic.","Operator","Our next question does come from Eric Bass of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Eric Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Just hoping, can you provide an update on expected margins on new sales by different products following the repricing given where you\u2019re investing new money today?","Kriss Cloninger","It jumps the gun a little bit on our FAB presentation, but I anticipated that someone would ask the question about the margin on the repriced business. For the business we\u2019re currently selling after the April 2 effective date on the repricing and with the discounted advance premium rate at 1% on business written with that. We anticipate that with a lifetime of the product, net investment yield rate of 2%, our profit margin as a percent of premium would be in the 15% to 20% range. Our ROE would be about 16%. If you say, okay, the net investment yield is going to be 2.5 life of the product kind of thing, you get up into the mid-20s. The range I am going to show you is probably close from 22 to 30 and ROE close to 22. So I will let you reach some conclusions about where the appropriate number for net investment yield over the life of the product is going to be. But those were the ranges I am going to show at the FAB meeting in May.","Eric Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then just maybe one follow up on the new money yield. You did see it increase in Japan pretty dramatically from kind of the fourth quarter to the first. I am just wondering since you are investing sort of the same mix between JGBs in U.S. corporate, kind of what it was on the U.S. corporate side that allowed you to get higher new money yields and if you changed anything either in the duration of securities you are buying or the credit level?","Eric Kirsch","Hi, it's Eric Kirsch. Nothing really has changed about the guidelines of the program. It's a longer duration corporate bond portfolio about 10 to 12 years, typically we are about 11 years on average. I think if you look at the fourth quarter to the first quarter within the U.S. corporate bond markets, by and large yields have come down -- or yields had gone up during the first quarter, excuse me, though there was some spread compression. But there was this [peakness] to the credit curve, particularly in the fourth quarter.","So we did pick up some additional spread because we are focused on the longer end, but by and large the yields we have invested in have been kind of in the area that we expected plus or minus 10 or so basis points. So we see a little bit of pickup in the first quarter just from the shape of the credit curve in general.","Operator","Our next question does come from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Before I ask my own questions, I do want to follow up on one thing. Ken, at the beginning when Tom asked his question, I was unclear. Are you looking at hedging 2014 profit repatriation very early in the year?","Ken Janke","We are looking at our options to do so right now.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. Then if I may, Kriss, looking at margins, could you give us a sense of maybe what the margin was on the first sector product that was sold in the first quarter, given that there was -- you got a higher rate through corporate debt program but you didn\u2019t have the rate increases in yet?","Kriss Cloninger","That\u2019s correct. It would probably be more in that 15% to 20% zone than in the higher numbers I quoted. But keep in mind that for the WAYS business with the discounted advanced premium, we did still have the 50 basis point rise in effect for that business, up through the April 1 switch date. So the initiatives we took to improve profitability on new business that we took during 2012 carried over into the first quarter of 2013. And I think it\u2019s pretty conservative life of the block assumptions for net investment yield rates. You would get at least 15% to 20% on the first sector business you wrote.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Good point about that. And then for Paul, two things here. Paul, you talked about kind of alternative distribution maybe participate in private exchanges what have you. I didn\u2019t hear anything about going over the internet, maybe going over portals like e-health, things like that, that maybe connecting to the exchanges. And I am also interested, you have through your sales force, probably an unparalleled look into the health spending plans of small employers. Are you hearing anything from your sales force to suggest that significant amounts of employers will be dumping their major medical plans and maybe in association with that, dumping their supplemental health plans as well? (Inaudible)","Paul Amos","There is a whole bunch in there. So let me get it started. First of all, we view the exchanges as an opportunity not to be necessarily an online enrolment tool where we\u2019re selling directly over the internet, but instead we view it as a direct tool to enhance our sales force to go to market and allow them to further their strength in the small business market. We\u2019re building our own private exchange where we\u2019ll be partnering with certain companies which we believe is going to allow our sales force to really strengthen their hold on the accounts that they have as well as continue to grow their accounts in the small business market. So I believe the exchange is a win for our sales team as opposed to being an online sale. In terms of participating in online only enrolments, there are aspects we may test, but today there continues to be large adverse selection around that type of sale as well as with increased competition in that marketplace we know that there\u2019s going to be a drive towards limited profitability and we want to do everything we can to maintain the margins on our profits and by selling through our own private exchange we believe we maximize the ability to sell with higher margins and maintain those ratios and at the same time obviously help our sales force. On the latter half of your question around healthcare cost increases, what I would say to you \u2026","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Paul, it wasn\u2019t healthcare cost increases. It was the idea that employers may take advantage of the existence of the exchanges to basically tell employees look, instead of me providing this, here\u2019s some money, you go get it.","Paul Amos","I understand. I\u2019m sorry about that. There is a technology that is going to allow us within our exchange called iFrame. Whether the employer chooses to or not to push their employees out to the exchange, we\u2019ll be able to actually enroll at the worksite whether they do that or not. So we can actually pull up the state or federal exchange through our enrolment technology, through this technology called iFrame. Therefore we believe we can persuade the business to allow, even if they want to go push their people out in order to qualify for the subsidy, we can help them do that. At the same time we believe that the implementation of subsidies is going to go at a very slow manner. We believe that it\u2019s going to happen on a state by state basis depending upon their current fiscal environment and we believe that there\u2019s going to be a very inconsistent rollout of exchanges. That\u2019s not a political view. It\u2019s a straight financial view of what\u2019s going to happen. And so we\u2019re monitoring this with the knowledge that it is going to be a highly complex environment. ","What\u2019s happening in California versus Iowa versus Alabama may be drastically different and therefore we\u2019ll have an impact on how those local businesses decide what percentage of their people to push out to the market. We do know that the only place in the United States where we have a test market about that is the State of Massachusetts. Today only 6% of businesses actually push their employees out to the open exchange as opposed to McKenzie who\u2019s gone out and said it could be as much as 40%. We believe it\u2019s going to be on the lower end. In America there continues to be a war on talent where we know that small businesses more than ever value their employees and not only recruiting them but retaining them. And in order to retain them, we believe that health benefits is something they\u2019re going to continue to want to offer. So to the extent that we can help partner with America\u2019s small businesses to both leverage the exchange, but also to bring Aflac products and other companies\u2019 products to the table, we believe we can continue to do extremely well.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Hopefully we\u2019ll hear about this iFrame next month.","Operator","Your next question does come from (inaudible) of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Can we talk a little bit about the individual independent agencies in Japan? It seems like the number of those agencies is coming down and your products at least going up. I was curious, has productivity increased simply due to weeding of the underperformers or is there more going on there?","Tohru Tonoike","I\u2019ll take that question. The decline in the recruiting numbers of the individual agencies and independent agencies I would say is in accordance with our plan. As I told you in the past conference call, we have been shifting focus from recruiting large number of independent out of individual agents towards putting more resources to the training of the existing recruited agents. That\u2019s part of it. And also particularly in the three large metropolitan areas, namely Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, we have created a network of the Aflac consultants, the group of visiting sales force employed by Aflac. So instead of hiring large number of individuals in that area, we are hiring a selected number of Aflac consultants. More professionally trained people so that they can make sales more efficiently than the average new recruited individual. So, yes, the number of recruits have been decreased substantially. But again this is, I would say, in line with what we have planned.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then on the investment side. As you are exploring alternatives of the JGBs, could you maybe walk us through some of the alternatives you are thinking about or maybe the frame work that you are using in order to look at these alternatives?","Eric Kirsch","Sure, I would be happy to. First, I think it's important to put it in perspective. The JGB allocation for us is 25% to 30% or so of our new money. And while certainly on April 4th after the new BOJ policy came out, yields fell precipitously. They have also come back up pretty strongly as well. So they are certainly lower than they were at the beginning of the year. But even if we followed of our JGB allocation for the rest of the year, if you did the math relative to our new money yield objectives, it was impacted by about 5 basis points. So it's not a huge differential.","Nevertheless, we do consider do we want to lockup 20 year or 30 year money at these low yields, given they are at historic lows. And our viewpoint is, that there is a good chance there will be success in Japan. So sometime in the future whether it's a year out or two, interest rates will eventually rise. So keep that framework in mind. So our objective is, within that 25% or so, is there some alternatives that we could be comfortable with. We will outperform those yields but not necessarily lock us up for 20 or 30 years. So as an example, we could take a look at a short term corporate bond program hedged back to yen, where we could take advantage of good quality corporate bonds in the U.S., shorter durations and maturities or probably pick up 40 to 50 basis points over those JGB yields. And because the duration of those corporate would be shorter, they will be subject to less price sensitivity than say our long corporate bonds.","So over a year or two from now, JGB yield should go up and we think we need to adjust the asset allocation at that time, we will have some flexibility as well. So we haven\u2019t reached any conclusions. We think it's critical we follow what's happening in the monetary and fiscal side in Japan and always reflect on that. But it's not going to be a huge difference ultimately to our yields for this year when you do the math and settle that down. So everything will be brought up in perspective.","Robin Wilkey","Thank you very much. We have reached the top of the hour. And if you have any further questions, please give us a call. Tom and myself will be in the office, and if not please make sure that you sign of for our FAB meeting and we look forward to seeing you there. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Young, Vice-President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations.","David Young","Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter call. This morning we will be hearing remarks from Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac, Incorporated, about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States; then Fred Crawford, Executive Vice-President and CFO of Aflac, Incorporated, will follow with more details about our financial results, outlook and capital management. We will then open our call to questions.","Joining us this morning for Q&A are members of our executive management team in the U.S.; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; Eric Kirsch, Global Chief Investment Officer; Rich Williams, Chief Distribution Officer; Al Riggieri, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary; Max Broden, Treasurer.","We are also joined by members of our executive management team in Tokyo at Aflac Life Insurance. Charles Lake, President of Aflac International and Chairman Representative Director; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director, Todd Daniels, Principal Financial Officer; and Koji Ariyoshi, Director and Head of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. The earnings release is available on the Investors page of aflac.com, and also includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures.","I'll now turn the call over to Dan.","Daniel Amos","Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","Let me begin by saying that the second quarter 2018 established a strong first half of the year for Aflac. I am pleased that we were able to upward or revise our 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook. Aflac Japan our largest contributor generated strong financial results. Fred will provide more details but let me just say that in yen terms, Aflac Japan's pretax profit margin was ahead of expectations both through the quarter and through the first six months.","Aflac Japan's outstanding third sector sales increase of 16% was well above our expectations. This strong results was largely due to April's introduction of our new cancer insurance products. There were a few factors that drove sales beyond our expectations for the quarter.","First, the new cancer insurance policy offered popular enhanced benefit features while carefully managing the risk profile of the product as we've done in the past. In addition, we launched a targeted promotional campaign for all this cancer - the new cancer product that incorporated television ads with the largest direct mail campaign we've ever done.","And finally we fully engaged our wide reaching distribution network. Over the last few years following our agreement with Japan post, we phased in our cancer insurance sales to postal outlets that were positioned for sales at the time. This new cancer product launch marked the first introduction that we've had access to all 20,000 plus Japan post outlets at the same time. The results there were bigger than we had anticipated. In fact this quarter reflected the highest production ever in Japan post in terms of a fee.","Our traditional agencies also had a solid performance in cancer sales and they continue to be bottled to our success. Our extensive distribution network furthers our goal to be where people want to buy insurance.","All of these factors reflected an strong cancer sales growth for both the independent corporate agencies and affiliated corporate agencies during the quarter. The quarter's results are laying the foundation for another strong year of third sector sales. We believe some of this reflects an acceleration of sales that we originally anticipated for the second half of the year recognizing the strong launch of the cancer product.","We have robust our projections and are now calling for growth rate in the low single-digit for 2018 third sector sales. Remember, we're coming off comparison to an outstanding 2017 for third sector medical sales due to last year's introduction of the new ever medical product. You will hear more about this from Ariyoshi at our financial analyst briefing in September.","Our focus of remaining our leadership position in the sale of third sector products that are less interest rate-sensitive had strong and stable margins. We will continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduce innovative new third sector products to maintaining our market leadership.","Turning to Aflac U.S. we are pleased with our financial performance. The pretax profit margins exceeded our expectations both for the quarter and for the first half of the year. I'm also pleased with our sales results for the quarter which advanced our progress in achieving our anticipated full-year sales growth of 3% to 5%.","You'll hear more about this from Teresa and Richard at financial analyst briefing in September but we continue to expect our growth in broker sales. Our team of broker sales professionals have made great strides in successfully strengthening Aflac's relationship within the large broker community. Our partnering initiatives for True Group products is still early in development but is already starting to take up the shape.","As a result, Aflac is seeing a high rate of growth through brokers and strong sales growth in our group products. Keep in mind, Aflac is different from our peers and there is a majority of our sales comes from our independent sales agent. We are fortunate to have such a strong independent field force which is truly unique within our industry. These career sales agents are best positioned within the industry to reach and therefore succeed with the smaller employers and groups with fewer than 100 employees. Aflac independent career agents have been driving force behind Aflac's ability to dominate the smaller case market.","Recruiting remains a challenge in a strong employment marketplace. However, productivity continues to improve as our veteran agents further penetrate existing accounts and our investment in agent development gains traction. Equally important is a coordination between our powerful field force of sales agents and our growing network of broker sales professionals. It is very encouraging that our brokers look for solutions for their clients. They have found that Aflac portfolio of products helps fills those needs.","Brokers are looking for a strong brand like Aflac as they also leverage our outstanding track record of experienced and extensive fulfillment capacities. Our deal force independent agents are experts who have demonstrated their ability to accelerate growth by working with brokers and broker sales professionals. We characterize this collaboration as broker influenced business.","As we look to the remainder of 2018 we will continue to expect sales to make way towards the fourth quarter as broker and broker influenced sales are a growing part of our business.","Turning to capital deployment, Fred will provide more detail shortly. We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our bondholders, shareholders and policyholders. At the same time, we are balancing our financial strength with increasing the dividend repurchasing shares and reinvesting in our business.","We continue to anticipate that we\u2019ll repurchase in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of our shares in 2018. As always is the case, this assumes stable capital conditions and the absence of compelling alternatives.","Looking ahead, we believe our strong earnings growth will reflect the underlying earnings power of our insurance operations in Japan and the United States. It will also reflect our prudent approach to deploying excess capital in a way that balances the interest of all stakeholders. At the same time, we will also reflect our dedication to delivering on the promise we make to our policyholders.","I\u2019ll conclude by saying that this has been one of the best quarters in the company's history and I'm very proud of it. I\u2019ll continue to be excited about Aflac future growth. And now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Fred who will cover the financial results. Fred?","Frederick Crawford","Thank you, Dan.","Building on a strong start to the year our earnings results for the second quarter exceeded our expectations. While it is early in the year the strength of our performance year-to-date and stability in our margins gives us confidence, we will exceed our original guidance range for the year. We have therefore updated our currency neutral adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $3.90 to $4.06 per diluted share.","Key variables as we move through the year include continued strength in investment income, sustainability of benefit ratios in underlying claims trends and the pace of expense build as we continue to invest in the future growth and efficiencies.","For the quarter adjusted earnings of $1.07 were driven by strong pretax margins both in Japan and the U.S. Our reported results benefited modestly by a strengthening of the yen as compared to 2017 period contributing $0.01 per share to the quarter's results. Virtually all key earnings drivers performed at or above our expectations.","Japan branch conversion costs in the quarter were $40 million. We project less than 10 million in remaining costs spread over the third and fourth quarter. We have effectively wrapped up the conversion with total project cost of approximately $120 million, consistent with the low end of our forecasted range.","Turning to our Japan segment results, we reported pretax profit margin of 21.8%. Our total benefit ratio came in below our guidance range of 70% to 72%, driven by a continued shift in business mix from first sector towards third sector, positive claims trends in our cancer business and associated reserve adjustments.","Our expense ratio in Japan reverted back to the midpoint of our outlook range of 19% to 21%. The sequential increase was expected given promotional spend with the launch of our refreshed cancer product and continued build in IT modernization spend. We would expect to run towards the high end of our outlook range throughout the rest of the year.","Before moving on to the U.S. segment, as is common when introducing a new or refreshed third sector product in Japan, we typically experience elevated lapse and reissue activity as policyholders choose to upgrade their existing policies for the enhanced benefits.","In the short run and depending on the mix of policies, this can apply downward pressure on our benefit ratio as we release reserves on lapse policies and experience elevated deck amortization on the same policies.","While it is too early in the launch of our cancer product to have specific estimates on the impact, we believe this contributed to Japan's favorable benefit ratio, increased deck amortization, and provided a very modest net benefits or earnings in the quarter. We expect this impact will lessen throughout the year.","Turning to the U.S. results, our overall pretax profit margin in the quarter was 21.1%. Our total benefit ratio moved back to the midpoint of our guidance range of 51% to 53%. We have historically seen a lower first quarter benefit ratio followed by a modest increase in the second quarter, and that experience continues.","Our expense ratio in the U.S. came in below our expectations and is largely timing related. We expect accelerated spend in the second half of the year, which includes previously announced post tax reform investments. As mentioned in the first quarter, these accelerated investments will amount to approximately $0.03 per share in the second half of the year.","Overall, we continue to see the year coming in around the midpoint of our guidance range of 34% to 36%, with the second half running at the high end of the range.","Investment income performance both in Japan and the U.S. continues to deliver very strong results. The year-to-date outperformance has been driven primarily by the accelerated growth of our floating-rate portfolio, further benefiting from higher LIBOR rates, relative to our expectations coming into the year.","As we have previously commented, we elected to lock in the majority of our hedge costs for 2018, which mitigated the potential impact from higher U.S. interest rates. As hedge instruments roll off, we would expect to lose some of this relative outperformance heading into 2019.","As I discussed in the first quarter call, we continue to make progress on managing our economic exposure to the yen, while lowering enterprise wide costs associated with the Japan's U.S. dollar investment hedging.","We accomplish this by entering into an offsetting hedge position at the holding company, with the financial impact recognized in our corporate and other segment. We have built this offsetting position to approximately $1.25 billion in the quarter, contributing $7 million on a pretax basis to the quarter\u2019s earnings.","Our strategy balance is securing Aflac's strong capital position in Japan, while lowering our enterprise exposure to a weakening yen. We will spend more time discussing this risk reduction strategy at our September financial analyst briefing in Japan.","We ended the quarter in a strong capital position. Japan's solvency margin ratio is estimated in the 950% range, this is particularly strong result recognizing our April 2nd conversion from a branch to a subsidiary reduced SMR by approximately 130 points.","As we have stated previously, we have plans in place to restore the SMR accounting impact over a three-year period. Our estimated U.S. only risk-based capital ratio at quarter end stands at roughly 850%, and includes an estimate of the full adoption of U.S. tax reform.","It is our understanding the NAIC intends on adopting the full effect of tax reform in 2018. With the impact of tax reform and dividend projections that include a drawdown of $500 million in excess capital in the second half of the year, we are projecting an RBC in the mid 600% range for year-end 2018.","We ended the quarter with just over $2 billion of capital and liquidity of the holding company. We set aside $1 billion of contingent capital, and $500 million for liquidity in support of holding company derivative positions. Despite recent increases in volatility, overall credit conditions and asset quality remains strong with very little in the way of impairments in the quarter.","Including dividends and share repurchase, we returned approximately $500 million to our shareholders in the quarter. We repurchased 6.8 million shares of our stock for $306 million in the quarter and remain tactical in our approach. We are maintaining our current outlook range for repurchase of $1.1 to $1.4 billion in 2018.","As we move into the third quarter, we plan to make a $50 million contribution to our pension fund. This contribution is larger than normal and takes advantage of a 35% corporate tax deduction if funded prior to September 15. The contribution has no implications for our capital plans and represents a sound use of excess capital.","With the conversion behind us, we are hard at work to optimize our capital and liquidity profile. We will further develop these strategies at our September financial analyst briefing.","I'll now hand the call back to David to begin our Q&A session. David?","David Young","Thank you, Fred. Now we are ready to take your questions, but first let me ask that you please limit yourself to one initial question and one related follow-up to that question to allow other participants an opportunity to ask a question. We will now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first participant to ask question is Ryan Kruger of KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Kruger","Fred, could you help us size the potential impact of the role off of the hedges that you locked in this year as we go into next and they reset?","Frederick Crawford","It certainly helped in mitigate if you will some of the rising rates. As you recall, we locked in approximately 80% of our hedge costs as we are entering into 2018 and we estimate for the full year on a pretax basis that benefits us by approximately $9 million for 2018. So that's the approximate benefits.","So it's relatively modest, but again we would note that as we roll into 2019, we'll start having a reset if you will of our hedge cost and obviously hedge cost have risen through throughout the year. Again that's offset by LIBOR benefiting us as we built down the floating rate portfolio.","Ryan Kruger","And then just one other one, you mentioned prudent investment in the business I think in regard as a comment after your buyback comment for the year. As presumably the ongoing business investments don't really have much impact on your capital position that is I referred to - are you referring to things like investments and some of the insured tech companies and things along that nature?","Frederick Crawford","No, not really referring to that, although we have set of sites some opportunistic money if you will to reinvest in those efforts and those efforts are going well, but they represent a relatively modest allocation of our excess capital when looking at any given year over a three-year period of time.","Really, the more important aspect of reinvestment back in the business platform both in the U.S. and Japan is that we are calling for some elevated expense ratios if you will as we move through the remainder of the year. We have been running at relatively low expense ratios in the early part of the year both in Japan and the U.S.","As you saw in the second quarter, Japan were reverted back to more what we would expect in that 20% range as an expense ratio, but the U.S. was quite low and that's largely timing related because we for natural reasons had backend loaded for example some of our tax reform investments as we formulate the plan and remain very prudent to how we allocate that money. So, some of that reinvestment is really related to expense ratio guidance and not so much a tax on our capital position or excess capital deployment.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of John Nadel of UBS. Your line is now open.","John Nadel","Fred, just a question on the U.S. risk-based capital ratio. I think you had mentioned that it's around 850%, you expect it to drop down to about 650% at year-end. I think there's two drivers there, one, is the $500 million dividend that you're expecting to take out, the other is the tax impacts. Can you sort of give us a sense of the relative contributions for that 200 point decline from each?","Frederick Crawford","Yes, absolutely. So, remember, the first half of tax reform was already adopted in the number that was the DTA that was adopted early. So, the tax reform impact for 2018 is really in the denominator, if you will. And that has as an impact of right around 75 points of RBC. In other words, if you were to look at our RBC before that implementation of tax reform, we would be running at or posting 925% RBC.","So, that tax reform implication had knocked it down to 850%. Now, what brings it down to 650% is that we've largely backend loaded our U.S. statutory dividend and the removal of that excess capital all takes place in the second half of the year.","In fact the removal of excess capital together with normal dividend of earnings that are produced in the U.S. entity, we are calling for upwards of just a touch over $1 billion of dividend activity up to the holding company in the second half of the year.","So, it's quite a bit backend loaded. And a lot of that had to do with making our way through the conversion and settling into our post conversion RBC estimates.","John Nadel","So that $1 billion of dividend is really the 200 points?","Frederick Crawford","You got it. And it's a combination of statutory earnings in normal, what I would call, ordinary dividend capacity, and then the $500 million excess capital.","John Nadel","And then just - to circle back on persistency in Japan. I know it's nitpicky but that's ticked down a bit maybe 1 to 1.5 percentage points over the last several quarters. Is that really related to what you discussed earlier, which is the sort of shift in lab patient of old policies and for the new ones?","Frederick Crawford","That's right. And particularly with cancer, because you're talking about having gone 4 years since upgrade, and so, with advancements in cancer treatment and diagnosis and then together with other beneficial features that Dan, noted in his comments. You have much more in the way of an attractive upgrade opportunity for our policyholders. Recognizing that we age down things in cancer and so it tends to be some of the more recent policies that are most susceptible to this.","And in that case what ends up happening is, yes, you'll have elevated labs activity i.e. lower persistency. You'll have sales obviously benefiting from that activity. But then when you get to our P&L, you have a bit of a lower benefit ratio as you release reserves on the policy, higher DAC and DAC amortization. And that tends to balance out for somewhat modest impact to earnings.","So, it's little less about an earnings story and more about the line items in the P&L. And I would note that it's very important to understand that. In the second quarter of last year we actually had the same dynamic, it's by coincidence but we launched our medical product in March last year.","And if you look at the trends in persistency, trends in benefit ratio, DAC amortization, you see the same phenomenon last year, 1Q to 2Q as you see this year. That's coincidental but it gives you an idea of that, that tends to happen when you first launch the product. It calms down over time, obviously.","John Nadel","And are you agnostic between cancer and medical sales?","Frederick Crawford","I'll let Dan answer that because we talked about that. The answer is, from a profitability perspective, yes. But Dan, why don't you talk about it.","Daniel Amos","Yes, I think we are. We have always said that when the profit margins are relatively similar, then to us it doesn't matter. And agents always choose the path of least resistance. And the path of least resistance is always the newest product that's on the market.","It gives some swizzle and they can straight to it. You saw that happened last year with the EVER product. And now you're seeing it this year with the new cancer product.","So, it makes it much easier than us to try to figure out how to balance every year, which one they sell. If there was an enormous difference in profitability then that's one thing. But there isn't. So from that standpoint we feel very good about it. And it's nothing new. I mean we've been doing it since the inception of Japan, we've been working that way.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Dally","I just wanted to follow on from John's question. Is it possible to, John mentioned, the portion of sales that represented the lapse then reissues activity on the new cancer product? And also just a question on accounting, when you do have a lapse and reissue, is it just a incremental premium book to the sale or is it the whole annualized premium on new policy?","Frederick Crawford","Yeah, it's the overall premium, because it's really treated as literally two separate transactions, meaning -- because it's really consistent with what the consumer has decided. They've decided to lapse their policy and so you'll see that lapse accounted for and reported just as a lapse.","So, it hurts your persistency as you would expect and it's consistent with accounting. The accounting guidance on this is, if you've made material changes to the policy, particularly the benefit structure of the policy and more materially improved it, then you really account for it as a lapse and reissue.","So, that's the way it goes. The reissue then is marked and reported as a sale. And so the accounting and the way we report is consistent in that regard. And then in terms of sizing it, this is obviously been going on for many, many years. This is really always how it's been reported as a company.","We will tend to see normal lapse and reissue activity ranging in the 10% to 15% in any given period and any given year. But as I mentioned, in the period where you actually launch in that period, i.e. the quarter or perhaps a quarter or two, it will naturally be elevated upwards of 25% to 30%. And we suspect that's about the type of result we've seen this time around.","When it comes to the outright earnings impact, it's quite a bit muted. It's very dependent on the cohort of what actually lapse. Older policies, for example, which is more rare when they lapse, will release higher reserves. They often times as they're very old may have cash value associated with it, and very little DAC amortization. And so it hits the bottom line in a little more pronounced to positive way.","But because many of the policies tend to be really younger, if you will, in terms of age of the policies when they've been issued, last five years, for example, you'll have less in the way of reserve release and more in the way of DAC amortization.","So it's highly dependent on the mix of business, which is why it's difficult to estimate. We would we would estimate in this period that may be earnings benefited from \u00a51 billion to \u00a52 billion, in that range, so, relatively modest, and again, very similar to 2017.","But Nigel, well you've been around long time. The cancer product before this one, that was the case, and the cancer product before that when it was the case. So, it's been going on over -- across 20 years. So, it's nothing new.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jimmy Bhullar","First, just on the expected RBC decline because of tax reform, has that in any way changed your view of what the RBC threshold should be? I think you've mentioned 500% that being sort of an initial threshold for the RBC, just trying to assess how the lower RBC affects your plans to free the $1 billion from the U.S. conversion.","Frederick Crawford","Yes, Jimmy. No impact to that. We are very comfortable, not only with the tax reform absorbed in our capital plan and drawdown of excess capital, but I would also note that we're comfortable with any potential movement related to the C1 bucket, if you will, changes that are expected in 2019.","We see neither of those events as disrupting our drawdown plans. We have settled in and expect to settle in around 500% at the end of 2019. As I've mentioned publicly, I think given the risk profile of our business as we start to print blue books and are able to analyze and report our stability, if you will, and low risk profile as U.S. only entity, we'll continue to look to see whether there's further optimization opportunity in that.","I think most observers would say that 500% RBC on the nature of our business is quite high, even for our high ratings threshold. And so, we'll work on that. But I think, when working with rating agencies and frankly thinking about our own risk management practices, it's important to start printing some of these statutory results on a U.S. only basis to make sure we have a good handle on it and can support our case.","So, we think there's room there, Jimmy, but just to answer your question, no tax reform nor the C1 changes are going to disrupt our capital plans.","Jimmy Bhullar","And if I could ask one more just overall obviously your sales were very strong in Japan, the one negative I thought was just the medical sales continuing to shrink and I think they're sitting around the \u00a56 billion quarterly range. And they\u2019ve drifted lower steadily after you introduced the updated product last year.","So I\u2019m assuming you had introduced a new product at some point next year, but - is this sort of a normal level of medical sales do you expect in the absence of any new products or have the sales been pressured a little bit because of the whole focus on cancer recently?","Daniel Amos","I\u2019d like you Koji - Koide to answer the question. Koide?","Masatoshi Koide","[Foreign Language] Well one of the big reasons why medical sales are shrinking is because it\u2019s been more than a year since the new medical product was launched. And then as you know we have launched a new cancer product in April and everyone is really shifting their focus to some of this product. As a result medical sales in the second quarter declined and this is something that we have assumed and this is what we have been experiencing in the past as well.","And as this medical insurance area is very competitive however we are still maintaining a number one position in new business policy number as well as AP. So please remember that we are still maintaining that number one position.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Question for Fred regarding the benefit ratio and DAC amortization impact from the lapses. I understand from a earnings is small, but like how should we think about the moving pieces in terms of the uplift \u2013 I mean the downward pressure on the benefit ratio and the uplift to DAC amortization. And then also how should we think about in the balance of the year?","Frederick Crawford","Yeah I think in terms of the balance of the year, we would expect this impact to lessen as I mentioned. So it will become less distinguishable from a line item perspective and really negligible in terms of any particular earnings impact. I think an easy way to think about it Humphrey is that as I mentioned in my comments.","We would expect the benefit ratio in Japan to elevate back within the guidance range we have which is 70% to 72% and that's one way of thinking about the relative impact because that would be probably one of the features that would drive it back up.","We also have particular strong cancer claims trends don't forget we\u2019re actually seeing just good flat net experience particularly in hospitalization trends on cancer. And that led to not only positive claims activity, but also some natural IBNR release which is somewhat mechanical as we adjust for the trends we\u2019re seeing.","So we continue to see that development and that's a very economic if you will in terms of the benefit. Very importantly what I would say to you is that when looking at the benefit ratio overall in Japan while our guidance range is 70% to 72% we actually expect the full year to be coming in at the downside of that range that has been somewhat consistent pattern and we expect some of that to continue.","It will be more elevated than what we had in the second quarter, but still overall year will fall very close to the bottom end of that range is what we are currently projecting. So that's the way to think about it. The actual line item impact with preciseness there is more work to be done to be able to isolate that because it gets quick quite, quite technical. You're talking about really needing to isolate all the exact moving parts in the policy from particularly a lapse policy dynamic. As I mentioned the cohorts can be very sensitive as to what the impact is to the line items.","We\u2019ll continue to do more work on that can provide more transparency, but from a bottom line perspective it's not a big material mover. And again you can kind of take both the benefit ratio guidance we've given as a little bit of the impact DAC amortization very similarly and I would again call your attention to last year's 1Q to 2Q development. You can see the same thing happening benefit ratio drifted down, when we launched the medical product in March amortization drifted up. And those are reasonable proximities of what you see on those line items.","Humphrey Lee","And then on the third sector sales in the quarter so obviously there are lot of the moving pieces part of it because of the new product launch and then also kind of we having a very successful targeted promotional campaign. And then I believe there is also some pent up demand from the first quarter in anticipation of the launch. So when we think about the product is up like excluding the impact of the pent up demand from the first quarter like how would you kind of characterize the product itself kind of addressing the need of the consumer that was not available in the marketplace before this product. And how should we think about kind of the sales impact in the balance of the year?","Daniel Amos","Koide or Koji?","Masatoshi Koide","[Foreign Language]","Koji Ariyoshi","Okay, I will take the question this is Koji [Foreign Language]. We have always - try to incorporate features by always thinking about what is needed by customers as well as what is going in the medical treatment area. For example this time we have implemented a specified premium waiver feature of positive care et cetera. We also have features to be able to cover broad range of customers that include new customers as well as our existing customers.","And we are also providing our product to those customers who have concerns about their health or even to cancer survivors. And particularly at this time our main feature is to add specified premium waiver feature which has been long wanted by the JP Japan Post customers. And we have also added our coverage that can be added to our existing policy holders policies and this is was very much wanted by our agencies and these have contributed two the sales this time.","Daniel Amos","I\u2019d like to add one of thing and that is product is important here but it\u2019s also just strong distribution channel. We are truly going to the places that people want to buy products. And then don\u2019t forget our domination of the cancer insurance market is something that stands out worldwide that what we\u2019ve been able to do in that market. Medical is more competitive if you go back 2001 when we deregulated the market a lot of people thought Aflac would be out of business all big competitors would put us out and instead you saw the Dai-Ichi Life sell for us.","You saw some of the other competitors get in and then pull back, you seen Japan post, you\u2019ve seen post off \u2013 I mean the banks. I think its part distribution, but it also as those products as well but it's a one, two punch of both of them that makes it stand out.","Humphrey Lee","I guess just kind of cover a little bit so like for the - almost \u00a521 billion in cancer sales in the quarter. We think about some of it is probably because of the pent up demand from first quarter and the others just because of the you have a new and better product. So if we kind of bifurcate between some of the pent up demand versus the what do you expect as a more normal, quarterly sales for the cancer product, how should we think about that?","Frederick Crawford","What I would say to your point if this is what you mean by pent up sales. You might recall and we've commented on this publicly that as it starts to become well understood that we\u2019re refreshing our cancer product particularly when we filed with the FSA and we\u2019re in motion and starting to build. You will see a natural anticipation of the new product and a pullback in some of the distribution systems as they prepare for it.","So you do have some shift from a 1Q pause to a 2Q jump out of the gate and strong sales but then as Dan had mentioned and Koji mentioned, it's natural both in medical and cancer that as the year goes on you start to see things taper from the sales perspective. So you have a little bit of acceleration of what we anticipate in the second half of the year into the second quarter and then you have exactly what you're saying a little bit of that delayed start or pent-up demand if you want to call it from 1Q to 2Q.","Daniel Amos","You can't get more about two quarters up.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of John Barnidge of Sandle O'Neill. Your line is now open.","John Barnidge","Given the strong first half third sector sales this year, should we start viewing the Japan segment now that we have had a product portfolio composition shift of third sector in a way from first sector as more heavily weighted towards the first half in any given year to may be balance out the U.S. increasingly 4Q '18 for sales?","Daniel Amos","I think it's a function of when we introduced new product and that is the approval based on the FSA and the minute we decide we are coming out with a new product, we wanted as quickly as we can. So we don't hold for anything. So I think that what's driving in more than anything else.","John Barnidge","Then with the new cancer products rolled out driving strong sales, can you talk about other new products or product enhancements, please?","Daniel Amos","Japan.","John Barnidge","Yes. That will be great.","Daniel Amos","Koide or whoever wants to do it.","Masatoshi Koide","[Foreign Language] In terms of new products, we'll be focusing and we have been focusing on medical and cancer and especially cancer products that we needed to develop very attractive products at appropriate timing.","And then looking at medical products because of medical area as more competitive compared with either product in much more quicker pace and we are also considering some of the products in the protection type area and we are considering them for example, one of the areas that we are currently considering - promotional area, which could be very attractive.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Erik Bass","In the U.S. you are seeing some nice improvement on year-over-year and agent productivity. Can you just talk about which of your initiatives have the biggest impact to date and where you still see opportunity to improve performance?","Teresa White","So, Erik this is Teresa. I think in the area of where we are seeing most of our improvement, its distribution expansion and all of the activities that we have around our broker tools and services. I think we have started to see the investments pay off in that area. We also have executed on product partnership and other solutions that we are bringing to the employer, which I think have helped us to provide lift on that side as well.","As to what may not be performing as well, at this point, I feel like we are operating on all cylinders, what I'm seeing is a disciplined execution on our strategy. Obviously, I'd love to have more recruits increased productivity et cetera, but we continue to see very positive movement in many of our metrics, so hopefully that will answer your question.","Erik Bass","To follow up on one thing you mentioned. You talked about the billed out of your products including some of the partnership relationships. Can you just comment on the impact that this is having on sales?","Teresa White","We are seeing increase in quotes from many of our larger case brokers and actually in the mid market as well. And so we see that as a great leading indicator for sales but we\u2019ve also seen the sales rates increase as well. Enhancements to our new cancer products has also been a part of that as well.","Erik Bass","And now I would assume the biggest benefit from that you'd see on sales would be in the fourth quarter as well?","Teresa White","Yes.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","Wanted to talk about Japan and the annualized premiums enforced even with the strong third sector sales it looks like that number is still coming down. I know there is 5-pay way still kind of coming through, but any sense of when you think that annualized premiums enforced number will start to grow again?","Frederick Crawford","Suneet I think it does take a while we are still seeing the paid up policy dynamics come through in first sector. First sector but in general has about a one little north of 1% lapse rate generally. And then the paid-up policies are running around \u00a530 billion for the year and that will continue to come down, but modestly. You'll still see a level of paid-up policies not just related to 5-pay but just in general other forms of paid-up policies that we have on the books.","And then eventually there's a 10 Pay product that sold far less than the five Pay but that comes into play as well. So first sector premium in general is going to continue to be modestly down, but it's slowly starting to get overwhelmed by the growth rate of third sector particularly when we post consecutive years of third sector growth rate. And so the third sector earned premium is now about 75% of our total earned premium that's up about 200 basis points over last year this time gives you an idea the mix shift.","And that third sector premium as we said we anticipate growing in the 2% to 3% range. And we\u2019re certainly hitting that that nicely. So you'll start to eventually turn the corner, I think for sure you're into very low growth rates once you do turn that corner just by virtue of the sheer size of our block of business and natural lapsation that takes place.","But what's really important is the embedded value if you will and profitability of that shift and mix away from first sector towards third sector is a very good development for the company over time. And you end up seeing the evidence of that in improved FSA earnings which means improved cash flow in excess capital and deployment opportunities. So we\u2019re happy with that trend line.","Suneet Kamath","And then just on the third sector sales it looks like cancer is going to carry you guys for this year I think medical was pretty strong last year. I think there was a question on this earlier but just to follow up. Is there another sort of key product launch that you guys are thinking about for 2019 to kind of overcome what\u2019s becoming some difficult comps in '18?","Daniel Amos","Will let Japan touch on that again.","Masatoshi Koide","[Foreign Language] And of course for our growth it is our responsibility to really inject new product into the market in a well planned manner. So we are steadily preparing for our new product launch. However I am not able to really disclose the specifics of the product that we are thinking of.","Daniel Amos","That\u2019s the requirement of that let\u2019s say that not just us that act like I want Dave.","Suneet Kamath","No, that\u2019s fine just one last one just on the income support product. I think in the past you talked about maybe that product is for the third leg and the product stool in Japan cancer, medical and then income support. And I realize there has been lot of emphasis on cancer certainly this quarter, but sales there really haven't budged much in fact they are down a little bit. Is that still a product that you think has the potential to be that third stool or any thoughts around that?","Daniel Amos","I\u2019ll answer that I\u2019m disappointed with the sales of the product, but it is a new product it\u2019s not a revised product like when we say okay this is a new cancer. This is new thing that\u2019s never really been out there and what we're seeing is the Shinkin banks are being successful with it. And we think that it will grow from there. What I would say is, I'm still encouraged that there is real potential with it, but it hadn\u2019t taken off yet and I was hoping it would be doing a little bit better.","But make no doubt about it when you're constantly introducing new products that are stable product that everyone knows about used to and it's a revised product, the new product like in the case of this one, they lose focus on it our distribution network does. So it becomes a little bit harder, but we still think it has potential is the answer, but I'm disappointed that it isn\u2019t doing a little bit better.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is David [inaudible] on behalf of Tom. I guess I just wanted to ask a question on this dynamic of the lapse and reissue and just get a sense for the margin or IRR on the new product versus the old. And I know it's sort of was - a bit elevated this quarter at around 30% of the sales, but you mentioned it can be anywhere from 10 to 15 in any given year. So, just wondering how that sort of overall through into results and just the margin in IRR on the new versus old?","Daniel Amos","Both medical and cancer are priced with very similar margins. So while the premium will fluctuate in terms of the nature of the benefits and features of the products, the economic IRR if you will - both the IRR, as well as profit margin is priced in a very similar range. And so this is really less about an economic issue if you will to the company. We\u2019re relatively indifferent. We leave it up to the customer to decide what's in their best interest related to the improved benefits and structure of it.","And so we\u2019re not motivated by necessarily economics and I would keep in mind that those economics can really go both ways depending on the age of the policy and the nature of the policy they can both contribute to GAAP profitability in a particular period, they could also take away from GAAP profitability depending on how recent the product was sold and the nature of the product. So we really don't try to model in if you will that type of activity, it's entirely a consumer driven action and what's in their best interest and we remain agnostic to the dynamic.","Unidentified Analyst","And then I guess shifting gears to - Fred you mentioned or you alluded to earlier on just thinking about capital structure and I think we\u2019d mentioned the RBC ratio in the U.S. But also just looking at the leverage ratio that's pretty low under your 20% to 25% guidance range, just thinking I guess how you guys are thinking about that. And then also just capital in Japan and I guess also just an update on the ESR regime and sort of how the FSA in Japan is thinking about maybe updating the SMR towards a more Solvency II like calculation?","Frederick Crawford","Yes, let me try to do a little bit of discussion on this I certainly welcome either Max or Todd also to weigh in with any thoughts, but I'll give you my overview. Let's take it one at a time. In terms of U.S., I think we\u2019ve covered that very well. I think there is opportunity to potentially do more optimization in the U.S. but that's dependent upon really settling into our U.S. only statutory conditions. But again I think there's opportunity there, but bit more marginal as we\u2019re bringing a lot of that excess capital down to our current plans.","When you go to Japan, we really are in a very nice capital position. SMR is very strong despite actually some widening of spreads and of course some rising interest rates particularly in the U.S. but also here just over last few days more modest increase in rates in Japan would be [OSHA] activities or comments. And so we remain in a very good SMR position.","I think in Japan the issue tends to revolve around what amount of our FSA earnings - first of all what's the trend in FSA earnings. As I mentioned it's improving because of the economic shift in our business and then what amount of those FSA earnings in any given year do we feel comfortable with moving out and into the holding company structure for deployment. And we\u2019ll develop that more in terms of dialogue at FAB.","But right now we have a policy of 80% of FSA earnings. We moved back into the U.S., that's under the basic notion that we need to retain 20% of those earnings to support the overall growth rate and in other reinvestment activities in our Japan franchise. But what we found is that, with the runoff of first sector and the run-up in third sector, we continue to produce increasing FSA earnings and can do more with that capital over time.","So, we'll discuss more about that, but that's really the optimization issue there. When you then come to the - to answer your question on ESR, ESR - first of all, our ESR, when you incorporate an ultimate forward rate adjustment, it's still running at around north of 225%. And when rates in Japan rise a little bit, that improves from there. I would estimate - is that about right Todd you can weigh in?","Todd Daniels","Yes, that's about right. Current internal models says about 225%.","Frederick Crawford","And the ultimate forward rate - my memory is that may have around 60 point or so impact to that that level. Is that about right?","Todd Daniels","Yes, that's about right.","Frederick Crawford","So, it gives you an idea. But the punch line is with or without a UFR, that's an extraordinarily strong ESR, particularly as it relates to other peer companies in the industry. And that's because we're so dominated by third sector, which is a better dynamic to have under that type of solvency.","In terms of where we are with adoption, I believe we're still in field testing, and I think it's still little unclear. But Todd, or anybody in Japan, if you've got any color on that, please provide it?","Todd Daniels","Yes, the FSA kicked off another round of field testing this summer, which will be targeted to complete by the end of the year. And as far as adoption of going to an economic solvency regime, I do believe there's not going to be any movement until around 2025. The FSA is following what the IAIS is doing in their modeling and guidance. So we still have some time with SMR and further development of our SMR framework.","Frederick Crawford","In terms of leverage, yes, we're running low, but remember we got kind of a booster on lowering leverage when we adjusted the deferred tax liability with tax reform, that added around $1.9 billion to our equity capitalization and that really lowered us a bit on leverage.","And so, it's not been a proactive de-levering activity on our part. It's been more of the effects of accounting adjustments related to tax reform. Now having said that, our leverage is low and our coverage is very strong, given, we borrow roughly 3.4 billion of our 5 billion in borrowings in yen.","So, we have room. I like to be somewhat tactical, if you will, in leverage capacity for opportunities and allows for absorption, should there be any other items, although we don't foresee anything.","So, we'll be looking at leverage optimization and what we may do there. I think I put that into the overall holding company, capital structure dynamic. And as we've talked about here now a couple of times, including this quarter, we're looking for ways to optimize our hedge costs in Japan through setting up mere trades at the holding company, and that serves to lower our net exposure to a weakening yen over time.","So we think there's some real economic benefits both from an earnings standpoint and risk reduction standpoint to better optimizing or utilizing the FX capital that we have at the holding company.","So, that's a bit of a flyby. Max, I don't know if there's anything you want to add from your perspective.","Max Broden","Just to add a little bit of color. So overall our business has a low risk profile, and we have a liability structure that is very stable and low risk as well. So you combine that with a relatively low leverage range that we are operating within, and you quickly realize that we do have significant debt capacity and we could go to a higher leverage level.","At the same time, in the post conversion phase that we are in right now, we continue to travel and want to travel with relatively low leverage and high capital. So I will put it this way, that we do have significant debt capacity but it has to be for good return projects.","We will not lever up just for the sake of it, but as we find very good projects to invest in, we do have very significant debt capacity.","Operator","Thank you.

Joining me this morning from the U.S. are Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President, Global Chief Investment Officer and President of Aflac Global Investments; Todd Daniels, Executive Vice President, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary.","Joining us from Tokyo are Charles Lake, President of Aflac International and Chairman of Aflac Japan; Masatoshi Koide, President and COO of Aflac Japan and Koji Ariyoshi, Executive Vice President and Director of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they\u2019re prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.","The earnings release is available on the investors\u2019 page of aflac.com and also includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures.","Now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Then Teresa will give an update on the U.S. followed by Koide-san who will cover Aflac Japan operations. Fred will follow with comments about our 2018 financial outlook and capital management. Dan?","Dan Amos","Thank you, David. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let me kick the morning of by saying 2017 was another great year for Aflac. One competitive advantage we held for more than six decades is our straight product focus on voluntary insurance in the United States. And third sector products in Japan. That focused success apart from every other competitor and it has been a major contributor our success. I believe, we will continue to drive our leading position as we look ahead.","I\u2019m especially pleased that our 2017 operating earnings per share growth before currency came in at the high end of the upwardly revised guidance. I think this is especially noteworthy given our disciplined approach to investments in the United States and Japan platforms where the goal of driving future growth and operating effectiveness. On the subject of investing in our business, we are pleased that the U.S. Tax Reform enacted in December of 2017 allowed us to increase and accelerate our investments in initiatives that reflect our company\u2019s values and objectives.","As we communicated, we expect to increase the overall investments in the U.S. by approximately $250 million over the next three to five years. These strategic investments target continued growth in the Company\u2019s U.S. operation, investing in technology and digital businesses, training programs and expanding employee benefits. These expanded employee benefits, which include both an enhanced 401(NYSE:K) matching program and additional company paid out like policies underscore our company\u2019s culture and the very nature of what we do as business, help protect persons financial wealth and well-being.","You will hear from Teresa and Koide-san today in greater detail about the two operating segments, Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan. But let me make a few brief comments on our sales performance in both segments. Our U.S. sales results came in at the top end of the three to five long terms guidance that we\u2019ve given.","Sales were fueled by solid performance both in our traditional channel and our broker platform that we\u2019re building on. Performance was strong across the majority of the sales territories and we are on track to drive similar results in 2018 with the increase building as the year goes on.","In Japan, we ended the year just above 4% growth in the third sector, coming off a very challenging 2016 comparison. As I mentioned during the outlook call, we expect third sector sales to be down in the first half of the year. This is especially true for the first quarter, recognizing that we introduced our refreshed core medical product in the first quarter of 2017, driving our sales increase up 7.6%.","As we prepare for Japan\u2019s conversion and delayed product introductions until the second quarter, we believe the third sector sales could be down in the high single digits in the first quarter of the year. However, we expect a strong recovery in sales as the year proceeds consistent with our December outlook call guidance.","I\u2019ll just take a moment to reiterate that the conversion of Aflac Japan to a subsidiary is on track to take place as early as April 2, 2018, the first business day of fiscal year for Japan. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the results for 2017. I\u2019m so proud of the hard work and accomplishments of our management team, our employees and distribution in Japan and the United States as they work hard every day to help protect our policyholders.","I believe our business segments are well positioned to achieve the performance goals communicated on our December outlook call. Turning to capital management and deployment. Fred will provide more details shortly, but I\u2019d like to touch on the dividend announcement. I know the importance you place on capital deployment and financial soundness.","We have been and will continue to be very disciplined in evaluating capital deployment, within a sound risk framework. We view our primary capital deployment options as dividend, share repurchase and enhancing organic growth. It goes without saying that we treasure our 35-year of dividend growth. I\u2019m pleased that the Board decided to increase the dividends by more than 15% effective the first quarter of 2018. This after our traditional increase in the fourth quarter.","While the Board reserves the right to look at the dividend on a quarterly basis, we plan to shift to the dividend increase to the first quarter of our review cycle. While cash reforms drives an increase level of earnings in cash flow, our dividend reset primarily driven by the overall capital position outlook for stable earnings growth and the balance approach to returning capital back to shareholders. In fact, this is not the first time we\u2019ve had significant increases in the dividend.","As recently as 2006, 2008, and again in 2011, we announced double-digit increases in our new quarterly dividend, in each case driven by financial strength in our business. We will continue to strive that right balance of investing in growth and repurchasing stock and continuing our long record of dividend growth.","Before I hand it over to Teresa, I want to take a moment to reiterate that when the false allegations were made recently by a very small groups of independent contractors in the United States, we were responded in a very transparent manner that represents our way of doing business. We posted over 70 page full report from a special litigation committee of our board, consisting entirely of independent directors and we committed to conducting all our operations in the same transparent manner.","I also want to take a moment to say that we have a robust internal audit function and our compliance function reports to the office of the General Counsel with direct regular communications to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Long ago, we created a special investigation unit, an anonymous ethics hotline available to all stakeholders and manned by independent third-party service. We take all of this very seriously.","When appropriate, we bring an outside independent support to investigate the incidences of compliance we receive, regardless of where they may come from or their motivation. We take swift, corrective action when needed and we look forward to fighting any false statements made about the company to the fullest extent in the court of law. That said, I want you to know that our intention, our attention remains on executing our strategy for delivering value to our policyholders and our shareholders and we are confident that we will achieve our objectives as discussed on our December outlook call.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Teresa, who will provide you an update on Aflac U.S. Teresa?","Teresa White","Thank you, Dan. I\u2019m pleased with Aflac U.S. sales results both for the quarter and the year. Not only were Aflac U.S. sales for 2017 up, but we also generated the best year of new annualized premium sales since 2007. We also had the best fourth quarter in company history. On top of that, I\u2019m pleased with the strong overall growth of the broker distribution and the improved growth in our career sales distribution.","Coming off 2016, I talked about improving sales in four areas in 2017; career agent sales, more specifically veteran engagement, new associate conversion to producers, the middle market broker sales and then Public Sector. From a career agent standpoint, we saw improvement in productivity from both veteran and new agents for the year and both groups outperformed the prior year and our expectation.","Our success with veteran agents benefited from our investments in tools and solutions to better equip them to service their customers. Our success with new agents meant working to cultivate more productive Aflac sales associates who stay with Aflac longer. I continue to believe that small case market is a growing opportunity for Aflac because our career agents are best positioned within the industry to reach and therefore succeed with these smaller employers.","Broker sales as a whole, continues to represent the growing amount of new sales for Aflac. We increase the amount of our broker sales professionals and onboard them with the expectation of seeing positive results in the second half of the year. While our total broker sales outpaced to the market projections, we still see opportunities for improvement, particularly in the mid-case market, which will be an area of continued focus for us in 2018. Along with the better market coverage, we are also seeing the benefit of technology investments and enhanced value with our large broker clients.","Finally, in the Public Sector, we continue to build out strategies, including customized tools and services for that market, which led to an increase in Public Sector new annualized premium for 2017. These initiatives and along with our focus on executing our strategy generated a 7.6% increase in sales for the quarter and 4.7% increase in sales for 2017. Needless to say, I\u2019m proud and pleased with the efforts of the Aflac U.S. operations. In 2018, we anticipate new annualized premium growth in the range of 3% to 5%, resulting in a 2% to 3% growth in earned premium.","We will continue to focus on growth, efficiency and customer experience. Our platform investments like Everwell and One Day Pay are already paying off in terms of customer experience. From our simple product enrollment process to our strong compliance culture and expedited claims process and every step in between, we are focused on enhancing the ways we deliver on the promise to our policyholders.","We want to their experience to be easy. In fact, in an independent \u2013 recent independent survey from The Bantam Group, we found that 97% of those enrolled in electronically with Aflac, said that process was easy and 94% of claimants say that their claims were processed or paid quickly. We believe these results differentiate and reinforce our strong brand and policyholder\u2019s trust. We\u2019re committed to meeting or exceeding our policyholders expectations at every touch point.","Now let me turn the call over to Koide-san.","Masatoshi Koide","Thank you, Teresa. I will now provide highlights from Aflac Japan\u2019s operations, which had a profitable year in terms of pretax earnings. From a product standpoint, let me start with the statistics. I\u2019m very happy with Aflac Japan\u2019s strong annual third sector sales increase of 4.1% and especially, with our 2.3% year-over-year earned premium growth. This growth was driven by strong medical sales, particularly from the release of our device medical insurance products in February 2017.","We anticipate that third sector earned premium will continue its steady growth in the 2% to 3% range, reflecting Aflac Japan\u2019s stable sales performance. Cancer insurance sales were essentially flat for the year. This was primarily due to the traditional advanced sales channels focusing on sales of our revised medical insurance product. We saw strong cancer insurance result in our other alliance channels, including Japan Post. I believe we will be able to maintain our sales momentum for third sector as a whole by steadily implementing our product and marketing strategy across our distribution channels.","Looking at the third sector as a whole, we have taken our third sector business from the mid-$60 billion range in 2012 to approximately $87 billion today, and that\u2019s good business. Life reinsurance providers indicate that they see growing opportunities within the third sector, but Aflac Japan remains the hands-down leader with continued growth in new and in-force annualized premium. We have seen growth, particularly at 20,000 post offices that offer Aflac\u2019s products.","Our nationwide model sales office initiative is almost complete. The initiative is aimed at enhancing sales agent productivity and further strengthening selective high market potential agencies. While not expecting to impact the sales in 2018, we will be actively investing in alternative distribution opportunities for future growth.","To touch on first sector products, as you know, Aflac Japan has substantially reduced sales of same type first sector products with our aggressive repricing of interest-sensitive products. Total first sector sales, including interest-sensitive products such as WAYS and self-enrollment were down 59.4% in the quarter, reflecting our actions to limit the sales of those products.","At the same time, we will continue to offer protection-type first sector products to provide our exclusive agency channel with a comprehensive product portfolio to continue growth setting with third sector products. Looking ahead to 2018, sales of third sector products face challenging comparisons, especially in the early part of the year due to the conversion of the Japan branch.","However, we expect to see improvements in the second half of 2018 following the completion of the conversion. And with the help of our third sector product launch, we are planning upon conversion. Finally, regarding the Japan branch conversion to a subsidiary. As Dan mentioned, we are proceeding on schedule, and I believe we\u2019ll be able to transfer business as planned on the first business day of Japan\u2019s fiscal year 2018.","In closing, I\u2019m pleased to say that our initiatives and investments to enhance our operational initiatives are proceeding as planned. I\u2019m also excited about 2018, and confident that Aflac is implementing the nimble, robust product and distribution strategy needed to continue leading the third sector insurance market in Japan.","Now let me turn it over to Fred.","Fred Crawford","Thank you, Koide-san. As Dan noted in his comments, we\u2019re very pleased with our overall financial performance in 2017. Earnings results for both the quarter and the full year exceeded our expectations. For the quarter, operating earnings per share of $1.60 benefited from stronger-than-expected pretax margins both in Japan and in the U.S.","Our reported results were impacted by a modest weakening of the yen as compared to 2016, negatively impacting the quarter by $0.03 a share. Operating earnings per share in a currency neutral basis for the full year came in at $6.91 per share, up 6.3% and at the high end of the increased guidance range communicated on our third quarter call.","Japan branch conversion costs in the quarter and for the full year were $18 million and $42 million, respectively. We expect to come in at the lower end of our $120 million to $130 million original estimate with the bulk of the remaining costs expected in the first half of 2018.","Turning to our Japan segment results, Japan\u2019s benefit ratio, expense ratio and pretax margins were all in line with recent results and our outlook call guidance. We completed our actuarial testing work in Japan during the quarter with no material adjustments to reserves. We did reduce our cancer and medical claim reserve by approximately \u00a53 billion, generally in line with similar adjustments in recent years and driven by continued strong underlying claim strengths.","Investment performance in Japan contributed to our strong results in the quarter with outperformance driven by higher yields on yen investments and lower hedge costs driving favorable dollar program income. The U.S. dollar hedge cost in the quarter was $60 million with full year cost of $228 million, below our original forecast for the year.","As discussed on our December outlook call, we have increased our unhedged U.S. dollar position based on a review of the stressed economic surplus in Japan, thus reducing our notional forward position and associated costs. Our approach to sizing the capacity for unhedged dollar investments seeks to balance the potential long-term currency exposure to the value of our Japan franchise under a weakening yen scenario and prudent management of regulatory capital and earnings volatility that comes with holding unhedged dollar assets.","Our tolerance for unhedged dollar portfolio is first and foremost, guided by the objective to secure the financial strength of Aflac Japan and the funding of yen\u2019s liabilities. Monday, we announced to follow on $75 million equity investment in NXT, a recognized leader in middle market lending, further strengthening a partnership we began about a year ago.","In connection with our strategic investment, we are committed to fund over time a $2 billion portfolio of floating-rate first mortgage loans for institutional quality middle market commercial properties throughout the U.S. To initiate that allocation, we will be purchasing from NXT a portfolio of these loans totaling approximately $1.1 billion. This move accelerates the build of our U.S. dollar floating-rate portfolio in Japan and gives us a strong start to building investment income in 2018.","Turning to U.S. results, our benefit ratio was in line with our guidance and our expense ratio, while elevated in the quarter, came in favorable as compared to the 2016 quarter. This is somewhat consistent with past years and reflects progress on certain strategic initiatives throughout 2017. Overall, our profit margin in the quarter improved over last year driven by revenue growth of 2% on a relatively flat expenses.","With the signing into law of Tax Reform, we announced our intend to invest up to $250 million over the next three to five years in our U.S. platform. As Dan noted in his comments, this commitment includes investments in our employees, philanthropic efforts and growth initiatives. U.S. expense ratios are expected to run modestly above the midpoint of our 34% to 36% outlook call guidance.","Importantly, the pace and nature of additional growth investments have not been finalized and therefore, are not incorporated into our guidance for 2018. In terms of capital, we ended the year in a strong position. Japan solvency margin ratio is estimated in the 1000% range, recognizing we have allocated an additional \u00a560 billion of capital to support our increased unhedged dollar position.","Our U.S. only risk-based capital ratio prior to the impact of tax reform stands at the mid-800% range. We expect a 15% reduction in our ratio or approximately 120 percentage points as a result of tax reform. We will recover this negative impact over a period of three to five years through additional statutory income, assuming that income is fully retained.","We do not expect any disruption to our U.S. excess capital drawdown plans as outlined at our 2017 financial analyst briefing. We ended the year with over $2 billion of liquidity at the holding company, setting aside $1 billion as contingent capital. Overall credit conditions and asset quality remain strong with only a modest level of impairments in the quarter.","I\u2019m pleased to say, we continue to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. Including dividends and share repurchase, we returned approximately $2 billion to our shareholders in 2017. As Dan highlighted in his comments, we have reset our common stock dividend with an increase of 15.6%. The Aflac board approved this move reflecting on our recent performance, current payout ratio and stability of earnings and cash flow as we look forward.","The increase also takes into account the optimal allocation of annual excess capital generation. We have taken a balanced approach with a desire to sustain our 35-year track record of increases and recognizing both our earnings and cash flows are influenced over time by yen\/dollar currency movement. We are maintaining our current range for repurchase of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in 2018.","We remain tactical within the range guided by relative returns and options for our use of excess capital. Before handing the call back to David for Q&A, I\u2019ll comment briefly on the impact of U.S. Tax Reform on our financials. In the quarter, we reduced our deferred tax liability, or DTL, by $1.7 billion. Our DTL was primarily driven by the tax treatment of Japan reserves, Japan deferred acquisition costs and the impact of unrealized investment gains. The result is lower current-period cash taxes and the build of an associated GAAP deferred tax liability.","Given the non-recurring and non-cash nature of the adjustment, we pulled this income item out of our definition of operating earnings. The $1.7 billion represents a best estimate of remeasuring the net liability when applying our new estimated effective tax rate. We are likely to see further adjustments to the liability as we refine our estimates. We included in our press release a revised 2018 outlook for operating earnings per share.","We are assuming an effective tax rate in 2018 of 26.5%. This derived from Japan\u2019s corporate tax rate of 28%, the U.S. rate of 21% and assuming a stable mix of earnings. We estimate operating earnings per share will increase approximately $0.80 a share and have reset our 2018 EPS guidance range accordingly. We estimate annualized capital generation will improve by approximately $250 million a year.","The incremental capital generation in 2018, together with excess capital in the U.S. from our RBC drawdown plans, drives our estimated capital deployment in 2018 to approximately $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion. This assumes markets remain stable throughout the year. Looking ahead to 2018, we are well positioned in terms of core margins and capital strength.","I\u2019ll now hand the call back to David to begin our Q&A session. David?","David Young","Thank you, Fred. [Operator Instructions] We will now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from the line of Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Dally","Great. Thank you, good morning. So we see a news article that came out in January. Regardless of the truth of the allegations has the potential to be somewhat damaging to your brand, so with that in mind, are you seeing any impact on sales or recruiting from that article? Or is it just too early to tell?","Dan Amos","I think it\u2019s too early to tell at this particular point. But as I told you, we expect to achieve our target for the full year and believe that when it\u2019s all said and done, we will be able to handle any of the issues that were brought before us and resolve them in our favor.","Nigel Dally","Great. And so a follow-up on tax reform. Will any of that benefit be passed along to your policyholders through lower prices or any other benefits? Because a market \u2013 smaller market tend to be less price sensitive.","Fred Crawford","Yes, I think you have that right. Obviously, for starters, it goes without saying that our Japan business is unaffected by this since there\u2019s no corporate tax rate change there, and we incorporate corporate tax rates in Japan in our pricing. So it\u2019s really a U.S. issue. And from a U.S. standpoint, you have that right. The nature of our products are such that there\u2019s very little delta, if you will, relative to changes in tax rates as it pertains to pricing and ultimate premium levels in our products. What we will do is what we always do and that is, we\u2019ll certainly monitor the competitive environments and make sure that the value proposition of our policies and the associated premium remains very strong and in practice.","Nigel Dally","Great. Thanks a lot.","David Young","Operator, our next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Good morning. First, I had a question on U.S. sales. It seems like you had decent momentum in the last couple of quarters and some of the initiatives that you\u2019ve had ongoing, like expansion through the broker channel, it seems like they are not fully in the numbers yet or the benefit is not fully in the numbers yet. So it appears like the guidance \u2013 the sales guidance of \u2013 or you could exceed your sales guidance in 2018. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing that makes you believe otherwise? Or is the guidance somewhat conservative?","Teresa White","We believe \u2013 this is Teresa, Jimmy. We do see a tremendous opportunity in the broker market. There are some areas that we believe we can improve over time, specifically in that middle market segment and that\u2019s where our focus will be in 2018. But as to our results, overall, we believe that we will be within that range of 3% to 5%. So we feel good about that range.","Jimmy Bhullar","And is there anything that\u2019s making you concerned about why you expect a slowdown in sales versus where they\u2019ve been in the last couple of quarters?","Teresa White","No. I don\u2019t have any concerns as it relates to any slowdown.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then on the Japan business\u2026","Teresa White","So let me be very clear. In the first quarter, that\u2019s probably our lowest quarter. So we will see a lower first quarter, still positive, but we\u2019re projecting it to be the lowest quarter and then you\u2019ll start seeing a pickup throughout the year.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And on the Japan business, the income support product seem \u2013 sales seem to have stagnated. What\u2019s your view of the ultimate market for that product? And has that changed versus what you might have thought maybe at six months or a year ago?","Masatoshi Koide","[Foreign Language] This is Aflac Japan, Koide. [Foreign Language] Our income support market itself is still in its growing period. So what we are trying to do right now is to really pursue or looking to an effective way to really appeal to our customers. [Foreign Language] As a result, we do believe that it will take some time for the income support to grow significantly. [Foreign Language] However, just to let you know that in the second half of 2017, our growth of this product was higher than that of the first half of 2017.","[Foreign Language] And particularly, in our agency channel, there are some agencies that have taken this product as their routine sales and so that has taken root in their sales activities. [Foreign Language] And so as a result, what we will do is to make an effort in long term to really strengthen the sales and promotion of this product. And particularly, in 2018, we will try our best in trying to promote this product, so that the product recognition will increase among our customers.","[Foreign Language] For example, those people who are concerned about one not being able to work at some point and have concerns about paying off their housing loans. [Foreign Language] And we also would like to cross sell this product together with medical product. [Foreign Language] But as always, we are not just particularly focused on the income support product, we will try to balance out our third sector products and push forward with all products.","[Foreign Language] That\u2019s it from me.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. First question. So Fred, $250 million increase in annual capital generation from tax reform. Should that be pretty constant or do you see that changing over time? Is there any meaningful delta on that or is that \u2013 should that be pretty constant based on how your earnings will change?","Fred Crawford","Yes, it should be pretty constant, Tom, the way we look at it. We don\u2019t have any \u2013 I know that for \u2013 to those companies that have concentrated businesses in the U.S., there\u2019s certain dynamics related to the treatment of both DAC and reserves that came out of tax reform that creates more timing dynamics related to the pace of cash taxes versus reported tax rates. We don\u2019t have that dynamic. And so we would expect this type of steady run rate improvement cap, provided, of course, tax rates remain the same both in the U.S. and Japan as they\u2019re currently stated.","Unfortunately, while we are impacted in the U.S. business from tax reform just like any other insurance company, because we have relatively lite reserve-type business, there\u2019s not a tremendous amount of reserve buildup related to the types of products we do as compared to other capital-intensive products. We want to kick quite as much by tax timing-related issues that come through the tax plan, so it\u2019s a pretty steady number.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then by follow-up. Dan, just in terms of these legal allegations. After you conducted your review, which sounds like you had some outside people involved in that, was there anything that you found that you ended up changing business practices? Or anything else that was an outcome of that review?","Dan Amos","They\u2019re not through, we have one more report that is to come out that we haven\u2019t seen yet. And it should be out very shortly. We said, before the end of February. But in the first report, I think we were \u2013 it spoke for itself in terms of what we\u2019re doing. But let me be clear, we\u2019re always looking to see if there\u2019s a better way to regulate things and to make sure we\u2019re following all the guidelines that are set forth. And so we\u2019re constantly adjusting to do those things.","But we\u2019re trying to do the right things, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that as we move forward and feel like. We\u2019ve had that hotline to where they can call directly, it circumvents management. It goes to the General Counsel\u2019s office. From there, it goes to the Audit Committee. So there\u2019s a way of information that if there\u2019s any real issues to where it can\u2019t be bought by anybody. And that\u2019s what we want to make sure of is, is that we\u2019re open-ended and that we\u2019re transparent and we\u2019re trying to make sure we run this company in the most ethical manner possible.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott","A question on Japan, I guess. After the branch conversion and some of these new products are coming out, are \u2013 is there more pricing pressure? Like, could you talk about, like, how much of the need to adjust the products is pricing versus structural? And what you\u2019d expect for the benefit ratio impact kind of thinking out over the next couple of years?","FredCrawford","I\u2019ll start this, this Fred. My general comment is that the competitive landscape in Japan has for quite a while been very competitive, it remains competitive, and we expect it to be competitive going forward. And so as a result, in order to maintain margins, we have to be very proactive in the development and refreshing of our products just to stay competitive and continue the growth rates. But this competitive landscape and sensitivities around that, pressures, if you will, related to competitive landscape, that\u2019s been around this company and our Japan franchise for many years, and we\u2019ve been able to navigate that and maintain our margins.","Alex Scott","And then in the U.S., the investment that you are looking at, can you provide any kind of details around specific areas? And how much upside that, that could provide to the long-term growth rate for premiums?","Fred Crawford","Yes. I think you\u2019re referencing the announcement we made over the holidays and our commitment to invest up to $250 million in the U.S. over three to five years. Well, as part of that investment is an investment in our employees through issues such as 401(k) matching and offering up our products to our employees, fully subsidized and then also philanthropic efforts. We had a significant effort at Aflac to fight childhood cancer and that\u2019s a major initiative for the company, it has been for a while. We\u2019re setting up all of our activities around that. If you look at the $250 million over three to five years, around 20% to 30% of that number is that commitment, the commitment to employees, philanthropic and benefits.","The remainder is very opportunistic in nature, but really represents an acceleration of what we would anticipate in doing over the long run. And tax reform allowed us to accelerate some of our plans with confidence and capital to make those commitments. They\u2019re going to revolve largely around digital advancement, technology advancement, in some cases, distribution, including alternative distribution. And what\u2019s very important is, they\u2019ve not been crystallized or identified, both timing and amount could also realize the nature of the investment will matter a lot in terms of guidance. For example, a number of the investments we would contemplate would be capitalized, some would take place at the holding company level, some would take place in the U.S. entity affecting ratios. So as those crystallize, we\u2019ll certainly give guidance accordingly. But that\u2019s our intent.","Operator","The next question comes from Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Thank you. At the FAB Meeting, you laid out a plan to deploy, I think, it was $5.75 billion to $6.5 billion of capital for 2017 to 2019. It\u2019s based on the dividend increase you announced and the improvement acceleration. I mean, does this change how you are thinking about that total amount of capital deployment?","Fred Crawford","The only change in that total amount of capital deployment is we do have one rate additional capital that would come in vis-a-vis the tax reform. And so I noted in my prepared remarks what that impact is to 2018. But over a three-year period, you would expect that to accumulate. We stepped back on the totality of the quality of our cash flow and capital and then looking at relative uses of capital, and that really was the foundation of making the move on the dividend. It has the effect of allocating approximately $100 million a year towards the dividend. And this was something we had been looking at for quite a while as we looked at our payout ratio relative to peers, but then also the relative value of using our excess capital. What\u2019s the best and highest use of using excess capital. And the dividend really started to shine in recent years as an area where we had opportunity to lift that.","So we\u2019ve made that move. Otherwise, we\u2019re sticking with our general repurchase guidance, including allocations to repurchase over that time frame. And so, therefore, what solves for the added capital and cash flow is more opportunistic investment. And again, as Teresa has outlined and Koide-San has outlined, in Japan, we think we have opportunities to invest in growth initiatives around technology, digital, distribution expansion, et cetera, and that\u2019s where we would look to dedicate some of the excess capital.","Erik Bass","Thank you. And then it\u2019s the follow-up on Alex\u2019s question. I mean, if you think longer term, do you see the investments in the U.S., including the incremental $250 million but plus what that you had \u2013 have already been doing, do you see that as potentially enabling you to accelerate sales and earned premium growth above the ranges you\u2019re targeting near term? Are these investments more that are needed to just keep pace with the industry?","Fred Crawford","Well, I imagine at the end of the day, they\u2019re going to fall into a mix of both. Because certainly, if you look at the rest of the industry, investments are being made along these lines. So you absolutely do need to keep pace. But we\u2019ve got a great foundation here at Aflac, a strong brand, significant distribution reach, scale in what we do. And so we touch 440,000 small businesses, we employee 50 million people, 8 million of which currently have our policies. And so when we talk about investing in growth, digital technology, et cetera, it\u2019s to drive greater penetration and greater growth. And you would expect that to yield benefits in earned premium, annualized premium, client accounts, policies in force, et cetera, but that would be the intent of these investments. I would say, productivity and efficiency are also playing into it.","Erik Bass","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Barnidge of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is now open.","John Barnidge","Thank you. In Aflac U.S., the average weekly producers, when was it that high either on a quarterly basis or in the annual basis?","Teresa White","When was it that high? I\u2019m not sure I understand the question. This is Teresa.","John Barnidge","It was 176.183 on Page 18 of the supplement and it doesn\u2019t seem like on an annual basis there it was that high previously.","Teresa White","Yes. I think what you\u2019re referring to is the productivity. And certainly, from a productivity standpoint, that\u2019s really been our focus. We have not seen productivity that high probably since 2007 or so, but I\u2019d have to go back and look at those numbers. But our focus has been on productivity and training, development, driving producers or working with producers to become productive agents. So I\u2019m not surprised that where we are, I\u2019m excited about that pipeline.","John Barnidge","And then with tax reform, does that change how you think may be your earnings mix between the U.S. and Japan? And do you seem inclined to maybe grow the U.S. component a bit more either organically or through M&A into new products or channels?","Dan Amos","Tax reform in and of itself is not necessarily influencing where we invest our dollars. Something I would remind you of is that remember, we remain a U.S. taxpayer on the entirety of our earnings, because our \u2013 Japan is a branch for tax purposes. So despite having converted it or planning to convert here in April to a subsidiary, we remain a branch for tax purposes. So we\u2019re a U.S. taxpayer on all of our earnings. Obviously, we have the dynamic where the corporate tax rate is higher in Japan. But that\u2019s not necessarily skewing our desire to make investments, we generate strong profitability in both regions. And so it\u2019s attracting capital accordingly.","John Barnidge","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Krueger","Good morning. On Japan, I guess, first would you expect to make the product revisions in April shortly after the conversion? And then secondly, are you planning to have refreshed products for both cancer and medical?","Dan Amos","Koide, can you answer that?","Masatoshi Koide","[Foreign Language] This is Koide-San from Aflac Japan. [Foreign Language] And since our new product has not been formally announced, therefore, I would like to refrain from really announcing the details here. [Foreign Language] But what I can say is that, we will be injecting a product that really reflects the recent medical treatments and to cover that \u2013 offer coverage that supports that. [Foreign Language] And to align with the timing of our conversion or incorporation in Japan, we are planning to launch a very, very strong product.","[Foreign Language] That\u2019s it from me.","Dan Amos","I want to just remind you that have not been on this call very often that that\u2019s a requirement of the Financial Services Agency that we not discuss the actual approval date of product. They do not want us to do that. So we\u2019re following their guidance. So just to make sure, it\u2019s not us. We\u2019d be glad to tell you, but we\u2019re following that. But you can kind of figure it out with what we did last and what we\u2019re doing now and it kind of adds up for you if you look at it.","Ryan Krueger","And then, Fred, just after the increase in book value from the DTL change, does that increase your view of debt capacity with the debt to capital ratio now below 20%?","Fred Crawford","Yes, it\u2019s a fair question. I\u2019m not at the moment reacting or overreacting to the one-time noncash DTL reduction to run out necessarily redial leverage over time. Our leverage is largely dictated by understanding the dynamics of cash flow and the quality of cash flows. When you are able to, for example, make a move on the dividend the way we have, that\u2019s in part because we have a relatively lite level of interest expense, and so we can make those kinds of decisions as to what the highest and best use of excess capital is. So there are no plans to pump up leverage. I would also remind you that we look at leverage in two different ways.","We look at the leverage on a recorded ex-AOCI basis, which is where you see it dropping down below 20%, which is in fact below our 20% to 25% stated policy. But we also look at leverage when you incorporate the unrealized gain and loss from foreign currency translation. Now that\u2019s a part of AC \u2013 AOCI that is at times not a small number and we try to look at our leverage with that as well. Why? Because that\u2019s economic in nature in the sense that even though it\u2019s unrealized, over time it may become realized because it\u2019s related to the currency impact to the value of our Japan franchise.","And so we look at it in both ways. And with that currency adjustment, leverage is up around 21% in change, still low, but we look at it both ways. So \u2013 and I should also add the rating agencies do as well. So right now, no plans. But of course, we are relatively low-levered. We have a very high coverage ratio on interest expense and that allows us to be opportunistic in deploying capital such as a nice dividend increase.","Ryan Krueger","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Sean Dargan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Sean Dargan","Thank you and good morning. I have a question for Fred around RBC and tax reform. So the 120 point RBC hit, that\u2019s inclusive of everything, not just the DTL \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the DTA?","Fred Crawford","That\u2019s right. It\u2019s \u2013 it has a DTA impact. And then the way I think of it is, there\u2019s a numerator impact and a denominator impact. And so there\u2019s also the loss of certain favorable tax treatment in the required capital, if you will, or denominator. And so it incorporates both of those elements.","Sean Dargan","Okay. And then about your comment to rebuild that over time, have you had conversations with the rating agencies and kind of sounded out how they\u2019re thinking about that? Are they going to give you some compensation?","Fred Crawford","Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 I might also add a little more color too. I mentioned that we recover the RBC over three to five years, that is based on an estimate right now of additional statutory income of around $85 million a year. This would when \u2013 this would be when you consolidate all of our statutory and legal entities in the U.S. And so that\u2019s what I mean by starting to gain back the RBC. To your question, is there going to be a \"reset of RBC\"? I\u2019ll tell you exactly what I\u2019ve told my team here internally and even our Audit Committee, and that is, I\u2019ve never really held my breath on the rating agencies coming out and saying, hey, last year\u2019s 500% is this year\u2019s 400%. I sort of go with the plan that we\u2019re going to be held to the same standards irrespective of these adjustments. If it plays out differently and if it becomes a reset, if you will, relative to these types of events, then so be it. But I think, right now, we are sticking with our plan targeting 500% RBC over the next few years, has no impact on our drawdown plan of excess capital. And if we find ways in which we can optimize in the future, we\u2019ll do that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Just wanted to start with the U.S. and the group sales, which have been late. Give a sense of what percentage of those sales represent new customers, new Aflac versus conversions? ","Teresa White","So let me first speak to \u2013 and I think what you\u2019re referring to is movement from business from individual to group. ","Dan Amos","Do you want re-enrollments and accounts?","Teresa White","New groups.","Dan Amos","New accounts? What are you kind of asking to make sure we\u2019re on the same page?","Suneet Kamath","A customer that had been on the individual side or paid, that\u2019s no longer sold through the individual agent, but is now are sold through Aflac?","Teresa White","So it\u2019s very, very small amount, less than 1%. So it\u2019s a very small amount, may be about 1%. 1%. ","Dan Amos","Let me say one thing. We believe that the individual policy is in the best interest of the customer. A lot of our people do, because they can take it with them when they leave.","Teresa White","I think what\u2019s more important is the group and individual, they are totally separate companies, right? And the employer makes a decision as to whether they want to offer a group policy or an individual policy to their employees. Now if there\u2019s an individual employee that has \u2013 there\u2019s a person who has an individual policy and their employer decides to go to a group policy, just by normal course, we give the individual the choice as to whether they want to keep their individual policy or move to group. So I guess, that from that standpoint, does the activity happen sometimes, but it\u2019s a very small amount of activity of transferring people from individual to group. And the choice is basically made from the employer\u2019s standpoint. And then the choice of whether the individual, as Dan said, it\u2019s an individually issued product, it is their product, it\u2019s underwritten differently. So those can \u2013 they can make the decision as to whether they want to keep that product. I hope that helps.","Dan Amos","The real driver though is that the business that we\u2019ve been writing on an individual basis are generally small accounts.","Teresa White","That\u2019s correct.","Dan Amos","And when we got into the group business, it\u2019s predominantly large accounts that is driven by brokers or driven by brokers working with our associates. So that\u2019s a major difference as you look at this. So there\u2019s not as much overlap because of that. So that\u2019s why that number is relatively low.","Teresa White","That\u2019s correct.","Dan Amos","And one reason for that just to explain it to you is the employer wants to make sure that these large accounts when it goes across state lines, that everyone has the same policy and they had that under that arrangement. In the case of individual policies, it\u2019s where it written. So they \u2013 within an account you could add different. So take, for example, here in Columbus, where Alabama is across the line, if it was an individual policy then the people in Alabama that are being \u2013 really would have a different policy from Georgia people. And most employers and human resources people don\u2019t like that, so that\u2019s why these larger accounts tend to be that way.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, that\u2019s fine. I mean maybe just one quick one for Fred on the RBC. Just wanted to make sure I understand, I know that you had said you\u2019re going to draw that down to around 500% by 2019. But I think that there was the thought that maybe after 2019, even when we have more, given the low-risk business model of Aflac U.S. Just want to be clear, does the impact of tax reform, which is going to knock that RBC down a little bit, does that impact your ability to draw that down beyond 2019?","Dan Amos","It doesn\u2019t really change my views in the sense of being able to run our business at a lower RBC than, say, more capital-intensive businesses. And so, right now, my assumption is that we continue to manage to a 500% RBC through the retention of ongoing earnings, while drawing down the excess capital. If, however, we\u2019re able to work with the rating agencies, and of course, upon assessment of our own risk management parameters, bring that down, we\u2019ll look to do that and optimize. But right now, that\u2019s not the game plan right now, we are sticking with the plan of 500%. Once we settle into blue book settle into the pace of statutory earnings, communicate more proactively on a U.S. only basis, that should offer us opportunity to optimize over time. But this is a year of transition. And as I\u2019ve mentioned to you before, it\u2019s been 40 years since we\u2019ve had a U.S.- only blue book. And so once we get into those numbers and be able to communicate properly and make a case for the very low risk profile of the business and the ability to bring that RBC maybe more efficiently.","Teresa White","Operator, I think we have pass the top of the hour. Is time to conclude our call.","Dan Amos","Thank you for joining us today. That concludes our call. If you have any questions please feel free to contact our Investor and Rating Agency Relations department. And we look forward to speaking with you soon.","Operator","Thank you.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Robin Wilkey","Thank you and good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Joining me this morning in the U.S. is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO; Teresa White, President of Aflac US; and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also joining us today from Tokyo are Paul Amos, President of Aflac and Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac, Japan.","Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of Federal Securities laws. Although, we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate, because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discussed today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments on the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and in the United States. Dan?","Dan Amos","Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. Sales of Aflac Japan's third sector products were up 21.3% in the quarter. This result established a strong start toward our expectation to third sector sales with average and increase of 15% for the first nine months of the year.","Sales of cancer insurance continued to be extremely strong following the introduction of the end of the third quarter the new cancer days products, which includes an exclusive policy sold for Japan Post. Following an outstanding fourth quarter 2014, reception of this product, cancer insurance sales in the first quarter generated a 118% increase through all distribution channels and outlooks.","Our distribution side, our strategic alliance with Japan Post continues to be enormously beneficial. This alliance leverages Japan's Post position as the largest distribution network in Japan with Aflac Japan status is a leading industry and pioneer of cancer insurance.","Our tremendous progress continues add more than 10,000 postal outlooks offering our cancer insurance to their customers. I believe this alliance will continue to benefit both companies as the opportunities and purchase cancer insurance is extended to more and more Japanese consumers.","At the same time, our traditional agencies had been and remain key to our success. Our goal is to have a presence for our consumers want to make their insurance decisions and our various distribution outlooks broadened for that reach.","Now let me turn to the U.S. operation. As I mentioned here in the fourth quarter conference call we expected the first quarter sales would be challenging. As we communicated the expense ratio increased during the quarter primarily reflecting the expenses related to the changes we made to our sales organization over the last several months.","We believe these changes which were implemented to enhance our sales growth are better positioning Aflac U.S. for the future. At the same time, we just started something no one in the industry is ever attempted, no less done and that is the one day pay. The industry first initiated means that we process, approve and pay in just one day. We are delivering on our promise to our policyholders in a more meaningful way of getting cash in their hands faster than ever, faster than anyone in fact.","We estimate that 70% of our policyholders can use one day pay for their clients. In 2015 we expect to process nearly 2 million claims within the parameters of this initiative. One day pay is generated a lot of excitement with their distribution channels or accounts in our policyholders. Along with the strong brand and relevant products, I believe one day pay will continue to help Aflac standout.","As I mentioned last quarter, I'm not willing to say that Aflac U.S. sales have turned the corner until we see the results for the first half of the year. At the same time, I remain encouraged by the progress that we've seen and continue to see.","I still believe that Aflac U.S. sales will increase 3% to 7% for the year. We'll continue to advance our efforts toward expanding our distribution to access employers of all size. Doing so will allow us more opportunities to leverage our brand and have attractive products in the portfolio in an ever-changing health care environment.","Having covered operations let me turn to the topic that I know are top of mind with our shareholders and that is capital deployment. Our commitment to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders puts us in an excellent position to repatriate about \u00a5200 billion to the United States for the calendar year 2015.","This reinforces our plan to repurchase 1.3 billion of our common stock in 2015 and puts us in a good position for the next year as well. I want to reiterate that our objective for 2015 remains to increase operating earnings per diluted share 2% to 7% before the effect of currency.","Challenging financial markets and a very low interest rate make it difficult to invest cash flows at attractive yields. Therefore we will continue to be very disciplined in selling per sector products in Japan which will reduce investable cash flows.","As always, we are working very hard to achieve our earnings per share objectives while also delivering on our promise to our policyholders. I am pleased with Aflac's position in Japan and the United States, the two largest insurance markets in the world.","Aflac has earned a distinction of being the best branded company for voluntary and supplemental products in each country. We continue to believe Japan and the United States each are characteristic that make them extremely well suited for the products that we offer.","Importantly both markets offer opportunities for growth. We are fortunate that in the process of growing our business we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide.","Now I will turn the program back over to Robin. Robin?","Robin Wilkey","Thank you, Dan. And now in the interest of time, we are going to start taking calls. Could I have the first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Binner","Good morning, thank you. I would like to try and get some more color on reinsurance deal. Those announced in the quarter is part of your capital management plan. I guess first, just to understand how this may have differed from the previous two deals in regard to subject matter risk that's covered, if it's with a different reinsurance partner. And you noted that there is a recapture almost immediately. So, can we take that last piece to mean that this is less expensive than the previous two deals?","Kriss Cloninger","This is Kriss Cloninger, I will handle that. The substance of the reinsurance agreement was materially the same as the two previous transactions we did they involve blocks of our enforced medical insurance that had demonstrated financial characteristics in the like.","It was done with a different reinsurer. The previous agreements had been done with the Swiss re, this was done with Munich. We had been talking with several reinsurance partners and we wanted to expand our track record of business relationships and so we did that.","The retrocession was similar in substance to the previous retrocession we did and the second tranche was Swiss re but it was a higher amount. It was 90% of the block in the set of 50% that we did in the second deal. Accordingly, there will be a lower net cost to Aflac on a consolidated basis than there was in the previous transaction.","Randy Binner","Just two follow-ups, one, we can think of it economically the \u00a5430 billion has been kind of freed up, I just want to clarify that. And also if you can give us color of how many more of these transactions we can expect? Our view is been that there is a lot of capacity for a series of transaction that free up more of the capital reserve differential between Japan and the U.S but would like to understand how many more of these are house systematic these maybe?","Kriss Cloninger","Well let me first say that, we do have additional capacity. We are always primarily interested in making sure there are policyholders in Japan are protected it at a very higher level freeing up some of the FSA basis reserve allows us to increase our solvency margin in Japan as a first step that gives us more security that we will able to perform with response to our policyholder obligations.","We do have significant capacity remaining. I believe and we haven't gotten a specific plan. We don't have a specific plan for additional transactions but I think that we will talk about that in some more depth in our upcoming financial analyst briefing in May when we talk about sources and uses of capital.","I think you can anticipate that there will be more transactions each. We have been taking this as one step at a time, the very first transaction we did we did to increase the SMR to reduce the exposure we had to volatility and interest rates and currency in the like. The second one we did to achieve the same objective to reduce cost and then the first retrocession deal.","And this third one has essentially the same objectives in the initial transaction that are to further reduce cost through the reinsurance of the retrocession. So, I think we will give you more color at FAB in May.","Randy Binner","All right, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Nigel Daily of Morgan Stanly.","Nigel Daily","Great, thanks, and good morning. Sticking with capital, given the sizeable repatriation seems like you could easily do more buybacks in the current guidance. First question, what's holding you back from increasing your buyback guidance?","Dan Amos","Doing the additional reinsurance deal does increase our financial flexibility going forward and as I said, we will talk more about our capital uses plan at FAB meeting. I think it is just fair to say Nigel and response to that we do have more flexibility but at this point we are early in the year. We had a target for repurchase in 2015 of a 1.3 billion.","We are going to stick with that things are still bit early and so we will give you more color on that in May.","Nigel Daily","And then just a follow-up on the reinsurance transaction. You mentioned it to be low in net cost given the higher retrocession. Can you quantify what that net cost will be?","Dan Amos","In terms of cents per share it has to - ","Ken Janke","Nigel, this is Ken. With tranches 1 and 2, we were looking at an annual run rate about $0.07 per share that would be reduced by about 10 years so from the retrocession of half of tranche 2. Given the size of the retrocession with tranche 3 with the most recent transaction, we don\u2019t look at it as materially impacting the net cost of the program in the short run.","So, when you think about an EPS drag for instance, for calendar '15, it's still going to be maybe in that $0.05 to $0.06 per share for the first three tranches, for the full year of this year, so total marginal net comps for the transaction.","Nigel Daily","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Jimmy Bullar of JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bullar","Hi, first had question on your EPS guidance, so I\u2019m little surprised that you left the guidance unchanged at 2% to 7%, since you are going to have the $0.07 reduction in your interest expense.","I\u2019m wondering if that this year and then obviously next year that should be around 10%, so I\u2019m wondering if that is part of your guidance and if it isn\u2019t, is there anything else that you see as a potential headwind that would offset the benefit of that and then secondly on Japan sales, even if sales sustain at sort of the recent level that they\u2019ve been, it seems like your guidance at least through the first three quarters of the year for the 15% increase, is somewhat conservative.","So just wondering why sales wouldn\u2019t sustain, they\u2019re right now, like I\u2019d assume that you would probably get more production from the Japan post as you keep adding additional granted.","Dan Amos","Jimmy, let me start with the EPS guidance and to address that and then will address the Japan sales guidance. We gave you a pretty wide range; I consider 2% to 7% increase in EPS on a currency neutral basis to be a fairly wide range. ","We do wide ranges because we know that some things are going to go well, some things aren\u2019t going to go quite as well and we\u2019re always working at activities that will move us up in the range.","So clearly taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem those high interest expense senior notes $850 million of senior notes that had a 8.5% coupon, will benefit us going forward.","That wasn\u2019t directly reflected in the original EPS guidance but again it\u2019s too early in the year to say that we\u2019re going to narrow the range at this point that we initially established.","Clearly that particular transaction will increase our certainty that will be able to perform within that range and certainly it adds to our ability to perform more strongly than we originally anticipated but that\u2019s as far as I am willing to go at the moment. Now let\u2019s turn to Ken.","Ken Janke","Let Yamauchi or Paul take that.","Dan Amos","On the Japan sales guidance, okay.","Paul Amos","This is Paul I\u2019ll start and if Yamauchi wants to add additional comment, I will let him do so, First of all, you\u2019re correct that we\u2019ve had strong sales in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year and we feel that the markets desire for our new cancer plant has been extremely strong. ","And as we noted in the previous call, we are expecting the first three quarters of this year to be strong with a 15% growth over those three quarters.","At this point we\u2019re not changing that number if we see sales continue to go extremely strong to the end of the second quarter we will at the time talk about any kind of revision but given the size of the fourth quarter of 2014 and hurtle that is to overcome, I\u2019m hesitant yet to talk about any changes in annual sales guidance but I have to say overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the sales, not only through Japan post but across the board. ","All of our channels have been extremely receptive, I do however believe there are many things we are doing to continue to increase our long-term sales, anytime we announced new product announcements things of that nature.","There can be an adverse impact to short term sales in a 13 week period and so as we move further into the year, there are things that may not necessarily cause us to perform at the same optimum level we\u2019re performing at today. But we\u2019ll still achieve excellent results and so we\u2019re very excited about where it\u2019s going to go forward from here. Anything you want to add? That is good, I think we are good.","Jimmy Bullar","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Seth Weiss, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss","Hi, good morning. Thank you. If I could ask another question on the capital and proceeds results released from the reinsurance transaction, so the reinsurance deals releases JPY130 billion so, call it JPY80 billion to JPY90 billion after tax, you increase your repatriation plan by JPY30 billion to JPY50 billion, so can you help us think about the plan for that remaining JPY40 billion that gets released from the reinsurance deal that will suppose we stay in the Japan entity?","Dan Amos","And I don\u2019t know, Ken you want to add any color on that, we did this additional reinsurance transaction, we increase the anticipated repatriation some that\u2019s it\u2019s not really one for one deal but, it\u2019s directionally proactive in equivalent.","We reevaluated the whole scenario as far as repatriation in the like in the JPY200 billion is our best estimate and what\u2019s provided for in our FSA financials as of March 31, 2015.","So that is the color I\u2019m able to provide, in a portion of it said its provisioned for potentially future type profit transfers and the portion would support the current SMR that we have in Japan, so we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility.","Seth Weiss","Okay, great. Thanks. And on the earnings side I understand there is very little net impact just for the case of our models, is there should we think about a transferring of earnings from the Japan entity to the U.S. entity and if you could give us any quantification of that that would be helpful. ","Dan Amos","Well, that\u2019s what the repatriation is the JPY200 billion as a transfer from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S. within the insurance entity then question remains how much of that would be dividend to the parent. But the JPY200 billion is the transfer from Japan to the U.S.","Seth Weiss","And so, I made have been unclear, I mean on the earnings standpoint thinking about the retrocession specifically which I believe goes to the CAIC entity in\u2026","Dan Amos","Right. Okay. Well I earlier commented that there is very little marginal effect on EPS of this transaction because it was 90% retroceded in terms of the cost, we do report the full cost in the Aflac Japan segment and the benefit of the retrocession will come through in our financial reporting identified in the so called other segment, we didn\u2019t included in the Aflac U.S. segment because it wasn\u2019t really an Aflac U.S. transaction but the net cost through corporate will be reflected in the consolidated financials. I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m totally answering your question but.","Seth Weiss","Yes, it just comes to try to look at Aflac Japan in a year-over-year basis, apples-to-apples so thinking about how much earnings maybe loss there in transferring into other, just we can get better view of underlying growth in that entity if you want to strip out earnings which is essentially being transferred to other. Thanks.","Robin Wilkey","This is Robin, let me just say especially for those may not have reviewed the statistical supplement and detail, we made two major changes to the statistical supplement and one of them is on page 21, we broke out the impact on both premium and on benefits for premiums, gross versus premium seeded and we went back from the first tranche.","So that you will be able to see trend on this and it should help you model on a go forward basis, so we did extend the information that we\u2019re giving you on that and so if you have to look at that will be glad to talk you through that also following the call if you would like to.","The second thing I would mention while we\u2019re added, the second change we\u2019ve made in the statistical supplement and as you\u2019re all know we make it in the first quarter of the year, so that we do not have any partial year anomalies occur, we enhanced what we think is the reporting of the persistency modeling in the U.S. it now includes CAIC and additionally it is on a rolling 12 month basis versus taking each quarter to-date in annualizing that number.","So we found and talking some analyst that was a better understood metric and it caused us to eliminate be able to eliminate some of those anomalies especially as you annualized first quarter which really didn\u2019t give you much of an idea of the trend in persistency.","I apologize, I want to make it statement on page, yes it was 22 where you can find that break out of that seeded and then 21 on the seeded in gross premium.","Dan Amos","And I don\u2019t have the net profit impact directly in front of me but as our call and I\u2019m going to talking to my internal team here is the net effect on Japan P&L was approximately $5 million for the quarter and try to add about $5 million for the three transactions combined and as I said that will okay that will show up in the Japan segment as gross number and then the retrocession effect will show up in the other segment but the impact on consolidated P&L ought to be probably less than a $1 million for that third transaction, third tranche. ","Seth Weiss","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Eric Bass of Citigroup.","Eric Bass","Good morning. Thank you, just can you talk about the trends in U.S. recruiting in the incentives you put in place try to increase the agent force, I guess the given the changes that you made on the middle of last year and the increase commission payments and the little surprise that recruiting hasn\u2019t accelerated in recent quarters?","Teresa White","This is Teresa, so I will answer that. First let me explain the recruited agent metric, the metric includes though career agent recruits as well as broker recruits, so as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we did expect disruption in the number as we started consolidation of that broker organization and we redirected a lot of their efforts at least in the short term to focus on existing broker relationship.","So we did really good job at recruiting brokers but what we wanted to do was enhanced relationships and obviously helped to increase penetration with regard to Aflac business.","So even with this results are not acceptable, we know that we have to have a marked improvement in the long-term but it\u2019s important to know that the changes that we\u2019ve made is that are really driving the operation to one side of the operation to look at career recruiting and the other side of the operation to focus on broker recruiting and developing of those relationships.","Eric Bass","Got it. And I guess how do you think about the sales growth pattern for the U.S. and given the I guess relatively flat producing agent levels on kind of the traditional channels do you expect to see material growth from that channel over the next quarter or most of kind of the year-over-year growth come in the fourth quarter, when you see the higher group sales?","Teresa White","So as we start increasing the volume of group product, we do anticipate that more of the sales skewed toward the fourth quarter and that\u2019s just kind of a natural progression as you increase your sales and with brokers in the group markets.","So we do see a skew towards the fourth quarter with sales growth.","Eric Bass","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Steven Schwartz, Raymond James & Associates.","Steven Schwartz","Hi, the couple questions Teresa just to follow-up on that and anything you can say with regards to progress with the alphabet brokerages would be appreciated?","Teresa White","Certainly we are seeing progress with many of the large brokerage houses and matter fact, they\u2019re moving in our top, they\u2019re in our top five now and before as far as production, sales production and before we couldn\u2019t say that.","We were seeing marginal improvements but now they\u2019ve moved in our top five as far as sales growth, so we are seeing tremendous improvement there, obviously we continue to work with each of those brokers houses and we\u2019ve now created an organization, I think that will help us to further enhance relationships in those brokerage houses as well as other relationships with regard to regional and large scale brokers.","Dan Amos","And let me say one thing. Because the number is so big, our general, our associates are agents that work for us on writing accounts of hundred or less. We must maintain continued stability there.","We do have growth there and so this has been an evolution as we are going through this process of trying to add on brokers while protecting and building our existing field force and that\u2019s been a real challenge for us.","But it\u2019s under Teresa\u2019s leadership it is doing very well and I\u2019m very encouraged about that and I think long-term these decisions that we\u2019ve made have been the right ones.","I will make one comment about recruiting and that is that we\u2019ve made so many changes from a production perspective that there is a lot going on and so all of it is tying together. I like the one day pay. I like that we have set it up in a way that these people are important market directors will do very well as the company does very well and they won\u2019t if we don\u2019t. ","So, I think it\u2019s all working nicely together and as I said in my comments, I\u2019m not willing to declare victory but it\u2019s certainly going the direction.","I would like it to go faster as Teresa would but it\u2019s still moving in the right directions of what we ultimately want to accomplish. I did find it interesting with all the changes, we make that we did not lose any market directors and so there is probably a few that will change out that if they don\u2019t as well, they won\u2019t make as much and they may retire or whatever.","So there is still some changes probably to take place but all in all, I think we\u2019re going down the path that it\u2019s going to prove that it\u2019s working the right way. It\u2019s just a question of how fast it\u2019s working.","Steven Schwartz","Yeah. And as a follow up part of what I think I heard you say at least at the beginning when you started talking. You didn\u2019t say in so many words but that try and keep the career agents in a sense where they belong at smaller accounts under 100 people is continuing and is working.","Dan Amos","Yeah. We\u2019re paying more to write there. So it\u2019s been an enhancement of moving them in that direction but paying because that\u2019s where they are most effective. And it is also the least area of competition.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. And then just an accounting question. I don\u2019t know Kriss if you know this answer or not but given the retrocession back to the U.S. is there any increase in the deferred profit liability?","Dan Amos","You\u2019re talking GAAP, not statutory.","Steven Schwartz","Yes I am talking about GAAP.","Dan Amos","Okay.","Steven Schwartz","Or is it any 10% I guess there is a difference.","Dan Amos","Well, the retrocession would be proportion of the direct transaction. And we do use on a well on a GAAP basis, it\u2019s we use deferred profit liability to minimize any profit recognition effect. So - ","Steven Schwartz","So it would be right in Japan? I guess","Dan Amos","Yes in Japan.","Steven Schwartz","But not in other, okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Wanted to ask Eric a question in terms of the new money yield in Japan. It was only 1.1% this quarter. I think the plan for the year is two. Can you comment on why it looks like you pretty much just invested in [indiscernible] quarter.","Is that just a timing issue? And then second question related to that for Kriss and I appreciate that first sector sales fell lot, but there is still north of 20% of your Japan sales for the quarter at terms of ways in endowment.","Are you actually making a profit for those products earning 1.1%?","Eric Kirsch","Thanks Tom. This is Eric and I will go first and thanks for asking that question because I know it sticks out a little bit but the short answer and the simple answer is our cash flows for the first quarter were insignificant and that was primarily in all plans for because as you know we have increased the frequency of repatriation, we had tax payments, so the amount of money we had to invest was inconsequential and not reflective at all of our strategic asset allocation.","We do expect in the second quarter our cash flows to be relatively low as well but in the second half of the year they will pick up and our new money yields at that point will reflect the types of investments new starts making whether those be in dollars or other products but for the first quarter it was just simply and inconsequential amount of new money.","Tom Gallagher","And Eric when you say inconsequential would that be less than 10% of the money you expect to invest in the year is it a way you could quantify?","Eric Kirsch","Yes actually it was about 4.5%, 5% of the total new money for the whole year. So it really is back ended in the second half of the year.","Tom Gallagher","Got it.","Dan Amos","And Tom on your question about profitability of first sector business [indiscernible] ways we are still writing. Those are profitable at the anticipated annual investment yield of about 2% recall that reserving was reduced to 1% FSA in first assumption and we reprice the products with networks assumptions of around 1.25%.","So we still we would have a positive spread in our anticipated yield for the year if we looked at first quarter only of 1.1% now it is pretty marginal.","There are sources of province other than interest spread but for the quarter itself the closer to break even and profitable in that first sector business but keep in mind we\u2019re writing the first sector business primarily is in accommodation to keep distribution alive and maintain relationships primarily with the banks.","So to some extent first sector business today is in the accommodation and we do have caps on total production to try to mitigate the lower anticipated profit opportunities at these low interest rates.","Tom Gallagher","Yes, Paul Amos, do you want to make any comments about that?","Paul Amos","I would be glad to our exclusive agencies have continued to be obviously dedicated to Aflac and all of its products. As a result we continue to allow those exclusive agencies to offer not only our third sector products but in order to be competitive in the marketplace, they do still offer certain levels of our first sector products.","In terms of the other channels as Kriss mentioned we are holding back and putting in caps for certain areas in certain channels in terms of the total sales. I think this meets our objectives, we obviously talk about caps on an annual basis and so we continue to look at them and how that will be affected throughout the remainder of the year as the sales reach those caps.","Tom Gallagher","Got it. And then that's all helpful guys, just one final question if I could the - ","Paul Amos","I would have Hiroshi Yamauchi very quickly here.","Hiroshi Yamauchi","[Foreign Language]","Robin Wilkey","So basically what Paul has said is absolutely correct and for agencies to be selling the first sector product - ","Paul Amos","We can\u2019t hear you?","Dan Amos","It is not clear.","Paul Amos","It is not clear, do it the way you are just talking.","Robin Wilkey","As Paul had mentioned the third sector product revenue by our agency and in order for them to do so the first sector product entity is - we are capping the first sector and for our customers that is needed in order for to retain the customers that is selling to be purchasing the third sector product.","Paul Amos","But all of that are in our numbers that we with our earnings per share guidance that we have given, all of that is taken into account and there is nothing there that we are shocked about going forward.","Tom Gallagher","That is clear, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets.","Eric Berg","Thanks very much. My first question is for Dan or for Kriss, well I certainly understand value appreciate what you are doing on the capital accounts side of things with the reinsurance and repatriation and so forth and related share repurchase, I can have noticed in your business in Japan on a constant currency basis is reporting lower earnings, your profits are down this year on a constant currency basis and then right it is not the Yen, my question is when you expect to start seeing the earnings, not the earnings per share but the earnings of your business in Japan growing and relatively, what would you view at this point in history of the company as the sustainable growth rate if you consider the long term sustainable growth rate of your Japan business?","Kriss Cloninger","This is Kriss. I will take the first shot at that and if Dan wants to supplement, he can. First regarding first quarter Japan operating results we were down little bit on the currency neutral basis. We had better well lower benefit ratios last year in the first quarter than we had this year but that was primarily due to the order of magnitude of claim reserve adjustments.","Last year we had a some release of claim reserves to get us down to the high end of the range that our auditors like to see in last year we had a larger release than we have this year. We did have some release this year but again we maintain conservative claim reserves I believe and we try to be within the range that auditors independently recalculate in.","So we just have it is really more difficult comparison so to speak earnings first quarter of 2015 versus 2014, overall I would say that we have the headwinds primarily of low interest rates somewhat at lower cash flows in the like impacting our operating earnings in Japan in keep in mind our margins in Japan are the highest in the industry and we really don\u2019t anticipate that they will increase significantly.","We have got bit of a mix shift going own sale between first and third sector and even though first sector sales are down relative to where they had been as previously pointed out, there is still significant and we are still having a larger proportion of our overall premium income associated with first sector products as the business continues to earn out on the premium thing basis.","Long term growth rates Eric the way outlook added is it at least related to third sector business, the medical and cancer, I will relate our fundamental business to the level of healthcare expenditures in the country and in Japan we anticipate the level of healthcare expenditures will continue to increase independent statistics have numbers in the 5% range in our fundamental business in the third sector is to help our policyholders meet their share of the healthcare cost that they have to bear in Japan.","Right now under the National Healthcare Program the co-payments are 30% we think those will either remain stable or increase going forward and that might increase our opportunity to further our medical sales. Regarding first sector sales it is going to depend on the trend in interest rates.","Right now the profit margin is lower than what we want to have in our portfolio, so we are de-emphasizing the production of first sector business.","Dan Amos","In fact we what we try to make sure of it is they sell a first sector they have to sell the third sector as well and pretty much what I would say Kriss covered especially when it comes to third sector because that is really the way I view our business.","The first sector is nothing but an introduction of selling ultimately third sector products and I would like to see a growth rate of 5% in new sales, it gets tougher as the number gets bigger but that is a goal that certainly worthy of us continuing to strive for and no one has got the distribution system we have and so we are always looking for new products and ways to do that. And if we are right now working on another new product which we can\u2019t talk about but we are doing, we will constantly be revamping and then the wildcard as Kriss said is whether or not the co-pay as deductibles go up.","I don\u2019t have any reason to think they are tomorrow other than if you look at the issues they are having regarding their budgets, they are continuing to have problems and they have got to find a way to bring down their deficits and with an aging population could there is a much higher likelihood that it is going to continue to go up not down, so I would think there will be more pressure on reviewing and seeing if they want to increase the co-pays and deductibles and if they do that that is a game changer for us.","Kriss Cloninger","One thing Eric you know little advertisement for the FAB meeting I do talk about anticipated margins between first and third sector during FAB speech as you can refer back to our FAB booklet for what our forecast for 2014 to 2016 as far as benefit ratio as expense ratios and profit margins separately for our first and third sector business.","And I will update those in May, so I can just tell you right now there is no major change in our margins that we anticipate so that is a bit of a preview but it says lot of our future growth will be related to revenue growth not margin expansion.","Eric Berg","One quick follow up then I will end it there. I have a question too about the reinsurance. I tend to think of the so to speak the cost of reinsurance in a co-insurance you like this one as the amount of premium I mean amount of assets that you have to see invested assets that you have to see to the reinsure in order to be relieved of a certain amount of risk?","So I guess my question in order to are you really reducing the cost of the reinsurance or more accurately are you just ensuring significantly less than would be the case if you weren\u2019t retroceding the business?","Kriss Cloninger","Well that is a way to look at it, the retrocession reduces the direct session obviously and so instead of reinsuring 100% of block of business you\u2019ve reinsured 10% of it and accordingly you have 10% of the cost, it is a risk sharing transaction between Aflac Japan and to reinsure and then it is a risk sharing transaction between the reinsurer back to the U.S. subsidiary CISC, that is a legal entity that picks up the retrocession.","So clearly their cost transfers but enough to the overall company you are correct, so let me just tell you that we don\u2019t we haven\u2019t had to do asset transfers in this co insurance, the prospective cash flow on the block of business is such that no asset transfer was done in any of the tranches and we just ceded the liability for future claims and exchange for our share of the gross premium. And there is a net cost associated with it.","Just to review the very first tranche that we did for capital raising purposes in Japan basically we did it, because that was the lowest cost of capital with any alternative we had. And we reduced the cost or reduced the size of the future tranches, the retrocession.","So we are achieving some reserve relief on an FSA basis enhancing our solvency margin, continuing to protect policyholders and the like, but continuing to free up some of or what I sometimes refer to payroll capital so that's an overview.","Eric Berg","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning, thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick follow on the reinsurance. Kriss mentioned that there will be a additional capacity for the reinsurance, but coming on the appetite like in other words all factors we\u2019ll appreciate if you give you more this year as opposed to doing last this year?","Kriss Cloninger","I think I mentioned on the last conference call, I don\u2019t want to do reinsurance just for the sake of doing reinsurance. I want there to be an appropriate use of capital in order to incur the cost regardless of how small the cost maybe. There's still a capital cost associated with doing the deal and unless we\u2019ve got an appropriate use for the reinsurance, we\u2019re not going to have the appetite.","I've covered the uses of capital from the reinsurance we've done so far. We\u2019ve certainly got additional capacity in terms of the blocks of third sector business in Japan. We've certainly got or continue to have an excess of FSA reserves over U.S. statutory reserves on same block and I'm confident that the U.S. statutory reserves were adequate so we believe we've got some opportunity to relieve ourselves as some of the excess reserves.","We\u2019re holding on a FSA basis, but there is no point in doing or reassuring reinsurance arrangement unless you have an appropriate use of capital. And again I'll give you some more color on that in May, I don't want to it on this call.","But we do have significantly more financial flexibility today after having done the reinsurance and particularly at a lower net cost than we had 18 months ago. So, I think we\u2019re in a much stronger and more flexible financial position having done each of these three transactions and proven we could do it we continue to have reinsurance capacity both from the two companies we\u2019ve done business with so far and we\u2019ve got other parties that continue to knock on our door and ask for opportunity. So we\u2019re happy with where we are.","Humphrey Lee","Thank you for the color. And another question on U.S. side of the business. So the expenses were little bit elevated, I think that's impart because of the condensation structures changes and also some other ongoing issue just going on in the US.","How should I think about the kind of excess ratio, the expenses for the quarter that would be considered more for recurring expenses due to the compensation structure change, as oppose to these initiatives going on?","Ken Janke","This is Ken. Let me comment on that, I talked a little bit about that in the fourth quarter when we released our guidance and talked about what went into it. In the first quarter of this year, the added expense from the changes we made to our field for structure was approximately $19.5 million net of capitalization and we expect it to run kind of in the $20 million to $22 million or so, we expected to run around $20 million to $22 million as a run rate for the fourth quarter of this year.","So we're little bit lower than in the first quarter than what we would anticipate it but it was again about $19.5 million of additional fixed expense coming from those changes.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Robin Wilkey","We're coming up to the top of the hour now so we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Yes ma\u2019am. Our last question coming from the line of Suneet Kamath of UBS.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks, good morning. So question on these reinsurance deals. Can you just remind us, does the FSA or U.S. regulators need to approve these transactions?","Ken Janke","We've reviewed the reinsurance transaction with both the FSA and the U.S. regulators. We\u2019ve reviewed both the direct reinsurance agreement and the retrocession agreement with the FSA. Certainly we covered the first tranche with them. With the FSA we approached them, two we approached the FSA with an opportunity to discuss the retrocession arrangement.","And they appropriately observed that Aflac Japan was not a party to the retrocession agreement and wondered why we had brought it to their attention. So we apologized and thanked them for their interest.","We just wanted to make them aware of the transaction, but yes we\u2019ve covered both aspects of the agreement with the FSA and of course we have covered with the state in Nebraska both on all three tranches and South Carolina with respect to the retrocession.","So we\u2019re in good shape on the regulatory relationships and approvals with respect to these transactions.","Dan Amos","Yes, we just want to make sure that we\u2019re not only taking care of the shareholders, but also making sure that we have strong capital position on behalf of the policyholders for Japan. So that\u2019s important to us too. And everyone seems happy at this point.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And my second question is on Japan sales and you\u2019ve talked about on this call and earlier calls sort of the benefit of staying in the first sector area in terms of your ability to sell third sector products.","But have you quantified that, in other words if you decided to significantly scale down even incremental to what you\u2019re doing now for sector sales, how big of an impact do you think that would have on your ability to sell third sector products?","Dan Amos","Well, I'll just answer that for the time running out. I think we're safe for this year. We feel very comfortable with the quotas we set and what will take place. As the year goes on and according to what interest rates do, we\u2019ll have to review it, but we're not going to be selling product at losses.","So, we'll take it on and figure accordingly, but that's a problem for the industry not just for us. If it's affecting us, it's affecting everyone else in the industry.","So, what we've seen in the past is, as interest rates stay down with these lower assumptions, which is ultimately mean rate increase on the premiums. So I would expect if rates continue to stay down, then we probably have right increases on policies going forward and that would help solve part of our problem.","Ken Janke","Let me add one thing and it's not on chattering but I think what will happen is that if the low interest rate environment continues you\u2019ll see a migration way from the asset accumulation element of life insurance contracts or first sector contracts more to the protection element.","There is a need for protection in the first sector products. And I think that that will become a larger part of the first sector products that we sell, the pure insurance elements that are still required by policyholders and we may move more to protection product in first sector, but I think we\u2019ll still do first sector.","And keep in mind that we sold the first sector products for a long time and we really started to see in spikes in first sector sales probably around 2010 when interest rates started moving the way they did and of course we had to respond to the truly low interest rate environment in 2013.","But if you kind of lopped off the spike in our sales, you\u2019ll see that we're about where we were pretty interest rate volatility. So that's about it.","Suneet Kamath","All right. Thank you.","Robin Wilkey","Thank you very much and I will reiterate what Chris said several times that we will be having our Financial Analyst Briefing meeting in May. It will be on May 21, in New York. We hope to see you all there. And please give us a call if we can help you with any of those details and we do have an online registration site.","And we appreciate you listening this morning and be sure to give us a call if we can follow-up with anything. Thank you very much. Bye, bye.","Operator","Thank you. And that conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."],"407":["Aflac, Inc.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question and answer session. Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. You may again.","Robin Y. Wilkey - Senior VP-Investor & Rating Agency Relations","Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter call. Joining me this morning from the U.S. is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also, joining us from Tokyo is Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan; Koji Ariyoshi, Executive Vice President and Director of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws, although we believe these statements are reasonable and we can give no assurances that they will prove to be accurate because they're prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.","Now I'll turn the program over to Dan who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and the year as well as our operations in Japan and the U.S. Following Dan's comments, Fred will follow up with brief comments about our financial performance for the quarter and the year. Dan?","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. As we look back on 2015, Aflac's 60th year of operations, let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2015 concluded another great year for Aflac.","What's been true for these six decades, and what separates us from every other competitor, is our distinct product focus on voluntary and supplemental insurance in both the United States and in Japan. That kind of direct approach has been a major factor in our success and I believe it will continue to propel our leading position in the future.","I'm especially pleased that our operating earnings per share growth, before currency, exceeded our expectations for the year, rising 7.5%. I think this is especially notable given historically low interest rates, market volatility and economic uncertainty in the world.","I couldn't be more proud of the hard work and accomplishments of our management team, employees and sales distribution in Japan and the United States. It is an honor to work alongside our team who are dedicated to enhancing our long-term growth of the company and who represent all that Aflac stands for, The Aflac Way.","Now I'll provide you some highlights related to our Japanese operation, where I believe we set the standard in many ways for other insurance companies in Japan.","We're not only the pioneer and leading provider of cancer insurance, but we're also the number one seller of medical insurance too. This is particularly impressive given our increasing competitive medical market for insurance has become in Japan. But our relevant products, trusted brand and diverse distribution are a powerful combination that's very hard to compete with, and it propelled Aflac to insure one out of four households.","I'm thrilled with Aflac Japan's tremendous annual growth of 13.4% increase in sales for third sector products, which surpassed our original expectation considerably.","Not only were our 2015 results impressive across all channels, but we pointed out in our release last night the third sector sales increase for 2015 is particularly phenomenal because it marked the second highest annual third sector growth in 10 years.","On the product side, it's exciting that sales of our founding cancer insurance were up a tremendous 40.6% for the year. As the pioneer of cancer insurance, this remarkable result underscores the importance of Japanese consumers' place on selecting a brand they know and trust.","Turning to first sector products, the actions taken by the Bank of Japan on Friday resulted in JGB yields decline, as well as additional weakening of the yen to the dollar. As discussed on our December outlook call, we have taken steps to control the sale of first sector products as we enter 2016.","Managing through the low interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. The actions of the Bank of Japan simply reinforce our strategy and we will continue to review potential and further actions as the rate environment plays out. Fred will touch on the financial considerations in his comments.","Looking at our distribution side, our traditional agencies had been and remain vital contributors to our success and this was certainly true throughout 2015. At the same time, I'm pleased with Aflac Japan's significant strides in further developing our alliance with Japan Post throughout the year.","We completed the expansion of the number of post offices and their agents selling their products to more than 20,000 outlets during 2015. With this expansion, we've continued to ramp up our training of Japan Post employees to ensure they have the knowledge and tools to sell Aflac products successfully.","The Catch-22 of tremendous sales results is the difficult comparisons they create. As we indicated, we believe that sales of third sector products in 2016 will be down mid-single digits following another year of outstanding sales in 2015. However, looking further out, we continue to view Aflac Japan's long-term compound annual growth rate as being in the range of 4% to 6%.","Now turning to Aflac U.S., 2015 was a year of building our business through our career and broker distribution channels. We not only enhanced our career sales management infrastructure over the last year and a half, but we also laid the foundation for greater opportunities within the broker market.","As you saw in the earnings release, Aflac U.S. hit an all-time record for the quarter with a premium amount of $497 million in new sales, which equated to a 9.6% increase. I'm especially happy with the fourth quarter given that it followed a 14.1% sales increase in the prior year. Our quarterly results exceeded our expectations and drove our total sales of $1.5 billion, which translates to a 3.7% increase for the year.","Our sales results for 2015 exemplify that we've been communicating; our sales are increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter and we believe this will continue to be the case.","As you all well know, success and opportunity breeds competition. That, combined with a clear need for voluntary products, has resulted in a number of other companies entering the voluntary supplemental insurance market. These have included insurance carriers who sell voluntary insurance as well as companies involved in various aspects of healthcare management. But keep in mind, Aflac's singular focus on supplemental voluntary products has greatly contributed to our dominant position in the work-side insurance market, and I believe will continue to drive our competitive edge.","One Day Pay remains a differentiator for Aflac. We will continue our promotion of One Day Pay to consumers which we believe will help increase brand loyalty and account penetration. Here is an amazing statistic. In 2015, we paid 1.2 million claims. 100% of the eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within one day.","I think we'll pay over 2 million One Day Pay claims in 2016. In the minds of consumers, our already high integrity jumped by 22%, the biggest move ever and we believe it's because of One Day Pay. Paying claims in just one day translates to this statement from consumers: If you're paying it in just one day, you must be a good company and with high integrity. Also, independent research continues to show that there is no doubt American consumers need cash quickly, and paying claims fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition.","Even further differentiating Aflac, I'm also proud that Aflac's contact center has been recognized by J.D. Powers for providing outstanding customer service experience. This recognition is based on successful completion of an audit and exceeding a customer satisfaction benchmark. It is these kinds of initiatives and feedback that demonstrates our commitment to delivering on our promise to our policyholders.","While 2015 was a year of building, we see 2016 as a year of stabilization and growth. We continue to believe that Aflac U.S. annualized premium sales growth in 2016 will be in the range of 3% to 5%.","Turning to capital deployment, Fred will provide more detail shortly, but let me just say that we view growing the cash dividend and purchasing our shares as the most attractive means of deploying capital, particularly in the absence of any compelling alternative. Our plan for 2016 is to repurchase $1.4 billion of our shares and we anticipate concentrating the majority in the first half of the year.","As we indicated last quarter, 2015 was the 33rd consecutive year in which we've increased the cash dividend. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increases in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation.","I'll conclude by reiterating how proud I am of our teams in both the United States and in Japan as they've worked hard to generate our 2015 results. You know I've been in the business for more than 40 years now, and I'm truly excited today more than I've ever been about Aflac's future.","So now, let me turn the program over to Fred for financial results and outlook. Fred?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Dan. You've all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, our fourth quarter and full year results exceeded the high end of our earnings guidance driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan. The only notable item to call out in the quarter was a favorable adjustment to certain retirement benefit liabilities as a result of refining our assumptions. These adjustments impacted our parent company-only results and contributed approximately $13 million pre-tax or $0.02 per share to the quarter's earnings.","Our Japan segment margins came in strong, driven by continued favorable benefit ratios. We had a few adjustments to reserves in the quarter, a result of our year-end actuarial work. These adjustments were largely offsetting and on a net basis contributed modestly to the out-performance in the period.","Our expense ratio came in favorable to our expectations as we are balancing investment with continued focus on expense management.","We would expect both our benefit and expense ratios to normalize within our outlook call guidance range as we move into 2016.","In the U.S., benefit ratios were considerably better than last year's quarter, but fairly consistent with our strong performance throughout 2015 and at the favorable end of our outlook call guidance range. As with Japan, our quarterly and year-end actuarial work resulted in certain reserve adjustments that were largely offsetting.","Our expense ratio in the U.S. was elevated in the quarter. This is not unusual in the fourth quarter and roughly in line with last year's quarter and in part reflects the conscious decision to accelerate certain investments in our platform.","Turning to investments, throughout 2015, we were successful in defending net investment income, recognizing that as higher yielding securities mature, we are investing new money into a low rate environment and need to proceed with caution given market volatility.","As we noted during our outlook call, this dynamic represents a natural headwind to investment income in 2016. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher, long-term returns.","Our capital and liquidity position remains strong. As is typically the case, we have only estimates on SMR and RBC at this time, but expect both to remain strong and consistent with recent periods.","Between dividends and repurchase, we returned just over $400 million to our shareholders in the quarter and achieved our guidance of $1.3 billion in repurchase for the year. Before I turn the call back over to Robin for Q&A, I'd like to comment on recent market volatility, the relevant strength of our financial position and our outlook.","The month of January has certainly been extraordinary with the return of credit and equity market volatility, a continuation of the low rate environments in the U.S. and Japan and a concern over energy and commodity prices and related exposures. In the case of Aflac, recent Bank of Japan actions draw renewed focus on Japan rates and the yen.","I think the following considerations are important and support the investment thesis that Aflac is well positioned to perform in the face of market volatility.","First, our core franchise in Japan and the U.S. supplemental health markets remain strong with natural demographic and economic catalysts driving core underwriting margins and favorable trends. These core franchise growth and earnings drivers are largely unaffected by recent market volatility.","Second, as with the rest of the industry, we are carefully monitoring interest rates. As Dan mentioned in his comments and consistent with Paul's strategic outlook in December, the recent move in Japan rates simply reinforces our strategy to actively manage down the sale of lump sum first sector products, focusing on appropriately priced, level-premium product in support of our high-return, third sector business and our core agency distribution network.","From a financial impact standpoint, we've concluded all of our year-end actuary work, including review and testing of core assumptions and maintain very strong margins across all material blocks of business and have very little liability and balance sheet risk associated with very low, for very long, interest rates.","In terms of investment strategy, we are only in the beginning stages of building our growth asset portfolio, thus we have modest exposure to naturally volatile asset classes. In some cases, we now have an opportunity to enter these asset classes at better valuations.","With historically low JGB yields, the success of the dollar program and expansion into new asset classes, we have naturally lightened our new money allocation to JGB's and that will continue into 2016. In addition, we pre-bought approximately 60% of our JGB budget prior to the BOJ easing announcement of late last week.","In terms of the dollar program, we carefully watch our hedging costs, but have been proactive in modestly extending the duration of our hedge positions to reduce exposure to short-term spikes.","While our long-term view is for hedging costs to rise, we remain comfortably within our tolerances and continue to drive significant value over and above JGB rates.","Finally, in terms of credit exposure, like the rest of our peers, we're carefully monitoring our exposure to energy sector along with metals and mining. We have a $6.6 billion energy portfolio measured at book value that is well diversified and high-quality. Only 7% of the portfolio is below investment grade and effectively all in the BB category.","As of the end of January, our below-investment-grade energy holdings were in an unrealized loss position of only $140 million. As we analyze security-by-security holdings, we do not see acute default risk, but do note that downgrade risk is present and pricing is under significant pressure on select names which could result in accounting-driven impairments as securities trade at deep discount for prolonged periods.","In summary, core margins are expected to remain strong and largely resilient to market volatility. Balance sheet exposures to low-for-long rates in the U.S. and Japan are modest and our general account assets are defensively positioned with limited exposure to naturally volatile asset classes and we are well positioned in terms of our energy and energy-related exposures.","We therefore have made no adjustments to our earnings per share guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 assuming an average exchange rate of roughly 121 yen to the dollar. And capital deployment guidance provided in our December outlook call remains the same.","Based on our capital conditions, earnings and cash flow stability, we are maintaining our repurchase target for 2016 at $1.4 billion. Having repatriated additional excess capital in the fourth quarter, we are front-end loading approximately $1 billion of repurchase in the first half of the year. Our performance in the fourth quarter certainly bodes well for 2016, but it is obviously very early in the year and we will update accordingly.","Thank you and I'll now hand the call back to Robin to begin Q&A. Robin?","Robin Y. Wilkey - Senior VP-Investor & Rating Agency Relations","Thank you, Fred. Before I turn it over to Q&A, I wanted to mention that you will be receiving an e-mail soon regarding our May 25 Financial Analyst Briefing to be held in New York. And again, if you have questions, please give us a call on that. Now we're ready to take your questions. But first, let me remind you that to be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to one initial question and only one follow-up that relates to the initial question. We're now ready to take the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Randy Binner from FBR. You may ask your question.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hi, good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to pick up on Fred's closing comments there on the front loading of the buyback in 2016 that relied on a reinsurance transaction from last year and there were some questions about kind of the outlook for further reinsurance deals on the December call. And it sounded like you were actively looking at different blocks and the market was active there. So, I'd like to get an update on what that outlook looks like because if we're going to continue to have high levels of buyback kind of looking forward in 2017, it seems there needs to be another material reinsurance transaction at some time this year.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So first of all, Randy, just a couple comments. You're correct. So, we repatriated an additional 60 billion yen, as you know, in the fourth quarter, roughly US$500 million. That has built up a liquidity position at the holding company which we're now spending down in the form of front-end loading the repurchase of approximately $1 billion of our $1.4 billion target in 2016. You're also correct to note that over the past few years, we have benefited somewhat from elevated repatriation and cash flow related to these reinsurance transactions.","I would note, however, that we've had a balanced approach to the use of proceeds, if you will, or freed up capital from reinsurance, roughly 40% or so dedicated to shoring up our SMR ratio and protecting the capital strength of our insurance franchise, the remaining 60% then repatriated only after being comfortable with our capital ratios. That is roughly the same type of approach that we would take going forward if we did, in fact, continue to entertain reinsurance transactions.","Right now, we're out there with a long-range guidance of 2015 to 2017 of excess capital of $6.3 billion to $7.5 billion. We remain consistent in that number. The difference between $6.3 billion and $7.5 billion is tied up in excess capital, some of which is in Japan and could be unlocked via reinsurance. Our basic approach to that, Randy, is to be opportunistic and defensive, meaning if there are compelling opportunities to unlock and go through the exercise of unlocking that excess capital for redeployment at higher returns, we'll entertain that. We also don't want to be defensive. As we make our way through market volatility and watch things unfold over the next year or two, we want to be equally careful to recognize that excess capital needs to be held and in some cases to defend the balance sheet.","So, it's a balanced approach. We don't have any reinsurance dialed into our estimates for 2016 as I mentioned on the outlook call, but we'll continue to watch markets unfold and look for opportunities.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So just a couple follow- ups; one is, can you just characterize how good the conversations are with reinsurers? I mean, broadly speaking, the global reinsurance market is overcapitalized, so I'd be interested then to see your characterization of how that's going.","And then, I guess the capital absorption in a downside scenario, is that \u2013 are you thinking in like low \u2013 you're thinking further moves by the BOJ on Japanese interest rates? Is that the main shock you would be looking at, or are you thinking more on the credit side? What would that main concern be there?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, first part of your question, we continue to maintain healthy reinsurance relationships. And in fact, we've even got commitments, if you will, for unfunded reinsurance that allows us the flexibility to pull down reinsurance if necessary for either defensive or offensive moves.","And that's largely a healthy approach because we're talking about health businesses and morbidity risk, which is an attractive type of risk to take in the capital markets these days by reinsurers. And because it's unaffected by capital market volatility, it tends to be something we can count on with reliability. So I'm not at all concerned about the nature of the discussions with reinsurers and our access to reinsurance. The issue is more whether or not it makes sense from a capital strength standpoint or an opportunity standpoint to entertain any of those transactions.","And then in terms of the second part of your question, as I mentioned in my comments, we're very well positioned relative to low-for-long interest rates. And that is not my concern relative to balance sheet. It's an issue relative to watching our earnings trajectory going forward, as I've mentioned, but it's not a balance sheet issue as we have very little relative liabilities exposed to low-for-long rates.","The bigger issue is whether or not we're entering into the early stages of a credit cycle and being careful about that. All eyes are on, of course, the energy market and commodities. But more broadly, we need to be careful about whether or not a mild or moderate credit cycle is in front of us.","And so it's a good time to be careful. I think spreads have widened, which is usually a signal; downgrades are outpacing upgrades modestly right now, even beyond the energy sector.","So, we have to be careful to watch that. But as I said, we're particularly well positioned. And we naturally have a defensive general account because we haven't been as aggressive as many in the industry in terms of entering into more volatile asset classes. We're just starting to begin that.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That's great. Thanks a lot, Fred.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, wanted to ask about the hedge portfolio. Given we've got higher short-term U.S. rates and lower Japan rates, can you discuss the impact that's going to have on your hedge costs? You mentioned it will be going up, but by how much?","Also provide some more details as to what's been done to mitigate those incremental costs. And also just discuss the logic behind putting the hedge cost below the line given that it's really an ongoing expense item.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In terms of the hedge program, maybe I'll ask Eric to make some comments on kind of where we stand relative to the cost structure.","Eric M. Kirsch - Global Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP","Sure. Thanks, Nigel. Well, as everybody knows, we have been expecting hedge costs to go up and in fact, that's the case. About a year or so ago, they were running about 60 basis points, now they're running about 130 basis points to 140 basis points and that's including the actions by the BOJ the other day, which increased the hedge costs around 10 basis points to 15 basis points.","Having said that, we were planning for hedge costs in 2016 to be upwards of 180 basis points, 190 basis points based on where our markets were back in the third quarter, meaning look at what the Fed was going to do for potential rate hikes, this new information from Japan.","And even at that level of 180 basis points to 200 basis points, we still deem our portfolio to be very profitable versus buying a portfolio of JGBs, which is what we measure it against.","And part of that is because new investments on the U.S. dollar program are going in at higher yields and higher spreads. We did take advantage through asset allocation of some of the dislocation in the high yield in the bank loan market, which get us higher yields, and we've continued to see JGB yields go down, so that creates a wider spread.","But importantly, relative to the program, the fact is that monetary policy around the globe continues to be easy, i.e., the Bank of Japan. But the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise four times unless there's really strong economic growth in the U.S. So when you look at things like forward curves, the 180 basis points to 200 basis points that we thought it was going to go to is unlikely to be realized this year. It most likely will continue to be lower.","Nevertheless, we have programs and analysis that looks at this continually and the tools that we have are either find higher-yielding assets, and to Fred's point earlier, as we're starting to explore growth assets, those have higher yields and returns than fixed income, continue to modify the types of hedges we have.","Again, Fred mentioned that we went through the duration of some of our hedges which has helped us to lock in some lower costs. So, those are the parameters we continued to look at to improve the performance of the program, but it's holding up much better than we would have expected and monetary policy is in our favor right now. And, Fred, maybe you want to talk about below the line.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think the decisions around reporting hedge costs below the line were largely predicated on the notion of these costs being highly sensitive to short-term interest rate fluctuations as you pointed out, Nigel, in your comment. So, that sort of mark-to-market, if you will, fluctuations in costs we felt was better depicted below the line. But most importantly, we are transparent in it and have created a line item around it because we realized that in this particular case, we're making a judgment call as to the definition of our operating earnings and you're now free to model it and track how those costs are moving. So that's fundamentally our position as to why we treat it below the line.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. So I just had a question on Japan sales. Just your reasoning for the expected decline in sales, I realize comps were tough in the first half of the year, but I would have assumed that you'd have an ongoing tailwind from greater production through the post office, especially from recently added branches. And also, I think you're adding new products later this year. So just discuss what you think will drive the weakness or the decline in sales in Japan and also maybe give a few more details on the new product initiatives in Japan later this year.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm going to let Paul take that. Paul?","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","Jimmy, let me begin by saying that the 13.4% increase in sales last year creates your first hurdle. You're correct we're up against very difficult comparisons and that's going to persist throughout the year. We do believe that we'll have a strong year, but without a product launch of one of our major core products, that being a complete revitalization of either our cancer or medical plans, we are in a year where we're going to have what we consider to be more moderate product launches and therefore, we believe that the sales comparisons, especially against such a large year, will be difficult.","We have some product launches, smaller in nature that we'll look forward in the first half of the year, and then as I mentioned on the outlook call, we'll be launching a completely new product line that we believe will enhance the second half of the year. That said, as is in the case in Japan, when you do things that are brand-new to the company, they tend to have a much slower adoption rate as well as a much slower rate of usage by different channels as we both negotiate with those channels as well as teach them the process for sales of that product. And so, we expect 2016 to be a year where we are enhancing our products and opening up new potential growth, but we expect the majority of that growth to happen beyond 2016.","Unfortunately, I can't go into the specifics about the products themselves, but we feel very comfortable with our plan and our plan for 2017 and 2018 beyond that.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Jimmy, I want to add one thing. This time last year, where we thought we would be in 2016 is actually going to be there or even a little higher because if you combine the 13% last year, and then the down this year, the combined is still higher than where we thought it would be. We just happen to being able to have enrolled and penetrated the market for Japan Post even faster than we thought we would, and so I think that's part of the reason.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just a follow-up on the previous question on hedging costs and, Fred, your answer makes sense. But I was just wondering how do you \u2013 your hedging costs most recent quarter, I think, were around 8% of your earnings. So how do you think about hedging costs in the context of your earnings power and your ROE as you look at results internally?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the hedging costs obviously factor into what we would call the net yield on our dollar program as compared to investing in other alternatives, JGBs and the like. So those hedging costs factor into our thinking about the relative attractiveness of the dollar program. It also can factor into how much of the dollar investment program we want to leave unhedged at times based on our view of the market.","So, it factors into the investment strategy predominantly. I would also add that those hedging costs also play into even our actuarial testing work, and so we also embed, for example, hedge costs including the rising hedge costs into our long-term cash flow testing and gross premium valuation work. And as I mentioned earlier, we're quite comfortable in terms of margins. So, it does play in. But I think the way we look at it, Jimmy, is more from a net yield perspective. It is really sort of an NII-driven view of those costs as opposed to maybe a conventional operating cost.","Eric M. Kirsch - Global Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP","I might just add, you'll recollect at the last FAB, I put up a chart where we actually showed you the, to Fred's point, the gross performance of the program and the net performance of the program taking out the hedge costs as well as any opportunity costs from settlements, versus a portfolio of JGBs because remember our assets on behalf of Aflac Japan, the liabilities are in yen. So, that's our natural benchmark, and that program has been very, very profitable versus JGBs since inception. And we monitor that on a year-to-date basis, inception to-date basis, a monthly basis to continue to make those relative value decisions between dollars to the dollar program or investing in some other asset classes.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, I think that makes sense that you are \u2013 it's overall beneficial to invest more in dollars and hedges than just buying JGBs. The only point I was trying to make is that it seems like, if that is going to be the case going forward, your operating ROE and operating earnings would overstate the economics of the business to some extent, but that was the point I was trying to make. But thank you for your answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Weiss from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you. Fred, just curious if you could comment a little bit more on U.S. expenses. You mentioned investments and infrastructure. You had mentioned this on the December outlook call. Just curious if any of this is front loading of some of those investments you were planning on making in 2016, and if this at all changes the expense guidance you gave for the U.S. for this coming year?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Seth, just a couple comments. I would not over-read accelerated investment into the expense ratio in the fourth quarter, that there was some acceleration of expenses into the fourth quarter. But as my comments and my prepared remarks, we would expect our expense ratio in 2016 to fall back down within the guidance range that we provided for the year. You had a couple things going on expense-wise. You had some acceleration of expenses. You had some miscellaneous items running through the expense line, which will happen from quarter-to-quarter. It didn't naturally fluctuate.","One other item I would note is that we did have a bit more DAC amortization in the quarter. And in fact we believe this relates also to a modestly improved benefit ratio in the period, and that while lapse rates were not unusually outside our expectation, what lapsed in terms of the mix of business that lapsed, tended to be policies that were carrying higher reserves and higher DAC balances. As a result, it tended to push up a better benefit ratio, if you will, or improve our benefit ratio, I should say, and pushed up our expense ratio a little bit. Estimates, in and around 100 basis points, but I would certainly say approximately, just to give you an idea.","So, on the expense side, we would expect to settle back down into our guidance. I do think you should expect what has been a natural seasonal pattern here at the company that we tend to move through the year well within the ranges, but it's not uncommon for us to see a little bit of an elevated expense ratio in the fourth quarter.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to go back to the BOJ action, and I think we talked about the investment impact. But can we also talk about the potential sales impact? I would think that not only could it impact first sector sales in Japan, but maybe it could also influence competitive pressures in third sector sales as maybe reserve rates come down and competition gravitates into the third sector products? So, we'd just like to hear your view on that.","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","Yeah, be glad, this is Paul, be glad to talk about that. When we think about first sector products, as we've mentioned in the past, we really divide it into two categories. First is a lump sum product, second area is more of the level-premium products. With those lump sum products, we believe that especially given the low interest rate environment, it is not in our best interest to focus on those products. And as a result, we've put strong pressure on those sales. We've put caps in place and we believe that the lump sum will be down as much as 50% or more in 2016.","As it relates to our level-premium products, however, we believe those still are a strong enhancement to our portfolio primarily because of the cross sale that we're getting with our traditional third sector products with cancer and medical, and those products continue to be an overall positive for us. We believe that the sales of those will remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future.","In terms of the BOJ impact to our third sector products, as this point, we don't expect it to have a significant impact. The level of overall competition in third sector products, especially in medical, remains high, but we don't expect there to be any short-term impact to expedite or make that much faster. Hope that answers it.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It does, thank you. And then, my follow-up question is on the Japanese incurred claims ratio, which was, I think, the lowest I've seen in many years. And was hoping to get a little more color on what drove that abnormally low number.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's really predominantly just a continuation of favorable results. As you know, we have been traveling in and around that benefit ratio in Japan of just 60% to 61% for a while here, and so the fourth quarter was modestly favorable.","I would say outside of just trends continue to be generally favorable. I mentioned in my comments that we did have some actuarial adjustments in the period, which are quite normal, frankly, every quarter, but also included some year-end adjustments. On a net basis, that contributed a bit to the positive out-performance. We didn't spike it out in dollar terms or basis point terms because some of these adjustments are quite normal each quarter. But we did benefit a little bit from actuarial adjustments on a net basis.","As a result, I would expect that you should see our benefit ratios in Japan fall back into line with the benefit ratio guidance for 2016 we provided.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Erik Bass from Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Just one follow-up on Japan sales. I think the fourth quarter was the highest quarter for cancer sales in 2015. So can you just provide more details on what drove production this quarter? I guess there's a potential that sales could hold up better than implied in guidance in 2016.","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","Well, I believe that the execution of our cancer sales was really about the leader of our sales force, Koji Ariyoshi, who is here on the call, continuing to guide our sales force in our different channels to continue to sell our product, because of the launch of that product a little over year ago, a year and a quarter ago, has continued to maintain strong momentum. I get the competition, and overall there's a high demand both in our traditional channels as well as through Japan Post.","And so I believe that is a potential positive that we will see continuation; however, the difficult comparisons that you come up against throughout this year do make us believe that there will be a downward trend in the overall sales, but we do believe that the product remains highly demanded and is still the best product in the market today.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And then if I could just ask one on the U.S., can you just talk about where you're seeing the most traction from a sales perspective, and where are the biggest opportunities where you remain underpenetrated?","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","Well, certainly, the broker \u2013 this is Teresa. Certainly, the broker market, it continues to be a market where we have not seen the penetration that we'd like to see, but we are going in the right direction there. The individual, less than 100 case market as well continues to be a great opportunity for Aflac. It's pretty much our bread and butter and we continue to work in that market. But I think that the market growth is in the broker market and that's really how we are developing our strategies and plans.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Is there any way to quantify sort of penetration levels in the broker channel at this point?","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","At this point, what we're doing is we're looking at the current brokers that we have and we're driving penetration with those brokers. We've seen a 27% increase in our top 100 brokers, but right now, I don't have specifics that I can give you as it relates to penetration. Once we gain a little bit more knowledge as to how we want to report that, we'll start reporting in our FAB, in the booklets.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me just say one thing about sales and that is that if you go back in the past, there was a real conflict between the brokers and our individual agents. And we probably are the \u2013 of all the companies out there, with that strong distribution network we've got, they're very important and you can't just forget them. And the thing I liked about sales in 2015 is, we were able to keep our sales numbers for our core agents continue to grow. We had them concentrate more on less-than-100, and we were up about 3%, I think, or 2.5%...","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","Actually, it's 5.3% in the less-than-99.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","A 5.3% increase in the less-than-99 sales and then overall, our individual agents were up about 2.5%. And then our brokers were up \u2013 the difference is broker isn't (45:15) bigger number as of yet. But being able to manipulate or maneuver I should say, is that maneuver in that space to where we can keep our agents happy and the brokers happy has been our challenge.","But we are accomplishing that. And it's slow and tedious because they were competitors at one time. Even though they weren't direct competitors, our agents were always calling on these big accounts even though they weren't landing them, and the brokers didn't like that. Now they're working together as a team and I think with time there's enormous potential for that market to continue to grow.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Excuse me. Good morning, everybody. I guess the question I have for you is can we think a little bit more about the composition of the $497 million of sales that were generated in the U.S. in the fourth quarter? Can you put some color as to how much of that came from the broker channel versus the agent channel? And if you have some sense for what the margin would look like for the broker sold business versus the more traditional sold business?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The profitability.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So on the profitability what I would say, John, is we have not really broken out at this point in time, sort of segmented profitability metrics on group versus individual, broker sold versus agent sold. So I'm not in a position to bust that out for you. What I would tell you is that we certainly priced the product with the notion of meeting our return expectations and obviously, more than and comfortably covering our cost of capital. So the returns are good in our view and priced appropriately. I think we're right in line with competitive pricing in the marketplace. I don't view ourselves as being priced to drive business growth. I think we're doing it the old-fashioned way.","What I would say is because we're in such a growth mode on the group side, we're obviously investing heavier in the group platform to absorb that growth and build for further growth. So because it's been a relatively recent pick up in broker group sales, we are heavily investing in that ways down on a reported, if you will, returns, but over long term, we would expect to achieve returns that are commensurate with what we've achieved individually.","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","And I'll just mention one thing, one of the things that I'd like to make sure that we don't assume is that all brokers write group products. 60% of broker sales were individually written product, is our core individually written product. So just wanted to make that comment.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And let me make one other comment about that. The reason it's skewed that way is not the major brokers. There's two forms of brokers, there's in Columbus a small regional broker that maybe I do buy my property-casualty insurance business from and then there is these massive enormous brokers. And the regional brokers perform more like our sales agents to some degree. And the big brokers, of course, are writing the big accounts and do it totally different. So that's why this skew is more towards 60%, 70%.","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","That's correct.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And I guess I'm trying to understand the seasonality, right? Because you've said for some time that fourth quarter will now be \u2013 or you expect it, anyway, to be the largest production quarter. I guess that has to really mean that we're looking at a much bigger proportion that is broker-sold, whether that's small regional types or the more national players. So as you think about that $497 million, how much of that would you say was broker sold? Is it 75%? Is it 50%? Is it something much bigger?","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","So, when we look at the skewing of business through the fourth quarter, what we saw is that from a traditional side, we did see a small list, and I think that that was primarily based on the Affordable Care Act and the dates that enrollments needed to be in place for the Affordable Care Act, because remember they deal with small case brokers as well.","But we did see a large skew of volume, especially group, as Dan said, the larger brokerage houses basically will do group product. So from a group perspective, we saw 50% of the group business come in the fourth quarter, but 40% came in December. So we saw a huge shift of business, which had not been a shift that we'd had before from an Aflac perspective.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our Risk Officer and Chief Actuary just said that 40% of our business in the fourth quarter came from broker; is that correct? Okay. That's your answer.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's helpful. Thank you. And if I could ask one quick follow-up on the hedged portfolio. I think Eric had mentioned that the cost is running at about 130 basis points to 140 basis points and that's post (51:17). Can you just remind us how big the U.S. dollar portfolio is at this point that we should apply that cost against?","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. The total dollar program is about $21 billion, but the hedges are on about $14 billion to $15 billion of that portfolio. Robin can follow-up with the very specific numbers, but that's approximately right because some of that portfolio we do leave unhedged. It's a hedge against our equity in the branch and about $14 billion-plus is hedged.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One last thing you might want to know. I just got this number from them. It's 33 (51:54) for the year for broker and it's 40 (51:57) for the fourth quarter. So you can figure it's 30 (51:59) for the first three quarters and 40 (52:03) for the fourth quarter.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. I'm wondering, in the U.S. can you dive in a little bit deeper into some of the underlying drivers of the lower benefit ratio, 2015 versus 2014? And then more specifically the even lower benefit ratio in the fourth quarter?","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. A couple of things. One is really just favorable claims experience in general. And so that has been the case for a while. While I think that aspect of it is stabilizing, it's been favorable and remains favorable. The other dynamic that I mentioned is that, in this particular quarter, we also had lapse rates played in, meaning not so much how much lapsed, but the nature of the product that lapsed in the period.","The product tended to carry, on average, higher reserves, and so there was a greater release of reserves, if you will, related to the lapsation. This also, as I mentioned, played into accelerated DAC amortization and weighed on the expense ratio. As we look at the year-over-year trend, as I mentioned earlier, we would approximate the impact of that dynamic to be in and around 100 basis points related to benefit ratio improvements. Again, that's based on the actuarial information we have and analyzing the nature of products that lapsed. So I think that mix of business in lapsation that will go on from quarter-to-quarter. This is not an unusual quarter. The mix of business will be different from time to time. We'll monitor it going forward, but right now, we hold to the benefit ratio guidance that we've provided on the U.S.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Makes sense. And then looking at recruiting in the U.S., it looked like not only was sales growth fairly strong in the fourth quarter, but we also saw some signs of agent recruiting picking up. Can you discuss some of the drivers there in terms of maybe the broader economy or maybe some more Aflac-specific comments?","Paul S. Amos II - President, Global Operations","I think the driver, quite frankly, is the compensation. We basically are paying for performance with regard to U.S. and part of the compensation drive is the recruiting fees. We are seeing that recruiting in many of our markets have been a struggle in the past, but has not been as much of a struggle right now and it's because, quite frankly, we focused on recruiting.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James & Associates. You may ask your question.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just one more follow-up on group sales in the U.S. Teresa, would you happen to know how much the group sales were up year-over-year in the fourth quarter? Maybe that would give us a sense of what's going on with the alphabet houses.","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","Just a second. Let me make sure I get that number from my actuary (55:20). 32% increase in the fourth quarter for group sales.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. On the group sales. And then you said the 20%, so and just to be clear, you mentioned the 27% number. That's total broker sales up or the top 100 broker sales up?","Teresa L. White - President, Aflac U.S.","That is the top 100 broker sales. Absolutely.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. So first question just as a follow-up on these hedging costs, just to make sure I get what the punch line is here. So if we run the 130 basis points, 140 basis point hedge cost assumption through the 2016 P&L, assuming things remain roughly where they are today. Fred, the after-tax difference between operating and net income would be about $200 million. Is that directionally about right, meaning net income would be about $200 million lower than operating?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Boy, Tom, I'd be reluctant to kind of opine to a number at this point in time. I'd have to look at it, to be candid. So we'll take a look at it and maybe take that type of analysis offline. It strikes me that you're trying to reconcile a model to get to the right number to think about and maybe we can work on that internally.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. But conceptually, there's going to be that 140 basis points would be applied to the total portfolio, I believe, because you're going to have to roll the whole hedge program. It's not just the new money that's being invested, right? It's the total dollar portfolio where you're rolling the hedges, is that conceptually the way to think about it?","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the reason I'm hesitating is you've got a portfolio of maturities related to those hedge instruments that range in tenure from short to longer as in 3 months to 18 months. We've been stringing it out, as I mentioned in my comments, which shelters us against sharp swings, if you will, in hedge costs in any given year. So I want to think about that (57:54).","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would add two comments, Tom. First, just to give some specific numbers to the question earlier, the dollar program in total is $21.6 billion. Of that, $14.2 billion is hedged. But it's also relevant to your question that ties into part to Fred's answer. Remember what I said earlier, we now have a portfolio of hedge instruments of different types and we stratify the maturities of those. So when I say hedge costs are 130 basis points to 140 basis points, those are current annualized hedge costs. Our realized hedge costs will most likely over time be lower than the annualized. So to Fred's point to answer your question specifically requires a little bit of putting it down on paper. But also not all of our hedges are forwards. So those hedge costs pertain to forward contracts.","Predominantly, we are in forwards, but we do use collar instruments as well. And collars could have a settlement, but that will be more dependent on the level of the yen where it settles versus how we strike the collars and currently, we have about $1.2 billion or so of collars and the rest are forwards. So it's a little bit more complex to answer your question. But I would say this for today, your $200 million number is overstating it.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So from a full year standpoint it would come in would you say meaningfully lower than the $200 million?","Daniel P. Amos - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It depends on the definition of meaningfully. But I suspect it's a number that's lower than $175 million off the top today.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","(59:33).","Kriss Cloninger III - President","This is Kriss Cloninger. I haven't said anything, but I want to help put this in perspective. We wouldn't have $14 billion of dollar investments if they weren't hedged. And I don't think it's appropriate to say what the hedge costs are without looking at what the additional net investment income associated with the underlying dollar investments are relative to the yen investments. So taking it \u2013 I think conceptually you're probably correct in applying 140 basis points to $14 billion and saying, yeah, that's the annualized hedge costs. But keep in mind we wouldn't have $14 billion of unhedged dollar investments unless we had this hedge program. So I think you've got to consider the net investment income differential between dollar investments and yen investments when you're talking about an economic evaluation of the deal.","Frederick John Crawford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would just, Tom, we were able to do some quick math here. Assuming 130 basis points to 140 basis points, which I think on realized for this year will be lower than that. On an after-tax basis, we are probably looking at about $110 million. And that's probably on the high side because I think our realized hedge costs this year will be lower than the annualized cost where it is now.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, guys. That's helpful.","Robin Y. Wilkey - Senior VP-Investor & Rating Agency Relations","Thank you. We have reached 10 o'clock. So I would like to thank everybody for joining us.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations.","Robin Wilkey - Senior Vice President, Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations","Good morning and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO, Aflac Incorporated and President of Aflac U.S.; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also joining us from Tokyo is Tohru Tonoike who is President and COO of Aflac Japan.","Before we start this morning, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although, we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate, because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those that we discussed today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.","Now, I will turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter. Dan?","Dan Amos - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am very pleased that we met and in many cases exceeded our financial targets for the second quarter. Let me begin today with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. For the quarter, pre-tax operating earnings in yen were up 2% on a reported basis and 0.8% on a currency neutral basis.","Our focus remains on growing the sales of the third sector products, which were up 4.5% for the quarter and in line with our annual sales target. For the six months, third sector sales were up 3.2%. Sales of the first sector products declined 20.3% for the second quarter, which was down somewhat more than we had anticipated. Third sector sales grew sequentially over the first quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in cancer insurance sales from Japan Post. The number of postal outlets selling our cancer insurance rose from 1,500 to 2,980 in March 2014 and has remained at that level as of June 30, 2014.","We were very pleased that at the end of June, Kampo was known as Japan Post Insurance Company received FSA approval to sell Aflac\u2019s cancer insurance. Kampo began selling our cancer product last week through their 79 outlets that employ approximately 1,200 sales agents. Another important aspect of our agreement is the sales education and training support that Kampo provides to post offices selling our products. This support, which includes sales practices in compliance helps expand our reach to agents selling our products.","Looking ahead, we believe this alliance will further strengthen when we rollout the exclusive cancer product for Japan Post. Pending FSA approval, we anticipate introducing this new product later in the year. We remain encouraged with our growing partnership with Japan Post Holding and we believe this alliance will gradually but steadily benefit our cancer insurance sales.","With respect to third sector sales, we have seen the contribution from traditional agencies slowing down and we have developed partnerships with new channels that help offset that decline. These channels include Japan Post and we are making gradual, but steady progress with advancing our sales through the postal outlets. However, the second half of the year will present us with difficult comparisons due to the medical product we introduced in August of last year. Taking these factors into account, we anticipate third sector sales for the full year will trend toward the low end of our expectations of 2% to 7% increase.","Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. In the second quarter Aflac U.S. pretax earnings were up 5.7%. As anticipated our second quarter sales results continued to be challenged declining 8.2%. For the first half of the year, new sales were down 6.4%. You recall at our May Analyst Meeting I told you that I was laser focused on a number of initiatives we are implementing to improve sales. We have spent a lot to time evaluating the market and our business model. We determined our sales model is not at as effective as it was in the past, it needs to be enhanced. As such, we are implementing tactical initiatives centered around better performance, management and competitive compensation and is more closely tied to our cooperate goals. These measures are designed to more effectively link sales management success to Aflac success."," ","First, we are enhancing compensation through an incentive bonus for our districts sales coordinators, the first level of sales management who are primarily responsible for their own personal production and training new sales associates. On July 1 districts sales coordinators began receiving a bonus based on new sales written at small businesses or under hundred. If it proves to be to effective which we expected to be we will use it again next year. We believe it\u2019s vital to ensure all levels of our sales hierarchy had the potential to earn the best compensation in the industry.","Second, we made the decision to eliminate the commission based position of the state sales coordinator. To better manage our state operations, we have introduced the new position of Market Director. Market Directors will be salaried with the opportunity to earn sales related bonuses. We believe this will enhance our performance management and better align their pay with the new business results. This change will be effective on October the first of this year. Further, we think this approach will allow us to more effectively and consistently manage the execution of the U.S. sales strategy over all state operations. This is especially critical given our strong brand, the rapidly changing marketplace and the expanding distribution that includes broker and career agents.","From a sales perspective, changes of this magnitude will be disrupted in the short run and it takes some time to gain traction. These changes are not without cost. We currently estimate that the quarterly costs related to these U.S. sales initiatives will be around $0.02 per diluted share beginning in the fourth quarter 2014. We will finalize 2015 expense estimates for these initiatives in our budgeting process and they will be reflected in the 2015 guidance that we will provide in October with the third quarter earnings release. Given these changes in the sales results in the first half of the year, we now expect 2014 sales to be down 4% to 8%.","Now, I will provide you an update on the consolidated financial performance. Operating earnings per diluted share excluding currency were strong, rising 4.3% for the quarter and 5.4% for the six months. I will remind you that the second half of the year we expect to see increased expenses on various initiatives in both the U.S. and Japan. As such we currently expect that the 2014 operating earnings per diluted share on a currency neutral basis will be up 3% to 4% for the full year. On an operating basis our second quarter annualized ROE was 21.3%. Based on our year-to-date financial results, we expect to meet our annual ROE target of 20% to 25% excluding the impact of currency.","We remain committed to generating strong capital ratios both on the RBC and the SMR on behalf of our policyholders and bondholders. Although, we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that our second quarter 2014 RBC ratio will exceed 800%. Additionally we expect that Aflac Japan\u2019s estimated second quarter SMR will be about 800%. You will recall that at our Analyst Meeting in May we raised our profit repatriation estimate from \u00a5100 billion to \u00a5127 billion. By tomorrow, we will have repatriated \u00a5131.4 billion. As such, we have the utmost confidence in this year\u2019s plan to repurchase $1 billion of our common stock. For the first half of this year, the company purchased more than 515 million of its shares. For six decades, Aflac has been delivering on the promise to be there for the policyholders when they need us most by paying claims fairly and properly. While I am pleased with our financial results, I won\u2019t rest until sales are better reflected in Aflac\u2019s full potential.","So, now, I will turn the program over to Robin. Robin?","Robin Wilkey - Senior Vice President, Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations","Thank you, Dan. I would like to go over some second quarter numbers this morning starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with the currency impact for the quarter, the yen weakened against the dollar 3.3%. In reference to top line in yen terms, revenues as reported were up 0.7% for the quarter. Premium income declined 0.4% in the quarter. Reinsurance lowered premium income by 2%. Excluding the impact of currency, revenues were up 0.4%. Excluding the weaker yen in the quarter on Aflac Japan\u2019s dollar denominated investment income, net investment income rose 5.8%.","In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio to total revenues declined over last year going from 61.5% to 60.6% in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of the weaker yen, the benefit ratio for the quarter would have been 60.8%. Reinsurance had a 50 bps positive impact on the benefit ratio in the quarter. Additionally, the benefit ratio improved in the quarter due to favorable claims experience in our cancer block as well as typical seasonality, which usually increases as the year progresses.","The expense ratio increased in the quarter to 17.7%, up from 17.0% in the second quarter of 2013. The pre-tax profit margin increased during the quarter going from 21.5% to 21.7%. Excluding the impact of the yen, the pre-tax profit margin for the quarter would have been 21.5%. With the expansion in the margin, pre-tax earnings increased 2% in yen terms. And excluding the yen in the quarter, pre-tax earnings would have been 0.8%.","Now, let me turn to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 1.3% in the quarter and persistency was 76.4%, slightly up compared to 76.3% a year ago. And looking at the operating ratios, the benefit ratio for the quarter was 41.1% compared to 49.1% a year ago. The operating expense ratio increased slightly going from 31.4% to 31.6%. Pre-tax operating earnings increased 5.7% in the quarter.","Now, turning to investment activity for the quarter, let me start with Japan, approximately 26% of the new cash flow was invested in JGB at a weighted average of 1.32%. During the quarter, 74% or $1.5 billion of the new cash flow was invested in U.S. securities for a weighted average yield of 3.02%. As a result, total new money yield in Japan for the quarter was 2.58%, up 59 basis points from March 31 and down 44 basis points from a year ago. The portfolio yield was 2.85% at the end of June, down 1 basis point from March and 16 basis points lower than a year ago.","Turning to few other items in the quarter, non-insurance expense was $51 million compared to $48 million a year ago. Parent company and other expenses were $19 million compared to $18 million a year ago. On an operating basis, the corporate tax rate was 34.5% compared to 34.4% last year. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share were $1.66 compared to $1.62 a year ago. The weaker yen decreased operating earnings by $0.03 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen\u2019s impact, operating earnings per diluted share would have increased 4.3%.","Lastly, let me comment on and reiterate some of the statements Dan has already made. We have tightened our range for our 2014 objective and now expect a range of 3% to 4% increase in operating earnings per diluted share. For the third quarter, if the yen averages between 100 to 105 we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.47 per diluted share. Using the same currency assumptions for the remainder of the year, we would expect to report operating EPS of $6.16 to $6.30 per diluted share for 2014.","Now, we are ready to take your questions. But first, let me remind you that to be fair to everyone, limit yourself to one initial question and only one follow-up that relates to the initial question. We will now start with the first question. Carol?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Randy Binner, FBR Capital Markets, your line is open.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","Hi, great. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question kind of higher level about U.S. sales. I appreciate all the commentary on the various initiatives regarding mostly incentives for managers, but other structural changes. But I guess my question as you know, you\u2019re not the only one we\u2019ve seen maybe bumpy sales kind of in your segment of the supplemental health market in U.S. And so is there something going on from a macro perspective from your perspective meaning the economy, how things are changing in certain regions you have or is it Obama care. What is it from a macro perspective that\u2019s maybe causing some of this headwind?","Dan Amos","Well, we spent a lot of time trying to analyze this. And I believe that \u2013 it\u2019s our \u2013 we\u2019ve been doing business basically the same way for 50 years. Our structure is paid absolutely same way and what we\u2019ve always said the founders going back to my dad and others was it the agent does well everybody else up the structure does well. And it\u2019s gotten out of proportion to some degree. And we needed our districts to make more money and we needed to make sure that everyone was aligned to where the company did well the others. And I think that\u2019s our problem and I think we\u2019ve addressed that. I\u2019m not so much worried at this particular time.","I will say that there is still is on certainty with people trying to figure out and there is no one just tearing the numbers up and terms of sales growth in our particular sector, no matter of what. But I think we can do much better and I think focusing them on that will allow that. I\u2019ll just give you an idea. At our state level, one of the problems we have is when a person comes in and was taking over state, they because it was an independent contractor status. They would take home such high expenses that it was hard for some people they ever take that position. Now, we\u2019re going to pay everything and our state sales coordinators will be the highest paid or we\u2019re going to call the market directors now will be the highest paid in the industry. And we don\u2019t have to worry anymore about anyone being able to take on the expenses we\u2019re going to cover that.","And over a three-year period, it should break even for us. But that will make a big difference. It means not only can we hire internally, which is the way we want to do it. But we can hire externally. If there is someone else, we want to talk to we can talk to them whereas before we couldn\u2019t talk to them because there was no way they could take on those expenses that we\u2019re in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. So, I think its position us correctly in the new environment we\u2019re in and I\u2019m very pleased with the attitude of our state people and their willingness to adapt, they get it, they understand that the company has to do well and they have to do well. And I just believe long-term, this is going to be very effective for us and I still believe that market is huge and has great potential. But until everything goes into effect, there is still is uncertainly in the marketplace as people look for it to happen.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","I guess a follow-up there, so your answer is you think it\u2019s tactics and that\u2019s very clear. But then does that mean that do you know whatever this Obamacare distraction has been. Do you feel like are you through the worse of that, kind of people getting more organized and how they approach that and maybe getting closer to make buying decisions?","Dan Amos","Well, everyday it\u2019s in the press about is this going to pass or is that going to pass or can they ask that all long that once you got putting in, it was never going away that they \u2013 you can argue anyway you want, but the idea that it will ever go away, I just don\u2019t think will happen, because you\u2019ve got to get the Republican President or you have got a get \u2013 if you got a Democratic President, you have got to get 60 people on the Senate side. And I just \u2013 that is not something they can \u2013 is likely to happen. So, we will just have to wait and see, but there is still uncertainty and as long as that\u2019s going on, we will have to wait, but I think it is beginning to \u2013 I think the worst is probably over, but there is still a lot of people that are waiting and seeing. Saying that is I am not going to use any of that as an excuse to why we shouldn\u2019t be up and I expect us to be up.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets","Alright, very good. Thank you.","Operator","John Nadel, Sterne Agee, your line is open.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Hi, good morning everybody. Maybe a couple of quick questions. One on Japan and I guess I will phrase it this way, Dan perhaps I am reading too much into the commentary in the press release and you talked about gradual this morning, but not long ago, you talked about the post-relationship and Kampo as a game changer and now it seems you are really tempering expectations there? Now, we are looking at the full year third sector sales being maybe at the lower end of your outlook, but you already knew the back half of the year was going to be a tough comparison. So, I guess if you could help us understand what\u2019s changed there? That would be helpful.","Paul Amos","This is Paul. I will start and then I will let Tohru chime in. Ultimately, we had hoped that the first half of the year will be slightly better than where it is today. And I will let Tohru talk about some of the reasons for that. When we gave you an update at FAB, we have data as late as the month of April that gave us better indications of some things that would have happened in the second quarter that we thought would produce overall better results. We do see Post is improving. Post in the first quarter did not meet expectations, but in the second quarter we saw that moving in the right direction and we believe that will continue. But as Dan stated earlier, the headwinds that we face due to the launch of the medical plan in August of last year will make the second half of the year substantially more difficult to overcome than the first half of the year. Tohru, do you want to chime in on the specifics around the corporate affiliate agencies?","Tohru Tonoike","Yes. For the second quarter, our largest disappointment was the sales by our large corporate affiliate agencies. And particularly, the sales posted employees to our customer companies. So, in April, typically the date had that solicitation to the new employees of our customer companies, which were very good. So, that was \u2013 the result of that kind of affair was in line with our expectations more or less, but in May and in June, when our corporate affiliate agencies tried to solicit existing employees, the sales are less than we had \u2013 they had expected. That\u2019s where the largest disappointment came. In addition to that, we had some disappointment with the sales with independent and individual agents. And that impact is largely offset by the growth of our sales to the large non-exclusive agents \u2013 agencies. So, that\u2019s the reason why that we have lowered our expectation for the year is somewhat changed. And that is quite right that the Japan Post services can be a game changer, but Japan Post in the huge organization so it takes time to realize that entire potential on the channel. So, the sales of the Japan Post, is improving month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, but still it has not quite reached that full potential of the channel. So, I think that\u2019s our situation of the Japan sales.","Dan Amos","John, I want make one more comment about the game changer. It is a game changer. It is a game changer and it was the only outlet that was left they could possibly be major and go against us in cancer insurance. When we mailed that outlet down, that new distribution channel and took it over and now control it. That was a major game changer for us. From a compensation or really production basis, it is going to be a game changer. I believe that, I still believe that and I think the numbers will reflect that as we move forward. These numbers could be larger. Our job is not to predict what we hope it will, but to be conservative. So, I could have given \u2013 we could have given higher number, but I don\u2019t like to ever disappoint. I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019ll say it again, we\u2019re very not very good at projecting sales. Everybody else predicts revenues, but we would like to predict sales, is 13 weeks and it\u2019s the best we know. But there is enormous variance and how they do that. And so I\u2019ll continue to monitor that, but I feel Japan posed as exactly where we wanted to be right now. We were \u2013 I didn\u2019t like first quarter as much, but I do like second quarter and I do like what July is looking like and going forward.","So, I\u2019m very pleased with that. So, let me be clear on the phone if nothing else Japan post is a winner and I\u2019m thrilled with it. In Campo and the rollout of the product is the unknown what will happen there. But they are committed and we are committed and I feel good now the individual are agencies and the corporate agencies are challenged. We\u2019ve seen consumers move away from writing business at the worksite or buying at the worksite, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve done the shops, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing other things, that\u2019s why we\u2019re adding these new channels because we do see consumers move in that direction. That\u2019s our challenge and what we have to find ways, it\u2019s not so many of the new employees, it\u2019s the all employees who have had the mail outs for many times and that thing going on for many years now. And we will continue to monitor that and word toward that.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay. And then I appreciate all those comments and in my follow-up question, it\u2019s sort of unrelated, I\u2019m just curious after you take this \u00a5131 billion back to the U.S. or the remainder of it I suppose. How do we think about the impact on a pro forma basis for your SMR ratio in Japan? How much is that come down and then related to that is just the question back half of the year expenses being higher. Is that simply a matter of timing you were slower to spend in the first half or is there something truly incremental about those expense levels.","Ken Janke","John, this is Ken. Let me start off and Kriss may want to add something to this. First on the SMR, the proper repatriation estimate for the number of 131.4 is fully reflected in the SMR estimates of around 800 that we announced.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Excellent, got it.","Kriss Cloninger","Already reflected in there. As far as the expenses go for Aflac Japan, we\u2019d have expected to see their earnings more front loaded this year in terms of our total forecasting and modeling and part of that is just related to the expected infrastructure expenses that we talked about last year with our third quarter release in our guidance is the head wins for instances. And then clearly, the restructuring of the state position from a mission-based position to a salaried position, which starts in October, is something new, but also would result in higher expenses in the fourth quarter.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay so, it\u2019s \u2013 but aside from that $0.02 in 4Q, the rest of it\u2019s really just the timing.","Kriss Cloninger","Yes, and I\u2019d also point out too that we have benefited in the first half of the year from lower benefit ratios than we had in prior periods. If you look back, you\u2019ll see that generally the second half benefit ratios for both Japan and U.S. are higher than they are in the first half of the year. So, we\u2019d expect them to increase.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Yaron Kinar, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. Ken, going back to your last comments on the expense ramp up in Japan, if I remember correctly the CVEP program was supposed to be about $0.12 of a headwind this year, I think by looking at the G&A in Japan today we see about $0.01 maybe. So, just want to get a better understanding of the ramp up process, are you still expecting those $0.12 to fully materialize this year? And how much of a success that would end up being forfeited this year\u2019s ability to maybe come out with products at a faster pace? I guess I have two questions in here. One, being the expense load and ramp up of the CVEP and two being kind of that impact on the ability to come out with products at a faster clip, which I think was also built into the sales expectation number for this year originally and that, that has since come down slightly?","Dan Amos","Well, I will let Paul address the second part. It\u2019s clearly a shorter speed to \u2013 or shorter time to market or faster speed is something that we want to accomplish in Japan. That speaks to the kind of the nature of the long-term corporate value enhancement project, but we don\u2019t \u2013 there is really no expected change in the emergence of those expenses related to our spending in Japan.","Paul Amos","In terms of the ability to launch products quicker, that is one of the primary goals of CVEP. Currently, we are working on multiple different initiatives. One of those is the new business process. The new business process is the single largest element that we must work on in order to bring products to market faster. And so I feel like we prioritize correctly what we are doing there. It is going to take a period of time in order for that to come together, but I feel confident that we are trying to move things in the right direction. That said, as we continued to expand our channels and we continue to work with groups like Tohru mentioned with the non-exclusive agencies, it\u2019s essential that we would be able to simultaneously fix whatever we need to in order to compete in the marketplace today while also focusing on what the long-term solutions will be for what Japan is as a market in the long-term, including the cost efficiency to make sure we are maximizing our profit levels on our products.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","So, I think a little while back, can you talk about maybe coming out with another medical product in Japan this year, is that still a possibility?","Dan Amos","We have talked about an additional third sector product this year. That being the revision of our cancer plan. And we are currently working through the final details around that with the Japanese government and internally.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Steven Schwartz, Raymond James & Associates, your line is open.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Good morning, everybody. Just some follow-ups. Dan, the corporate affiliate agencies, that\u2019s been a problem forever and ever and ever, maybe there is nothing to be done there, but what can you do with the individual agencies?","Dan Amos","Well, I think that we continue to look at different aspects of the way they are operating and try to run more ads for them that we have done. We have done better training, but there is some we eat away a little bit by adding distribution channels to the situation like with the banks. It does impact individual sales to some degree when we do that. So, it\u2019s been the new channels to me that would offset it more than anything else, but Tohru would you like to comment or make any \u2013 have any comment I should say?","Tohru Tonoike","Sure. Dan, you are right. So, the individual agents will continue to be the important part of our distribution channel. There is no question about that. However, there are some other channels, which are growing faster than the individual agents. The biggest one of such growing channel is the large non-exclusive agencies. So, like Dan said, we are focusing more on our business results, large non-exclusive agencies other types of distributors such as the Japan Post. So, on a comparative basis, individual agents \u2013 we are now shifting away from the individual agents, but they will continue to be producing as much as they are doing now, I think.","Dan Amos","I think what I would say about it is it\u2019s a stable block and we will continue to grow it, but we are going to where the consumers are going. And the consumers are moving more towards other places and we are trying to make sure that we are there for them to fill those needs and that\u2019s very important and what we will continue to do. But we do care about our individual agents. We do constantly focus on that. We have contest, we want to grow it. But that is not where we see the real growth channel going forward.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. And then a little move to the U.S. as follow-up I get that the market directed to move from state sales coordinator to market director I get that, I am not getting the compensation to the DSCs I mean I get trying to incentivize them to go the right accounts and what have you, but are you implying that these people don\u2019t make enough money (indiscernible) out their selling?","Dan Amos","Well, what I believe is that we have more district sales coordinators than a lot of our competitors. And we need to focus on making sure that they are making the money we want them to make. And I would like to see them \u2013 I would like to have strong districts that are making good living and we promoted a lot of people. If they got renewals they make very high numbers. But when they are coming on they need more front money and so we are trying to concentrate on that and making sure that they are able to grow their business. What we have done over a period of time is we made some adjustments \u2013 an example would be, we might cut in a new level of management. And that means that we have cut the commissions back a little bit to take that into account.","Now at that time the districts were for it, we were for it, but you take a little bit away and take a little bit away here, it begins to hurt their income. So by adding this back we are now getting them up to the level that they were in 2008. And I think ultimately will benefit us. We have always said that the district levels are the key to our organization that and the associates. And so trying to make sure they are high paid is very important to us and we want to make sure that happens \u2013 continues to happen going forward. And we think this cements that and allows us to really grow the business because they are the ones training the new people. And we have got to hire more new people and that requires a lot of time and effort on their part. And they are going to be working harder and so we want to pay him more for working hard.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","So pay these guys more or their sales like the same level of sales they can live and then got out and use the extra time to train?","Dan Amos","Well, they don\u2019t \u2013 let\u2019s be clear almost every time they are selling, they are not selling by themselves. They are taking somebody with them. So they are splitting the commissions on what they are doing when they are out training a new person. So we are trying to make sure that they are better positioned. And frankly this I think will put us in a position where we will be able to hire more people at the district level and really grow the business long-term. But shifting some money to them is the exactly what we need to do.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. And then one more if I may very quickly, California I don\u2019t know if you ever all looked at this but California, AB 1962 with regards to MLRs for dental, have you guys looked at that?","Dan Amos","I don\u2019t know anything about that now, but I will find out and get back with you.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Jimmy Bullar with JPMorgan, your line is open.","Jimmy Bullar - JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. First on the changes that you are making in the U.S. you mentioned in the release it\u2019s about $0.02 expense per quarter in the fourth quarter, should that actually stay about the same next year or would it like go up or go down. And then how long would it take for you do get a return on this, I am assuming it\u2019s like 1% to 2% headwind on earnings growth next year, but you could let me know if that\u2019s right or not. And then on the share buybacks you \u2013 obviously, your capital position is fairly strong, so I am just wondering and you stayed with the $1 billion guidance but just wondering why you did less in the second quarter than that would have \u2013 than we would have expected given your $1 billion guidance?","Ken Janke","This is Ken. Regarding the expenses related to the change to the salary position we will know a lot more in the next couple of months as we budget because of that amount about half is related to the state operating expenses that Aflac will now be responsible for. In addition, it also includes the overhead that it will take to manage in effect 66 tele workers around the country plus their, whatever administrative staff, they have a secretary or admin that we also pull in on. So, we will have to tighten down those expenses, but that\u2019s the best estimate right now. That \u2013 so we are layering on fixed cost. There is an expected offset with the reduction in variable costs, because we will now \u2013 you should see total commission expense as a percentage of revenues declined going forward, because we are not going to be paying out renewals for that level of the hierarchy any longer. So, the more that we sell, the shorter the payback period in terms of that reduction in variable expense offsetting the fixed expense that we will be putting on the income statement.","Jimmy Bullar - JPMorgan","But did those end to sort of the \u2013 the net of the higher fixed minus the variables, it\u2019s more like an ongoing expense at least initially as opposed to one-time type expense?","Ken Janke","Right. It is more \u2013 you will see in year two meaning the second 12 months, you see a larger offset, because you always would see sales coordinator position will still be \u2013 they are in effect \u2013 they are still earning commissions on business that they had written all the way up to September or will write all the way up to September 30 of this year. So, the drag is really greater in the first year than it would be in the second.","Jimmy Bullar - JPMorgan","Got it. Yes.","Ken Janke","On your follow-up question on share repurchase, when we buy, we want to make sure that we are buying in a manner that we are acting as a responsible investor. We try and buy below the VEP, which we did in the second quarter and we have generally been able to do. We want to stay on track for the full year amount of $1 billion and trying to be as opportunistic as we can. So, really it was just some judgment on our part based on market conditions, volumes the way the stock was trading so on and so forth, but we still again expect to be at the $1 billion mark for the full year. We will have to see how that plays out between third and fourth quarter.","Jimmy Bullar - JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Jay Gelb, Barclays, your line is open.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Thank you. I want to circle back on something that was mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks with regard to Japan Post I believe it discussed rolling out the new Japan Post specific policy. My sense was that was going to be done earlier. So, can you give us some perspective on what\u2019s the delay there?","Dan Amos","We will let Tohru answer. Tohru?","Tohru Tonoike","The cancer product now designed specifically for the Japan Post, our plan was, I don\u2019t know if we had sold the market that we were going to introduce that product earlier. So, we are working on that. We are working exactly as we have been planning. So, I don\u2019t seem to understand exactly what your question is?","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Sure. Well, my question is my understanding is it\u2019s a pretty simplified product. So, I am not sure what the delay is in terms of launching it specifically within the Japan Post system?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, this is Kriss. I will just kick in. It \u2013 we have to get it approved by the FSA. We had a party day that pretty much the anniversary of the new agreement, which would be around October 1. We didn\u2019t anticipate implementing it prior to that time. So, if you could have the impression we were doing it earlier, it was somewhat inaccurate, but we are more or less on track with our original plan to get the JP specific product in their hands, hopefully around the beginning of the fourth quarter.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Okay. And then my follow-up question is also on Japan for the third sector growth outlook for 2015\/2016 at fab, you discussed the range of 2% to 8% given that\u2019s been narrowed for 2014, I would like to kind of see if you can update your confidence level in achieving that target for 2015\/2016?","Kriss Cloninger","I think it\u2019s too early. What we don\u2019t know is the uncertainty of Japan Post and specifically how Kampo will do with the new product. At the end of the third quarter, we can probably shed a lot better light on that.","Dan Amos","And I don\u2019t believe those were actually our sales projections, I believe those were data that was placed into Kriss\u2019 financial projections they shared with you. And clearly articulated the time that they really are meant to be projections, but meant to be ranges of assumptions that we would articulate. When we get to the end of this year, we will do as we typically do and give out our sales guidance for the coming year and I feel like that time we\u2019ll be better able to give you forward looking guidance.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Alright, look forward to that. Thank you.","Operator","Credit Suisse, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. I just wanted to ask you a question about the change in the seasonality, the earnings pattern here. If I go back three or four years ago, you saw what was an emerging pattern of 4Q earnings to be lower based on what you guys had flagged as timing of higher expenditures in 4Q. And now you\u2019ve definitely seen that spill into 3Q and it started happening last year and it seems to be more pronounced now. So, you\u2019re getting a very big delta between what you\u2019re earning in the first half of the year versus second half of the year. And you flag some of the higher back half earnings and I got that, when you gave our guidance. But the order of magnitude here is a lot bigger than I\u2019d have guessed, looking at a 15% earnings drop sequentially that you\u2019ve guided too. Can you peel back the onion a little bit and talk about how much of that is expenses, how much of that is benefit ratio change that we\u2019ve seen on some of these newer products and anything else you could elaborate on.","Kriss Cloninger","Tom, it\u2019s Kriss, now I try to address that, yes, we\u2019ve \u2013 we have had lower earnings in the second half of the year than the first half and then part of its due to the reason you\u2019ve identified sometimes or cautious on our expense initiatives and first half of the year and as we\u2019ve moved through the year and gained more certainty that we\u2019re going to be able to achieve our annual EPS guidance then we kind of loosen the strings a bit and particularly in the marketing promotion area may have a larger expenses that\u2019s been true gosh for years now. Not just last three or four years may be more recently in Japan. The other thing that has gone on traditionally, Tom is that we \u2013 now that we\u2019ve had all of the stock stuff in place for years and years we\u2019ve had to define the process of evaluating our claim reserve estimates in the like with the auditors and we\u2019ve got a particular process employees where we evaluate certain reserves in the third quarter and certain other reserves in the fourth quarter. And so the historic patterns reflected some reserve strengthening for example in closed blocks like dementia due to lower interest rates than anticipated in the reserving in the like.","And we\u2019ve had some reserve strengthening over time for that that tends to occur to some extend the third quarter, some extend the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s been more financial reporting seasonality than an actual benefit reserve seasonality. This past year, we did a reinsurance agreement in the fourth quarter that actually improved benefit ratios in the fourth quarter relative to the third. We\u2019ll have the reporting of that reinsurance fully integrated into our benefit ratios by the end of the third quarter and we\u2019ll give some improvement in the third quarter benefit ratio in 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2013, Robin identified that was about 0.5 point improvement in the benefit ratio in the second quarter of this year and will be again in the third quarter and the fourth quarter that will be in the system we\u2019ll have direct comparability so that improvement will go away.","When we do have some seasonality claim patterns that we reflect in the financial statement more today than we used too, we used to be able to move them out a little bit. And these days, the accounts are more sensitive to smoothen anything else, so we have to go more with the actual seasonality of things and claims tend to be lower in the first part of the year as people they tend to back load business for the doctor in the actual claim processing partly due to deductibles and the like, but partly just due to the holidays and other seasonal patterns. So that\u2019s a long answer to a pretty short question, but I will focus more on the accuracy of the annual estimates. And we did because we exceeded our six month EPS increased \u2013 exceeded our annual high end of the range of 5.4% was greater than our annual range of 2% to 5%. And because of some of the anticipated expenses we have talked about earlier, we decided to tighten the range within the 2% to 5% going to 3% to 4%. So that\u2019s some of the rationale behind it.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. That\u2019s helpful Kriss. And so if I am interpreting your answer correctly this is a pattern that we will continue to see each year directionally much greater order of magnitude in terms of first half earnings and second half earnings, in part normal higher expenditures but also the benefit ratio that change being more directly reflective of claim payment patterns, is that a fair way to put it?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes. That\u2019s a fair way to put it. I do want to just say that I specifically mentioned dementia reserves and we have had a couple of increases over the last couple of years. But right now we don\u2019t anticipate doing that in the third and fourth quarter. We will have to look at the interest assumptions behind the reserves. But with the stabilization of investment yields in the total portfolio and the like we don\u2019t think we have got that kind of interest rate exposure we had in the past that led us from reserve increases, so that\u2019s a favorable thing.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Christopher Giovanni of Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Thanks so much. Good morning. I guess first one just on in terms of medical sales clearly alluded to the tough comp in the back half of this year, but I want to think about the sustainability of the quarterly sales we have seen so far year-to-date?","Kriss Cloninger","Sustainability in quarterly sales.","Dan Amos","Medical.","Kriss Cloninger","We have seen beginning last year very strong sales in our medical product. We anticipated that the medical sales would sustain slightly better growth in the first half of this year than we originally saw. That said, we still believe that the product continues to go in a strong manner. We are focused on the standard medical plan, not our gentle ever plan at this time. But we believe those products will continue to sell well in the coming quarters. That said, it is the reality that competition continues to put out more and more new products all the time. And one other things that we have to continue to do one of the key reasons I mentioned earlier our desire to be able to launch products in a quicker manner is the sustainability of the length of time that a product last in terms of the boost of new sales. So we are constantly monitoring that. We do believe we still have continued tailwinds with our medical plan for some period of time, but we continue to notice that, but amount of time that a new product is lasting is slightly less than it used to be.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then for Dan sort of a silly question but given your recognition that you won\u2019t be growing kind of at the pace you have in the past, the increased focus you have on capital generation returning capital to shareholders, I guess why continue to have such an emphasis or heavy emphasis and probably you stated goals around sales targets?","Dan Amos","As we are a sales company and I expect sales to grow. And there I believe it sets a trend for us to what ultimately earnings are going to be and persistency is in that number and other elements. But I want to \u2013 I believe that ultimately when the agent does well everybody else will do well. And that\u2019s what we have got to see happen here. And I am committed to fixing this in the U.S. and believe we will be able to do it. I put my reputation on the line of trying to fix this and that\u2019s what I get paid big bucks to do is to fix things. And I understand that\u2019s the way it works. And I am willing to go out on a limb and telling I expect third quarter sales to be down but I want to see an upward movement in fourth quarter and I know that\u2019s quick knowing how hard it is to make changes sometimes. But that\u2019s where I am focused and that\u2019s what I will continue to do.","Kriss Cloninger","This is Kriss, I pushed down a bit, so look we got to have the revenues to build the house \u2013 the house of earnings. And we have done well at building earnings over the period and sales are an important part of the earnings for Aflac U.S. The premium income for Aflac U.S. is probably at least 25% first year and about 75% renewal. In Japan its not is big, it\u2019s little less than 10% first year premium 90% to 92% renewal. But I need that growth in first year premium to help grow the revenues overall if we are going to get earnings growth. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep getting new sales and to keep pushing on new sales estimates and the like to achieve our overall financial objectives which include growth in earnings per share.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Robin Wilkey","","Carol, we are coming up to the top of the hour, so will have one last question please.","Operator","Joanne Smith, Scotia Capital. Your line is open.","Joanne Smith \u2013 Scotia Capital","And I have always thought that those were the guys who had the biggest existing books of business?","Dan Amos","We only call we didn\u2019t get any of your question. You just came on in the middle and start back and so we can hear which question is\u2026","Joanne Smith \u2013 Scotia Capital","Okay. So can you hear me better now?","Dan Amos","Now, we can.","Joanne Smith \u2013 Scotia Capital","Okay. So if my recollection is correct, my understanding of the state sales coordinators has been they are the ones that have the largest historical in-force book and that they are earning most of their money on the commissions that their getting from that. And those aren\u2019t going away. However, if those state sales coordinators do not chose to pick on the new position of Market Director, what is the outlook for those books of business and is there the potential for them to move those to some other carrier is in fact they move to a different \u2013 a different company as a rep?","Dan Amos","First of all, it\u2019s not their book of business is based on the people that work for our company. I was a state sales coordinator for 10 years, so I will understand totally and now you can\u2019t move it that easily. So that\u2019s one half. The other thing is we have not had a single state sales coordinator not go for this new program. It\u2019s going to be the highest paid in the industry. They like it. There is a wonderful retirement \u2013 for your salary we put out the equal amount for retirement. So they like it very much. But they will become more of a manager than just a sales manager. They will look at profit, they will look at all aspects. So I am very pleased with we had them sign confidentiality agreements and we introduced this a week go and to adjust them in six locations, we had them at the exact same time took away all cell phones we are very pleased because \u2013 we are pleased of where we offered them. This is a great deal for them. It is a great deal for the company because we now can be a united front. We don\u2019t have 50 independent people running state organizations or in this case 65 go in different directions. We will unite with the strongest brand that\u2019s out there in the insurance industry and be able to push forward with what I believe will ultimately drive our sales. Now again I warned you the third quarter, but the fourth quarter in going forward I have been in sales, it\u2019s in my blood and I just think we can do this. So we will wait and see but that\u2019s where outlook added now.","Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital","Okay, okay, Dan. Just as a follow up very quick, so the first quarter you are looking for an uptick, is this something that you think is I mean as \u2013 this is not like a major change that would be disruptive for an extended period of time, is that what you are suggesting that people are on board that now they are going to be directed towards what the overall objective of the company is which is to bring in the sales of the core small business employer for some of these agents that are not going after the large cases, etcetera. So, you think that this is something that can get implemented and it could be back to business as usual by fourth quarter and we should start to see some improvement then?","Dan Amos","Well, one reason I am optimistic about an uptick in the fourth quarter was it was such you are right in fourth quarter last year. So, I didn\u2019t like our sales last year, so that\u2019s the reason that I am encouraged about that. I don\u2019t want to be too optimistic in terms of it not being somewhat disruptive. Remember, all these people are used to being independent contractors. So, it\u2019s a change of the way they have operated. But we think that we can mold the way we are going to do it in a way that they are going to like it and it will be less disruptive for them, but any time you change jobs and this is a change in job, there is some disruption, but I think the districts making higher money in between is going to help offset the disruption, because here these districts are as we are announcing this making more money. So they need to be out there selling, because we have only guaranteed it through the end of the year, although I hope will possibly continue it if it works. So, while we have got this disruption at the state level, we have got this enormous positive thing happened at the district level, which I think will help drive sales. So, that\u2019s why I am encouraged. But look I am an internal optimist when it comes to sales. I don\u2019t want to overstep it, but as I said, I will be very disappointed, if I don\u2019t see an uptick in the fourth quarter. And then going forward, I expect to see improvements.","Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital","Okay, thanks very much, Dan.","Robin Wilkey - Senior Vice President, Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations","Carol, I think we are out of time.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Robin Y. Wilkey","Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of our U.S. Operations; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO; Eric Kirsch, First Senior Vice President Global Chief Investment Officer; Toru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan who is joining us from Tokyo.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in the teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. Now, I'm going to turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and our operations in both Japan and the U.S. Dan?","Daniel P. Amos","Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased that we met and, in many cases, significantly exceeded our financial and operational performance for the fourth quarter and the year. I'll briefly review the quarter and the year starting with the operations in Japan and the U.S. Let me begin with Aflac Japan, our largest earning contributor, that generated strong results throughout 2011. We were again pleased with Aflac Japan's financial performance, and particularly the tremendous sales momentum they produced. New annualized premium sales rose 31% to JPY 48.6 billion for the quarter which significantly exceeded our expectations and set all-time quarterly record. Aflac Japan outstanding sales results are especially remarkable considering 2011 was the year Japan was hit by the most devastating natural disaster in its history. For the year, total new annualized premium sales rose 18.6%, though suppressed by the strong yen revenue growth in yen rose 6% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year. Pretax earnings rose 8% for the quarter and 6.8% for the year.","Bank channel sales significantly exceeded our expectations, generating JPY 16.5 billion in new annualized premium sales produced and accounted for 33.9% of total Aflac Japan sales. This represents an increase of 135% over the fourth quarter of 2010. Banks have been very successful in selling products especially with WAYS, our unique hybrid whole life product. In the fourth quarter, the bank channel produced 323% increase in the sale of WAYS over the fourth quarter of 2010. Looking at the bank channel sales, we anticipate sales comparisons in 2012 will be especially difficult, especially in the second half of the year, following the record 2011 results. Keep in mind, we anticipated the momentum of WAYS sales through banks to carry over into the first quarter of 2012. In fact, we believe first quarter sales of Aflac products through banks will be up more than 150%. This is in large part because we expect an intense product first quarter push from banks to finish their fiscal year very strong.","Following in a strong first quarter, we anticipate the decline in the second half of the year. One reason is the phenomenal sales growth resulting from the addition of new banks has been mostly tapped. You'll recall that we started in the smaller Shinkin banks, then the regional banks and now all for the mega banks. Following a great start to the year is Japan banks focus on strong sales for the conclusion of their fiscal year, sales will be increasingly challenged when going up against record third and fourth quarter results. Keep in mind that we've been selling WAYS, our top-selling product, through banks for as long as 2 years at some banks. That means we've already cycled through the first major pass at selling this product to the large portion of the bank customers, though we believe sales through bank channels will be down for the full year.","With respect to Aflac Japan's traditional sales channel, the tremendous sales results in 2009 and 2010 from our EVER product in the Maneki Neko duck campaign created tough comparisons in 2011. Our traditional sales channel produced flat in 2011, but I expect to see sales growth from this channel in 2012.","Before I turn to the U.S., I want to give you some perspective on our Japan business. Until recently, 2010 was by far the best year we have ever had in Aflac Japan sales. As we entered 2011, it was absolutely unthinkable that Aflac Japan could generate an 18.6% sales increase for the year. That's exactly what we did, and we crushed 2010 sales records by JPY 25.5 billion or $316 million. Following that kind of sales growth, I can't imagine that any of you would be surprised that we expect Aflac Japan sales to be down 2% to 5% for 2012. You'll recall my comments in the third quarter, I'm not about to hold business in order to smooth the sales track for the future. It is in the best interest of our shareholders to take sales when they come in, and that's exactly what we did and had a 31% increase in the fourth quarter.","Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. It's been and continues to be an outstanding -- a long-standing vision to be the leading provider of voluntary insurance in the United States, a position we've held for many years. Aflac U.S. generated 9.3% increase in new annualized premium sales for the quarter and a 6.8% increase for the year. We are pleased with those strong results which exceeded our annual sales expectations of flat to up 5%. I would also note that in 2011, we had stronger persistency than we have had in over a dozen years.","We are continually leveraging Aflac strong brand by directing our efforts and initiatives to support that. Part of what has driven Aflac's success is our commitment to investing in our business infrastructure. Once we achieve our corporate earnings objective, we look for opportunities to strengthen our business operations. We told you that we were going to increase expenses in the fourth quarter on IT and marketing initiatives, following 3 quarters of restrained spending and that's exactly what we did. These higher expenditures substantially contributed to fourth quarter earnings decrease of 11.8%. Earnings for 2011 were basically flat which is better than expected for the year. This is because 2010's earnings benefited from the release of a $40-million reserve from a 2009 lapsation of a large account. Revenues rose 4% for the quarter and 3.8% for the full year.","We continue to expand Aflac's potential to connect with employees at many companies, large and small, across the United States. 2009 addition of group products to our existing portfolio has allowed us to leverage our strong brand and provide more options for customers in both traditional and broker distribution channels. In 2011, product marketing efforts geared toward existing accounts contributed to strong sales for the veteran agents. Those efforts included strategic product pushes of enhanced products including dental and short-term disability. Additionally, you'll recall that we've been establishing and developing relationships with brokers that handle larger cases. While the broker initiatives still is in the infancy, we are excited about the opportunity this channel presents for future growth. I believe that given the challenging economic environment, our success in achieving a sales increase of 6.8% for the full year is outstanding. The U.S. continues to provide a vast and accessible market for our products by leveraging our strong brand and enhancing our portfolio of individual and group voluntary products. We expanded our universe of potential customers within the vast and accessible market. For 2012, we expect Aflac Japan sales to increase in the range of 3% to 8%.","With both operating segments performing well, investments are my top priority as a CEO. The financial crisis that began at the end of 2008 transformed the investment landscape. In the wake of the fallout, we've been closely evaluating our investment function. In addition to our proactive derisking activities, over the past several years, we've also enhanced our global investment platform by investing in systems that will help us refine our analysis. By management -- my management philosophy has always been to find the right person for the job then give them the latitude and support them to deliver the results. As most of you know, Eric Kirsch officially joined Aflac as the Global Chief Investment Officer on November 1. I'm confident he is the right person to prove the capabilities of our investment function. Eric's 3 decades of experience in building and leading global teams and managing assets will help us further our vision to be a world-class investment organization that pays particular attention to the needs of the insurance operations through effective ALM and capital adequacy management while also balancing the expectations of shareholders through the investment income growth.","It goes without saying that this objective is in the best interest of the policyholders. We didn't bring Eric on board to manage our global investments from a status quo standpoint. Given continued challenges in today's environment, we are calling upon Eric's global perspective to evaluate where we are with the investments in relation to the current financial backdrop, and where we want to be within that same space.","Eric's on the call today, so he will answer your questions when we go to Q&A. But first, let me highlight some of the actions we took with investments this quarter.","As conditions in Europe has deteriorated further, volatility has increased. And we are not presently making any new investments in Europe. As part of the company's strategy to improve our investment credit profile and diversification, we decreased our exposure to Europe through optimistic investment transactions and impairments. I want to emphasize that these impairment charges are as a whole, different from the impairments we've taken in the past. These impairments did not result from a significant credit changes to specific companies. Instead, they reflected a well-thought-out strategy to reduce our overall exposure to Europe. I would remind you that our strong capital position and our operation to generate significant capital on an annual basis, we were able to make impairments from a position of strength.","We were able to offset a portion of the losses with the sale of the holding of the U.S. Treasury strips, which produced an after-tax gain of $218 million. So our net after-tax losses for the first quarter was $145 million, which was down from $191 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. We will continue to look for opportunities to lower our holdings of European financial assets.","Let me remind you of how successful we've been in substantially enhancing our investment portfolio over the past few years. From January of 2008 to the end of 2011, we have dramatically cut our holdings of sovereign and financial investments in PIIGS countries from 5.9 to 2.2 of the total investments in cash. For example, on the fourth quarter, we exercised the downgrade put on a local Spanish authority, La Mancha [ph], and put the security back to them at par. We've also lowered our investment in perpetual securities by more than half, going from 14.7 to 6.8 of the total investments in cash. We sold the perpetual security in the fourth quarter KBL at a much higher sales price than an impaired value. DBN Nor [ph] also redeemed the perpetual upper Tier 2 security in December.","I'd also like to point out that none of the perpetual securities we currently own are in PIIGS countries. As we pursue opportunistic investment transactions, we will continue to take actions to reduce our exposure to European debt. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated financial performance. Operating per diluted share rose 11.3% to $1.48 for the quarter, and 15.5% or $6.33 for the full year. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating per diluted share rose 6.8% for the quarter and 8% for the year, which was consistent with our 2011 EPS objectives of an 8% increase before the impact of the yen. I am pleased that for the 22nd year, we have achieved our operating earnings objective.","I'd like to comment on the capital position. The strength of our capital ratios demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of our policyholders, bondholders, as well as our shareholders. As we've communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC, remains a priority for us. We have conveyed that our goal was to end 2011 with an RBC ratio in the range of 400 to 500, with a target of 450. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that 2011 RBC ratio will be between the 480 and 520. Our capital strength enables us to increase our cash dividend to shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2011 for the 29th consecutive year. Our objective is to grow our dividend at the rate in line with our earnings per share growth before the impact of the yen. I believe dividends are an important component of the value that we provide investors. Additionally in the fourth quarter, we purchased 900,000 shares of Aflac's stock bringing the total number of shares purchased for the full year to 6 million.","As we have said for many years, when it comes to the deploying capital for the benefit of shareholders, we still believe that repurchasing our shares and growing the cash dividend of the most attractive means and that is something that we will continue to pursue. As you've heard us say before, proper repatriation has always been the primary source of funding our share repurchase programs and that is true for 2012. We mentioned on the third quarter call, that we estimated 2012 profit repatriation to be about JPY 45 billion, assuming no additional material investment losses through March 31, 2012. However, since that time, we again enhanced the quality of the portfolio through reducing our exposure to European assets. These results incurred investment losses in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the reevaluation of the Aflac Japan's deferred tax assets resulted from the reduction of the corporate tax rate in Japan, will lower our current SSA-based earnings. Therefore, our profit repatriation in 2012 will be less than we originally anticipated.","We will make a decision about the amount of money that we will transfer from Japan to the U.S. around middle of the year. In thinking of that decision, we will be taking into consideration the needs of all of our shareholders in Japan including the policyholders. As you know, our capital adequacy in Japan is principally measured by the solvency margin ratio which we estimate within the range of 520 to 560 at calendar year 2011. We are comfortable with this level of solvency margin ratio but continue to test our capital adequacy ratios by applying vigorous stress test under extreme scenarios.","As we've discussed, one of the potential risk to the solvency margin is the rising interest rates. Although this does not seem likely in the short run, we continue to assess the impact of rising interest rates on solvency margin ratios. In that regard, we've taken action to help mitigate that risk. For instance, we sold a portion of our JGB holdings, classified as available for sale and then repurchased them the same amount of JGBs classifying them as held to maturity. Additionally, we sold the remainder of our holdings of U.S. Treasury strips in the fourth quarter, and reinvested the proceeds primarily in JGB that were classified as held to maturity.","Looking ahead, I want to reiterate that our objective for 2012 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share, 2% to 5%, on a currency-neutral basis. This range reflects the impact of the portfolio derisking and investing significantly cash flows at lower interest rates. We expect the rate of earnings growth for 2013 to improve over 2012. I'm very pleased with how we have responded to the challenges in 2011 and remain focused on our vision to be the leading provider of voluntary insurance products in the United States, and the #1 provider of supplemental insurance in Japan. Robin, I'll turn it over to you.","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thanks, Dan. Today, I'm going to dispense with our usual process of highlighting financial and operational metrics in order to allow more time for questions. However, to use this time most effectively, I would suggest you focus your questions on the how and why. If you have a question of fact, the odds are we disclosed it. If you can't find the answer, please call Investor Relations and Tom and I will be happy to help.","But before we get to your Q&A, I'd like to highlight several things that came up repeatedly in the conversations last night. One relates to the profitability characteristics of our WAYS product in Japan. One, it has higher premium about 9x the premium of our medical and cancer products. Two, lower commission rates. Three, a higher benefit ratio. I'd like to add that our benefit ratio in Japan primarily reflected the increased sales of WAYS which greatly exceeded our expectations. As we've said before, the overall profitability of the sale of one WAYS policy is about the same as the sale of one of our cancer or medical products. My second comment relates to impairments in the quarter. Of the total impairments for the quarter, there was only one impairment, CSAV, related specifically to the credit of that company. The remainder were related to our investment strategy and the basket of securities we identified with the intent to sell that Eric will discuss later.","As in the past, I would remind you to please limit yourself to one question and one associated follow-up in order to be fair to the other callers. But before we begin taking your questions, since this is Eric's first quarter with the company, I'd like Eric to comment on his objectives, strategies and challenges for the investment area. Once he completes his opening remarks, we'll open the lines to your call. Eric?","Eric M. Kirsch","Thank you, Robin. And let me start by thanking Dan and the management team for allowing me to become part of the Aflac family, a terrific and great organization, and asking me to take the challenge on bringing the Aflac investment group up to world-class standards. It's a terrific challenge, but it's also a great opportunity, and it's a great opportunity for our shareholders.","Let me give you a sense of what I've been doing in my first 3 months on the ground, and in the spirit of becoming world-class, I would classify my objectives as both strategic in order to move us to world-class, as well as tactical, because we have investments to make and investments to analyze every single day as the world in particularly Europe in such a dynamic and volatile place, if you will.","Firstly, I've spent significant time on the ground in our operations in Columbus worldwide headquarters with our investment teams and management. And I have spent significant time in Japan having made 3 trips already, spent significant time with our investment teams on the ground in Japan, as well as our senior management, which has allowed me to fully understand our capabilities, our challenges and our issues. I've also had the opportunity, right when I started, to meet with all members of the board and to work closely with our finance and investment committees. As you all probably are aware, we have many governance structures internally around the investment functions and I have taken over as chair, for example, of our global investment committee and our credit subcommittee, and we're working very closely with our finance and investment committee representing our investment goals [ph] this year.","Let me break up my conversation in the next few minutes into the strategic and these tactical buckets. And let me start on the strategic front, and then move into the tactical front. Strategically, the charge is, let's make sure that Aflac is a world-class investment organization, by reviewing all of our capability, not only in human capital, but also with respect to technology, also with respect to investment process, also with respect to best in class investment strategies to ensure that our portfolio is well diversified, well-managed and we understand all the rest that we can take and take advantage of in consideration of our capital. So 2 things that we have engaged folks on that we are working on extensively already. First, we've hired McKinsey & Company, a well-known management consultant, to work alongside me to do a strategic review of our investment capabilities on a global basis. That project has already started. We have steering committees of senior management that have already met with McKinsey, and McKinsey has been on the ground in our Japan office as well as in our Columbus office and New York, already doing an extensive review. We expect this project to take about 3 months and to conclude somewhere at the end of March.","Secondly, we have embarked on a strategic asset allocation, ALM capital management exercise. So specifically, what that means is we want to take a broad look at all the investment opportunities that are appropriate for an insurance company, appropriate for our company, of our locations in Japan and Columbus, appropriate for the type of liabilities that we have, and well-managed given the objectives that we have with respect to capital. That project we've embarked on with Goldman Sachs asset management, who is a world leader in this expertise, and what my expectation of that is to look at a broader set of asset classes and investment opportunities that we can use in the future that has not been used historically at Aflac which will help us improve the overall quality of the earnings of our portfolio and diversification for the future. That project will take approximately 5 months, and my expectation is, when we have those recommendations and work with the senior management and our board for approvals, we'll begin to implement those strategies somewhere in the second half of the year.","So those are the strategic parts that go along with defining our roadmap which I think in the second half of the year will be very well defined and we'll be able to articulate that to you. Let me move to tactical because that's so, so important as we have $100-plus-billion balance sheet, that in fact is invested on a global basis in a time of great volatility in the markets.","So with respect to that, I have spent significant time with our investment teams, both in Japan and the U.S., looking at all of our holdings, understanding where our exposures are, where our concentrations are. In addition, as you all know, we've made a commitment to do outsourcing. And I took advantage of asking some potential partners of the future to work with us, to look at our portfolio so that I can have a second set of eyes and opinions that complement our own. So with respect to that, as you all know, we do have concentrations in Europe. And as you also know, and I'm pleased to tell you that I reviewed, the company had been on a derisking strategy over the last few years and it made significant improvement in reducing those exposures and increasing the quality and lessening the volatility of our portfolio. Nevertheless, we still have those exposures, and as I look at that basket of securities with a focus on Europe, where most of my attention has been focused on, clearly, I'm focused on the financials. As I look at our broad portfolio, it's actually a high-quality portfolio. As you know, most of our assets are in private placement form where we've had the opportunity to negotiate specific covenants to our structures. But clearly, the financials represent the greatest challenge with respect to the situation in Europe.","And let me remind everybody, that in the second half of this year, the volatility in Europe increased to unprecedented proportion that nobody could have imagined. And it's multifaceted because we've got the political framework, the monetary framework and the fiscal framework in a very difficult situation in Europe in order to get agreement. And during the quarter, no matter what financial indicator you look at with respect to European assets or European financials, in particular, the spread in the marketplace went to all-time highs in terms of volatility. During the quarter, as different actions were successful by the politicians and the monetary officials and some actions were not. In the last month of the year, we did see an easing up as the ECB has basically provided liquidity to financial institutions, helping to take the biggest risk, a Lehman type risk, off the table. Nevertheless, we will continue to see volatility in Europe in my opinion over the next couple of years, as they try to reach consensus on some strategies that will be everlasting in nature, but that will take some time.","With that in mind, that expected volatility, as I looked at the portfolio, I felt it was necessary to have a strategy to continue to reduce these exposures, in particular, with the financials so that we can lessen our exposure to that potential volatility which is very, very hard to predict. As Dan and Robin have mentioned, consistent with that strategy, since we've embarked on that in late December, we took a number of impairments with respect to that basket of securities because our intent is now focused on executing those strategies which started in late December and are going to be ongoing throughout this year, but hopefully primarily completed before the midyear mark.","So again to emphasize, those impairments were not because of credit related reasons with respect to the financials. They're related to a strategy that's focused on improving the quality of our portfolio, lessening the exposure to the financial sector, so that we'll have less volatility should the situation in Europe continue to be volatile, which I believe it will be. We will be highly vigilant on these holdings. Our teams are highly focused on it and where it makes sense, we will leverage outside advisers that are potentially going to become outsourcing partners with us so that we have the best intelligence in the world to make the best informed decisions. I should also may -- mention early on my arrival, upon my assessment, I put a stop to all new investments in Europe. As I look at our broad exposure, while I believe the quality of the portfolio is very high, with obviously the risk in the financial sectors I've already mentioned, I felt that our macro exposure to Europe was at its limits, and there was no need to make further investments, even though there are many good companies in Europe that we could find as attractive opportunities, we just have reached our risk bucket. Nevertheless, there are new investment opportunities we're looking at in other parts of the world.","So with that, those are the strategic and the tactical things. We're working hard on all of those fronts. And we'll continue to provide you updates as the situation continues to develop. But we're very proud of the work that we've done to-date. And we feel good with respect to where our portfolio is and feel good that these strategies will transition us into the future state.","Daniel P. Amos","Eric, why don't you go ahead and answer a couple of questions that came up last night that you overheard and give them a sense and then we'll take their questions. It might cut down the questions.","Eric M. Kirsch","Sure. Again, one of the questions we've heard last night was, can we see the list of specific securities and is that it? The reason we've not provided the list is, this is a strategy. The strategy around our financials. And as you all know, our investments are not publicly traded investments. They're in the form of private placements. And what that means is, these are privately negotiated transactions in order for us to find ways to either liquidate those securities that we'd like to reduce exposure to, and if we can't do that, there are other strategies such as looking at hedging strategies, credit default swaps and amongst the bucket of securities that we wish to look at, we will only execute if we get a value that we feel is optimal for our shareholders. We will not execute simply in the interest of trying to reduce the exposures if we can't get a fair value. So in that spirit, the negotiations will take a few months to develop, and we will report to you as we actually transact during our regular reporting periods, but I want to emphasize that it's a strategy.","Another question that comes up is, do you expect more? That is a difficult question to answer. What I expect is the situation in Europe will continue to be volatile. Just -- let's look at the recent activity. The month of December started to feel better, financial indications -- indicators in Europe began to get better, because the ECB came to the table and is providing liquidity to the system. Just in the last 2 weeks, questions have arose again with respect to Greece. And again, I'm proud to say that we don't have any exposure to Greece. But nevertheless, because those questions have arisen in the market, we've seen an increase in volatility in the last week or 2. I expect those types of events to continue to happen.","Therefore, our strategy of reducing our bucket should reduce our volatility. Again, I'll remind you, the strategy is not because we had a change of opinion on the credits. But should the situation in Europe deteriorate, as an example, and the ECB not provide liquidity because they feel the fiscal situation isn't keeping speed, that could have an impact on our views of our holdings, the speed of our execution and\/or the credit views.","So I can't say anything with precision, but I can analyze the dynamics that might affect the portfolio and be actively working on those risks to reduce the potential that those situations in Europe would impact us in any substantial way from here on out.","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thank you very much, Eric, and welcome aboard. All right, we will now begin with your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a question on Japan sales. Typically, sales in Japan declined sequentially in the first quarter from the fourth. Given your comments on bank sales which are obviously seasonally strong in calendar 1Q, is it reasonable to assume that you'll see sequential growth in sales in the first quarter of this year? And then just following up on Dan's comments on free cash flow and capital flexibility at the holding company. Could you just give us a little bit more detail on how much capital you think you can upstream to the holding company from the Japan's sub in 2012 based on what you've seen in, in investment losses the past few quarters?","Robin Y. Wilkey","Kriss, you want to go ahead and take that?","Kriss Cloninger","Okay. Jimmy, I'll take the question on how much capital we can upstream from Japan. At the end of the third quarter, we had said that we had projected that the repatriation would approximate JPY 45 billion, potentially, if we had no material additional losses. As you know, we did take additional losses in the fourth quarter within the Aflac Japan segments. And now our best estimate, at today's date through March 31, if we don't have any additional material losses, would be approximately JPY 25 billion. So that's kind of the range of numbers on that. Now at that level at JPY 25 billion would we choose to take it all out and use it for capital management purposes of various sorts, I think the jury's out on that right now. I think we're kind of in a wait-and-see period as to what our most effective use of capital is. Our overall story continues to be that we have strong operating earnings. They're going to generate a lot of capital. We're going to see to what extent in realized investment losses are going to cut in to the portion of that capital that becomes available for capital management purposes. So that's where we are right at the moment.","Daniel P. Amos","And in regard to sales, I don't have it in front of me because I'm always interested in what it compares to last year. But let me say again that first quarter sales traditional channels look to be about flat. What's going to happen with sales regarding the bank channel is the driving factor. And I just said, it would be up 150% or more. How it's going to break down, I'm not totally sure at this point. When I said or more, it could be. I don't know how much more it could be. Because it's something we just can't track at this point. But I do expect -- I want to go back on sales. This is common with any new product. There's an enormous spike once they've made the cycle. So they're trying to finish out the cycles on some of these and -- by the end of the quarter. And so there may be carryover in April. They may process it all in March. I'm just not sure at this point. But the point I want to make to you is it's going to be big. So just because it's big in the first quarter don't expect the sales for the year to be that tremendous because we're expecting this spike.","Operator","Our next question is from Ed Spehar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a question about the RBC ratio that you think you have at the end of the year. And I guess if I'm doing the numbers right, it looks like your year-end total adjusted capital shouldn't be that much different than where it was at the end of the 9 months. And so for you to be at the lower end or even the midpoint, the 480% to 500% RBC, it would seem that your required capital would have to be up 10% to 15% year end '11 versus year end '10. And I guess it's hard to see, can you help us understand why required capital would go up so much, especially considering that you've been derisking throughout 2011?","Kriss Cloninger","Okay, Ed. I haven't seen the final numbers to know whether required capital is up or not. Based on the nominal NAIC ratings changes in the portfolio that actually would help us. Foreign exchange will hurt us a little bit. So then, I think the primary change in RBC ratio related to the realized losses, and whether or not or to what extent we can take tax benefits associated with those losses. On a GAAP basis, we've been taking a full tax benefit on the realized losses, because we've got unrealized gains that we can use to justify, no allowance on utilization and foreign tax loss carry forwards. But under statutory, there's a limitation on the amount of surplus that you can use to get an admitted deferred tax asset. And I think I mentioned last year that we were approaching the limit on that deferred tax assets. So I think what you're seeing is that limited tax benefits on the realized losses we're booking.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But, Kriss, that's already been the case through the first 9 months of this year, right? So I guess, that's factored into this tac number that I think you've got already, right?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, that number reflects actual capital as opposed to the total adjusted capital in the numerator. I think the denominator stayed about the same, Ed. And I think the total adjusted capital we have in force was influenced by the higher level of losses pretax.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. I mean, I guess, that would be my assumption as well which would make it seem like 520 is a lot more likely than 480, I guess, is my conclusion.","Kriss Cloninger","Well, right now, I think, we're close to the middle of the range. We haven't finished the numbers.","Unknown Executive","We'll know at the end. Really, a couple more weeks, Ed, before we get the final stat work done. And then we can work with Robin to provide a reconciliation to the year end '10 numbers so you can see what the moving parts were.","Daniel P. Amos","Ed, we've got our Chief Accounting Officer in the room and her comment was it may be. We're just not sure at this point. [indiscernible] We're just not sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Eric, question for you. I mean, the -- sort of the tactical element and the strategic review is taking probably another 5 months or so to address the optimal asset allocation. Can you comment some in terms of what you're doing with new money today as you kind of bridge the gap, as you look out over the next 5 months?","Eric M. Kirsch","Sure, happy to. We continue to be looking at non-JGB investment opportunities. And they do exist in other parts of the world. As previously stated, no more investments in Europe, but we are seeing good investment opportunities in Asia, including some in Latin America as well. We're also focused on continuing to purchase an appropriate amount of JGB investments. We need those both for diversification, liquidity, but also as I believe Dan mentioned earlier, the JGBs as we're able to use them as liability management tools, as well as interest rate tools, allow us when put into HTM to better manage our solvency margin ratio. So for the foreseeable future, those are the things that we have concentrated on historically, and we'll continue to do that before we venture into new investment opportunities, we need to do, as I mentioned earlier, the asset allocation project to make sure we understand how they're going to fit. One last item I should mention, last year, the company did embark on an allocation to bank loans. And the board had approved an allocation up to $500 million. Through the end of the year, we've used approximately $100 million to $125 million of that. We are moving forward to use that capacity as we believe bank loans do represent an attractive opportunity and an attractive complement to our broad portfolio. So I would expect that before the end of June, before the end of the second quarter, we will probably use $500 million of capacity in bank loans subject to market conditions, but we're working on that funding as we speak.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, Dan, in terms of, I guess, Japan. Can you comment a little bit on sort of the expectations for where the benefit ratio could go given the product mix shift? And are you at all worried given sort of the distribution, how it becomes much more open architecture with banks being a predominant player now? Or you at all worried about deterioration in overall profitability, not just for Aflac but for the industry overall?","Daniel P. Amos","I think that's a Kriss question.","Kriss Cloninger","Thanks, Dan. Well, I would say that we did write a significantly more, significantly higher portion of life products and including WAYS in the fourth quarter than we had in previous quarters. Those will -- particularly the WAYS products caused the ratios to behave in the way that I've been describing. You're going to get higher revenue on the WAYS life policy than you got on a health policy. Your benefit ratio is going to be somewhat higher. Your expense ratio is going to be somewhat lower. Your overall margin may be somewhat lower. But your profit per policy ought to be at least the same as a health policy, as a combination health policy. Now, I was pleased to see that our overall margin increased during the 2011 period, including the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter last year. So the numbers are behaving as I told you to expect them to behave. We're not getting the declines in the benefit ratios, but we are getting some decline in the expense ratios. And overall, margins are holding steady to modestly improving. And that's even holding true in the light of low interest rate environment we invested in during 2011. I think you'll see some continuation of that into 2012. I told you the reduced earnings estimates in 2012 were a function of getting the low investment yield rates kind of reflected through the full 12-month period, as well as the effect of reinvesting funds associated with investment principal that we had derisk that is sold and had to reinvest. So that can -- impact continues on into 2012.","Daniel P. Amos","And the only other comment I'd make is that, we are continuing to downplay the sale of the endowment policy. In fact, we're giving no credits for sales in 2012 for bonuses for the management team on endowment. And in addition, we're introducing a new cancer, I mean, a new medical product, and we expect that to be very positive for us going forward and will be the same profit margins of the medical products in the past.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the open architecture and kind of profitably across the industry?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, by open architecture, I'm not sure if you mean that we intend to control sales by product category. Is that sort of what you mean?","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, more just the bank distribution, you have sort of expanding distribution beyond just sort of control, controlled distribution.","Daniel P. Amos","Well, I was just going to say, our distribution channels vary dramatically over the years. If you go back, you can remember we had a telemarketing company that was selling almost 18% of our business. And they no longer produce anything for us. So we found a way to look for new alternatives of distribution and expand on as we move forward. I still think the bank channel, although this year will be difficult and maybe even next year, we always find ways to supplement and grow our business. So I think that's what we'll be doing in terms of expanding that distribution channel.","Operator","Our next question is from the Andrew Kligerman of UBS.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This question is around the profitability of the products. Two data points. I was a little confused, Kriss, and I think Robin mentioned earlier that for every one sale of a medical product, you have the same profitability as a WAYS and then there's -- and it's 9x the premium. So is the profitability 1\/9? And then following on to that, I was in Japan recently and had gotten some feedback from competitors that the pricing on WAYS was somewhat aggressive and that they were having difficulty competing. So what I'd like to know is, what do you think is the reason for these robust sales? And is the pricing aggressive?","Kriss Cloninger","Okay. The -- with respect to child endowment, we did have the situation where the premium was about 3x higher than the health policy and the margin was about 1\/3 of the typical health policy. So the comment about same profit for policy really applied to child endowments. We don't have that extreme situation on WAYS because WAYS has a different patterns of cash values and settlement features and the like. And the premium is much higher. It's like 9x higher on average. So the profitability of WAYS as a percent of premium actually is almost double that of child endowment as a percent of premium. So the WAYS's profitably is much better. The WAYS benefit period tends to be longer than child endowment.  It's longer before you reach the time when benefits are paid out. Child endowment, you start paying benefits at about age 15. WAYS is more like a whole life contract where you pay benefits out starting at a retirement age, and you have certain options in the benefits after retirement age. As far as pricing it aggressively, it's priced at the same interest rate that child endowment was, but it is a longer duration. So we think we can invest for somewhat longer period on WAYS than we can on child endowment and still maintain asset liability management principles in place. Overall, just suffice it to say that WAYS, when sold with advanced discount premium options which is done over half the times in the bank channel, 90% of the bank channel almost half the time overall, that does improve the profitability, too. Because you change your weighted average interest rate required under the contract from the 1.85% that the base policy assumes to an average of 1.85% and the 1% that we credit on the advanced premium deposit funds. So it really kind of weighted average required interest down less than 1.5% on the aggregate contract and that makes a big difference on WAYS sold through the bank channel. So whether or not the other company that made the comment to you that they thought we are priced aggressively, utilize the advanced premium deposit fund to the same extent we do, I don't know. Whether they just want to invest short-term in JGBs only, I don't know. So I can't really comment on the comparative profitability. That's all I can tell you what we're doing.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just with regard to the profitability, how long a duration are you investing? And more importantly, on this investment portfolio, the hierarchy, it sounds like there's a derisking of another pool of investments. What kind of impact will that have on 2013 earnings? Is there going to be sort of a waiting down? Should we be looking at something in the mid-single digits next year as well because you are derisking a significant amount of securities?","Daniel P. Amos","Well, I want to make one other comment. This is Dan going back to your first question. Number one, is one reason, the competitor's hadn't been in the business is because it has the health insurance element and most life insurance companies have not been comfortable with the health insurance element that's in there. Therefore, it's given us an enormous competitive advantage that very few had been offering it. And also, I just want to mention that the profit margin is around 18%. So it's a great profit margin on that if you include the discounted advanced premium.","Kriss Cloninger","They're -- and they're actually competing with us with the product that we prefer not to sell. There's really no other product like WAYS in the marketplace.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. I mean, they were arguing that -- they argued that they could tack on some type of the health benefits but maybe they can't. I don't know.","Daniel P. Amos","Well, all we know is we're doing great with what we're doing, and we're making an 18% profit margin. We're very happy with it, and we're glad we're selling the hell out of it.","Kriss Cloninger","Was the last question related to the duration of investments? I'm kind of...","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just quickly wanted -- you just said you can invest longer, so I just wanted to get a quick number, like what's the duration of the investments tied to the WAYS product?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, it's 20 years or less, typically.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel of Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones, if I could. I know there's been a lot of talk about the premium levels and the margins, et cetera, of WAYS, relative to maybe the medical or cancer products. Maybe the easier way to get at this, and I'm not sure if you'd be willing to do it, but I'll ask anyways is maybe you can help us understand the ROE characteristics of WAYS relative to cancer and medical. I assume the ROE is lower. But I guess the question is just how much lower. Maybe capital required per premium dollar or something like that.","Kriss Cloninger","The capital requirements -- we pay lower commissions on WAYS, John, than we do on the medical. So we don't have a major difference in invested capital. I'd say the payback period or the so-called breakeven period on the statutory or regulatory accounting basis would be about 7 years, which might make ROE somewhat less than our basic health products which break even after maybe 3 or 4 years. But with that kind of profit margin, the ROEs are somewhat less than the health products but not a tremendous amount. We're still getting ROEs in excess of cost of capital certainly and that approximate our average. They're not going to bring down our average ROE very much, if at all.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a quick one. Just thinking about cash flow and obviously the higher level of losses might bring down the repatriation. Just want to get a sense for where the holding company's cash balance was at the end of 2011.","Kriss Cloninger","All right. We were, I think around $380 million or so, I'm trying to remember that...","Unknown Executive","That sounds $385 million.","Kriss Cloninger","About $385 million down from last year where we were about $685 million or so.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","But there's no upcoming debt maturities like there was in 2011, correct?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, we have a JPY 30 billion samurai note due in June that we've been investigating alternatives to refinancing that and considering other options that we think we can easily refinance that activity. I'll say we actually planned for the cash at the holding company, to be somewhat less than it is now. But we did forego taking 2 of the quarterly dividends from the life company to the holding company in 2011 and that brought our cash position down somewhat at the holding company. I think I mentioned on the last call, yes, the last call or the June call that we were doing a lot more cash flow analysis and a lot more cash flow projections and looking at the different levers we can pull to maintain adequate cash position at the various levels of the company, and have some alternative strategies in place that will interface with our capital management program. I will tell you that we also contributed $40 million to the group company, CAIC, during 2011 to support the substantial growth that we have there. You didn't ask anything about the U.S., but U.S. sales were up quite a bit in 2012. And the significant part of that came out of the success of our Aflac group operations.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess, that begs sort of an interesting follow-up. I mean, I think historically or in recent calls, you guys have talked about or, Kriss, you've talked about 20% of annual earnings, operating earnings or net income required to support organic growth. Is it safe to assume -- I assume that it's safe to assume -- sorry -- that given the substantial growth in 2011, it was much higher than 20%, correct?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, most of the organic growth came out of Japan. And -- but I think that 20% would not be substantially affected by the volume of business necessarily because if the growth's there, 20% of the same volume would be about right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Schuman of KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","A couple of follow-ups for Kriss. First of all on the repatriation, I wondering how that relates to share repurchase. I think you had earlier suggested 2012 share repurchase could be maybe ballpark $600 million. I assumed that figured somehow into the EPS guidance. Should we think of that as being at risk at this point? How should we think about that in light of the uncertainty around repatriation?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, I mentioned earlier, Jeff, that at the end of the third quarter, we had forecast our repatriation through kind of as of the March 31, 2012 FSA statements, which is the time that the fiscal year end in Japan is the time that we set that repatriation. And normally, we target approximately 80% of our net earnings on FSA basis after tax. And the impairments we took in the fourth quarter for Aflac Japan investments caused us to revise our estimates of repatriation down from $45 billion which might have given us $600 million at then exchange rates to about $25 billion if we have no additional material net realized losses during the first quarter of 2012. Now, I don't know whether we're going to have the realized losses or not. Eric's still continuing to posture the portfolio and if we decide that it's in the best interest of the company to sell or impair additional securities, we may have more realized losses. And we may reduce repatriation or at least repatriate-able earnings. And then we'll have to take a look at the solvency margin in Japan and try to decide whether that's an appropriate level to satisfy the policyholders and the regulators in Japan. And that is a solvency margin that we're comfortable with relative to our position within the other countries in the industry. Our story all along, Jeff, since the fall of 2008 has been that we believe that our best strategy to make it through the financial crisis is to continue having solid earnings growth which we've done. Our operating earnings have continued really without a blip. And those earnings have contributed enough capital to the company to be able to absorb all the investment losses we've been able to take. And in 2010, we were -- 2011, we were comfortable enough to resume share repurchase and did in fact, to repurchase 6 million shares or so last year. Now, where we go in 2012 is going to be a function primarily of the investment losses we take. We're comfortable with that the operating earnings we're going to generate are going to be there. They're probably going to be in excess of our projections given the good sales activity we've had going on both in Japan and the U.S. relative to what those sales were back when I was making the projections before the last FAB meeting. So we'll update those numbers for you in May and take a look and let you know. But all I can tell you is, right now, I'm thinking that it depends on the level of the realized losses, and the operating earnings portion of it is going to be there.","Daniel P. Amos","The statement I want to make is, is that if we didn't buy any stock back, we can still make the range. But our goal is to have JPY 25 billion available to be able to buy stock back with. That's the most important thing I want to mention.","Kriss Cloninger","Internally, I'm saying we're managing toward that. And if we can achieve it, that'll be good. But if we don't, it's not the end of the earth because that doesn't mean we're going to have an earnings miss [ph] in 2012.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the other thing I want to just follow on quickly was the WAYS' ROE. You gave us a couple of bookends that were really far apart. I think you talked about it, earning more than cost of capital which I assume we would all agree is probably low double digits for you, but then you said probably close to ROE which is I think 2011 was 28%. So that's a really big range. I know you don't want to give specific number, but I mean, which is it really close to, the cost of capital or your consolidated ROE?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, that's a difficult question for me to answer because I don't price our products on an ROE basis. And ROE's influenced by the level of investment losses you have and the like and what your equity position is. Now you have to get into the whole list of things about what are we talking about, are we going to compare net earnings to equity including unrealized gains and losses or we're going to talk about operating return on equity where we exclude investment losses and we exclude realized gains and losses and I don't sit around spend a lot of time worrying about that. I worry about the fundamental profitability of our products as a percent of premium. And if I can sell products with double-digit profit margins, I figure that I've got it covered for the most part. So that's just our internal perspective.","Robin Y. Wilkey","I'm going to interject now. I see that it is already past the top of the hour, but considering the number of people in line to ask questions, we're going to extend to 10:15. So you can go ahead with the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Randy Binner of FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division",".","I just got a quick follow-up on the buyback. I think previously, Kriss, had talked about in 2013, JPY 90 billion to JPY 95 billion of repatriation. So how does everything that's been talked about so far affect how you might be able to look ahead to 2013 in those levels of yen repatriation and thus buyback?","Kriss Cloninger","Well, the JPY 90 billion to JPY 95 billion, those are our projected operating earnings before any investment, realized investment losses in 2013. The JPY 45 billion that I talked about at the end of the last quarter are already reflected the realized losses we had taken during the first 6 months of the fiscal period in Japan for the year ended 3\/31\/2012. So the JPY 45 billion reflected the investment losses we had in the second, third quarter this year. So that' how you got down. JPY 95 billion is close to the run rate of operating earnings for fiscal 2012 in Japan, but then we have the realized losses. The other JPY 95 billion for 2013 would just be close to the operating earnings, assuming no additional realized losses. So that's where those numbers came from.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","All right. So without further credit loss in 2013, we can -- we should be able to try and model for much higher buybacks in 2013 versus what we'll be able to expect again in 2012, is that fair?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes, that's fair. Keep it in mind that we really don\u2019t become eligible to take the repatriation out until March 14. March 14, that's when -- that's the final date of the financial statement. And then as  a practical matter, we don\u2019t file it till May or so and we have to reflect any losses that occur prior to the date of the filing and that   could affect things. So we've become more certain we're going to get the money, but we don\u2019t get the money until accounting period is over. Kind of thing, we can't pull it out as we go along. I suppose, we could arrange to finance anticipated share repurchase. But I've been reluctant to do that because of the changing nature of the investment climate throughout the world. I would say that our primary priority is supporting the shareholder dividends, making sure we got enough money for that and then share repurchases. Our second priority in terms of returning money to shareholders.","Operator","Our next question is from Joanne Smith of Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","I just want to talk about your past history in terms of your way of reserving for relatively new product, and how that kind of runs through profits over time. So in the past, you have always put up a little bit more reserve or pads or whatever for new products because there's this uncertainty around how the profit is going to emerge. And then that tends to be conservative and then you're able to take down some of those reserves over time as the benefit ratios come in and you're more comfortable with the profitability of the product. Is that one of the ways that we should look at the WAYS product now, because it's new and it's different that you're being a little bit conservative on the reserving, and so, over time, we should see more profit emerge?","Kriss Cloninger","It's not quite as true to the level of the health products, Joanne, and the reason is that prior to the age at which the policyholder has the options. It's primarily a life insurance accumulation contract. You tend to accumulate cash until the so-called Y age which is the age at which the policyholder has the opportunity to elect the option to continue the product, as life benefits or to take out cash or move the health benefits or annuity benefits. So the WAYS product is more inter sensitive than a typical health product because it builds cash to that retirement age. And then at the retirement age, when they elect the options, they elect the options at the price at which we offer products at that time. So the policyholder doesn't really know, and we don't have to commit to the price we're going to sell them health benefits at 15 years from now. We don't have to commit to that today. So we've got the option and the protection of doing that. Now on the health products, you're right. We tend to be a little bit more conservative in the early years. If we don't have a good track record or a good handle on where the health claims are going to come out based on who utilizes our distribution channel to buy those products. So we start out being a little conservative and then as we gain confidence over a couple of years, we'll introduce a new version of the product and develop new reserve assumptions that reflect our experience to date and probably have a little less element of conservatism and therefore, the old products would have more provisions for adverse deviation to release in the future. But it's a little bit different story on the WAYS product.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","And just a follow-up for Eric. With respect to your looking at new investment opportunities throughout the world. One of the problems is obviously that you have so much liabilities denominated in yen. So when you look around the world for opportunities, will you only consider things that can be denominated in yen? And does that limit that opportunity set?","Eric M. Kirsch","Terrific question. First, as you know, through the private placement structure, that's exactly right. We end up with a yen denominated asset with no risk to currency fluctuations. As we look at new strategies beyond privates, which is an objective because we have a big portfolio of privates. One of our objectives which will come out from the asset allocation project is to have more public traded bonds but on a global basis. So you're right, in order to do that, we need to focus on the currency risk, and our objective would be to have minimal currency risk relative to our liabilities and particularly in Japan. So we would be exploring, if we were to invest around the world in more publicly traded securities, what hedging vehicles or strategies would we need to employ to ensure we're not taking on currency risk so that it's better matched to our liabilities and our base currency. So that will be determined and analyzed as part of our project and later on this year, as I said, when we would move to implementation, we will have that all factored in and be able to articulate that more.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Eric, just a quick follow-up and then I'm done. In the past, management has been very reluctant to hedge currency risk.  And I'm wondering if this is something that you think you can do without taking on substantial financial risk? Or is it more of a diversification of exposures strategy?","Eric M. Kirsch","Well, I think we can potentially achieve both. But that's the scope of the asset allocation, ALM. And I just said, capital management program. We certainly want to achieve diversification in our balance sheet on a global basis, and we certainly want to understand all the different types of investment risk that we could take or could be exposed to. So those investment risk include interest rate risk, sector risk, concentration risk, how different asset classes correlate with each other. But within those risks, could be currency risk. And I don't feel that we should be an investor in currencies in terms of taking that as an active risk. Our liabilities, particularly for our Japan branch, are based in Japan, and we should minimize that risk by ensuring the asset strategies match up well versus the liabilities. So as we do this project, we will actually be able to measure and quantify those potential exposures and what would be the effect of a hedging strategy if we employ more assets globally and in publicly traded bonds. So we would have a metric on given different scenarios of what can happen in the currency markets or the credit markets or the financial markets. What the hedge is on? How would that potentially impact our investment results, our capital position. So we would not move forward unless we had that fully quantified. And we understood fully the potential for those risk.","Robin Y. Wilkey","It's 10:15. It's 10:15 now, so we're going to have one more quick question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I want to follow up and then a quick one for Paul, if he's still there. Kriss, the timing -- the amount that you can take out in May or June is based on the net income of Japan for the year ended this March. Is that correct?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes, that's correct.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then assuming everything is clear, which you can -- I think you said 2014, but what you can take out in 2013, is based on the year ended in March of 2013, is that correct?","Kriss Cloninger","Yes. I probably got the year off there.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. You said 2014, I just wanted to clear that up. And then for Paul, it seemed -- talking about the group business through the brokers is still nascent, still in its infancy. If you can talk about what's going on there because I think that's going to be, that has the potential for being a huge delta. And we're only 1 year into it, if we're talking in this time next year, is that the time to really see whether or not this is successful?","Paul S. Amos","Yes, the book to market has certainly been success over the last several years. As I've mentioned in previous calls, it is a relationship business that takes time for us to be successful. There's no doubt that the large majority of our success in the group business was a balance between not only what we're seeing in the broker market, but also our field force. I think there was pent-up demand among accounts as well as some of our sales force to actually go out and write group business and accounts over 100.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Let me stop you, Paul. I understand it's been very successful through the traditional agent. I'm much more interested in the alphabet houses.","Paul S. Amos","I'm getting there. The alphabet houses themselves continues to be slow. We have done -- our greatest success with the smaller regional brokers and in terms of the national brokers, we know that those relationships have the longest tail to them and are taking the longest for us to develop. We do feel that we're making progress, and we're making some additional changes and investments in order to grow that further. Whether or not 12 months from now, we're going to see significant premium, I think that it will be much improved over where it is today. That said, I think it's still too early to tell how that's going to go. That said, broker sales on the whole for last year were up 18%. So I feel very good about the success of our broker strategy, but I would like to see us become more successful in the top end of that broker strategy, and we're putting the things in place now to make sure that happens for the long term.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So a year from now yay or still too early? If we're here a year from now talking about this.","Paul S. Amos","A year from now is going to be better than it is today, how exponential versus linear that is, I can't tell you. My hope is for exponential but linear may be a reality. Just give me until May and I can talk to you a little more of that.","Robin Y. Wilkey","Thank you. All right, this concludes our conference call this morning. Thank you for joining us.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Young, Vice President of Aflac Investor & Rating Agency Relations.","David Young","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter call. This morning, we will be hearing remarks from Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated, about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Then, Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated, will follow with more details about our financial results. ","In addition, joining us this morning during the Q&A portion are members of our management team in the United States. Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; Eric Kirsch, Global Chief Investment Officer; Rich Williams, Chief Distribution Officer; Al Riggieri, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary; and Max Brod\u00e9n, Treasurer and Head of Corporate Development.","We are also joined by members of our executive management team in Tokyo at Aflac Life Insurance Japan; Charles Lake, Chairman and Representative Director; President of Aflac International, Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director; Todd Daniels, Director and Principal Financial Officer; Koji Ariyoshi, Director and Head of Sales and Marketing.","Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature.","Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our Annual Report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. The earnings release is available on the Investors page of Aflac's Web site at investors.aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures.","I'll now hand the call over to Dan. Dan?","Daniel Amos","Thank you, David. Good morning and thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2019 established a solid foundation as we set out to achieve our annual objectives. Let me give you more details beginning with Japanese operations. Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor, generated strong financial results that are in line with our expectations for the quarter.","For 2019, we continue to expect a slight decline in Aflac Japan\u2019s total earned premium primarily due to the limited-pay policy reaching paid-up status. As you saw in the release, third sector combined with first sector protection sales were down low-single digit in the first quarter, but generally in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success as do our alliance partners. While cancer insurance sales were up for the quarter with strength in our associates\u2019 channel, results were weaker at Japan Post as they achieved their 2018 fiscal year targets early. Both Daido and Dai-ichi increased cancer sales in the final quarter of the Japanese fiscal year.","As for medical sales, we focused on riders in the medical area to retain and attract new customers with midterm riders. Policyholders can update their existing medical coverage by adding a rider to their existing policy. They also have the option to purchase a new policy with an income support rider targeting young and middle-aged segment or a nursing rider designed for the middle-to-older age groups. While this strategy is effective in driving better overall economics in earned premium, it\u2019s less beneficial to the sales versus replacement of the whole policy.","As you know, we take a longer-term perspective looking forward to the remainder of the year, let me just say that we anticipate making our annual sales objective. Last year, beginning in the second quarter, we had a very successful launch of our new cancer insurance product which drove a 16% increase in third sector sales for the second quarter of 2018. This makes a very difficult comparison.","We want to make sure you understand that we expect third sector and first sector protection combined sales to be down in the high teens in the second quarter of '19. This means that we expect those sales in the first half to be down in the high-single digits. Having said that though, we anticipate a strong second half and more importantly we expect to achieve our annual sales objective of a mid- to single-digit decline in the third sector and first sector protection sales for the year.","Ultimately, our focus remains on maintaining our leadership in the third sector products while complementing this core business with similarly profitable first sector protection products. To that end, we will continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduce innovative new products that our policyholders want and need and where they will want to purchase them.","Finally, with respect to Japan Post and our alliance, you may recall that at the end of the February, we announced in the filing that Japan Post Holdings formed a trust that permits the trustees to purchase Aflac Incorporated shares. We continue to anticipate the completion of the regulatory approvals in the second half of 2019.","As we have mentioned previously, we view 2019 as more of a year of planning around opportunities for Aflac and Japan Post Holdings companies to collaborate. When I was in Tokyo last month, I met with the CEO of Japan Post Holdings along with the senior executives of both companies. We had very productive meetings to work toward areas that are mutually beneficial to both parties. As we told you, 2019 is a year of planning and 2020 will be more of an execution on our plans.","Turning to Aflac U.S., our revenues increased 2.2%. At the same time, pre-tax earnings continued to reflect ongoing investments in our platform, distribution, and customer experience. U.S. sales were up 1.5%, which was in line with our expectation for the quarter. Aflac is unique with respect to our peers and that the majority of our sales comes from independent sales agents.","We are fortunate to be represented by such a strong field force, which is truly distinctive within our industry. These independent career sales agents are best positioned within the industry to assess and therefore succeed with smaller employers and groups with fewer than 100 employees.","Aflac\u2019s agents have always enhanced their collaboration with local and regional brokers as we continue to grow broker sales, while our team of broker sales professionals have taken and made great strides in enhancing our relationship with the large broker community.","Brokers have recognized more and more that their clients need the types of products Aflac offers. This has increased the appeal and therefore the interest in doing business with Aflac. With the continued growth of our broker business, our sales have been increasingly skewed toward fourth quarter with the continued growth of the broker business and we expect 2019 to be no different.","We were also pleased with the continued improvement in productivity in the quarter. At the same time, net earned premium rose 2.4% and we continue to expect Aflac U.S. to deliver solid results in 2019 with earned premium growth in the 2% to 3% range. Ultimately, we believe the investments we\u2019ve made in our distribution and customer experience will promote increased productivity, stable persistency, and improved long-term economics.","While Fred will address capital deployment in more details, we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our bondholders, shareholders, and policyholders. At the same time, we\u2019re balancing our financial strength with reinvesting in our business, increasing the dividend, and repurchasing our shares.","Through Aflac Incorporated subsidiaries in Japan and the United States, we have the privilege of helping provide financial protection to more than 50 million people. In both countries, we have earned our position as the leading supplemental insurer by paying cash fast when our policyholders get sick or injured.","Looking ahead, we believe that our strong earnings growth will reflect the underlying earnings power of our insurance operations in Japan and the United States. It will also reflect our prudent approach to deploying excess capital in a way that balances the interest of all stakeholders. At the same time, it will reflect our dedication to delivering on the promises that we made to our policyholders.","Now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Fred to cover the financial results. Fred?","Fredrick Crawford","Thank you, Dan. We are off to a strong start to the year on the earnings front as results for the quarter exceeded our expectations. Adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share benefitted from strong margins both in Japan and the U.S. Our reported results were modestly impacted by a weakening of the yen as compared to the 2018 period reducing our earnings by approximately $0.01 per share in the quarter.","The quarter\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate of 25.5% includes the tax treatment of equity compensation under GAAP that contributed roughly $0.01 to our adjusted earnings per share. When normalized, our effective tax rate of 26.3% came in as expected and represents a blended rate based on our current mix of Japan earnings taxed at 28% and U.S. earnings taxed at 21%.","Turning to our Japan segment results, earned premium for our third sector products increased 1.8% and in line with our expectations. With continued headwinds from paid-up first sector products, overall earned premium growth was down nearly 1% in the quarter.","As we move through the year, the earned premium impact from paid-up policies will remain stable. The first sector WAYS paid-up impact will gradually reduce throughout 2019. However, a portion of our medical sales in 2017 was a newly introduced Two Pay [ph] product which was popular in the bank channel and will have a slight impact to third sector earned premium growth for the remainder of 2019. Overall, it\u2019s important to note that this strain to the top line does not impact profitability.","Our total benefit ratio came in at 69.1% and at the lower end of our annual guidance range driven by a favorable third sector benefit ratio and the continued shift in business mix from first sector towards third sector which carries a lower benefit ratio.","Our expense ratio in Japan was 20.2% consistent with our projected range. While year-over-year our expense ratio increased, expenses came in below our forecast due to the timing of sales promotions and lower DAC expense as lapse experience was better than expected. Our expense ratio outlook for the year remains in the range of 19.5% to 21.5%.","Net investment income in our Japan segment contributed to our strong results. While no one area drove the outperformance, continued favorable returns in our floating rate loan portfolio, modestly lower hedge cost and variable income from our building alternative investment portfolio contributed to results. Overall, in Japan, we recorded a very strong pre-tax profit margin of 21.9% with all key earnings drivers coming in better than our forecast.","Turning to the U.S. results, earned premium was up a steady 2.4%. Our total benefit ratio came in at 49.3% at the lower end of our annual guidance range and generally consistent with recent claims trends and our mix of business. Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 36.3%.","Breaking down the expense ratio further, DAC amortization was elevated in the quarter reflecting natural growth, mix of business and adjustments related to lapse experience in truing up previous estimates.","In terms of general operating expenses, this quarter benefitted from timing of spend which we expect to build throughout the year. Our expense ratio outlook for the year remains in the range of 35% to 37%. Net investment income performance was in line with expectations and reflects our continued movement of excess capital out of the U.S. to the holding company.","In our corporate segment, the main driver of improved earnings year-over-year is net investment income and amortized hedge income. Investment income benefitted from the movement of capital and increased liquidity at the holding company.","Our corporate hedging program reduces our economic exposure to the yen, while lowering enterprise-wide hedge costs. Amortized hedge income contributed $20 million on a pre-tax basis to the quarter\u2019s earnings with a notional position of just over 2.5 billion.","As you may have noticed, we have added disclosures in our financial supplement with additional detail on our corporate hedging program and associated amortized hedge income.","Capital remains strong. Japan\u2019s solvency margin ratio is estimated in the 950% range. In April, we issued \u00a530 billion of hybrid debt out of our Japan subsidiary which receives regulatory capital treatment at a very low cost to capital. We estimate that this will contribute approximately 20 points to SMR and is another example of financial flexibility stemming from the conversion of our Aflac Japan from a branch to a subsidiary.","Our estimated U.S.-only risk-based capital ratio at quarter end is now in the 700% range. RBC is a bit elevated as we have planned increases in operating dividends and the drawdown of $500 million of excess capital scheduled for later this year as we target 500%.","We ended the quarter with nearly 2.5 billion of capital and liquidity at the holding company. Asset quality remains strong with very little in the way of impairments in the quarter. Following a solid recovery in pricing, we elected to sell our entire $146 million position in PG&E realizing a small gain in the quarter. We had previously impaired our position in the fourth quarter by $21 million.","In the quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares for approximately $490 million. This amount was elevated as we tactically accelerated repurchase early in the quarter. We are maintaining our current range for repurchase of 1.3 billion to 1.7 billion in 2019.","In closing, we\u2019re off to a solid start both in Japan and in the U.S. And I\u2019ll now hand the call over to David to begin the Q&A session. David?","David Young","Thank you, Fred. Before we take your questions, let me just ask you to please limit yourself to one initial question and a follow up. You can always get back in the queue. And we\u2019ll now take the first question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question is from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O\u2019Neill. You may now ask your questions.","John Barnidge","Yes. So productivity in the U.S. was rather strong for 1Q. What do you see as the driver for this and are these digital investments that you\u2019re making already yielding? And if that\u2019s what the driver of productivity is, can you maybe talk about some examples?","Teresa White","I\u2019ll start off. This is Teresa. What we\u2019re seeing is, yes, those are \u2013 the digital investments are assisting us with \u2013 especially on the broker side of the business with enrollment tools that allow us to be more productive on that side of the business. We\u2019re also seeing additional productivity based on product offerings \u2013 portfolio offerings that we have. If you recall, we introduced some life products and we expanded our portfolio with life and disability to help us to improve some of the \u2013 be able to see more people and also to be able to respond to more RFPs. And so we are seeing a number of the investments that we\u2019ve done not just in digital investments but also investments in product to help us to be more productive in the market. I\u2019ll let Rich talk \u2013 if you have anything else, Rich?","Rich Williams","Teresa, I think you said that well. The only thing I would add to it is the engagement of our veteran associates has been very positive for us. They\u2019ve adopted the training and our technology solutions with Everwell. And so, I think part of the productivity is driven by our veteran associates.","Teresa White","Absolutely.","John Barnidge","And then my follow-up question sticking with U.S. We\u2019ve just completed the first tax filing season post reform. Can you talk about any behavioral changes either on individuals or business owners that stand out for distribution? Thank you very much.","Daniel Amos","Do you want to take that, Rich?","Rich Williams","I think the short answer is we have not seen any meaningful changes, and it\u2019s continued to be business as usual.","John Barnidge","Thanks for the answer.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Dally","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on Japan sales. I appreciate the color on Japan Post being down as they previously hit their budget. My question is whether this decline was anticipated when you set your sales growth guidance, whether the results this quarter make any full year sales growth guidance perhaps a little more challenging? Also you seem bullish on the prospects of the second half. Did anything change there to drive that optimism or was that always your expectation?","Daniel Amos","Koji? Who wants to answer that?","Koji Ariyoshi","[Interpreted]This is Koji. I will answer your question. As Dan mentioned in his speech, because Japan Post or JP at January to March was their very last quarter of the fiscal year, they focused on the sales of the proprietary product sales. And from April this year this is the start of the new fiscal year for JP. So now they are starting to sell more cancer insurance products. However, what is different from last year is that even though their quarter is at the fiscal year\u2019s starting, they will be selling their cancer insurance more in an equalized manner than compared to last year, instead it was really focusing on just a particular quarter. So, as a result, we are expecting that JP will still be negative at the end of the second quarter. However, since last year JP has been working on improving the productivity such as to really strengthen the sales skills, and they have also been accumulating a very efficient motivation increasing efforts. And we do believe that their sales and performance will increase in the second half by leveraging all of these efforts that they have been working on. Now, going on to the associates\u2019 channel, the second quarter last year was when we had a very large increase in the third sector sales because of the new cancer product launch last year, and we are expecting that the second quarter this year will be negative because of the reason that I have mentioned as well as the long consecutive holidays for our Emperor\u2019s Accession Enthronement this year. However, at the end of the second quarter, there will be further revision of a medical insurance although we are not able to disclose the details at this point. However, we are expecting that we will have an increase in the third quarter because we will be launching a very effective commercial together with associated direct mails; and then starting with that, our sales activities will increase. As a result, we will have a good third quarter si our expectation. So, as a result, associated with the guidelines that we have \u2013 our guidance that we have indicated at the beginning of the year, we will end in a single mid-range negative figure. That is a combined number of associates and JP channel. That\u2019s it for me.","Daniel Amos","Nigel, the one thing that you asked the question was and I want to be clear is, is that nothing\u2019s changed. We expected this. So as we were preparing for the first quarter relief, we realized we needed to make sure everyone else understood that. But when I saw the 16% coming in last year, I knew oh-oh in 2019 it\u2019s going to be a big hurdle and how we\u2019re going to offset it? And the answer was even going back to the second quarter of last year, we\u2019re going to have a great second half of 2019 and so we\u2019re on plan to do that.","Nigel Dally","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Second question is just on investments incorporating floating rate securities being an important part of the change in the portfolio mix. Now future rate increases looking less likely. Any implications of that expected both positive and negative, but hoping you can flesh that out?","Fe1","Sure. Thanks, Nigel. And as a reminder relative to Fed rate changes, it really impacts not only the floating rate assets but the hedging strategy as well because they\u2019re correlated with LIBOR which obviously is heavy influenced by Fed action. But to be specific to your question, I\u2019ll break it into two buckets. For 2019, we expect very little impact to our forecast and income from Fed action and that\u2019s for two reasons. One, you\u2019ll recollect at our outlook call and we talked about hedge cost. We locked in about 85% of our 2019 hedge cost by terming them out. So in essence regardless of what happens to hedge cost, most of our hedge cost will be locked in if the Fed should lower rates, for instance. Secondly, on the floating rate assets just from a mechanical standpoint if the Fed is lowering rates and LIBOR is going down, that would certainly impact our coupons when they reset. However, in late December we had put on an income hedge in essence of fixed or floating rate swap because we had saw the change in the Fed\u2019s view going from hawkish to dovish, so about 75% of our floating rate income is locked in as well because we did the hedge. So that\u2019s why at my first part of the statement, regardless of what the Fed does this year, our income actually from the floating rate portfolio including the hedge cost will be relatively stable and within a tight range. The second bucket though is when you look out to 2020. Obviously when we redo our budget at the end of this year to reflect 2020 if LIBOR continues to go down and the Fed should be cutting rates, that would get reflected in the floating rate income but also get reflected in the mark to market of the hedge cost. And if you recollect, the whole concept of the floating strategy is you should always think of those two buckets together; the floating rate securities what the hedge is. And in essence we\u2019re earning a nice net spread. So there would be some impact in 2020 if the Fed were to continue to lower rates and if LIBOR goes down assuming no other factors change. And of course the opposite is true. We don\u2019t know exactly what will happen. We just saw a good print for GDP this morning. So if rates should be rising, we\u2019d get the opposite impact which certainly we saw in 2018 in our results.","Nigel Dally","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Nadel of UBS. Your line is now open.","John Nadel","Good morning. I have a couple of quick ones. First, it sounded in your opening remarks, Dan, like Japan Post actually doesn\u2019t yet have everything in place to begin purchasing Aflac shares. Did I hear that right? And if I did, when do you expect that they\u2019ll actually get the approvals needed to get that process started?","Daniel Amos","I\u2019m going to let Fred take that because he\u2019s been working with them.","Fredrick Crawford","Yes. The way to interpret Dan\u2019s comments are as follows. One is, as we may have mentioned I think or made public a few months ago, Japan Post has established the trust which now allows them to move forward on the purchasing of stock when they\u2019re prepared to do so. Dan\u2019s comment was related to ongoing regulatory approvals that are required particularly in the U.S. that will go on through deeper into the year. This is essentially the Form A process in various states that they need to go through. That however doesn\u2019t prohibit their ability to start the process of building shares. They simply needed to get the trust in place. And then of course it\u2019s entirely up to them and their tactics as to how and when they begin purchasing. And we\u2019re sort of leaving that up to them of course. So that\u2019s the way to interpret it, John.","John Nadel","Okay. Can you actually tell us whether maybe you know, maybe you don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ve actually started purchasing or no?","Fredrick Crawford","The answer is no, I can\u2019t tell you and no I don\u2019t know. And that is somewhat by design in the sense that we other than the provisions of the alliance, for example, the one year provision that starts from the beginning of them purchasing shares and building to the 7% ownership level, we\u2019re treating them as any other institutional investor which means we\u2019re not in a position to either know and\/or report out on what they\u2019re doing relative to building the position. What I would say is this though. It\u2019s an obvious question that we would receive and we know that. And so what we would do is refer you to any disclosures that Japan Post makes as part of their registered environment with the Tokyo Stock Exchange or any other disclosures they choose to make. And so we\u2019ll be paying attention to that. But otherwise we are treating them as any other institutional investor in that regard.","John Nadel","Got you. Thank you. And then my second question is just around expenses. It sounded also from your prepared remarks like you\u2019re expecting that the pace of spending I think both in Japan but in particular in the U.S. will pick up as we move through the year. So I just wanted to confirm whether that\u2019s what you\u2019re actually foreshadowing? And then also specific to the U.S. you talked about DAC amortization being a bit higher. Is that a level that we should expect now on a go-forward basis or was there some reason why that\u2019s unusual in 1Q?","Fredrick Crawford","Yes, let me answer both and give you more perspective, you and everybody else on the call. And that is, so from the standpoint of expenses it is a timing-related area and the quarter did in fact benefit from the timing of expenses which by default means that these expenses will start the process of building and running through in the latter part of the year. To be more specific, in the U.S. our estimates are that expenses ran approximately $20 million better than we had anticipated and therefore we would expect the build of that or shift of that expense into future periods. There is nothing necessarily unusual about this. It\u2019s what I would call the normal timing related to the picking up of various initiatives and spend related to that. Staying on the U.S. and answering your DAC question, we did see elevated DAC expense in the quarter. It\u2019s not unusual for DAC expense to be elevated in the first quarter. You\u2019ll see that in some of our supplemental information and that\u2019s because you have a natural level of higher lapsation in the first quarter due to annual enrollment dynamics. And so each year you\u2019ll notice that our benefit ratio tends to be a bit lower in the first quarter and our DAC amortization higher and that\u2019s the result of increased lapsation, particularly as we start to change the mix of business towards group and larger groups, you\u2019ll see that perhaps a little bit more pronounced. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving DAC expense up. We also had a little bit of what I would call cleanup, if you will, related to estimates we made around DAC amortization on certain groups that we anticipated lapsing or that had lapsed late in the year in December and we had to true-up those estimates. That probably kicked up our DAC expense in the U.S. by about $5 million. So back on the delayed expense issue to Japan, Japan also had that dynamic. It was largely revolving around promotional spend and we estimate that about \u00a51.6 billion, okay, of delay, if you will. In other words, we had anticipated \u00a51.6 billion more of expense related to promotion. That will shift into the later quarters. And then finally on corporate, corporate expenses were also a bit below our estimate and that actually has more to do with the pace of spend on the new accounting adoption. As many companies are doing in our industry, we\u2019re having to adopt the new accounting and we\u2019re starting into the more significant project spend related to that. In fact, we anticipate that spend being pre-tax around $20 million to $25 million in 2019 and that will start to pick up as we go through the year. So if you want me to wrap it all in a bow for you, we would estimate that the quarter benefitted by approximately $0.04 a share related to these expense timing issues.","John Nadel","That\u2019s all extremely helpful and I guess full employment DAC per --","Fredrick Crawford","Yes, right.","John Nadel","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to Japan sales, particularly the cancer product. I get the drop off from Japan Post but I thought that the second quarter '18 launch was sort of characterized as a new product and it sounds like your second half '19 recovery is also tied to a medical product. So my question is, is this sales cycle for a new product really that short that you get most of the sales associated with the new product in the first couple of quarters sort of requiring you guys to refresh on that kind of annual basis?","Daniel Amos","I\u2019m going to let Koji talk but I want to remind you that part of the reason that it\u2019s changed somewhat is due to this new writer concept. We would write a new policy and they would then lapse their old one. And now what is more efficient and better for the company and for the policyholders is to have writers. So, Koji, why don\u2019t you discuss that for a moment? And if there\u2019s anything else, I\u2019ll be glad to answer too.","Koji Ariyoshi","First of all in the second quarter, we once again revised medical insurance which we also had in the first quarter. But as you know compared with any other companies, Aflac has the largest number of medical policies. And so although the competition is very tough and it\u2019s important that we increase the number of new businesses, but then it is also important for us to protect our current existing policies, especially because most of the policies are whole life policies and what means is that depending on customer\u2019s life state, the needs change and the customer\u2019s status of health also change. So what we are doing now is considering all these factors, we are developing these writers that the customer really wants to buy depending on the life stage, for example, thinking of the health state of particular age customers. And this writer strategy is a part of this positive thing for customers and this also aligns with our core value of Aflac. And when the existing policy is lapsed and the new policy is purchased, the premium normally goes up. And with this new writer strategy what we are able to do for customers is that the customers will be able to maintain their policies and also just add whatever the coverage is needed with lower premiums. So in the long term what we are thinking is that we are actually responding to what the customers are wanting. And because of this fierce competition, it does cost a lot of money to change product and I would like Todd to really follow up on the economics of what we are doing. Todd?","Todd Daniels","Thank you, Koji. Yes, as Koji mentioned, we\u2019re doing this for benefitting not just the customer but it benefits our economics. We develop these writers that with the midterm writer addition they\u2019re able to add these writers to existing policies that have been issued many years ago. And so with that we don\u2019t have to incur another acquisition expense if we were to issue another base policy. I know you mentioned earlier asking about product lifecycle. We have seen shorter product lifecycles on the medical, particularly because there is lots of competition. But we maintain this past round with issuing the writers that the customers want with holding the base policy premiums consistent with what we had with the prior version of the product. For years we had been repricing product as interest rates change and competitors come in the market to keep up with different benefits and features that customers need, but this time we decided to keep those premium consistent with the prior version. So policyholders would not want to lapse the base policy and buy a newer one which would have a higher premium, so they\u2019re able to enjoy better economics. At the same time we\u2019re able to enjoy better economics by having writers that are cheaper per unit to develop.","Fredrick Crawford","One thing I do want to step in and make a comment about. This is Fred. That entire discussion was surrounding the very important strategy related to our medical product. But when you first asked your question, you were somewhat pointing to cancer product and be very careful about looking at the pattern of sales in cancer over the last several quarters and think of it in terms of the lifecycle of the product. Last year in the second quarter and that was the first time that we refreshed the cancer product of course in four years which means there is substantial advancements in the quality of the product in coverage because of advancements in cancer treatment. It also included a very attractive premium waiver feature which was particularly attractive in the Japan Post channel. And importantly, it was the first time that we meaningfully revised the cancer product in the Japan Post channel. And so you saw a big spike in sales in the sales in the second quarter and then continued strength throughout 2018. You can\u2019t look at the first quarter results in cancer sales in JP in particular in their fourth quarter and think of that as the end of the product cycle. That has more to do with them having reached all of their goals. And so they naturally pivoted towards their proprietary product. They\u2019re going to pivot back to this very attractive cancer product as we go throughout the year and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to give the recovery. So just be careful about looking at those patterns and assume there\u2019s some sort of shorten cancer product cycle.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then my follow up, and that was all very helpful, is do you have data that you can share with us in terms of what percentage of your sales are to existing policyholders in Japan versus new policyholders?","Daniel Amos","Koide?","Masatoshi Koide","Yes. Koide speaking. Roughly speaking, 50% and 50%. The proportion will depend on the timing of the launch of new products, of course, but generally 50% and 50%.","Fredrick Crawford","I\u2019ll just add one thing real quick too on the cancer block. You\u2019ll recall that we\u2019re developing new cancer policies to keep up with treatments for cancer. And it\u2019s in our best interest to offer this to existing policyholders. So part of our marketing campaigns over time have been through direct mails and follow up by our agents to offer them the latest cancer coverage which we think is the best interest of the policyholder.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Also a few questions on Japan sales. Any product enhancements or product expansion in terms of the relationship between you and Japan Post that you\u2019re planning or are you just still selling the same initial cancer product that you launched there?","Daniel Amos","What I would do is ask Koide to talk about the four different groups that have formed within Japan Post. Koide, you want to talk a little bit about that?","Masatoshi Koide","This is Koide from Aflac Japan. As we announced in the strategic alliance released in December last year, our first pillar of the three pillar of the strategic alliance is to work on new collaborative work with JP. And we will be working on four themes; leveraging business technology, new product development cooperation and joint investment into third party or domestic or internationally business expansion together and cooperation with investment. And for all these four themes we have already launched working groups and have started to have discussions. That\u2019s all for me.","Daniel Amos","And so what I would say is, is that we\u2019re proceeding in a very methodical and cautious way to where we can have products and services that will enhance not only our business but also enhance Japan Post business. And it never moves as fast as any of us want, but I\u2019m very pleased with the cooperation on both Aflac Japan\u2019s management team and also what they\u2019re doing with Japan Post. So as I said, 2019 is a year of planning; 2020 will be part of execution in moving forward. So we are working toward that end.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my follow up is just did I hear correctly in one of the responses that you\u2019re revising the medical writer again in 2Q after revising it in 1Q, or did I not understand that correctly? And the reason I ask is are you changing something relative to what you did initially with the launch of that product or is that \u2013 can you elaborate on that?","Daniel Amos","Let\u2019s have Koji.","Koji Ariyoshi","Well, what we are going to do is there are some things that we were not necessarily able to incorporate some of the changes incorporated in the January change of revision. And I\u2019m not able to elaborate on the details because it has not been announced yet. As we try to provide various products based on the needs, we would like to be providing these kind of benefits and coverage depending on the status of customer\u2019s health because our policy life is very long.","Daniel Amos","Let me just say that this is not unusual and that when we\u2019re dealing with our sales people, they come up with ideas and thoughts and we look back to see if there\u2019s anything that we can ultimately make is more sales appealing. So I wouldn\u2019t take into this anything major. This is a minor adjustment. But if it will help our sales people, then we try to work towards that end.","Fredrick Crawford","But just to be clear, this has always been our plan. We\u2019re not redoing anything in June or second quarter in response to our resulted first quarter. This has been our plan all along.","Thomas Gallagher","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMC. Your line is now open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. Good morning. First, I had a question for Eric on just the new money yield. It was up a lot I think 3.29% in Japan and a lot higher than the portfolio yield. So to what extent does this a better rate environment or what I suspected is it\u2019s just the decision to allocate more money I guess to U.S. dollar investments? And would you expect the new money yield to drop as the year goes onwards since the 1Q level?","Eric Kirsch","Thanks, Jimmy. It\u2019s definitely not a function of the rate environment because rates are lower all around the globe, but it is more a reflection of asset allocation. So you\u2019re right on that part. And for Aflac Japan, approximately half \u2013 just a little bit under half went into U.S. dollar assets and a good portion of that went into our loan portfolio, transitional real estate and middle market loans, and those are having average yields from 5.5%, 6% up to 7% on middle market loans. So that\u2019s really the driver of the higher new money yield is really asset allocation. Because from a new money perspective, as you know, yields have been coming down, spreads have gotten tighter. Fortunately for us relative to our income objectives for the year, that\u2019s not a big driver of whether or not we would make our numbers. And the asset allocation I described is within our plan. So there\u2019s nothing that deviated. For the loan portfolio, we start to receive prepayments on those loans and therefore they get reinvested back into dollars. So asset allocation is very much in line with our strategic asset allocation and how the underlying loan portfolios are performing. For the rest of the year, I wouldn\u2019t expect big deviations necessarily subject to of course market yield and any tactical actions we might take if something were to present itself in the market.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then maybe a question for Todd on just the whole policy versus the writer dynamic. Can you sort of give us an idea on what the premiums per policy are if you sell a writer versus selling standalone policy just to be able to assess how much is that weighing on your sales this year?","Todd Daniels","Yes, I\u2019m going to hand it to Koji. They had some numbers and we can refer to this.","Koji Ariyoshi","The writers versus the base policy is 15% to 16% premium, in case of the income support writer is 15% to 16%, in the case of care writer is 15% to 20%.","Todd Daniels","So I think it varies greatly by which writer you\u2019re looking at versus a base policy. And one thing to keep in mind is these writers are limited benefits versus buying the entire base policy. For our income support writer, it\u2019s covering long-term being out of work and supporting your income where this writer that we\u2019ve developed is a lump sum one-time payment. So it\u2019s limited benefits to try to make it more affordable for the customer to purchase this as a writer. Same thing with the care option for the older age people, it\u2019s sold as a lump sum benefit. So the premium\u2019s going to be quite a bit less than if we were to design and develop a true nursing care policy.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And just lastly for Fred. Will the Post be required to file the DSCC [ph] once they get to a 5% stake? I\u2019m assuming they will be, but --?","Fredrick Crawford","Yes. We would expect them to have to obviously follow all of the guidelines associated with reporting.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Fredrick Crawford","To the NYSE, yes.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Greg Peters","Good morning. I was wondering if we could just step back from a big picture perspective and I guess I got to say upfront I realize your U.S. business has a different focus, but I was hoping you could comment on all the recent political rhetoric around the possibility of Medicare for All and what your perspective is on that.","Daniel Amos","I\u2019ll say something and then I\u2019ll see if Teresa. Medicare for All is nothing more in my opinion than some form of what we see in Japan with their national healthcare system. Granted they\u2019ve gone from no deductibles to 10 to 20 into 30. But we have been selling in environments since inception that consumers would own some type of major medical insurance whether it be Blue Cross, Blue Shield to Obama Care to anything that might be out there, because there are costs associated with unexpected expenses that are not covered by any type of Medicare and Medicaid, whatever it might be. So from our standpoint I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change how we address these issues. I do think we will hear a lot about it with the election in 2020. But I don\u2019t think when it all boils down that it\u2019s going to change anything in terms of the way we\u2019re selling now. So I really don\u2019t worry about that from that standpoint. I\u2019m paid to worry, so I do watch it carefully but there\u2019s nothing on the horizon that makes me nervous about that. Teresa?","Teresa White","I think you\u2019ve pretty much summed it up. At the end of the day I think it becomes more apparent to the consumer about their risk and gaps when they have whichever coverage, whether it\u2019s Medicare for All or it\u2019s Blue Cross, Blue Shield as you mentioned. So from that perspective I think the value of our product, the value of what Aflac offers continues to be apparent whichever major medical you have as a consumer.","Daniel Amos","Let me say this. As a company we want everybody to have health insurance.","Teresa White","Absolutely.","Daniel Amos","We\u2019re absolutely for that. We think it\u2019s in the best interest. The costs associated with it are going to be through the roof, because as you know in other countries they have \u2013 they limit medical access on different things. And we would be the first country that would go to a period of where you would have unlimited access with unlimited costs, so the costs associated with it is another issue, a political one in my opinion. But just know we as a company want people to have it because we think we\u2019ve got the product that will help build those gaps that are going to be created in today\u2019s society.","Greg Peters","Thank you for that answer. I guess staying on the same theme of politics, there\u2019s also been rhetoric around share repurchase activity and I\u2019m curious, Dan, at the Board level if you guys are starting to change your thinking around capital allocation as it relates to share repurchase versus say perhaps possibly a dividend or special dividend or anything like that?","Fredrick Crawford","This is Fred. I\u2019ll answer and then Dan can pick up from the Board level. But I think just in terms of capital allocation, obviously after a 36-year track record of increasing the dividend and certainly intending to continue that track record, we feel like we\u2019re in good shape on balancing the dynamics of investing in our business, buying back stock and paying out a common stock dividend. In terms of stock repurchase, it remains a very good investment of the company particularly on a risk-adjusted basis. And it also is the basis upon which we measure up other opportunities, the degree to which other non-organic, for example, opportunities can come into play. I think from the political perspective, the only thing I would generally agree with because I think it\u2019s just good management and that is you don\u2019t \u2013 as a company you don\u2019t deserve to be significantly buying back your stock and frankly paying a high dividend until you first and foremost secure your balance sheet and secure your capital ratios in such a way that you can meet all the promises of your policyholders and frankly meet any obligations you have to your employees, that includes pension obligations. And so there\u2019s elements of it I agree with. However, I don\u2019t see any need to regulate that type of dynamic. I think frankly good management and governance self regulates those issues in my view. So that\u2019s my thinking.","Daniel Amos","And I think our position all along has been a very moderate position. We haven\u2019t been at an extreme on any area. And it\u2019s the extremism that brings the most criticism. And so I think we\u2019re very well positioned. I think we will continue at this pace. The Board will of course constantly review that to see if there\u2019s any areas that they think we should be looking at. But I think if anything you know about our company is we try to look ahead of what the trends are no matter what they might be; political, consumer activism, whatever it might be, to make sure we\u2019re on top of what\u2019s taking place. So I can assure you this is a top of mind subject that we will continue to monitor, but we feel we\u2019re well positioned right now.","Greg Peters","Again, thank you for your answers.","David Young","And that brings us to the top of the hour 10 AM. I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. If you have any other follow up, please feel free to reach out to the Investor & Rating Agency Relations department. We\u2019d be happy to help you out as we can.","And before we end, I want to just remind you that we have our Financial Analyst Briefing in New York on September 25 and I hope you\u2019ll consider joining us then. And we look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
