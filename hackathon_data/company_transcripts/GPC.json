At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sidney G. Jones - Genuine Parts Co.","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2017. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We'll begin today with comments from our President and CEO, Paul Donahue. Paul?","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Thank you, Sid, and let me add my welcome to all of you on the call this morning. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and year end 2016 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance, and then cover the highlights by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for 2017. After that, we'll open the call to your questions.","For some perspective on our performance, total sales in the fourth quarter were up 2.7% to $3.78 billion, while net income was $152.5 million and earnings per share was $1.02 compared to $1.07 in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, total sales were $15.34 billion, which is up slightly, with net income at $687 million and earnings per share at $4.59 compared to $4.63 in 2015.","These results represent the total sales and earnings across our Automotive, Industrial, Office and Electrical operations, which we'll discuss in more detail throughout this call. We executed on many of our initiatives in 2016, and we believe we entered the new year as a stronger, more diversified global distributor. And while there is no question the U.S. sales environment was challenging throughout the year, our international operations in Canada, Mexico and Australasia, outperformed the stronger, more positive results.","In addition, we continue to build on the revenue and cost benefits derived from the growing scale associated with our portfolio of distribution operations, and we remain committed to further optimizing our enhanced buying power for indirect and direct spend. Together with the shared talent, best practices, transportation, technology, systems and common distribution processes, we expect to derive improved efficiencies, productivity and lower overall cost structure, which would ultimately drive profitability and add value to our end customers.","During the past year, we utilized our strong balance sheet to further strengthen the company and generate cash flow. Although we cannot control the weather or the ongoing downturn in the energy sector, we remain focused on our long-term growth targets. This included ongoing investment in our core business and targeted complementary acquisitions that contributed to our performance in 2016 and will continue to enhance our results as we move forward.","We have a proven track record as a disciplined and successful acquirer, and acquisitions remain an important element of our growth strategy. In 2016, we invested more than $400 million of capital for 19 new businesses, with estimated annual revenues of more than $600 million.","Turning now to more details on our performance by six business segments. We'll begin with our Automotive operations, which were 53% of our total revenues in 2016. For the fourth quarter ending December 31, our global Automotive sales were up 2.4%, improved from the 1.5% increase in the third quarter and our strongest quarterly performance of the year. Comparable sales were up approximately 1%, which has improved from the prior two quarters. For the full year, global Automotive sales were up 1.2%.","In the U.S., which represents over 70% of our total Automotive revenues, sales were up slightly in the fourth quarter and improved from the low single-digit declines we experienced in the second and third quarters. This includes essentially flat comparable sales, which we believe is the most meaningful metric in measuring our core U.S. Automotive sales performance. This metric covers 100% of our revenue stream, and over time it will replace any reference to just our U.S. company-owned stores, which represent only one-third of our total U.S. Automotive sales and just over one-quarter of global Automotive sales.","With that said, as we make this transition, we also want to be consistent in our quarterly reporting for 2016. So for your reference, U.S. company-owned same-store sales increased 0.5%, and for the full year we're slightly positive.","Now turning back to our total U.S. result, the slight increase in fourth quarter sales was driven by a stronger December, and equally positive contributions from our commercial and retail platforms. Our commercial growth in the fourth quarter was driven by sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center customers, which grew to 17,200 members in 2016, an increase of nearly 500 members from 2015. This growth area was offset by slight sales declines to our major accounts and fleet customers, which experienced weaker demand patterns throughout most of 2016.","We believe our DIY or retail sales growth in the fourth quarter was at least partially due to December's turn in the weather, which drove increased demand for cold weather parts, like batteries, starters, and heating and cooling products. Our nationwide NAPA Rewards program has now grown to more than 3 million members, and we believe we are seeing the benefit of that as well.","Lastly, as part of our retail impact initiative, we rolled out 166 updated retail concept stores in 2016, exceeding our goal of 150. As a reminder, this initiative includes things like installing all-new interior layouts and graphics, extending store hours, and increasing training for our store associates. Although small on the overall scheme of total sales today, these updated stores continue to produce low double-digit retail sales growth. This steady uptick in sales gives us confidence in the long-term positive benefits of this initiative and we are on plan to accelerate the project with an additional 300 stores in 2017.","Now moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers for our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.5 years. Lower fuel prices remained favorable for the consumer, and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 4.3% in November, the most recent data available, and is up 3% for the 11 months. November marked 33 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.34 in the fourth quarter and just $2.25 for the full year; positive indicators for further increases in miles driven, and ultimately driving additional parts purchases in 2017.","So now let's turn to our international Automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada and Mexico. Combined, these operations account for nearly 30% of our global Automotive revenues and, as we mentioned earlier, these operations outperformed with an 8% local currency increase in the fourth quarter and for the year. In Australia and New Zealand, fourth quarter sales improved by low double digit, driven by solid comparable sales growth, as well as the benefit of acquisitions. In total, the Asia-Pac business expanded their footprint with 52 new stores in 2016, and we see opportunities for further expansion in the future. We are also encouraged by the generally favorable economic conditions in this region, as well as solid fundamentals, such as a growing car park driven by record car sales, relatively low gas prices, and upward trends in miles driven.","At NAPA Canada, sales held steady with low single-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. This team performed fairly well, given the tough conditions in 2016, and we anticipate a more favorable overall sales environment in 2017. Similar to the U.S. and Australasia, the total vehicle fleet is growing due to the record new vehicle sales and gas prices remaining at historically low levels. These fundamentals bode well for NAPA Canada's continued growth prospects in 2017.","Finally, in Mexico, our sales grew low double digits as well, as we expanded our NAPA Mexico footprint to 33 total stores during 2016. We have plans to add additional stores in the periods ahead and are encouraged by the long-term growth prospects we see for NAPA in Mexico.","We were pleased to close the year with improved Automotive sales results in the fourth quarter. While we made progress in the U.S., we intend to build on these results and we are encouraged as we move ahead in 2017. Furthermore, we expect continued strong results in our international Automotive operations, which have performed well for us. For 2017, we remain focused on expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and major accounts, executing on our retail strategy, and continuing to drive global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions.","So now let's turn to our Industrial business, Motion Industries, which represents 30% of our total revenues in 2016. Industrial was up 4% in the fourth quarter, which has significantly improved from the 1% decrease in the third quarter and also our strongest quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2014.","In addition, comparable sales were up slightly, which has much improved from the decrease in comparable sales in each of the prior six quarters. For the full year, Motion sales are essentially unchanged from 2015. We are encouraged by the early signs of strengthening market conditions for our Industrial business, as evidenced by the year-end uptick in indices, such as the Industrial Production and the PMI numbers.","In addition, the energy sector is making progress in its recovery, with the increase in rig counts translating into much improved sales to this sector. Lastly, the level of exported goods continued to improve from the 6% to 8% declines we experienced in 2015 and the first half of 2016, an especially positive sign for our equipment and machinery customers in the OE sector. Each of these trends bodes well for the overall industrial marketplace.","Today the question is more of the sustainability, as these indicators have been quite choppy over the last several periods. That said, we entered 2017 encouraged by the prospects for stronger industrial sales.","A review of our Motion business by industry segment, product category, and top customers further supports our fourth quarter improvement. We saw an increase in the number of sectors generating positive sales gains, with food processing, aggregate and cement, pulp and paper, and oil and gas, all out performing. It's worth pointing out that oil and gas improved from a double-digit decline in the third quarter to a double-digit increase in the sales in the fourth quarter, so solid improvement for this sector in just one quarter.","And we had more of our product categories and top 20 customers generating sales increases in the fourth quarter, so positive trends across the business, which we expect to build upon in the quarters ahead, both organically and via strategic acquisitions.","Moving on now to EIS, our electrical distribution segment. Sales for this group were basically flat in the fourth quarter and much improved relative to our results in the first three quarters of 2016. Total EIS sales were down 5% for the year and were 4% of the company's total revenue. The market served by EIS closely follow those at Motion, so our fourth quarter included a sequential improvement in comparable sales, as well as the accretive benefit of the CPS acquisition in October. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our initiatives to drive meaningful sales growth at EIS over the long-term.","And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business, which represents 13% of the company's 2016 revenues. The Office group reported a 4% increase in sales for the fourth quarter, driven by a 12% sales contribution from acquisitions in the facilities, breakroom, and safety supply category. Total sales for the year were up 2%. Excluding acquisitions, comparable sales were down in the fourth quarter due to the decline in sales through our independent reseller and mega account customers. Sales to these customers were partially offset by the increase in sales to e-tailers, as well as our growing FBS distribution channel.","On the product side, sales in the traditional office supplies, furniture and tech products, each posted sales decreases. Offsetting these declines was a substantial growth in our FBS category sales, which we have expanded to diversify our overall products and service offering. FBS sales were 31% of our total office sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus just 20% in 2015.","As we move ahead to 2017, we remain focused on the continued expansion of our FBS business, including strategic acquisitions, as well as key initiatives to grow our overall share of wallet and market share across our product categories and sales channels.","So that recaps our consolidated and business segment sales results. And in summary, we're pleased that the fourth quarter was our strongest quarterly sales performance of the year, with improved comparable sales trends in the Automotive, Industrial and Electrical businesses, relative to the second and third quarters of 2016. Generally, we believe that we operated in more favorable market conditions as the fourth quarter progressed and our teams were in position to capitalize and post improved results.","In 2016, we executed on several of our initiatives to overcome the challenging sales environment and position the company for sustainable long-term growth. A few of the highlights include, strong growth in our international Automotive operations, 19 strategic acquisitions that enhanced our product and services offering, effective asset management that further strengthen our balance sheet, key capital expenditures and IT investments, including digital, to support future growth and distribution efficiencies, and finally, return of capital to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and our outlook for 2017. Carol?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with a financial review of our fourth quarter income statement and the segment information. And then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items, and finally I'll provide our outlook for 2017.","As Paul mentioned, total sales in the fourth quarter of $3.78 billion were up 2.7%, including a 1% decrease in comparable revenues. For the full year, total revenues of $15.34 billion were up slightly and also include a 1% decrease in comparable sales.","Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 29.9%, up 17 basis points from the fourth quarter in 2015. For the year, gross margin is 30%, up 16 basis points from 2015. This improvement was primarily driven by the combination of product mix shifts to higher margin categories and also the benefit of our higher margin acquisitions, which is partially offset by lower supplier incentives.","Overall, we were encouraged by our gross margin expansion in 2016 and, as we look ahead to 2017, we remain focused on further enhancing our gross margin for the long-term. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively unchanged from the prior quarter, with deflation in the Automotive and Electrical segments, and just slight inflation in Industrial and Office. Our supplier price changes in 2016 were negative 0.7% in Automotive, positive 0.4% in Industrial, positive 0.3% in Office, and negative 1.2% in Electrical.","Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses for the fourth quarter were $895 million, up 7% from last year and 23.7% of sales. For the year, total expenses of $3.5 billion were up 3% from 2015 and 23% of sales. The increase in operating expenses as a percent of sales primarily relates to the deleveraging of expenses across our businesses for most of the year. We also increased our spending for planned IT investments and experienced cost increases in areas such as insurance, legal and professional.","Lastly, we had increased cost in 2016 related to those 19 acquisitions, which we would expect to eliminate as we further integrate these businesses into our existing operations. As we mentioned earlier, several of these acquisitions also operate with higher gross margin and higher operating cost model, so this impacts our SG&A comparison as well.","To offset these increases, we've implemented enhanced cost control measures and we're focused on assessing the optimal cost structure for our businesses. As we mentioned in our last call, our businesses are rationalizing their facilities to streamline their cost structure, where appropriate, which serves to reduce our distribution costs, as well as our head count and payroll related costs, which are significant expenses for us.","In 2016, we consolidated or closed several DCs and branches, and we expect to see these savings in our future results. We also see more opportunities for further consolidation ahead. Our investments in technology, which we noted earlier were stepped up in 2016, are allowing us to do more and more of this type of rationalization, while also maintaining our excellent customer service standard. So you can look for us to continue making progress towards a lower cost and highly effective distribution infrastructure across our businesses in 2017 and beyond.","And looking at our results by segment, our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $160 million is down 5%, with the operating margin for this group at 8% compared to 8.7% in the fourth quarter last year. And this is primarily due to the deleveraged expenses due to our U.S. sales results.","Our Industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 4% increase from 2015. Operating profit of $81 million is up a strong 12%, and their operating margin has improved to 7.0% compared to 6.5% last year. This segment benefited from a favorable product mix shift, as well as progress with their ongoing cost reductions and facility rationalization.","Our Office Products revenues were $476 million, up 4%, including the benefit of acquisitions, which contributed nearly 12% to sales. Operating profit of $20 million is down 40% and their operating margin is 4.2% due to a variety of factors, including the decrease in organic sales, as well as rising costs associated with serving a growing number of sales channels, including e-tailers. The Office team is working hard to drive significant cost savings in this business, which we realize needs to happen soon.","The Electrical\/Electronic group sales were $177 million in the quarter, which is flat from the prior year. Our operating profit of $15 million is down 4% and the margin for this group is a solid 8.7% compared to 9.1% last year. This team has also been working fast to reduce their facilities and related costs, and we believe these savings will begin to flow through their results in 2017, so we're encouraged by that.","So our total operating profit for the fourth quarter was 7.3% compared to 7.9% last year, and for the full year is 8% compared to 8.4% in 2015. Not the margin expansion we look to achieve each year, but we recognize the need for improvement and we're focused on driving cost savings and improved margins across our businesses in the future.","We had net interest expense of $4.8 million in the quarter and $19.5 million for the full year. We currently expect net interest expense to increase slightly in 2017 in the range of $21 million to $22 million. Our total amortization expense of $12.5 million for the fourth quarter was $41 million for the full year. We estimate total amortization expense of approximately $43 million in 2017.","Our depreciation expense of $27 million for the quarter was $107 million for the full year. For 2017, we expect total depreciation to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million. So our total depreciation and amortization combined would be approximately $160 million to $170 million for 2017.","The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $23 million for the quarter and $95 million for the full year. In 2017, we expect corporate expense to increase slightly to the $100 million to $110 million range.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 35.5% compared to 38.4% last year. For the full year, our tax rate was 36% compared to 37.2% in 2015. The reduction in the rate for the quarter as well the year is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, and also more favorable non-taxable retirement plan valuation adjustment. In 2017, we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 36.0% to 36.5%.","Net income for the quarter of $152.5 million and EPS was $1.02 for the quarter, and for the full year our net income was $687 million and earnings per share of $4.59.","Now I'll turn and discuss the balance sheet, which we further strengthened in the fourth quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at December 31 was $243 million, a $31 million increase from 2015, even as we increased our spending for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Our cash position remains strong and it continues to support our growth initiatives across each of our distribution businesses.","Accounts receivable of $1.9 billion at December 31 is up 6% from the prior year, and this reflects our stronger sales in the month of December.","Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion, which is up 7% from the prior year, primarily due to acquisitions. Our teams effectively managed our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward.","Accounts payable at December 31 was $3.1 billion, up 9% from 2015, due to the ongoing benefit of improved payment terms and acquisitions, as well as other payables initiatives. At December 31 of 2016, our AP to inventory ratio was 96% compared to 94% at December 31 of 2015.","Our working capital of $1.7 billion at December 31 was a slight increase from the $1.6 billion in the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital remains a high priority for the company and we expect to show continued improvement in the quarters ahead.","Total debt of $875 million at December 31 compares to $625 million in total debt in 2015. The increase is primarily related to the 19 acquisitions we made during 2016. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 21%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We continue to believe that our current structure provides the company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may choose to pursue in the future.","So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We generated strong cash flows in 2016, with cash from operations at $946 million and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, at $399 million. In 2017, we're planning for another strong year of cash flow and we would expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range, and our free cash flow would be approximately $400 million.","We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. These includes strategic acquisitions, which Paul covered earlier, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses, as well as the dividend. We purchased 420,000 shares of stock in the fourth quarter and 2 million shares for the full year.","We've also purchased another 60,000 shares thus far in 2017, and today we have 4.2 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead, as we believe our stock still represents an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.","Capital expenditures were $74 million in the fourth quarter and $161 million for the full year. For 2017, we're planning for capital expenditures in the range of $145 million to $165 million.","Turning to the dividend, yesterday our board of directors approved a $2.70 per share annual dividend for 2017, which marks our 61st consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. This is a 3% increase from the $2.63 per share paid in 2016, and it's approximately 57% of our 2016 earnings.","So this concludes our financial update for the fourth quarter and the full year, and in summary, we operated an overall challenging sales environment throughout most of the year. But our teams worked hard to overcome these challenges and we were in a position to take advantage of the improving marketing conditions in the fourth quarter. Moving forward, in 2017, we're focused on driving greater efficiencies and cost savings, and this is a critical objective for us across our businesses and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress.","Now turning to our guidance for 2017. Based on our current performance and our growth plans for 2017, as well as the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future, we are establishing our full year 2017 guidance as follows. Total sales would be in the plus 3% to plus 4% range, including the carryover benefit of our 2016 acquisitions, but no future acquisitions, and net of a slight headwind from currency translation. Comparable sales growth is projected to be plus 2% to plus 3%. By business, we would expect Automotive and Industrial to be up 3% to up 4% in total sales growth, Office to be up 2% to up 3% sales growth, and Electrical to be up 1% to up 2% sales growth.","On the earnings side, we would expect our earnings per share to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 for 2017, which represents a low to mid-single-digit increase from the prior year. We would also add that this full year earnings growth will likely be weighted towards the third and fourth quarters of 2017.","So with that, we would just close by thanking all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the future growth of the company. And at this time, I'll turn it back over to Paul.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Thank you, Carol. As we enter 2017, we remain committed to our global growth initiatives, which include the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive greater share of wallet with our existing customer base, an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both geographical as well as product line expansions, the building out of our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses, and the further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint. We remain confident that our ongoing focus in these four key areas, along with our initiatives to drive significant cost savings, will positively impact our future results and produce the steady and consistent growth we look to achieve each year.","So with that, we'll turn it back to Dana, and Carol and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Good morning.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Hey. Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So why don't you \u2013 a couple of questions. So you mentioned the cadence of sales are weighted to the back half. Thinking about NAPA and Motion in particular, do you think they build up relatively evenly from the fourth quarter of this year into the back half or do you expect some bumps along the road and specifically around NAPA? I mean, obviously, you talked about a good December. Weather hasn't been as great here in the first quarter, and then you've got the tax refunds that others have talked about. So trying to get some understanding on how to think about those two divisions.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Yeah, so two things, Chris. One is our comments about the back half of the year were more specific to the earnings. So we were more commenting on the plus 2% to plus 5% in earnings, we would expect to see more of that in the back half of the year. Then the second thing is, you spoke to (32:34) sales, Q1 last year was our strongest quarter. So as you think about that, I would just take that into account, but then knowing that quarters two, three, and four were more similar.","And then you specifically called out Industrial, and I would just mention with the Industrial, again, we saw great improvement in their sales in the fourth quarter. So the guidance that we gave you for them, those sales increases would be pretty even across the quarters in 2017, unless we see something outside of our control in the economy that we're not anticipating.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","And, Chris, just staying on Industrial for a minute. If you look at all the macro numbers, as we look at them, whether it be the ISM number, rig counts, we're seeing significant improvement. We've been through these cycles in the downturns in Industrial before. And it does feel \u2013 and we see it in both Motion and our Electrical business, that these two businesses are now poised for much better growth in 2017.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. And just to clarify that, that 1Q strongest quarter, that was a reference to NAPA, correct?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Yes.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So a segue to Motion. So as you've consolidated facilities, you've invested in technology, how should we think about the long-term margin potential of the business? After the crisis, you got back to an 8.1% operating margin. Before the crisis, the prior peak, I believe, was 8.4%. So how do you think about what's the potential earnings power sort of in a peak state, and then the time to get back to that?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Yeah. So a couple of things there is, you're right, they've closed over 50 branches and a couple of distribution centers. They've done a terrific job on the cost side. And as we have mentioned before, they had an impact of lower volume incentives as it related to this business. So as this business picks up, you do see the margins coming back and we've seen some nice improvement in their core gross profit, and then they've got some acquisitions coming in.","So I would just mention, we always have a stated goal of improvement each year in operating margins. As far as the bounce back and the range, I mean, for all of our businesses, we still target the 8.5% to 9% for operating margin. I wouldn't necessarily expect that within 12 months, but I think you're going to see a nice bounce from them.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I guess asked another way, between the acquisitions and the costs that you've taken out of the business, did you create a structural potential that's higher than you've seen in prior peaks?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","I wouldn't say higher than what we've seen in prior peaks. I mean, remember, they're just at 7.3% right now. So, I mean, we've got a ways to go. But 8.5% would be a really nice margin for them.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, very nice. Understood. Thanks very much.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Thanks, Chris.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'd like to get a little more. I know you've probably covered this in kind of a fragmented way as to why you'd expect the earnings to be second half weighted more so than the sales, if sales are fairly even. Just talk about what it is moving the margins around that will work more to your benefit in the second half of the year?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Well, really, if you look at from the cost structure, I mean, we've said it takes a bit of time for us to get those costs out, and look, we're not happy with where we ended up the year in fourth quarter. We've got more work to do in SG&A. I mean, when we look at what we've done in terms of facility rationalization, when we look at our head count, when we look at our cost structure, freight, legal and professional, insurance, I mean, there is wage pressures. So we've just got to work hard at continuing to get those costs out, and that's not a quick thing that happens in just a quarter. So that's why we're giving a little bit of the earnings to say it will probably be more back half loaded.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then the second question, obviously, tuck-in acquisitions and some bigger ones have been a pretty consistent part of the story over the past several years. Can you just clarify, other than the dividend, what kind of free cash flow deployment you have baked into the guide?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","So, our \u2013 what we have assumed in our cash flow guidance that we gave was very similar to what we had this year. So we would have an amount set aside, if you will, for of course the dividend, the CapEx number we gave you, share repurchases of a similar amount, and then for acquisition. So you can count on the 1% to 2%-ish on acquisitions in terms of revenue, so that's modeled into our cash flow guidance.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Matt, we were very active in 2016 with 19 acquisitions and $600 million in annualized revenue, quite a bit more active than we were in prior years. It's difficult to say, this is generally a long process, when we look at businesses and partnering with businesses. So you just \u2013 it's hard to gauge, because you just never know when they're going to come along, when the right one is going to come along. But I will tell you that we will remain active, not only across all four of our businesses, but across all of our geographical regions as well.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just to be clear, does that $4.70 to $4.80 include any buyback or any acquisition that is new buyback or new acquisition in 2017?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","No, it would just be the normal ranges that we've discussed. So we have not \u2013 the acquisitions that have already taken place in our numbers in 2016, and then roll into 2017 is what's contemplated in our guidance. But in the earnings guidance, it would just be a normal buyback. So that's usually around 1%, 1.5% of our shares.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you so much, guys.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Thank you, Matt.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Thanks. I \u2013 two questions. First, I'd start with the business and particularly the inflation\/deflation trends and, Carol, you give us a nice update for last year on each of the businesses. What are you thinking \u2013 or seeing this year when you plan your guidance for inflation or deflation by business?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Well, so we just finished our fifth year of deflation on the automotive business. And I can't say we're planning for anything much different than that. In the other businesses, this was definitely much lighter than normal year. So we're not really planning for much. But, look, there are so many unknowns out there in the economy right now and certainly with new legislation, some of the trade and tax issues that are being thrown about, we don't know what will come. But right now we're contemplating a similar number in 2017 for inflation, which would not be much.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. And then second one is a little more big picture. If you just take your guidance this year, that sort of low to mid-single-digit EPS growth, I think now it's a couple of years where you've been at slower growth than the normal objective, which is high single digits. And I guess the question is, has something changed in the business or what \u2013 do you think this is cyclical or secular or how should we think about that?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Well, I think in the \u2013 one of the things that we've assumed for this year is core growth of 2% to 3%. So, as you know, in distribution business, core growth of 2% to 3% makes it very difficult for us to leverage or to have margin improvement. So that's why we're giving kind of an earnings number of plus 2% to plus 5%. But certainly know that we're not happy there and we've got a lot of work we're doing. So I don't think it's anything more than just probably a lower level of sales growth, but we would still expect \u2013 and again, our long-term objectives are still to have a much higher core growth, and more like a 4% to 6% going forward.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Got it. So if the top-line was mid-single-digit, you'd still see the earnings at the high single-digit?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Yes.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Right.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Yes, we would.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Yeah, we haven't \u2013 Greg, we haven't come off our long-term objectives on the number side. But based on what we see today, we believe that the guidance that we provided is achievable, but I can also tell you that our team is focused on not only reaching that guidance, but absolutely exceeding it this year.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Great. Good luck. Thanks.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Thank you, Greg.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","We'll go next to Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Hey, Bret.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Good morning.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","A question on the fourth quarter. I guess, if we look regionally, I mean, obviously, some of those northern markets that were soft got better. But could you talk maybe sort of southern, western and northern markets and maybe what the dispersion of results was, like what the spread between the strongest and the weakest markets were? And then maybe a little bit on product category strength, anything that was a particular outlier.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Yeah. Let me \u2013 I'll take the regional question first, Bret. First and foremost, I'm very pleased to tell you that every one of our regions we saw improved sales results in the fourth quarter and we also saw that gap narrow from what we had seen in Q3, and even a little bit into Q2 we saw that gap narrow by about 100 basis points. So we're still \u2013 our strong regions are still in the South, but I can tell you we see improved results in the Midwest and we saw improved results in the Central part of the country as well. So that December blast of cold definitely helped. This January warm temps are not helping us a whole lot, but that is what it is.","Your second question, Bret, regarding product performance, our best performing categories, and probably not surprising, in Q4 were anything related to engine and electrical systems, so battery, starters, alternators, all performed well in Q4, filtration performed well. Some of the \u2013 where we saw a little bit of downturn within some of our T&E, tool and equipment, especially on some of the large equipment and some of our paint categories were off just a bit.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Anything \u2013 I mean, I guess, as you think about the larger tool category, is that sort of a real shift in the consumer side there or any thoughts about that?","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","No, I don't think so. Bret, I think it's timing. We have a robust tool and equipment business, and I think it's more one of timing. I don't think there is anything that changed dramatically in Q4 that would have impacted those sales. I think we'll see that rebound in Q1 going forward.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then one question on your 2017 outlook for Auto growth of 3% to 4%, how does that stack up U.S. versus international?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","We would be stronger on the international side than the U.S. That assumes core growth of 3% to 4% as well. We've got a little bit of a currency headwind built-in and a little bit of acquisitions. But I think you're going to see similar, with a little stronger growth internationally, similar to what we had this year, little stronger internationally than the U.S. side.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Yeah, I would just reinforce Carol's comments, Bret. We continue to be very bullish on our international operations, and that's really all of them, Australia, New Zealand. We think we have expansion potential in those markets. Mexico, we will continue to expand our footprint there. In Canada, despite a challenging environment out West, our team up there had a good year. Where we need to turn it up is here in the U.S. and absolutely our team is focused on getting that done this year.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. And then one last question. On Motion, you called out oil and gas as having double-digit improvement in the fourth quarter. Are we seeing some structural change you think in that space or just the bar got low enough that we had a good quarter? Are we calling a turn in oil and gas?","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","I'm sorry?","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Are we calling a turn in the oil and gas?","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Well, I'm not sure I'm ready to go there. All I know is, where we were a year ago in the depth, Bret, where \u2013 we're double the price of a barrel of oil today than we were a year ago. Rigs are coming back online and we're seeing a lift in that Southwest \u2013 we do a big business down in the Southwest and we're seeing a nice lift across that part of the country really in all of our businesses.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","All right. Thank you, Bret.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Thanks, Bret.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one \u2013 first clerical one and a clarification. Do you have any currency movements and M&A activity for the non-Office segments? I don't think you gave it out this quarter. And then two, just wanted to confirm what your definition of a comp is for your non-Automotive. Are you measuring it by branch, like maybe just talk high level what your comp number means for your business?","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Well, I'll take comp first, and then let Carol address your first question. So as we're identifying and defining comps, Chris, we're excluding new stores, new branches, or new stores, branches closed over the past 12 months, and we're also excluding acquisitions.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. Okay.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","And you specifically asked about FX in the quarter for the non-Automotive?","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Well, I mean, like I say, if you have \u2013 I think in the past you've given out the FX impacts and you've given out...","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Yeah, there...","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","...the M&A impacts for each segment.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Yeah, there was virtually no FX impact in the quarter. It was just negligible. And the acquisition impact in the quarter, it was around 2% for Automotive, and it was around 4% for Industrial, and it was around 11% for Office, and then Electrical was 1%, so in total we were about 4%.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, very helpful. And then just quick high-level question. Given the improving \u2013 I mean, you were extremely acquisitive in 2016, which was nice to see. How do you think about the backlog right now that industrial sentiment's improving and probably just global sentiment around the markets right now, are you having a harder time kind of building the acquisition pipeline? Have you seen any changes in your conversations, anything to think that your pace of M&A might slow near term? Thank you.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Yeah. It's a great question, Chris. I will tell you that we have a robust acquisition pipeline in really across all four of our businesses and, as I think I've mentioned earlier, in all of our geographical regions. I think what we're seeing is that in some parts of our business, when we do an acquisition, and I'd point out one that we did in Industrial with the acquisition of Braas in Q3 of last year, what that brings us is additional players in that space. When they see that GPC is, one, that we're acquisitive, and two, that we're a good partner, we have more and more some of these folks coming to us as opposed to us tracking them down. So we feel good about our prospects for 2017. I mentioned earlier, we did 19 acquisitions last year. I don't know that we'll be at that level of activity, but we certainly expect to be active again in 2017.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks for your time.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","You're welcome. Thank you.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli.","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research LLC","Hi, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in here.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","You bet, Brian.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research LLC","Just a question on NAPA. You're not the only one today who reported some margin degradation there and you're not getting the comp leverage, but I'm just curious about the pricing environment relative from a competitive standpoint and then also any pressure or pushback from the manufacturers themselves.","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","No, what we're seeing has been fairly typical of recent years, Brian. The pricing across the marketplace is rational and we're not seeing \u2013 and our supplier partners are partnering with us as they always have. We're not seeing any significant shifts there either.","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research LLC","Okay. All right. Terrific. Just conversations with suppliers, if we were to have a situation where there is some sort of border adjustment tax that was really draconian for the industry by nature, any talks with them about potential onshoring or areas that you could speak to?","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Well, I would say it's probably premature. We have \u2013 it's early to have discussions with suppliers about what changes they are going to be making, what changes we're going to making. I think we're all taking a bit of wait and see to see what ultimately happens. I think, as we think about this, what amount is going to be borne by the supplier, what amount is borne by us, what amount passes onto the customer, I think in theory, a lot of this is probably going to end up being passed onto the consumer and in terms of inflation and what we see in the cost of products. But we have not started. Again, it's early to be having discussion with what changes may happen in the supply chain. But know that we will work with our suppliers and hopefully come up with the best solution that we can.","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research LLC","All right, terrific. Much appreciate it and good luck in 2017","Paul D. Donahue - Genuine Parts Co.","Thank you, Brian.","Carol B. Yancey - Genuine Parts Co.","Thank you, Brian.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","I would now like to turn today\u2019s conference call over to Mr. Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Sid Jones","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts third quarter 2014 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Sid. And I would also like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President along with Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and I will each handle a portion of today\u2019s call. And once we have completed our individual remarks, we will look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.","Earlier this morning we released our third quarter results and hopefully you have had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were 3.986 billion, and this was up 8% over the prior year. Operating income was 298.3 million, which was up 10%; net income was 190.5 million, which was also up 10% and our earnings per share were $1.24 this year compared to $1.12 last year, which is an 11% increase. So with revenues up 8%, net income up 10% and EPS up 11%, we feel that we came through the quarter in good shape. And as you will hear from Carol in a few minutes, all four of our business segments were able to show operating margin improvement in the quarter, which is encouraging and in our opinion indicative of an overall good job done by each of our management teams.","Turning to the individual performances by business segment, as we customarily do, I\u2019ll make a few comments on the non-automotive operations and then Paul will follow with an overview of the Automotive segment. Starting with industrial. This is our second largest segment representing 31% of total company revenues on a year-to-date basis. We\u2019re pleased to report another solid quarter from the industrial team. Sales were up 10% and this continues the trend of sequentially strengthening sales results going back to the final quarter of last year. After being up 3% in the fourth quarter of 2013, we were up 4% in the first quarter, 7% in the second quarter and 10% in the third quarter. And if we look at it without acquisitions and foreign exchange impact, in the first quarter were up 2%, second quarter up 4% and third quarter up 8%. So a nice trend in the sales progression and our industrial operations are now up 7% year-to-date.","And looking a bit more closely at the results on a product basis, we\u2019re pleased to see positive growth across all of our major product categories in the quarter. And then from a customer perspective, 11 of our top 12 customer segments are showing growth in the quarter as well. The strongest segments in alphabetical order are automotive, coal and aggregate, iron and steel, lumber and wood products and pulp and paper. And similar to our overall sales results for the quarter, each of our top 12 customer categories had their strongest sales increases of the year, perhaps reflective of further strengthening in the industrial segment of the economy, which should bode well for our industrial business in the quarters ahead.","Moving on to EIS, our electrical, electronic and wire and cable segment, we\u2019re pleased to be able to report another strong revenue quarter with sales up 35%, which is the strongest quarter of the year. However, it is important to point out that most of our revenue increase is attributable to acquisitions completed over the past 12 months and the underlying business is up just slightly similar to what we have seen pretty much all year long. Lower copper prices had been a slight headwind to our revenue growth on the electrical side, but more significant has been the deferred demand that we have seen from telecommunication customers in the wire and cable segment and reduced demand from several contract manufacturers in the electronic segment. While we don\u2019t anticipate significant changes in any of these specific situations until early 2015, we do see some modest improvement in the early days of the fourth quarter. And this, combined with the acquisition revenue, will enable EIS to report a strong finish to the year.","Switching to the office product segment, S. P. Richards turned in a fine quarter with sales up 15%. As with our industrial operations, we have seen nice sequential improvement from the office products group. In the fourth quarter of last year they were down 4%, they were even in the first quarter of this year and then up 4% in Q2 and up 15% in Q3. And looking at it without acquisitions and currency exchange impact, we were down 4% in the fourth quarter of last year, down 1% in the first quarter of this year and then up 2% in Q2 and up 8% in Q3.","As just referenced, acquisitions accounted for approximately seven points to the increase in the third quarter and the increased volume from our new Office Depot agreement was a significant contributor as well. However, we were encouraged with the mid single digit growth that we saw with our independent office products resellers. This is back-to-back solid quarters with this important segment of our customer base and we\u2019re pleased with the results that we\u2019re seeing here.","We\u2019re also pleased to see solid results across all four of our main product categories. Technology products, core office supplies and furniture reached up mid to high single digit in the quarter and facility and breakroom supplies were up low double digit. So good results across all of the product categories as well as across our two primary customer categories, the independent resellers on the megas and we\u2019re pleased with the consistency and the balance that we saw in our sales results in the quarter. And importantly, we feel that the office products team is well positioned to end the year in good shape.","So that\u2019s a brief overview of our non-automotive businesses. And at this point we will ask Paul to bring up-to-date on the automotive segment. Paul?","Paul Donahue","","Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone and let me add my welcome to our quarterly conference call. I\u2019m pleased to join you today and to have an opportunity to provide you an update on the third quarter performance of our automotive business. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, our automotive business grew top line revenues by 4% in the third quarter. This essentially reflects our core automotive growth for the quarter of 4.4%. This sales increase was in line with our expectations. We were able to deliver on our commitments in spite of the milder than normal temperatures here in the U.S., evidence of our teams out in the field continuing to perform at a high level. When evaluating on our quarterly performance, we\u2019re encouraged by the solid results across our automotive businesses, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Australia and New Zealand. In the U.S., all regions of the country are positively contributing to our sales growth. As has been the case the past several quarters, our Midwest and Central divisions continue to lead the way for the company. We also saw solid sales growth in the Southern, Atlantic and Mountain regions of the country.","Turning to our U.S. company owned same store sales. Comp store sales growth in the third quarter came in at plus 6%. This 6% increase is on top of 4% in the same quarter of 2013, giving us a two year stack of plus 10%. This solid performance continues to run up strong same store sales numbers dating back to the fourth quarter of 2013 when our team delivered a 7% increase.","The NAPA team continued to execute well as they delivered an 8% increase in the first quarter of 2014 followed up with a 7% increase last quarter. While we\u2019re pleased with these strong numbers, we also are well aware of the tougher comps facing us in the quarters ahead. Our sales increase in Q3 was bolstered by continued strong growth in our commercial wholesale segment. We followed up our 7% increase in Q2 with another healthy increase of 6% in the third quarter. As most of you know, the key drivers of our commercial business are the NAPA AutoCare centers and our strong alliance with our major account customers. These two big wholesale initiatives continue to exceed expectations and we\u2019re proud of our dedicated teams in both these businesses.","Let\u2019s start with our major account business. This important segment of our business delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of low double digit sales growth. And turning to our NAPA AutoCare centers, we continue to grow the overall number of AutoCare centers, now totaling over 15,500. This team posted high single digit sales increase in the quarter and through nine months they were up low double digits year-over-year. So all in all, another fine performance by these two segments of our commercial business.","Another segment of our commercial business worth breaking out is our all important fleet business. As a reminder, this segment posted a 6% increase in the second quarter and we followed that up with a 7% increase in the third quarter. This strong performance puts us at plus 7% through three quarters. We can also report improving trends in our average wholesale ticket value with little to no inflation support. We are also encouraged to see our average number of tickets continuing to increase. We continue to be pleased with our improved performance in our retail business. This segment of our business grew 5% in the third quarter. And if you'll recall, our retail business generated a 9% increase in the first quarter and a 7% increase in the second quarter. As we saw with our wholesale business, we generated a mid single digit increase in our average retail ticket value while we experienced a slight decline in our average number of retail tickets in the quarter.","Our team has been working hard to drive both increased foot traffic and our average retail ticket value. These efforts are beginning to take hold and we\u2019re pleased with this performance through nine months.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at the product categories driving our growth. Our heavy duty business continues to post strong results as this group generated low double digit growth in the quarter. We also experienced low double digit growth in our brake business and strong growth from our tool and equipment business. Core product categories like chassis, ride control and our filter business, all experienced mid to high single digit growth. Conversely, the milder temps experienced this summer had a negative impact on our heating and cooling product sales.","So in summary, we\u2019re encouraged by the growth opportunities available to us in both the retail and commercial sectors of the automotive aftermarket. While we have much work ahead of us, we remain optimistic that the initiatives our team is focused on will continue to drive strong results. We would also add that the industry fundamentals remain steady and positive for the aftermarket. The average age of vehicles on the road remains in excess of 11 years, the total fleet is large and growing and deferred maintenance remains at historically high numbers. Likewise, important metrics such as the price of gasoline and miles driven are trending favorable. Fuel prices continue to decrease and accordingly miles driven have increased now for the sixth consecutive month through August and stand at plus 0.6% year-to-date. ","In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our third quarter results as well as our year-to-date performance. While we didn\u2019t experience a hot summer we\u2019re all hoping for, our NAPA team persevered and delivered another in a series of good quarters. We are proud of our management team and know they remain committed to driving profitable growth throughout 2014 and beyond. We would like to personally thank all of our associates both at NAPA North America and at GPC Asia-Pac and Australia and New Zealand for their efforts in the third quarter.","So that completes our overview of the automotive business. And at this time I\u2019ll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?","Carol Yancey","","Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with a review of our third quarter and nine month income statements and the segment information and then we will review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back up to wrap it up and then we will open the call up to your questions.","As Tom mentioned, our total revenues were a record 4 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 8% from last year, which includes the 5% underlying sales growth, a 3% contribution from acquisitions, and this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 0.5%. Our gross profit for the third quarter was 29.7% of sales compared to the 29.9% gross margin reported last year. For the nine months, our gross margin of 29.9% compares to the 29.6% reported last year or 29.8% excluding the one time purchase accounting adjustment in 2013 that\u2019s previously been disclosed and also referenced in today\u2019s press release.","The pressure on our third quarter gross margin reflects the impact of our ongoing customer and product mix shifts that we see in our businesses. For 2014, we expect our margins to approach the 30% range with the gradual expectation of margin expansion in 2015 and the years ahead. This is an area that is receiving a good bit of our management team's attention. As an additional point of interest, we\u2019re seeing some slight inflation in our nonautomotive businesses year-to-date, but we continue to see very little inflation in automotive and we don\u2019t expect this to change over the balance of the year. Our year-to-date cumulative pricing for 2014 is 0.2% in automotive, 1.2% in industrial, 1.2% in office products, and 0.3% in electrical.","Turning to our SG&A. Our total expenses were 885 million in the third quarter, which is an improvement of 30 basis points to 22.2% compared to the 22.5% reported last year. For the nine months, our total SG&A expenses are 2.6 billion, which is 22.5% of sales, compared to 22% in 2013 or 22.5% before the purchase accounting adjustment mentioned earlier. The improvement in our third quarter SG&A expenses continue to reflect a combination of our cost savings associated with the freeze of our pension plan effective January 1st as well as the ongoing benefits of our cost saving initiatives and expense leverage. We remain focused on effectively managing our cost in every area of our business and through these initiatives we expect to show continued progress on our SG&A line in the periods ahead.","Now let\u2019s discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the third quarter was 2.1 billion and represents 52% of total sales and is up 4%. Our operating profit of 193 million is up 7.3%, so their margin improved by 30 basis points to 9.2% from the 8.9% last year. For the nine months, our automotive sales of 6.1 billion is up 10%. Our operating profit of 550 million is up 12.8% and our margin is up 20 basis points year-to-date to 9.0%. Our industrial sales were 1.2 billion in the third quarter and this is 31% of our total revenues and up 10% from 2013. Our operating profit of 95.3 million is up 20% and our operating margin expanded a strong 60 basis points to 7.8% from the 7.2% last year. Year-to-date industrial sales of 3.57 billion are up 7%. Our operating profit of 274 million is up 10.7% and our margin of 7.7% is up 30 basis points from last year.","Our office products revenues were 497 million in the quarter or 12% of total revenues and up a very strong 15.4%. Our operating profit of 33.3 million is up 19%, so their operating margin increased by 20 basis points to 6.7%. For the nine months, office revenues of 1.3 million represent 11% of the total and are up 6.4%. Our operating profit of 98.4 million is up 8% and our margin is up 10 basis points from last year to 7.4%. The electrical group had sales in the third quarter of 193 million and that's 5% of our revenue and up 35%. Operating profit of 17.8 million is up 41% and their margin is 9.2% which is up 40 basis points from last year\u2019s 8.8%. Year-to-date sales for this group are 562 million or up 32%, and our operating profit of 50 million is up 41%.","So our margin is up nicely to 8.9% from the 8.3% last year which is a solid increase of 60 basis points. So our total operating profit was up 13% in the third quarter and our margin improved 30 basis points to 8.5%. This increase follows a 20 and 30 basis point margin improvement in the first and second quarters respectively. So for the nine months, our total operating margin is 8.4%, which is up 20 basis points from 2013. As covered earlier, our overall margin expansion is supported by increases in each of our four business segments in both the quarter and the nine months. So we\u2019re encouraged by this progress and we remain focused on continued margin expansion in the periods ahead.","We had net interest expense of 6.3 million in the third quarter which is down from the 7 million last year. For the nine months, interest expense is 18.7 million and we expect this cost to remain relatively steady over the balance of 2014. We currently estimate interest expense to be 24 million to 25 million for the full year. Our total amortization was 8.9 million for the third quarter and this is 26.3 million for the nine months. Year-to-date our amortization is up from last year due to the acquisition activity across all four of our segments. We expect amortization expense to be in the 35 million to 36 million range for the full year.","The other line which reflects our corporate expense was 26 million expense for the third quarter, which is relatively consistent with the first and second quarters, although up from last year. The increase from 2013 reflects an unfavorable $4 million swing associated with our retirement plan valuation adjustment as well as higher expenses for a variety of items including legal and professional, insurance and incentive related costs which have continued to impact this line item. For the nine months, this line shows 75 million of expense and this is up from the 47 million last year excluding the one-time purchase accounting adjustment in 2013 of 33 million. Currently we expect this line to be in the 90 million to 95 million range for 2014.","Our tax rate was approximately 36.1% for the third quarter of 2014 and 2013. For the nine months, our 36% tax rate compares to a 34% tax rate for the same period the prior year. The increase in our nine months tax rate is primarily due to last year\u2019s favorable tax rate on the one-time purchase accounting gain. Looking ahead, we expect our full year tax rate for 2014 to be in the 36% range.","Our net income for the quarter at 190.5 million compares to the 173.7 million or up 10%. Our EPS of $1.24 compared to the $1.12 last year is up 11% and for the nine months our net income of 546 million is up 9% and our EPS of $3.53 is up 10% from the nine months of 2013 on a comparative basis.","Now let\u2019s discuss some of the balance sheet items. Our cash at September 30th was 136 million, which was down from approximately 321 million last September and 197 million at December 31st. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives in each of our businesses and we remain comfortable with our cash position at September 30th. Our accounts receivable of 2 billion at September 30th increased 12% from the same period in 2013 on an 8% sales increase for the quarter. We remain focused on our goal of growing receivables at a rate less than the revenue growth and we have some work to do in this area in the periods ahead. But we\u2019re very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.","Our inventory at quarter end was 3 billion which is up approximately 6% from last September and up only 2% from December 31st. Before the impact of acquisitions, inventory is basically unchanged from year-end and up 3% from last September so our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels.","We will remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward during the year and also into 2015. Our accounts payable balance at September 30th was 2.5 billion or up 15% from September 2013 and this is due to the positive impact of our extended payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors and to a lesser extent the impact of acquisitions. Our continued improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital in days and payables is encouraging. We expect this favorable trend to continue in the periods ahead.","Our working capital of 1.9 billion at September 30th compares to 1.8 billion at December 30th of 2013, an increase of 6%. Effectively managing accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company and our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in solid improvement in our working capital and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at September 30, 2014.","The total debt of 835 million at September 30th is relatively unchanged from last year and it represents approximately 19% of our total capitalization. The September 30, 2014 debt includes two 250 million term notes as well as another 335 million in borrowings under our multi-currency syndicated credit facility agreement. We are comfortable with our capital structure at this time.","Thus far in 2014, our cash from operations is approximately 586 million and for the full year, we currently expect cash from operations to be approximately 900 million. We expect free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the 425 million to 450 million range. We are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and we remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority for cash is the dividend which we have paid every year since going public in 1948 and have now raised for 58 consecutive years. Our annual dividend of $2.30 per share in 2014 represents a 7% increase from the $2.15 per share paid in 2013 and that\u2019s approximately 52% of our 2013 earnings and that is well within our goal of the 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal will be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our core businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases.","Our investment in capital expenditures was 34 million for the third quarter and 74 million for the nine months. We currently expect our capital expenditures to pick up further over the balance of the year and we look for our CapEx expending to be in the range of 120 million to 130 million for the full year. This is down slightly from our previous estimate of 130 million to 140 million, but in line with our prior year CapEx of 124 million. As usual, the vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology.","Depreciation and amortization was 35 million in the third quarter, consistent with third quarter last year, and 109 million for the nine months which is up from the 98 million in the prior year. The nine-month increase reflects the impact of GPC Asia Pacific as well as our more recent acquisitions. We currently anticipate depreciation and amortization to be approximately 145 million to 150 million for the full year.","Our strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash for us and they're integral to the growth plans for our company. In the third quarter, we made three acquisitions including one small tuck-in for both our automotive and electrical businesses, as well as the July 1st addition of Impact Products to our office products group, which we discussed in our last call. All in we have made seven acquisitions thus far in 2014 including one in each of our four business segments. We expect these new businesses to contribute total annual revenues of approximately 390 million. We are encouraged by the growth opportunities we see for each of these acquisitions and we\u2019ll continue to seek new acquisitions across our businesses to enhance our prospect for future growth. We\u2019re generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally thus far in 2014, we have used our cash to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. Today we have another 9.5 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases but we expect to remain active in the program over the balance of the year as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with our dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","So that concludes our financial update, a solid quarter but more room for improvement. And in closing, we want to thank our GPC associates for all their hard work. We have a great team. And because of their dedication and hard work, the company is well positioned for continued growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. We look forward to updating you on our future progress when we report again.","I will now turn it back over to Tom. Tom?","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Carol and Paul for those informative and comprehensive updates. So that will complete our planned comments. And in recapping our view on the quarter, we would say that we feel good about the performance turned in by the GPC team with sales up 8%, net income up 10% and earnings per share up 11%.","As we look toward year-end based upon our year-to-date results, we feel that some modest adjustments to our prior guidance would be appropriate. On the revenue side, we previously had guided automotive revenues to be up 7% to 8% and at this point we would say that that would be up closer to the 8%. In industrial, we previously had said up 5% to 7% and now we would say up 6% to 7%. Office products was 6% to 7% and at this point we would say 8% to 9%. Electrical was 25% to 30% and we would suggest right at 30%.","So for the total company, prior guidance was to be up 7% to 8% and now we would say we'll be up 8%. And on the earnings side we previously had guided in the $4.54 to $4.60 range. We are comfortable taking that upside and we now feel that $4.56 to $4.60 is more appropriate and that would represent an earnings per share increase of 9% to 10% for the full year.","So at this point we would like to address your questions. And we will turn the call back to. Celina. Celina?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Becks with JP Morgan.","Mark Becks - JPMorgan","I guess just to start off on the automotive side. Looking at your guidance of 8% sales growth, by my calculations it looks like it's sort of like a 3%-ish number in sales growth for NAPA in 4Q. Maybe just trying to get an update on how you are thinking about the automotive trends. Obviously they are still very solid, but you are lapping some pretty impressive comparisons, so maybe what you are seeing in the business now. Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","","I will try to answer that. The guidance would suggest some modest deceleration. However, as you pointed out, the comps are getting a bit more challenging. And we also don\u2019t know what the early winter weather impact we may get this year. As far as the current trends, we would say that we are pleased with what we see in automotive specifically in the beginning or the early days of the fourth quarter. And I might say that that same comment would hold true for the other businesses as well. We are early in October, but we do like what we see at this point.","Mark Becks - JPMorgan","And then on the gross margin side, a little bit of a headwind there. Can you elaborate a little bit on what caused the pressure there? Is there any change in the promotional activity going on in the category? Is that maybe some acquisition related impact? Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","","The margin, as I think we mentioned in the last call, the margin is being impacted a bit by the customer mix and the product mix that we see across our businesses. And as you know, the larger the customer in any of our businesses, the greater the discount that they receive. So the margin compacts some. However, the offset to that is the greater the volume, the more leverage that we can get. So in the quarter, our gross margin was down 18 basis points, but our SG&A was down 29 basis points, so we did have a positive 11 basis point improvement in our operating margin. So that\u2019s the primary thing that\u2019s happened. If we look at it on the product side, we see nice growth in a couple of areas that Paul mentioned. Certainly our heavy duty business was up and that\u2019s a little bit lower gross margin, but higher ticket values. The same thing would be true on tools and equipment in the automotive. If we look at the office products business, I mentioned that our technology products were up, again higher ticket value, but lower margin. So I think they would be the primary contributing factors.","Mark Becks - JPMorgan","","And then just a follow-up to the margin comment. On the industrial side, presumably you might have hit some vendor rebates kicking in with the big acceleration there, maybe where that\u2019s coming from and the sustainability of that. It looks like incremental margins were kind of mid-teens maybe historically what you've seen with incremental margins on the industrial side. Thank you.","Carol Yancey","","So Mark on the gross margin on the industrial, what we would say is certainly with their core growth coming back a bit, we\u2019re seeing some of the volume incentives come back, but I would say it\u2019s really more trending in line with what their sales increases are. It was primarily more their cost savings and the leverage that came through on that for the industrial side.","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America.","Elizabeth Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America","","Hi, this is Elizabeth Suzuki on for John. In terms of the acquisition landscape, which segment are you most interested in? And how do the multiples being paid for acquisitions compare to about a year ago?","Tom Gallagher","","I will try to answer that. And I would say that our overall growth strategies across each of the businesses include a component for acquisition growth. We have been able to make acquisitions in each of the four businesses over the course of this year. In terms of where the acquisitions may come from prospectively, we\u2019ve got active discussions going on in each of the businesses, but there are more possibilities in the industrial and the electrical sides of the business only because those industries continue to be the more fragmented of the two industries that we\u2019re in.","In terms of the valuations, valuations are relatively constant with where they\u2019ve been. They might be pushing the top end of what we would consider to be reasonable valuation, but they're still relatively consistent. And I would also, just as a point of information, I would say that we continue to be what we would consider to be fairly consistent in our valuation models and we\u2019re going to \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t fit our model, there is a high probability it won't be a deal that we do. We\u2019re not going to do any deals that are dilutive to our shareholders.","Elizabeth Suzuki \u2013 Bank of America","","And then just one other quick one is that GPC once operated in Europe. Do you foresee any future operations there?","Tom Gallagher","","As it turns out, I actually was involved in that business stack then. And I think our primary emphasis would be in North America, in Australasia and potentially South East Asia and then also into more in Mexico and Latin America. Not to the exclusion of Europe, but that would be down the list. We think there may be other opportunities for us in these other areas that might be more attractive.","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri \u2013 Wolfe Research","","Hi. This is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram. Was hoping you can kind of walk us through the incremental margins maybe by segment and what you\u2019re seeing particularly perhaps ex acquisitions. It seems like you had a lot of very strong growth obviously in industrial on an organic basic, the same with office. So maybe just talk about like your maybe implied margins for -- was this quarter \u2013 I want to keep saying Q4, or maybe just long term where you expect those to trend?","Carol Yancey","I guess just to comment on -- so a couple of things on the margin. While we were able to see -- what we\u2019re seeing there, and again you\u2019re seeing it in total, so there is some gross margin pressure, but you\u2019re seeing our improvement on SG&A and that really applies to all of our segments. And I think where we\u2019re seeing the improved top line growth, we\u2019re able to really see that push through on the SG&A line. So where we are more on the nine months year-to-date basis, and when you look at what our margins are up for each of our segments, we\u2019re still going to really hope to keep the 10 to 20 basis point improvement for each one of those and a little bit greater than that in the electrical., but I think maintaining where we are at through the nine months and looking for just a continued 10 to 20 basis points for each of the segments.","Chris Bottiglieri \u2013 Wolfe Research","And one another additional small question. Can you talk a little bit about the industrial, what\u2019s causing the explosive growth in organic revenue? But at least compared to industrial production, it seems to really have accelerated this past quarter. And maybe one of the segments that you're playing out might be outperforming versus the benchmark?","","Tom Gallagher","","We mentioned five, I think it was five categories or customer segments that we\u2019ve enjoyed a little bit stronger growth than the overall, and they pretty much follow what you\u2019re seeing happening in the economy. If you look, automotive is a strong segment for us right and you see what\u2019s happening with new vehicle sales. Lumber and wood products and the mining and aggregate are both fairly strong for us and we think that may follow what\u2019s happening with construction, both housing as well as commercial construction.","So I think we\u2019re following the overall trends within the economy. The external indices, industrial production capacity utilization, they\u2019ve actually been fairly strong for a number of months now. And it\u2019s been our expectation that we would see some improvement in our sequential growth rates and I think we\u2019re just now beginning to experience some of that.","And then one other thing I might add is that in prior calls I think we\u2019ve mentioned that we keep track of what we would call project work, which is work that our manufacturing customers are planning to do where they may take a line down or they may do a complete refurbishment. And to the best of our ability, we try to quantify what that might be and we follow the patterns on that end for a period of time. What we saw is a relatively consistent dollar amount of project work. But to take out on that was not flowing as it had historically. We had seen some deferrals, some delays and we\u2019re beginning to see some of that work being done now. So that\u2019s probably contributing a bit to the overall growth rates as well.","Operator","","Next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","","A quick question, I guess, on the auto. I was about to ask that project work question a second ago, but just to sort of follow off on that. What\u2019s the expectation -- I mean if we sort of look at the quarter on the industrial side, how would it weigh percentage that was sort of just general disposable as opposed to project work from a contribution standpoint, just sort of trying to get a feeling for where we are, what inning we are in the expansion of projects work?","Tom Gallagher","","Bret, I\u2019ll try to answer that. And I would say that it was more weighted toward the day in and day out needs than it was the project work. We were pleased to see some increased activity on the project work, but the overall growth rates were more driven by a good, steady demand from ongoing operations.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then back to my other question. If we look at sort of any prospective or early look at market share shifts, are you seeing anything shaking out as far as recent consolidation? I think a question was asked earlier about increased promotional levels. But are you seeing maybe a shift in some of the customers' bias to go with you as a commercial supplier as opposed to other competitors?","Tom Gallagher","","I think the best way we could answer that would be to point to our NAPA AutoCare on our major account business. Paul referenced in his comments that we\u2019ve enjoyed nice growth again this quarter and we\u2019ve had a number of really good quarters there. And I think those results would indicate that there has been a bit of share gain with those customers or a share gain by those customers, whichever, and I think we\u2019re benefiting from that. I don\u2019t know if there is more that Paul might want to add to that.","Paul Donahue","No. Tom hit on it, Bret. Those two businesses, as we\u2019ve discussed before, continue to perform well and show no real signs of slowing. So I would think with the kind of growth rates that we\u2019ve seen, high single digit out of our AutoCare group this past quarter and low double digits out of our major accounts., we\u2019re very pleased with that performance and our team's really got to go on all cylinders.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","And Paul, one last question. You mentioned that all markets were -- all regional markets were up and some of the standout strong markets. What were the weaker markets relative just geographically?","Paul Donahue","As we\u2019ve seen a good bit this year, Bret, out West and certainly when we always like to talk about weather, certainly the drought has impacted, we believe, some of our customers out there both on the installer side as well as some of our independent owners. So that would be absolutely one that would stand out.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Robert Higginbotham with SunTrust.","Robert Higginbotham \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Quick first question on auto and imports specifically. Your major competitors have really increased their attention on that piece of the business and they\u2019re doing it in a couple of different ways, a couple of people using the warehouse distributor model and then some cross-sourcing to the legacy stores, if you will, and then one focusing on developing private labels specifically for imports. You guys really don\u2019t talk much about that. Could you give us a sense to how you view that piece of the market? How important you see it and how you see yourselves attacking that going forward?","Paul Donahue","Yes, Robert, this is Paul. I will give it a shot. I am assuming you\u2019re referring to a couple of our competitors and recent acquisitions. And you\u2019re right, we don\u2019t talk much about the OE import business. But I would tell you that six plus years ago we did an acquisition of a company called Altrom, which is a OE branded provider that we acquired six years ago. They do business both in the U.S. and Canada. We viewed it then as we view it now as a very strategic and integral part of our overall automotive business. And we\u2019ve been getting after it for a number of years. So I think that what you\u2019re seeing with our competitors\u2019 recent acquisitions, which I think is a good move on their part, it just further reinforces the opportunities that are in that segment of the business.","Robert Higginbotham \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And then on the Asia Pacific, and when you look outside of Australia, in the past you've somewhat loosely alluded to opportunities outside of Australia and using Australia as a foothold, as a platform for growth in the larger region. Could you give us a sense of how -- what you see in those neighboring markets, specifically automotive, in terms of size, competitive fragmentation, kind of what the opportunity is there?","Tom Gallagher","I\u2019ll take that one, Robert. First of all, our primary and near term focus is continuing to build out in Australia and New Zealand and the team there is doing a really good job for us in that regard and we continue to see some pretty attractive opportunities in those markets today. At the same time, we\u2019re looking at some other markets. I had mentioned that China is not high on our list. Although it\u2019s a large and rapidly growing market, it\u2019s not one that we think is ready for a company like ours yet or a company like ours is not yet ready for China, either way.","But there are some other markets. Although they\u2019re smaller, they\u2019re enjoying very attractive growth rates in the vehicle part. And when you total up a couple of them, they\u2019d become fairly significant. So we\u2019re in the process of trying to gather as much market intelligence as we can currently, make as many contacts as we can with existing players in those markets. And at some point, it\u2019s probable that we\u2019ll make a move to start to do business in some of those markets.","Robert Higginbotham \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And let me sneak one quick one and hopefully -- in the past you\u2019ve talked about a stronger dollar hurting the export business of some of your customers and then that of course are flowing through to softness in your own business. Are you seeing any of that happen now or are you concerned about that?","Tom Gallagher","Yes, it continues. The dollar continues to be quite strong vis-\u00e0-vis other currencies. So that continues to be an issue for those customers of ours, primarily capital goods type customers who are shipping and selling product into some of these other markets. And then you combine that with a general malaise in the global economy and you\u2019ve got a combination of maybe a bit softer demand and the higher dollar that causes some compression for some of those customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","I have my first question on office products to change it up a bit and a couple of quick follow-ups on automotive. If you think about the pop that you saw in the underlying growth rate in office supply and if you could sort of isolate as best as you can some of the drivers of it, can you talk about how much maybe layering in the Office Max business would be versus your getting just a bigger share of the pie given your new deal down at Office Depot? And then finally what you\u2019re seeing in terms of intrinsic demand which, based on what you saw from the independents, that also seems like it wasn\u2019t so bad?","Tom Gallagher","Maybe we\u2019ll take them in reverse order, Matt. The demand was actually encouraging, especially from the independents and there has been a lot of work going on by our office products team to work with independent owners to help them improve their position in their respective marketplaces and I think that\u2019s a partial contributor to results that we saw. Additionally, we had seen some slowdown in governmental spending, as a general statement, and that has a ripple effect on a number of our independent customers and we saw that improve some over the last two quarters. So, that\u2019s been a contributor as well. As far as looking out a little bit, we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen on the independents side and the expectation is that it should continue to generate reasonably good growth for us over the next quarter or two for sure.","It's hard for us -- moving on to the question on the incremental volume from Office Depot and Office Max, it's hard for us to be able to extrapolate that very precisely. I can tell you that the aggregate volume is running very much in line with what we thought it would be and what the Office Depot folks thought it would be. So, we\u2019re very pleased with what we see in the early days and I think it's a reflection of the combined entities, but it's also, I think, a reflection on some improved demand for the combined entity today and I think they're doing a pretty good job.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","","Great. On automotive, kind of a quantitative question. If you could just help us understand the difference between the 4% reported total growth and the 6% comp, presumably there is -- there would ordinarily be I guess store growth. I might have gone the other way, you have ForEx. Anything else that would have driven that delta?","Paul Donahue","","No, you hit on it, Matt. Just to reemphasize, the 6% same store sales number that we mentioned, that\u2019s reflective of our U.S. company owned store base. There is a combination of factors this past quarter that impact the overall number. We had a sales return adjustment that we've contended with as well as a couple of store consolidations, and certainly as you mentioned, the FX impact as well.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","","And if we think about \u2026sorry.","Tom Gallagher","Matt, excuse me for a minute. If you aggregate those three things that Paul just mentioned, that pretty much accounts for the delta between the 4.4% increase that we had and the 6% comp store.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","","Great. And then also on the automotive number, if your aggregate commercial business -- I believe you said it was up 6%, if I got that right -- and your same store sales number was up 6%, there were a number of initiatives -- you talked about major accounts running double digits, NAPA AutoCare ran high singles, if we solve for the residual, which I guess would be commercial outside of major accounts and NAPA AutoCare, there is some piece of it that must track below 6% for the math to work. So, can you talk about sort of is that just your undesignated commercial business or is there anything else happening in the business that might have been a bit weaker outside of those efforts?","Tom Gallagher","No. And you are right. The business set was not highlighted in Paul\u2019s comments is running up, but it's running up low single digit, and it is the unaccounted for, it's the all other in our commercial business.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","","Fair enough. And then I promise the last. Just Carol, if you could talk about the impact of ForEx by segment, just whatever the revenue impact was for each segment? I know it was 50 bps overall, although I am not sure how that was distributed.","Tom Gallagher","Gives us a minute on that one.","Carol Yancey","","Yeah, I'll get back on that. So on the automotive, I think Paul already gave you that number. And the industrial, it was a negative 1%. And then really no impact on office or electrical to speak of. And then in total it was 0.5% in total.","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","","I wanted to first ask about in automotive, if you could just help us understand a bit what\u2019s driving the continued double-digit type strength in major accounts. Is there business wins that you've had with new customers or the existing customers just doing more business and you\u2019re getting more wallet share? Can you help us understand the drivers there?","Paul Donahue","","It\u2019s certainly a combination of both. Our teams are executing extremely well in the field, Mike, and you\u2019ve got -- when you look at the major account business, and you mentioned, it\u2019s continued growth with our existing plus some wins along the way. And when you combined them both and then you combined it with the strong execution in the field, our team continues to do a great job.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","","Great. Wanted to follow up with Carol actually on the other line item, which looks like now it could be 125 million to 130 million versus the prior guide I had 115 million to 117 million. So can you just help us understand I guess incrementally what the major changes are and anything to be aware of into the fourth quarter there?","Carol Yancey","","Yes. Just to be clear, so that other net line, which is including the interest and the intangible, we gave guidance of 90 million to 95 million for the full year. That\u2019s been running at about 25 million each quarter and we\u2019re at 74 million year-to-date. So, the things that are going in there, I mean you certainly have some increase in some of the costs that we\u2019ve talked about for some time, so legal professional insurance, we have some of our corporate, be it shared services, it could be IT, payroll benefits, depreciation on corporate assets, it\u2019s pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. We also have -- there would be some things that are sort of non-recurring or we have some unusual items, like we mentioned the $4 million retirement benefits adjustment that was unfavorable. So, we didn\u2019t change it a whole lot, but we\u2019re looking at more of a 90 million to 95 million for the full year.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","","And then two last follow-ups, one was on the cash flow guidance, which by my math appear to be about 50 million lower than last quarter, so just hoping to understand the puts and takes there. And lastly was on sort of incremental margins, because you guys ended up putting up certainly stronger growth than I had looked for at least for this quarter, but yet the margins were kind of flattish in total. So, help me if you could to understand some of the initiatives you have there to get EBIT margins expanding at the total company level.","Carol Yancey","Okay. Well I\u2019ll take the cash flow one. So you\u2019re right, we did probably tweak that a little bit. I would tell you we\u2019ve had two outstanding cash flow years the last two years. We feel really good about cash from operations at around 900 million. But we didn\u2019t have quite -- I mean we feel good about the numbers, we feel like there is improvement going ahead, but we just felt like it was time to firm that up just a bit. I would say the change was really in the working capital area, kind of a combination of AR and AP. The folks are doing a really good job in inventory. But I think I could say we felt like it was time to kind of firm that up a bit.","And I think on your margin question, again I would just point to where we kind of are on a year-to-date basis. And I think where we can maintain our SG&A improvement between now and end of the year, I think you\u2019re going to see the segment margins that we have year-to-date that would basically continue for the end of the year.","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","My first question is on the auto group. Can you give us a sense of the cadence of comps for the U.S. company owned stores throughout the quarter?","Paul Donahue","","Yes. We talked about this in the last call, Seth. And if you think back, that was in July and we mentioned that early July we saw some softer numbers coming out. That's started to strengthen in the second half of the month. And our numbers firmed up as the quarter progressed, so we\u2019re I\u2019d say pleased with the way the quarter came about.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities","And then remind us looking forward here for October, November, December, how the cadence of the comps compares for Q4?","Paul Donahue","","Maybe I\u2019m not sure -- I apologize.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Just the comparisons for the next -- for the months of Q4.","Tom Gallagher","","We don\u2019t give out monthly guidance.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities","I guess, Tom, another way to ask the question is, how much strong was December relative to October last year, because that\u2019s when the cold weather started?","Tom Gallagher","","Well December was, if I recall -- I don\u2019t have it right in front of me, Seth. But if I recall, that was the strongest month of the quarter because we were getting the benefit of some of that cold weather flow through.","Paul Donahue","","Yeah. And I would also just mention, Seth, last year Q4 was when we really saw our business start to come on strong. And so our total Q4 last year, we\u2019re plus 7% same store sales.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","Okay. Then secondly, maybe Carol you can give us some more color around AR. You talked about it being a focal point. Can you give us a sense of where the increases are coming from, which segments and what their natures are to bring that a little bit more under control?","Carol Yancey","","Well I would tell you on the AR, it's really across all of the businesses. And I think we talked about where we had some of these larger accounts and associated with some of those larger accounts, they may have slightly different terms. So what we are able to do is get those same terms back through our vendors. But I think we also have some acquisitions that are also flowing into that and we are trying to integrate the acquisitions in. So the thing is with our accounts receivable the quality of it is outstanding. We have no concerns there. It's just making sure that we are getting all the AR in line to be slightly less than our sales increase and that\u2019s what all of our internal teams are focused on.","Operator","","The next question comes from line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","","Hey guys it's Scot Ciccarelli. Another auto question as well. How much of a difference did you see in geographies? You mentioned that the West was soft, but can you help us understand how soft that was? Number one. Number two. You did mention in drought conditions. Can you help us better understand I guess outside of wipers and such what else from a product standpoint really struggles under those kinds of conditions?","Tom Gallagher","","Scot, I will take the first half of that. In terms of the delta, we wouldn\u2019t want to quantify that, but we would go back to what Paul said and that is that all of the geographic areas had positive growth for us in the quarter but, some are stronger than others with the West being on the bottom end of that. And in terms of the impact of the drought. You are right about something like wiper blades, but it goes a whole lot further than that when you think that California for instance is a big agricultural state and the impact that the drought has on the crops there, that impacts not only demand from the agricultural concerns, but it impacts the truckers who hold that product, that impacts the processors who process the product. So it has a pretty long tale in terms of how it can influence demand. A lot of the workers in the ag community may not have quite as much disposable income. It can affect a retail business. So it\u2019s a significant factor.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","","And Tom, specifically who are your primary competitors when it comes to stuff like the agricultural products or is it the right way to think about it, just the long tail that you mentioned and because of that it's just a cascading effect?","Tom Gallagher","I think the right way is the long tail. When we talk about the competition, it's all of the companies that you would know. We are all located in those respective markets. Now there will be some specialists as well. But for us, for the product that we are selling, the primary competitors would be our peer group and the companies that you are well aware of.","Operator","","Your question comes from the line of Mario Gabelli with Gabelli & Company","Mario Gabelli - Gabelli & Company","","Yeah. I had to ask the question to you and Paul and Tom. Paul, when you sit down with Tom and he says to you his experience in Europe, what structurally does he remind you about that he had as a problem that you won't encounter in Southeast Asia, either political, rigidity of labor or just the notion of only traveling eights hours versus 24?","Tom Gallagher","","You know what, Mario, I think I better let him answer the question. I'm staying clear of that one.","Paul Donahue","","That one is up upward delegation right there, Mario. No, the structural -- it would be getting at it was my comment about the... ","Mario Gabelli - Gabelli & Company","Yeah. Tom, it was about 35 years ago, wasn\u2019t?","Tom Gallagher","","No. In terms of our business over there, it's performing really well. We will in fact expand it outside of those countries.","Mario Gabelli - Gabelli & Company","","No. But what happened in Europe that says I don\u2019t want to go back as a high player?","Tom Gallagher","","In Europe what we saw was we had our doubts about how long it would take for the common market on the the EU to actually come into being. And number two, how successful would it be over the long-term. We didn\u2019t have any insights beyond anybody else\u2019s, but I think current situation might suggest that we were asking appropriate questions back then. Back then you didn\u2019t have the common currency that you have today, but you have got different languages, you have got different rules of law, you\u2019ve got different methods of approaching the business. And our feeling at the time was that we would continue to be successful, but it was going to be a much tougher slog than what we were accustomed to. And keep in the mind also we had just acquired S. P. Richards and Motion Industries and we had been approached someone who wanted to buy our business and we felt we could repatriate the money and invest it in S. P. Richards and in Motion and do a better job for the shareholder and I think that that has proven to be the case for the most part.","Mario Gabelli - Gabelli & Company","","Well, the conclusion we agree with that's it's been a fantastic 35 years since you got out of Europe. Thank you very much.","Operator","I will now turn today's conference call back to management for closing remarks.","Carol Yancey","","We want to thank everybody for their participation on the call and we thank you for your interest in and support of Genuine Parts Company.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Sidney Jones","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter two018 Conference Call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for the full year. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.","A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call also may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","Now let me turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Sid, and welcome to our second quarter two018 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our second quarter two018 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our three businesses, Automotive, Industrial and business products. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2018. After that, we'll open up the call to your questions. ","So to recap our second quarter performance across our global platform, total sales were a record $4.8 billion, up 17.6%, driven by the favorable impact of strategic acquisitions and a 3.4% comp sales increase, which has improved from the plus 2% in the first quarter. Net income was $227 million and earnings per share of $1.54 was also a new record. Excluding the impact of transaction and other cost related to the acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group and the agreement to spin off the Business Products Group, adjusted net income was $234 million, up 23%, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.59, also up 23%. ","As we look to our global Automotive group, total sales were 27.7% in the second quarter, including an approximate 2.1% comp sales increase, which compares to a 1.5% increase in the first quarter. We are pleased to see our comps headed in the right direction. We also have the benefit of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation. Breaking it down further, sales for our U.S. Automotive operations were up 4% in the second quarter, with comp sales up 1.5% and improved from the first quarter. We were encouraged by the positive shift in the underlying sales environment for this business, which we believe reflects the continuing favorable effect of this winter's more normalized weather as well as the summer heat across most of the U.S. in both May and June. ","After a slow start out of the gate, largely due to the cold and wet conditions at the start of spring, our sales were much improved in both May and June. By market segment, sales to our retail customers continue to outpace sales to the commercial segment, although our commercial comps were improved from the first quarter and reflect our strongest results over the past 9 quarters. By customer segment, we were encouraged to see stronger results in both NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts sales. NAPA AutoCare sales were plus 3% for the quarter while Major Accounts sales were up slightly for their first positive comp in several quarters.","Looking ahead, we believe the improving conditions for underlying sales demand, combined with our ongoing initiatives, continue to enhance our value-added services for both existing and new commercial customers. This should drive further sales growth in the upcoming quarters. ","Turning to our retail business. We remain pleased with the continued solid growth in this segment due primarily to initiatives like the NAPA Rewards Program, expanded store hours and our retail impact store project. These initiatives continue to drive incremental sales growth. And while retail remains at 20% to 25% of our U.S. Automotive sales, it is an important segment of the overall market. ","In summary, we are encouraged by the improvement in our U.S. Automotive comp sales in the second quarter, and we expect to see demand across the aftermarket continue to strengthen. As we head into the second half of 2018, we are seeing the positive shift in demand for failure and maintenance parts due to the continuing impact of more normalized winter weather patterns and the record heat across much of the U.S. thus far this summer. We expect the number of vehicles in the aftermarket sweet spot to further stabilize and ultimately become a tailwind in 2019 and into 2020.","The long-term fundamental drivers for the automotive aftermarket remained sound with a growing total and aging fleet and an increasing -- increase in miles driven among consumers. We also expect our ongoing acquisitions and overall footprint expansion to positively contribute to our future sales. ","In addition to the five Smith Auto Parts stores added to our U.S. network in March, which we discussed last quarter, we recently added the Sanel Auto Parts to our network of independent NAPA auto parts stores. Sanel Auto Parts is a 44-store, fourth generation business with market-leading position in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine markets. Sanel represents the largest independent changeover in the history of NAPA, and we want to welcome both David and Bobby Segal and the entire Sanel team to the NAPA and GPC family. The addition of Smith auto and Sanel Auto Parts to our overall store network, as well as other accretive tuck-in acquisitions, remain an important part of our growth strategy, and we see additional opportunities to expand our U.S. store footprint. ","So now let's turn to our international Automotive businesses in Canada, Mexico, Europe and Australasia. Collectively, these operations delivered a second consecutive quarter of 6% total sales growth, including a 2% comp sales increase and accounted for approximately 40% of our total Automotive revenues. Starting with our other North American Automotive operations, total sales were up mid-single digits at both NAPA Canada and in Mexico. ","In Canada, sales were driven by low single-digit comp sales growth and acquisitions, including the addition of Universal Supply Group on December 31, as we discussed last quarter. The NAPA Canada team remains focused on their sales initiatives and with positive industry fundamentals and a stable economy at their back, we expect continued growth at our Canadian operations over the balance of 2018.","Now turning to Alliance Automotive Group. This business continues to operate well across its European footprint in France, the U.K., Germany and Poland. The team at AAG posted mid-single-digit sales comps for the second quarter and continues to benefit from ongoing acquisitions. AAG remains on plan for both sales and profit, and we are pleased with the continued progress on our integration plans, including our initiatives to drive synergies. ","As mentioned before, AAG's robust acquisition strategy resulted in additional bolt-on acquisitions again in the second quarter. We also announced on June 7 the addition of the Hennig Group in Germany, a leading supplier of light duty and commercial vehicle parts. Hennig has 31 branches across Germany and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $190 million. We are excited to welcome the Hennig team to our German operations and expect to close on this transaction in the September-October time frame.","The addition of the Hennig business, the full pipeline of other potential acquisitions and our continued focus on underlying core growth is supported by relatively solid economic and industry fundamentals. We are encouraged by the opportunities we see for our European operations and are confident that the AAG team will drive strong results through the balance of the year and beyond.","In Australia and New Zealand, total sales in local currency were up mid-single digits while comp sales were up low single digits in the second quarter, consistent with the first quarter. The Asia Pac team is doing an excellent job of balancing their strategy to generate both comp sales growth and accretive acquisitions, including important e-commerce investments to enhance our digital capabilities. ","We expect our continued focus in each of these areas, coupled with sound economic and aftermarket fundamentals, to drive continued solid results. But before we launch into our review of our Industrial business, allow me to summarize our global Automotive results. ","After a slow start to the quarter, our U.S. business rebounded in the months of May and June and finished out the quarter with improved comps. Our European acquisition, AAG, continues to outperform, and we expect continued great things from this team. Our remaining international Automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada and Mexico continue to perform to plan, and we are optimistic for a solid second half from this group. ","So now let's turn to our Industrial Parts Group. We are pleased to report the sales environment for this business remains positive. Total sales for Industrial were up 8.7% in the second quarter, including 6.5% comp sales growth, plus the benefit of acquisitions. These increases improved on the already solid growth we reported last quarter and reflect the positive impact of our ongoing growth initiatives and favorable economic and industry-specific factors. These would include the continued strength in major industrial indicators such as Purchasing Managers Index, Industrial production, active rig counts and U.S. exports. ","In addition, 13 of our 14 major product groups, including the electrical specialties group, posted sales gains, and all 12 of the top industries we serve were up as well. The aggregate and cement, equipment and machinery, chemicals and allied products industry sectors were especially strong, with each showing low double-digit increases. The broad strength across our products and customer base indicates a strong industrial economy, a promising sign for the balance of 2018 and well into 2019.","Our Industrial management teams at motion and EIS continue to work closely together and are making progress to generate additional revenue opportunities, economies of scale and improved efficiencies in the combined organization. The combination of these two businesses into a larger and stronger industrial group was absolutely the right decision for our team and the opportunities we see ahead for this business are encouraging. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect continued strong results from the Industrial group. ","We also remain pleased with the ongoing growth at Inenco, the Australian-based industrial distribution company we partnered with in 2017. This business is performing well, having just closed its fiscal year with a record-setting performance. This group surpassed the AUD 500 million threshold for the first time in their fiscal year 2018. ","As Inenco further expands its footprints across Australia and New Zealand, with acquisition such as HCD Flow Technology in New Zealand, which we announced last quarter, while they also expand their presence in Indonesia and Singapore, we are further encouraged for the future growth prospects for this business. As a reminder, we currently have a 35% investment in Inenco and we look forward to further investing in this business within the next 12 to 18 months. This quality organization will be a great addition to our global Industrial group.","Now a few comments on S.P. Richards, our Business Products Group. This segment reported flat sales for the second quarter, which was a vast improvement from the 5% decrease recorded last quarter. While this business faces headwinds in the demand for traditional office products, our diversification into the facilities, break room and safety supplies category is offsetting some of these headwinds. With that said, we continue to work towards the closing of our definitive agreement with Essendant and now is back on April 12, whereby GPC will spin off the S.P. Richards business and merge it with Essendant, another national business products wholesaler.","As discussed last quarter, this transaction made sense for several reasons. Primarily, the newly combined company is in the best interest of all stakeholders as it will be better positioned to effectively compete in the business product space with greater ability to support their customer community. Additionally, this allows GPC to further strengthen our focus on our core and larger, higher growth and more profitable Automotive and Industrial businesses. ","Since we last reported on April 19, you are likely aware of several developments involving this transaction with Essendant. Despite these developments, our agreement remains in place. And subject to regulatory and Essendant shareholders' approval, we continue to expect to successfully close on the agreement. We believe the combination of Essendant, along with S.P. Richards, creates a stronger, more diversified business as together, these talented management teams and complementary cultures, with a shared commitment to serving customers, will be better positioned for future success. ","Likewise, for employees, the new company will have the scale and depth to compete more effectively. We look forward to supporting the S.P. Richards and Essendant team in facilitating a seamless integration.","So that is a summary of our consolidated and business segment sales results for the second quarter of 2018. We are pleased to report improved results with many positive developments to build on as we move through the back half of the year. So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide an update of outlook for 2018. Our total sales in the second quarter were up 18% or up 3% before acquisitions and a slight benefit from foreign currency translation. Gross margin for the second quarter was 31.55% compared to 30.24% last year. Consistent with the first quarter, this strong increase primarily reflects the higher gross margin associated with AAG and other acquisitions as well as the benefit of increased supplier incentives in our Industrial business. These items were partially offset by lower supplier incentives for the Business Products Group. ","We remain focused on enhancing our gross margins through several key initiatives, including continued supplier negotiations both globally and across our businesses, the ongoing investment in more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies and improved analytic capabilities around product and customer profitability.","The pricing environment has been somewhat inflationary in our Industrial and business products businesses thus far in 2018 and we would expect this to continue with the ongoing rhetoric around new tariffs. With the latest round of tariff talk, we could also see an inflationary impact in Automotive, however, there is still a fair amount of uncertainty around its timing and ultimate impact. With that said, we expect to be able to pass along any increases to the customers.","Our cumulative supplier increases through the six months of 2018 were flat for Automotive, up 2% in Industrial and up 1.1% for office. Turning to our SG&A. Total expenses for the second quarter were $1.22 billion, representing 25.33% of sales. This is up from last year due to the higher operating cost model at AAG as well as incremental depreciation, amortization and interest associated with the acquisition. In the quarter, we also incurred $9 million in transaction and other cost related to AAG and the pending transaction to spin off S.P. Richards. In addition, we continue to experience the lack of leverage on our comparable sales in the Automotive and business product segments as well as ongoing pressure from rising costs in areas such as payroll, freight and delivery, IT and digital. ","Finally, as we discussed in prior calls, we increased the level of technology and productivity investments this year, which we believe will generate longer-term cost savings and efficiencies. ","As we move forward in the year, we're focused on our plans to address the rising cost environment and generate meaningful savings. This is essential as we work to improve our operating margin in the Automotive segment and specifically, the U.S. Automotive business. This is a top priority for us, and we're fully committed to taking the necessary steps to get this done. Now let's discuss the results by segment.","Our Automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.7 billion, up 28% from the prior year, and operating profit of $244 million was up 18%, with an operating margin of 8.9% compared to the 9.7% margin in the second quarter of 2017. Primarily, the decline in operating margin reflects the deleveraging of expenses in our U.S. Automotive business, as well as the cost pressures and investments just discussed. ","Our Industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, a 9% increase from quarter two, and our operating profit of $125 million is up 12% and our operating margin is 7.8% compared to 7.6% last year, with the 20 basis point improvement due to a solid gross margin and improved leverage on our expenses with a 6.5% comparable sales increase. ","We expect to see continued margin expansion at Industrial over the balance of the year. Business products revenues were $483 million, flat with the prior year, and their operating profit of $21 million is down 29%, with an operating margin of 4.4%. Although we saw sales stabilize for this group in the second quarter, the business products segment continues to operate in a challenging environment and faces unfavorable product and customer mix shifts. Both of these issues are pressuring their profitability. ","Our total operating profit in the second quarter was up 12% on the 18% sales increase and our operating profit margin was 8.1% compared to the 8.5% last year. This change in margin is consistent with the first quarter and as we said before, improving on these results in the quarters ahead is a top priority for us. ","We had net interest expense of $25.5 million in the quarter. And for 2018, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $98 million to $100 million, which is an increase from our previous guidance of $93 million to $95 million. ","Our total amortization expense was $22 million for the second quarter, which is an increase from the prior year due to the amortization related to AAG. For 2018, we're updating our full year amortization to be $88 million to $90 million, which is up from the prior guidance of $83 million to $85 million. Our depreciation expense was $31 million for the quarter, up $4 million from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect total depreciation to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. And on a combined basis, we would expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $230 million to $240 million. ","The other line, which typically reflects our corporate expense was $43 million for the second quarter, and this includes $9 million in transaction-related costs incurred in the quarter.","Excluding these costs, our corporate expense was $34 million, which is consistent with the second quarter of 2017. ","For 2018, we continue to expect our corporate expense to be in the $115 million to $125 million range, which excludes transaction-related costs. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 24.4%, which is an increase from the 23% in the first quarter, as expected, but down significantly from the 36% tax rate in the prior year, which is due mainly to the benefit of U.S. tax reform.","In addition, our tax rate was positively impacted by the favorable mix of U.S. and foreign earnings. We are updating our full year estimate for the 2018 tax rate to approximately 25% from the previous estimate of 26%. ","Now let's turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our accounts receivable of $2.7 billion is up 23% from the prior year and up 3%, excluding the impact of acquisition, primarily AAG, as well as foreign currency. The 3% increase is in line with our 3% comparable sales increase for the quarter, so we made progress in improving on our receivables during the quarter. In addition, we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables.","Our inventory at June 30 was $3.5 billion, up 5% from June of last year and down 3%, excluding AAG, our acquisitions and foreign currency. Inventory at June 30 highlights the positive impact of our current initiatives to improve the inventory levels in our core businesses, and we're very focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward.","Accounts payable of $3.8 billion at June 30 is up 16% in total and flat with the prior year excluding AAG, other acquisitions and foreign currency. Our flagged for payables is primarily driven by the 3% increase in inventory, which is resulting from the lower levels of purchasing activity in our U.S. Automotive and Business Products Groups. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of improved payment terms with certain suppliers. And at June 30, our AP to inventory ratio was an approximately 110%. Our total debt of $3.2 billion at June 30 is consistent with our debt at December 31 and March 31, and it reflects our increase in borrowings for the AAG acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2017. ","Our debt arrangements vary in maturity and currently, the average interest rate on our total debt stands at 2.98%. We're comfortable with our current debt structure, and we have the strong balance sheet and financial capacity to support our growth initiatives, including strategic acquisitions and investments such as AAG and the Inenco Group in Australia, which we believe creates significant value for our shareholders. So in summary, our balance sheet remains a key strength of the company. ","Turning to our cash flows, we've generated $455 million in cash from operations for the six months in 2018, which has improved from last year. Our cash flows continue to support the ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. And for 2018, we continue to project cash from operations in the $950 million to $1 billion range and free cash flow of approximately $400 million. ","Our priorities for cash remain the dividend, reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchase and strategic acquisitions. Regarding the dividend, 2018 represents the 52nd consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. Our 2018 annual dividend of $2.88 represents a 7% increase from 2017. ","We have invested $65 million in capital expenditures thus far in 2018, which is up from $54 million in 2017. For the year, we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $200 million to $220 million, with the increase from 2017 mainly due to the impact of AAG and certain technology, facility and productivity investments that we're planning for in association with our tax savings. ","We have not purchased any of our common stock in 2018. And today, we have 17.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to be active in the program over the long term as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. So now let's turn to our guidance for 2018.","Based on our current performance, our growth plans and initiatives, as well as the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future, we now expect total sales to be in the range of plus 13% to plus 14%, excluding the benefit of any future acquisitions and any impact from foreign currency. This represents an increase from the previous guidance of plus 12% to plus 13%. ","By business, we're currently expecting plus 21% to plus 22% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, which is an increase from the previous guidance of plus 19% to plus 21%. Plus 6% to plus 7% total sales growth for the Industrial segment, which is an increase from the previous plus 4% to plus 5%. And a sales decrease of minus 3% to minus 4% for the Business Products Group, which we continue to include in our guidance until the spinoff transaction is closer to completion. This estimate is unchanged from the prior guidance.","On the earnings side, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share, excluding any transaction-related costs incurred during the year, to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.75. This EPS guidance includes the benefit of a full year of operations with S.P. Richards, the Business Products Group. ","So that's our financial report for the second quarter. And we closed the first half of 2018 with positive momentum, and we look forward to building on that over the second half of the year as we address those areas in need of improvement, such as our SG&A and Automotive operating margin. ","Again, this is a top priority for us, and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress in the quarters ahead. Before turning it back over to Paul, I'd like to thank all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and dedication at GPC. We appreciate all you do. And now I'll turn it back over to Paul.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Carol. To recap the second quarter, we have several accomplishments to highlight. Although we also have a few areas requiring improvement, and we plan to address these head on. We fully recognize the need to show progress in our core operating results. And the key here is to improve our Automotive margin, specifically in our U.S. operations. To this end, our team is focused on driving core sales growth to better leverage our fixed expenses. We have more work to do to execute on our sales initiatives and maximize the growth opportunities available to us. And we are also focused on ensuring a steady gross margin along with an efficient cost structure. ","Rising costs in several areas has continued to offset our savings initiatives, so we must work to eliminate even more cost while continuing to provide exceptional customer service. We are committed to taking action to deliver cost savings in every aspect of our U.S. Automotive business. From an execution standpoint, we can and we will do better. Our team has delivered a much needed lift in revenues this quarter. And now we must increase our intensity around our execution and deliver improved results. ","As we look at the highlights from the second quarter, there are many to report on. We established a new sales record at $4.8 billion and up 18%. We established the new earnings record with EPS of $1.54, up 19%. We improved on our Automotive sales comps on our U.S. operation, and we continue to perform well in our international Automotive businesses. Our Industrial segment produced strong sales growth and improved on their profitability with an expanded operating margin. We stabilized our business products sales and continue to work towards the spinoff of this business.","We improved the strength of our balance sheet and generated strong cash flows to support our capital allocation plans. We announced the significant strategic acquisition in Germany that will strengthen our position in this key market. And we increased our full year sales guidance to plus 13% to plus 14% and reiterated our full year adjusted EPS guidance at plus 19% to plus 22% over last year. ","With these accomplishments, as well as our other action plans to address areas requiring improvement, we entered the second half of 2018 focused on improving our operating results. We will continue to emphasize an organic and acquisitive sales strategy to drive long-term, sustained revenue growth and will continue to execute on our plans and initiatives to enhance our gross margins, reduce cost and build a highly productive and cost-effective infrastructure. ","We expect our focus in these key areas to improve the operating performance in our core businesses and for the company overall. As always, we look forward to updating you on our progress again in October when we report our third quarter two018 results.","So with that, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bret Jordan, Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","A couple of questions on AAG. So the mid-single-digit comp in Europe, is that, do you think, better than the market? Are you gaining share there? Or was the market very strong in Europe?","Paul Donahue","Bret, I think that, overall, as we model that business and did our due diligence, we believe we're outperforming right now. Our thoughts going into the year would be really on the low side of positive comps, and we outperformed. And I would really call out our team in the U.K. where we had strong single-digit comps in the U.K. And Germany, we did just fine as well. So a really good performance by the AAG team.","Bret Jordan","How do we think about their EBITDA margin? I guess, it sounds like their gross margin's high, but maybe some incremental SG&A in that business mix?","Carol Yancey","No, actually, when we look at their operating margin, their operating margin is performing better than our U.S. Automotive margin and more in line with our other international Automotive businesses. So they actually carry a slightly higher operating margin and there isn't really any concerns with SG&A with that group. I can tell you when you have mid-single-digit comps and you're growing a little bit better than the industry, they're doing a really nice job on the margin side. So they are at plan with where we told you guys back last year with the $0.45 to $0.50 EPS on a full year basis and probably more at the high end of that number.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. And then the question I have to ask, any regional performance spreads in the quarter in the U.S.?","Paul Donahue","Yes, Bret, certainly, the strength for us this past quarter was in our warmer markets. So our Southeastern division had a strong quarter. Our Southwestern division had a strong quarter. And if you look out West, we did just fine. They outperformed what we call our colder weather division, so the Midwest, the Central, Northeast, even the Mountain. And again, that April soft start with -- we had snow across the Midwest go in the month of April. That certainly had an impact on our Northern divisions, but they rebounded nicely in May and June.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then one last question. We said you would probably passing through anything you see in tariffs. Have you had any conversations or have your suppliers been opening the conversation about higher pricing? Obviously, even before tariffs, they were seeing labor and maybe some material input inflation. But what do you expect for inflation in the second half? It sounded like it was flat in the second quarter.","Carol Yancey","Yes, so on the tariff side for Automotive, and you're right, we're flat in price increases for the first half. We certainly expect -- we've had some increases and some decreases, first half. We certainly expect to see something in second half for the year. When we speak specifically to tariffs, I think what's been effective thus far to date is they're negligible, especially when you look at this is just our U.S. Automotive business primarily what we're talking about year-to-date. So we absolutely have had conversations with our suppliers. They're ongoing. We've got a team that's very involved with this. And we would be looking at any increases, whether it's raw materials, freight, interest rates, tariffs, we're looking at it very broadly. We've got teams in place that are working with our global sourcing offices. We've got modeling going on. We're going to use a lot of database negotiations with our suppliers. But at the end of the day, it's going to be something that we pass along to the customer, and we'll just have to wait and see how this plays out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham, Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Nice improvement in the U.S. comps. But I was wondering if you could address some of the margin weakness in the U.S. Can you give us a breakdown how the margin performed between gross and SG&A, and what's been the drivers are specifically?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So Seth, when we look at our Automotive margins and the decline that we had in the quarter, that is completely related to the U.S. Automotive business. So combination, flat to slightly up on gross margins. We had a little bit of customer and product mix issues in the quarter that were a headwind on gross margin. But the primary issue is SG&A. And what I would call out is what we're seeing is probably about half of the margin deterioration is great and diesel fuel and delivery related and also IT investments, which we've called out, and the other half is payroll. And so the two things I would say is that these increases in payroll and specifically freight and delivery are greater than what our, say, 5% sales increases, including AAG. And so we had particular issues in the quarter with freight. You guys have seen it. April, it particularly spiked. It stayed up very strong in the Q2.","We had some additional driver regulations. There's labor shortages. So our teams are working very hard to deal with those freight increases that are greater than our sales. And so we're working on that and considering and looking at a number of things from passing along to the customers. And the other thing with payroll, as you know, again, with payroll increases, some of the minimum wage increases and some of the unemployment. And quite honestly, incentive compensation swing this year compared to last year, which is a function of the improved sales, all that with a up slightly comp that we don't leverage on is really what's weighing on those U.S. Automotive margins. But having said that, and you heard Paul say it, we've got a lot of plans in place for the second half to hopefully narrow that gap and make up some of the progress there.","Seth Basham","That's helpful color. How do you think about the pricing power of your business in the U.S. given these rising costs that everyone else is facing? Do you have an ability to pass along those higher cost in the form of higher prices?","Paul Donahue","Yes, we do, Seth. And if you look across our businesses in the U.S. whether it be Industrial, auto or business products, our intent -- and it's no different in 2018 as it has in past years, we do intend to pass those along. And when you look at our size and our scale in the Automotive sector, we certainly believe we have the ability to pass those along, not here -- not just in the U.S., but across the globe as well.","Seth Basham","Fair enough. And then just thinking about the cadence of your sales for the quarter in the U.S., you talked about softer April and stronger May and June. Did -- was May your strongest month and then a bit of deceleration in June? And how do the July period start off for you?","Paul Donahue","No, the -- well, Seth, look, April was a train wreck. April weather really, really put us in a bit of a hole, coming out of April. We saw -- and I'm speaking just the U.S. Automotive right now. But it was a similar trend across all of GPC. We saw it rebound nicely in May and it held up in June. So there was no slide in June and July with the heat that we're seeing across the U.S. is holding up just fine. So as we predicted last quarter, that combination of that brutally cold winter we had, coupled with the heat that really kicked in May, June and is holding in July, that bodes well for the aftermarket.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Suzuki","So regarding your guidance, you had raised the sales growth outlook and the tax rate was lowered for the full year, but the EPS range is still the same. Do you think -- is there some conservatism being baked into that earnings outlook, particularly given the uncertainty around tariffs? Or do you think costs are already turning higher than you previously expected, so you're just going to keep the outlook for EPS the same as it was?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So what we looked at, certainly, we look at where we are thus far through the six months. So there is certainly a consideration that we're a bit behind through the six months. We had implied kind of flattish operating margins on a full year, and we're a little bit behind now. So that's part of it. We are implying a little bit stronger comp growth when we've got a range for a second half. If we come in a little bit stronger there, that would give us more comfort. But the other thing I'd point out is we called out a couple of cost increases for second half. So interest, amortization. We even have a little bit of FX in the second half. So I think our second half margins would be somewhat comparable to what you saw in the first half and we hope to kind of narrow that range. And look, as you mentioned, which is all the uncertainties right now, we just felt it was appropriate to leave the range that we have at this point.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Yes, that makes sense. And as you mentioned, the inability to leverage cost in the auto business this quarter, comps were above 2%, globally. So what do you think is the bogey for where your comp needs to be in order to get operating leverage in this current environment?","Carol Yancey","Well, we've said in the past that, that comp is around more of a 3% number to get us there. Having said that, when you've got these kind of increases in freight and delivery, we're working awful hard to get that to where it needs to be. So having 1.5% or 2% is certainly helping us, but we need to get 3 or above. And the reason we're comfortable with that is we can look at our industrial business and see what we've done there, their margins and their improvement, and we know also historically what we've done in the past. So a number of these projects we have will be helping us try to narrow that gap.","Paul Donahue","And Liz, I would just add to the comments Carol just made, the 3% number. The good news is that we were there and a little above that number in both May and June.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers, JP Morgan.","Christopher Horvers","My first question is on the gross margins. Can you remind us of what the sort of acquisition benefit was in the gross margin? What I'm basically trying to figure out is if I look at the core gross margin rate performance and ex acquisition in 2Q versus 1Q, was it -- did you see similar up year-over-year? Or was there some degradation in the performance in 2Q versus 1Q, and what would have driven that?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So when you look at Q2 specifically, our core growth margin without AAG would be up slightly. So more around a 10 or 20 basis point up. That is primarily due to Industrial strong performance in their core gross margin, their improved supplier incentives, and that is being offset by the lower supplier incentives and product mix, customer mix issues and business products. And then the core Automotive is up slightly as well. When you ask specifically about Q1 to Q2, there is a little bit of a shift in Q2. It's small, and that primarily -- we would call out a little bit of the mix issues in the quarter. Some of our categories in Automotive, be it batteries, tools and equipment, commodities, chemicals, those carry the lower gross margin. So a little bit of mix shift. But I think when you look at kind of full year, you're going to see us have an up slightly gross margin, and that should carry through.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And maybe as you think about a core growth rate or comp in Industrial, 6.5, accelerating on a 1 year and 2 year, really very impressive. The margins haven't really flowed through. You would think at that pace that you would see more OI rate expansion. So is there something different about the cycle? Is it -- is some of this the freight cost that you're referring to? Is the vendor allowance dynamics different around cycles? Is the mix of the business that is growing? Curious how you think about as to the long-term potential of the Industrial operating income rate considering how strong it is at this point.","Carol Yancey","Yes. So the one thing I would call out, our Industrial business has performed quite well. As you recall, we combined the electrical division within motion. So when you look at their performance in the quarter, motion standalone was actually up 30 basis points in the quarter. So nice improvement there. The supplier incentives are moving in line with sales. This team is doing a terrific job on their balance sheet, working capital and inventories. So we're always going to be mindful of that. On a long-term basis, we're looking for their margins to be at 8 to 8.5. You're going to see more incremental margin improvement with the 10, 20, 30 basis points because it's a very competitive environment out there. So as they are having these increases, they're working very hard with their customers, especially those under contract to pass them along. So it remains a competitive environment. But we're pleased with this 30 basis point improvement that we have thus far. And a long-term basis, I think you can expect to see about this rate going forward.","Paul Donahue","And Chris, I would just add, our Industrial business really shows no signs of slowing down. And as you commented, they're building upon quarter after quarter. I mean, this rebound really began in Q4 of '16, carried all the way through last year. And now, the first half of this year. And when you look at key indicators, whether it be the manufacturing capacity numbers or the PMI numbers, rig count, all those continue to be very positive. So we're bullish on our Industrial business and expect to see continued good results from this group.","Christopher Horvers","And that's a good segue. As you think about the energy business and your exposure to that, I was just curious what you're seeing. I'm surprised it wasn't up. You didn't mention that as a low, a double-digit grower. Is there something different this time in terms of the amount of hiring that's been happening as oil prices have come up? Is it that -- there's been more automated then there's been more investment so there's less -- sort of less need in terms of -- for parts of existing products versus [indiscernible] cycle?","Paul Donahue","No, I don't think so, Chris. One thing I would point out is we look across our divisions across the motion business. So I look at the -- if you were to ask about the regionality in our Industrial space, our best-performing operations are down in the Southwest part of the U.S. And again, we're stacking these increases on top of the quarter after quarter and over last year. So when you ask specifically about our oil and gas extraction business, it's up mid- to high-single digits, so still, still comping very well.","Christopher Horvers","Yes. And then my last question is just for the peeling of the onion on the Automotive business. You talked about the West and the South being stronger because it didn't have April. I don't know if you have this in front of you, but if you could just focus on the May and the June side. Was the performance in sort of the North Central and Northeast more similar to the other areas of the country?","Paul Donahue","Yes, they rebounded nicely. And again, I've mentioned this on a number of times and we talked about it last quarter as well, the Midwest, which I visited just recently, spent time with our owners up in Illinois and Minnesota. These guys, the farmers couldn't get the field. They have to put a snow for the end of April. Once that snow cleared, we got into May and June, those businesses rebounded nicely, but they had just -- they were coming out quite of a hole in April.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Melich, MoffettNathanson.","Gregory Melich","I guess, a quick follow-up on the auto trends and then I want to fully understand the guidance. Paul, when you talked about that bounce back in those markets, like the Midwest and Northeast, are those areas now actually running ahead of the rest of the country? Is there some sort of catchup from that? Or are they just sort of back to a more normalized trend? And then I have a follow-up.","Paul Donahue","Back to more normalized, Greg. And if I look at the Northeast, for instance, they're going to get skewed with the, I mentioned, the big change over there. We're going to have really starting to take hold here in the second half, Sanel Auto Parts up in New England. So our Northeastern business is going to benefit greatly from adding that business. But no, we've returned back to more normal growth patterns across the Northern, Northern sector of the U.S.","Gregory Melich","Great. And then a follow-up on a bigger picture question on tariffs and passing through. What percentage of your product in the auto business is imported either indirectly or direct? And how, historically, it's been so long since we had any inflation in auto parts. What's the history? Or what do you think it takes in terms of timing for that to actually flow through to the end market?","Paul Donahue","Yes, I'll take the first part of that question, Greg, and I'll let Carol weigh in on the second half of your question. As we look across our businesses and what percentage of their business is coming out of China, whether it be on a direct sourcing standpoint, which is still relatively small for us. But our manufacturers and suppliers who manufacture and bring parts in from China, our Automotive business is about 40% and S.P. Richards is greater than that on the office side. Motion is significantly less than that number. So that's kind of how it breaks down by business.","Carol Yancey","And I think the only other thing I'd add is, as we've mentioned before with this tariff, and again, while there's a lot of uncertainties, this really does not impact our European Automotive business or our Australasian business. So this 40%, Paul mentioned, was really on the U.S. Automotive number. And as far as to how long and passing it through, look, one of the things is -- and we saw this with the first round that came into play, when these things go into effect, there's a number of discussions to go on with the suppliers. There's a lot of modeling that's done. We could look at early buy-ins. We could look at when the market can bear. I mean, we may even have opportunities to have margin increases in certain areas. So it's going to be -- I mean, we will have time. And if the effective date that's out there tentatively, remember to be September 1st on this list three that we have, we would have time to work with our suppliers on passing those through.","Gregory Melich","Great. So it sounds like something more for fourth quarter in terms of...","Carol Yancey","Well, look, we're really watching it very closely. But we know -- we don't know right now. We don't have anything factored in, but we would say later in the year for sure.","Paul Donahue","Greg, the list three that Carol referenced is the one that we're all keeping a very close eye on. We really, as we mentioned, it's negligible to this point, but everybody is keeping a close watch on list three.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri, Wolfe Research.","Christopher Bottiglieri","Quick clarifying one. The 5% comp growth or mid-single-digit that you said, slight in Europe, is that all same-store sales? Or is some of that like square footage growth?","Paul Donahue","It's a combination of both, Chris. Our AAG business in Europe, we've done a number of small bolt-on acquisitions that's kind of been their historical pattern. And we've continued that as we've stepped into that business. Again, where we were pleasantly surprised is the strength of our comp number in the quarter. And again, hats off to our team in the U.K. and in Germany. They've done a terrific job.","Christopher Bottiglieri","Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then earlier in the conversation, you start talking about productivity investments. Can you just maybe remind us what you're doing there and types of projects are working and there's a way to quantify to the extent that those are currently impacting margins? And is there a point where you lap those? Are you kind of seeing this as like a multiyear process?","Carol Yancey","Well, the first thing I would say, this is a multiyear process. It's being driven GPC and it's actually being driven globally. I sat through a recent meeting with our senior operations team, and these are projects that are in Australia. They're in Canada. They're in Europe. It's putting further automation, as an example, further automation in our facility, so our distribution centers and enhancing those facilities. In some cases, moving to newer, more improved facilities, consolidating facilities, putting in automation. We're also looking at -- on the technology side. We look at automation there and whether it's back office, shared services, we certainly have projects there. So some of it is warehouse management type software and enhancements there. Pricing is other thing I'd call out. I mean, we call our technology and productivity investments in our pricing, data analytics and software and actually working with a group to use the data that we have and be able to have a more optimized pricing strategy for our retail and wholesale business. So that's some of where our investments are going to. As far as -- again, a multiyear process and as far as calling out, I think, again, it's probably too hard to really specifically talk about it, but it would fit into what our long-term margin goals are going forward.","Christopher Bottiglieri","Got you, okay. And then just one final unrelated question. You mentioned that the NAPA AutoCare Centers are seeing really strong growth right now. And then the national accounts, still a bit lighter. Can you talk about maybe what you think is driving that variance between the 2 customers? I would think they have kind similar demand patterns, but anything you can maybe talk to that could explain that gap?","Paul Donahue","Yes. First, I'd point out that the growth that we saw both out of our NAPA AutoCare Centers and the Major accounts is the best growth that we've seen in a number of quarters. We can do better and we will do better, but we're very pleased to see it headed in the right direction. NAPA AutoCare Centers, Chris, if you think about it, we've got a bit more of a captive audience there. They fly our flag. They fly the NAPA brand. They use our training, a lot of our systems, our guys are well entrenched there with our autocare centers. So our expectation would always be that auto care centers are going to outperform. Major Accounts, that's a competitive business for sure. And our competitors are all chasing that business as well. Again, we were pleased to see a positive increase in the quarter because it's been a while since we've seen our Major Accounts post positive comps. So we're encouraged by that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Fassler, Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","My first question relates to your guidance, your revenue guidance. Can you talk about how much of the change in the revenue guide, that hike in the revenue guide, relates to your second quarter performance? And then on the forward, how much of it would relate to your organic outlook versus acquisitions versus what, I think, is probably a slightly less helpful FX outlook for you guys.","Carol Yancey","Yes, I mean, I'm going to start with the FX. And I think you're spot on. I mean, we had about 0.5 point improvement in the first half, and it is not going to be as helpful in the second half. So we've modeled a slight headwind in the second half that would have us at maybe flattish, maybe up slightly for the full year. The second thing I'd remind you is AAG came on November 1 of last year. So you have that few months of revenue for AAG. I can tell you our guidance for second half versus first half is really largely based on where we are today. I mean, the run rate that we have to date and then mentioning the AAG 2 months and FX, we have not modeled in any acquisitions that haven't closed yet, and that would include the Hennig acquisition in Germany because that has not closed yet.","Matthew Fassler","Got you. That's very helpful color. Secondly, you spoke about your confidence in the aging of the auto fleet and the sweet spot, stabilizing and helping the business going forward. You all have, presumably, pretty good visibility to the years, of cars that you're servicing. Are you -- other than the fact that they certainly should play out just based on everything we've seen historically. Are you seeing any evidence as cars make their way through your system that the dilution or the pain from these issue is abating and that the vintages are starting to help you out?","Paul Donahue","Matt, we have been saying now for some time that our hope and our expectation was that we would begin to see a little bit of a lift in the second half of this year, but certainly more so in 2019. And look, it's hard to zero in exactly why all of a sudden here in the months of May, June and certainly, in the July, things have really picked up. Is it all weather related? Is it partly due to the -- us coming out of that low we saw from the '08, '09 SAAR. But the fact is business is picking up. And I think it's certainly a combination of factors, including really a good job by our team in the field.","Matthew Fassler","That's super helpful. And then one final question because we do get a lot of questions on the tariff scene. Presumably, the 40% of the products you said that is coming from overseas for the U.S. auto business are final goods or finished goods that are sourced from overseas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but beyond that, are there components that would contribute to or that are found in and some of your purchases that would make the underlying number a little bit better. Just trying to understand not just direct pressure, first order pressure, but whether there's additional potential inflationary pressure for the industry from those inputs?","Paul Donahue","No, it would largely be the finished goods that we're bringing in. Matt, we saw back when the steel and aluminum tariffs went in back in June. So it's still very, very early. We've seen some folks and they push through a few small price increases due to what's happening, and that's across a couple of our businesses, but it's very minimal and it's -- look, it just started to really take hold in June. So I think that's a bit early to tell. But the majority of what we're referring to on that 40% is all finished goods.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli, RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","I'm sure it feels like that the horse is good at this point but I did have one more on the auto side. I'm trying to quantify train wreck, if we can. Paul, was the business in the U.S. down like kind of 2% to 3% in April? Or was it even worse than that?","Paul Donahue","No, you're in the range. And it was probably a poor choice of words. But no, it's -- you're right in that range, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And is there any kind of difference in terms of DIY or commercial performance when you have those kind of wet and cold conditions in the spring? Or is that kind of uniform across the business?","Paul Donahue","Well, as we reported now for a number of quarters, our retail business continues to outperform. And our retail business, once again, was up mid-single-digit in the quarter. And that's a number of quarters in a row. What we are encouraged about is the slight lift that we saw on the wholesale side, which it's been a challenge. We've been battling that flat to even slight declines on the wholesale business. So it's really encouraging to see a lift in our wholesale business as well.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you, okay. And then the last question here. Should we expect tables in inventory to largely stay at these levels? Or is there something particularly happen or influence that ratio at this quarter?","Carol Yancey","So we would expect to be around this level, the 100% to 110%. We did have a reclass in the quarter in inventory, and it was about $200 million related to sales return and that moved from inventory to current assets. So that probably spiked in the quarter, but that's going to stay there for the rest of the year. So -- but again, I think we made good progress on working capital, and you can expect us to stay around that level.","Scot Ciccarelli","Can I ask a clarification on that. So there was, what, $200 million of incremental inventory return in the quarter? Or is that like an accounting function of some sort?","Carol Yancey","No, it's an accounting -- it was related to the new revenue recognition guidance that was effective for this year. So it was reclassing an inventory amount to other current assets.","Operator","Our final question comes from Carolina Jolly, Gabelli & Company.","Anna Jolly","Most of my questions have been answered. But just, I guess, 2 clarifying ones, the do-it-yourself growth that you've been experiencing, would you attribute any of that to general industry growth? Or is that all of your investments in that investment?","Paul Donahue","Well, it's hard to say. We'll wait and see how our competitors report, Carolina. But as I have said in quarters past, our retail team is doing a terrific job. And our bar was set a bit low. And our team has done a terrific job of really upgrading our stores, which we've hit now. Most of our company stores have been revamped, expanded store hours. We have revamped our product assortment. All of that, I believe, is having a very, very positive contribution to our retail numbers.","Anna Jolly","Great. And then just another clarifying one. I know this has been asked a lot, but for the Automotive margin breakdown, would you say that the 40% that is international, did they actually see margin expansion? Or is this really all the U.S. that we saw some of that deleveraging and additional cost that you went over?","Carol Yancey","So basically, our international automotive margins had expansion, and that's a function of their core sales being mid-single digits. So we actually did have expansion year-to-date in the quarter for our international business. And remember, AAG is in there as well and that carries a higher margin. So I want to be clear, it was only the U.S. Automotive.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Carol Yancey","We want to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. We look forward to reporting to you in our third quarter call in October, and thank you for your support and your interest of Genuine Parts Company.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sid Jones","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company, first quarter 2018 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for 2018. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Carol Yancey our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings Press Release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.","Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this mornings' press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","Now, let me turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Sid. And welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. ","Earlier today we released our first quarter 2018 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our three businesses: automotive, industrial including both our Motion and EIS businesses and business products, including an update on our pending agreement to spin this business off and combine it with Essendant, which we announced last week. ","Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2018. After that we\u2019ll open the call to your questions. ","So to recap our first quarter performance across our global platform, total sales were a record $4.6 billion, up 17.4%, driven primarily by acquisitions and lower single digit comp sales growth. Net income was $177 million and earnings per share $1.20. ","Excluding the impact of transaction related costs associated with the fourth quarter 2017 acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group and the agreement to spin-off the business products group, adjusted net income was $186 million, up 16% and adjusted earnings per share were $1.27, an increase of 18%. ","So we entered 2018 as a more diversified global distributor and we remain committed to our key growth initiatives in order to drive long term sustained revenue growth. ","As a reminder, our four growth initiatives are as follows: Driving greater share of wallet with their existing customer base, employing an aggressive acquisition strategy focused on both geographical in-fill and product line adjacencies, expanding our digital capabilities and lastly further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint. We continue to see these growth pillars combine with the diversity in our operations, both across our core business segments and geographies, creating ongoing shareholder value. ","As we look to our Global Automotive Group, total sales were up 29.6% in the first quarter, including an approximate 1.5% comp sales increase, as well as the benefit of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation. Breaking it down further, sales for our U.S. Automotive operations were up 3.5% in the first quarter, with comp sales up slightly. This is consistent with the sales comps we saw throughout 2017 with retail sales outpacing commercial sales.","With that said, we estimate that the winter storms across the North East and Atlantic regions of the U.S. during the quarter which resulted in multiple distribution center and store closers, as well as the shift in the Easter holiday and approximate 1% negative impact on sales. By customer segment, we were encouraged to see our sales to NAPA Auto Care improve further in the first quarter up low single digits and our major account sales moved in the right direction as well. ","So the combination of a more normalized winter seasons in most parts of the U.S. coupled with the ongoing initiatives with our commercial customers, which includes an expansive and growing list of value added services, should drive stronger sales over the balance of the year. ","Turning to our retail business, we remain focused on the many opportunities we have with our DIY customers and this continues to play out in terms of positive sales comps. Among our initiatives, the NAPA Rewards Program now has over 7.1 million members, NAPA Online sales continue to grow and our retail impact store project which is a multiyear initiative to modernize and refresh our NAPA Store layouts. This project has resulted in our team upgrading and updating 535 company owned and independent owned stores through March of this year. These stores continue to produce our strongest retail sales comps and we look forward to the positive impact of this initiative as we roll this platform out to another 250 to 300 stores in 2018. ","We expect to see the overall aftermarket industry and ultimately our U.S. Automotive Sales strengthen over the balance of 2018 for several reasons. We expect to see the demand for failure and maintenance parts increase due to the impact of a more normalized winter weather pattern, something we haven\u2019t experienced for two years. We expect the number of vehicles and the aftermarket sweet spot to stabilize in 2018 after falling for the past few years due to the historically low new car sales and the post recession years after 2008. ","Long term fundamental drives for the automotive aftermarket remains sound, with a growing total fleet and relatively stable fuel prices, despite the recent increases which continue to drive increased miles driven among consumers. Total mils driven increased 1.2% in 2017 and they were up another four-tenths of 1% in January of \u201918, the most recent data available. ","We also expect our ongoing acquisitions to positively contribute to our future sales. Thus far in 2018 we added Smith Auto a Fresno, California based automotive group with five stores and approximately $17 million in annual revenues to our U.S. network. Smith Auto as well as other accretive tuck-in acquisitions remains an important part of our growth strategy and we see additional opportunities to expand our U.S. store footprint. ","So now let\u2019s turn to our International Automotive Businesses in Europe, Australasia, Canada and Mexico. We will begin with the newest addition to our growing automotive footprint Alliance Automotive Group. As you will recall, we acquired AAG one of the leading automotive aftermarket distributors in Europe with operations in France, the U.K., Germany and Poland back in November of 2017. ","So this was their first full calendar quarter as part of the GPC family. We are pleased to report that this business is performing quite well, posting low single digit sales comps and in line with our plans for both sales and profits. The AAG team completed several small bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter and has a full pipeline of additional acquisitions for the periods ahead. ","In addition, our management teams are working hard to deliver the $25 million in synergies we announced with this transaction and expect to realize over the next three years. These synergies primarily relate to our sourcing opportunities and we remain confident that we will achieve the targeted goal. ","As we work through this integration which is going very well, we expect the talented management team at AAG to drive strong results throughout 2018. AAGs growth plans are supported by the backdrop of solid industry fundamentals and steady economies across their markets. We look forward to their continued positive impact on our overall automotive results. ","Now a brief review of our other international automotive businesses. As a group, these operations delivered a 6% total sales increase in the first quarter, including a 2% comp sales increase in local currency. ","In Australia and New Zealand total sales in local currency were up mid single digits in the first quarter, driven equally by an increase in comp sales and the ongoing benefit of acquisitions. The Asia-Pac business operated with 560 stores in the first quarter of \u201818 and this business has plans for further store expansion in the future. ","In addition, the Asia-Pac team continues to make important e-commerce investments in several areas, including the strategic investment in a leading ongoing business to enhance our digital capabilities. We expect these initiatives in addition to the sound underline fundamentals for the Australasia after market, including a growing car park driven by record sales, relatively low gas prices, an upward trend in miles driven and an overall healthy Australian economy will drive continued solid results for our Australasian automotive business. ","At NAPA Canada, sales remained strong in the quarter with total sales in local currency up mid single digits and comp sales up low single digits. These results include the acquisition of the Universal Supply Group purchased back on December 31.","Universal ads 21 Ontario based stores to our operations, generating strong sales across both light vehicle parts and heavy duty truck parts. Finally, the industry fundamentals and general economic climate in Canada remain positive. So we remain optimistic for another good year from our Canadian team. ","In Mexico our automotive operations finished the first quarter of 2018 with total sales up mix-single digits before the favorable impact of currency. The NAPA Mexico footprint includes 42 total stores and we look forward to expanding our store base further over the balance of the year. We expect this expansion combined with our other growth initiatives in Mexico to further accelerate our revenue growth in this large market. ","Turning now to the industrial parts group which includes the combined results for EIS and Motion. Following a 7% increase in 2017, total sales were up 8.3% in the first quarter, including 5% comp sales growth and the benefit of acquisitions. ","The industrial economy continue to experience favorable conditions in the first quarter with positive reports from the major industrial indicators such as purchasing managers index, industrial production, rate counts and U.S. exports. These industry fundamentals, as well as our ongoing growth initiatives continue to drive robust growth across our product categories and the industries we serve. ","Each of our major product groups posted sales gains in 10 of the 12 industries where we compete were up as well. Additionally the equipment and machinery industry, our largest single sector, showed the strongest growth among the industries we serve for the second consecutive quarter. ","Other sectors, performing especially well include open paper, iron and steel, lumber and wood products, aggregate and cement, equipment rental and leasing and oil and gas extraction. Our industrial management teams at Motion and EIS are working closely together and making progress to generate economies of scale and improved efficiencies in the newly combined organization. The opportunities we see ahead for our larger and strong industrial group are encouraging and we expect strong results throughout 2018. ","We would also add that we are very pleased with the ongoing growth at Inenco; the Australian based industrial distribution company we partnered with in 2017. This business is performing quite well and continues to expand its footprint across Australia and New Zealand, while also operating in Indonesia and Singapore. ","Inenco announced earlier today the acquisition of HCD Flow Technology, a leading supplier of industrial hose and pumping equipment, further solidifying our market leading position in New Zealand. Today we have a 35% investment in Inenco and we look forward to investing further in this business within the next 12 to 18 months. This quality organization will be a great addition to our global industrial group. ","Now, a few comments on S.P. Richards, our business products group which reported a 4.8% decrease in total sales for the first quarter. This business remains challenged by the continued pressures and demand for traditional office products, while sales and the facilities break room and safety supply category continues to partially offset these headwinds and post solid growth. ","Due to the challenges we have faced in this business we have been evaluating our long term strategic outlook for S.P. Richards for some time. As referenced at the beginning of my comments, last week we announced that after a comprehensive review of our options, we entered into an agreement to spin-off the S.P. Richards business and merge it with Essendant, another national business products wholesaler.","This transaction made sense for several reasons. It maximized the value for S.P. Richards. GPC shareholders will gain 51% ownership of the combined company, allowing our current shareholders to participate in the significant upside of the newly combined company. The newly combined company in the best interest of all stakeholders, as it will be better positioned to effectively compete in the business product space with greater ability to support the customer community. ","This option allows us to strengthen our focus on our core and larger, higher growth and higher margin global automotive and industrial businesses, and finally the $347 million in cash payments to GPC further enhances our capital allocation strategy. ","We believe the combination of Essendant along with S.P. Richards creates a stronger, more diversified business. Together these talented management teams and complementary cultures with a shared commitment to serving customers will be better positioned for future success. For employees, the new company will have the scale and depth to compete more effectively. We look forward to supporting the S.P. Richards and Essendant teams in facilitating a seamless integration. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2018 subject to regulatory and Essendant shareholder approvals and other customer closing conditions.","So that is the summary of our consolidated and business segment sales results for the first quarter of 2018. It was another eventful quarter for us and we believe the steps we have taken in Q1 will set us up well for not only a successful 2018 campaign, but an even brighter future for GPC.","So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol.","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We\u2019ll begin with the review of our key financial information and then we will provide our updated outlook for 2018.","As Paul mentioned, total sales in the first quarter are up 17.4% or up 2% before acquisitions and a 1% favorable impact of foreign currency translation.","Our gross margin for the quarter was 31.3% compared to 29.6% last year. This strong increase primarily reflects the higher gross margin associated with AAG\u2019s operations, as well as other higher gross margin acquisitions and it also includes the benefit of increased supplier incentives in our industrial business. These favorable items were offset by $5.8 million in deal cost that was reported to cost of goods sold in the first quarter as well as the negative impact of lower supplier incentives at S.P. Richards.","We remain focused on enhancing our gross margin through several key initiatives, including continued supplier negotiations both globally and across our businesses, the ongoing investment and a more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies as well as improved analytic capabilities around SKU profitability.","The pricing environment remains somewhat inflationary through the first quarter and we would expect this to continue, especially if the steel and aluminum tariffs take effect in the coming months. At this point there is much uncertainty on this issue and it\u2019s really too early to determine the potential impact of tariffs on price inflation, but as we said before, we\u2019re generally able to pass along these types of increases to our customers. Our cumulative supplier price increases for first quarter of 2018 were flat for automotive, up 1.3% in industrial and up six-tenths of 1% in office.","Turning to our SG&A, total expenses for the first quarter are $1.2 billion, representing 26.3% of sales. This is up from last year as our expenses for the quarter reflect the operating cost at AAG, including incremental depreciation, amortization and interests, as well as $7.2 million in deal costs reported during the quarter. In addition, we continue to experience the lack of leverage on our comparable sales in both, the U.S. automotive and business products division, as well as ongoing pressure from rising costs in areas such as payroll, freight and including fuel delivery and IT and digital. ","To offset these and other increases we continue to enhance the cost saving initiatives across our business and we will remain focused on showing more progress in this important area in the quarters ahead. With that said, we also outlined in our year end call certain incremental costs that would be necessary to support our long term savings plan which will overall pressure our SG&A to some degree. All-in however, we\u2019re confident that we can improve our cost structure to positively impact our long term profitability.","Now let\u2019s discuss the results by segment. Automotive revenue for the first quarter of $2.6 billion was up 30% from the prior year and operating profit of $185 million was up 22% with an operating margin of 7.2% compared to 7.7% margin in the first quarter of 2017. Primarily the decline in operating margin reflects the deleverage of expenses in our U.S. automotive business.","Our industrial sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter are an increase of 8%. Operating profit of $112 million is up 8% and their operating margin is 7.2% compared to 7.3% last year with the slight decline due to the combination of motion with EIS\u2019s lower net margin. That said, we expect to see a strong performance from industrial in the quarters ahead, which does lead to margin expansions for the year.","Our business product revenues were $474 million down 5% from last year and their operating profit of $22 million is down 31% and their operating margin is 4.6%. This business continues to operate in a challenging environment and this is pressuring their profitability. Our total operating profit in the first quarter was up 11% on the 17% sales increase and our operating profit margin was 6.9% compared to 7.3% last year. Our teams are working hard to improve on these results in the quarters ahead.","We had net interest expense of $23 million in the quarter, up $17 million due to the increase in debt associated with the AAG acquisition as well as an increase in rate for the quarter. With that said, we continue to expect net interest expense to be in the range of $93 million to $95 million for the year.","Our total amortization was $21 million for the first quarter, an increased from the $11 million last year, primarily due to the amortization related to AAG. For 2018 we are updating our full year amortization to be $86 million to $87 million. Our depreciation expense of $37 million for the quarter was up $10 million from last year and for the full year we\u2019re updating our total depreciation to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. So on a combined basis we now expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $225 million to $235 million.","The other line which typically reflects our corporate expense was $44 million for the first quarter and this includes approximately $13 million in transaction related costs incurred in the quarter. Excluding these costs our corporate expense was $31 million which is up $6 million from the prior year and this is primarily due to the costs for our retirement plan valuation. For 2018 we continue to expect our corporate expense to be in the $115 million to $125 million range, excluding transaction related costs.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 23%, much lower than the 34% tax rate in the prior year, due mainly to the lower tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In addition our tax rate was positive impacted by the favorable mix of U.S. and foreign earnings in the quarter. Our first quarter rates are typically our lowest quarterly rates each year and for the full year we currently expect our 2018 tax rate to approximate 26%. ","Now let\u2019s discuss the balance sheet which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our accounts receivable at $2.6 billion are at 27% from the prior year and up 4% excluding the impact of acquisitions, primarily AAG as well as foreign currency. The 4% increase compares to our 2% comparable sales increase for the first quarter. So we have some work to do on improving this metric, but we do remain pleased with the quality of our receivables.","Our inventory at March 31 was $3.8 billion or up 15% from March of last year. It\u2019s down slightly excluding AAG and our other acquisitions as well as foreign currency. This improvement highlights the positive impact of our current initiatives to improve the inventory levels in our core businesses and we are very focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward.","Accounts payable was $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter is at 17% or at 2% excluding acquisitions as well as foreign currency. The 2% core increase reflects the lower levels of purchasing activity across our businesses, especially in U.S. automotive and business products which is slightly offset by the benefit of improved payment terms with certain suppliers. At March 31 our AP inventory ratio was approximately 100%. Working capital of $1.8 billion at March 31 compares to $1.6 billion last year. So effectively managing our working capital continues to be one of our top priorities and we look forward to showing further improvement in the quarters ahead.","Our total debt of $3.3 million at March 31 compares to $1 billion in total last year and it continues to reflect an approximately $2 billion in borrowings that were assumed in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the AAG acquisition. Our debt arrangements vary in maturity and at March 31 the average interest rate on our total debt was 2.84% with approximately $1.5 billion in debt at fixed rates. We\u2019re comfortable with our current debt structure and we\u2019re fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our growth initiative, including strategic acquisitions and investments such as AAG in Europe and the Inenco Group in Australia, which we believe creates significant value for our shareholders. So in summary, our balance sheet remains the key strength of the company. ","In the first quarter we generated $138 million in cash from operations, which has improved from last year. Our cash flow has continued to support our ongoing priorities for the use of cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. For 2018 we expect cash from operations to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range and free cash flow of approximately $400 million.","Our priorities for cash remain the dividend reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. These priorities have not changed even with the savings from tax reform and the cash associated with the pending spin-off transactions.","Regarding the dividend, 2018 marks our 62nd consecutive year of increased dividend paid to our shareholders. Our annual dividend of $2.88 represents a 7% increase from the prior year. We invested $32 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter which is up from $25 million in the prior year. For the year we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $200 million to $220 million, an increase from 2017 due to the impact of AAG as well as certain additional investments that we are planning and associated with our anticipated tax savings.","We did not purchase any of our common stock in the quarter and as of today we have 17.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases that we expect to be active in the program and the quarters ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","So now turning to our guidance for 2018, based on our current performance, our growth plans and initiatives, as well as the market conditions that we see for the future, we are maintaining our full year 2018 sales and earnings guidance as follows: We continue to expect total sales to be in the plus 12% to plus 13% range, excluding the benefit of any future acquisitions as well as an impact from foreign currency. By business we continue to expect plus 19% to plus 21% total sales for the automotive segment, plus 4% to plus 5% for the industrial segment, as sales decrease of minus 3% to minus 4% for the business products segment which will continue to be included in our guidance until the spin-off transaction is closer to completion.","On the earnings side we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.75, which is consistent with our initial guidance announced in our last call. This EPS guidance includes the benefit of a full year of operations for S.P. Richards, the Business Products Group.","In closing, we made progress in several important areas that better position us for the future and although we have much work ahead of us, we move forward excited about the many opportunities we have to grow our sales and improve our operating performance in the quarters ahead and over the long term.","We\u2019d like to thank all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and dedication as our people are our greatest asset and we\u2019re excited about the long term growth prospects for Genuine Parts. ","Paul, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. ","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Carol. As we reflect back on the first quarter we have several accomplishments we\u2019d like to highlight. We established a new sales record at $4.6 billion and up 17%. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.27 increased by 18% from 2017. We reiterated our full year sales and earnings guidance with sales at plus 12% to plus 13% and comparable EPS of plus 19% to 22%.","We completed our first full quarter with AAG and this business continues to perform well and we are making progress on our integration. We took two significant steps to optimize our portfolio, further enabling us to focus on our higher growth and higher margin global automotive and industrial businesses. ","First, we combined EIS with Motion to form a larger and stronger industrial products group with expected revenues exceeding $6 billion annually. In addition we entered into an agreement to spin off the business products group and form a new company with Essendant. We made significant IT investments in the quarter to improve our digital capabilities and enhance our B2C online offerings, as well as enhance our operational efficiencies and productivity in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Australasia.","We generated solid cash flows improving our cash from operations relative to 2017 and finally we increased our 2018 dividend for the 62nd consecutive year.","So with these accomplishments we move forward in 2018 better positioned to address our challenges and maximize the growth opportunities available to us. We remain focused on both organic and acquisitive sales to drive long term sustained revenue growth and will continue to execute on our plans and initiatives to enhance our gross margins, reduce cost and build a highly productive and cost effective infrastructure. We expect our focus in these key areas to improve the operating performance in our core businesses and for the company overall. ","As always, we look forward to updating you on our progress again in July when we report our second quarter 2018 results.","So with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to Ashley and Carol and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks, good morning everybody.","Paul Donahue","Hey, good morning Chris.","Christopher Horvers","I want to first focus on the U.S. NAPA business. Can you share how much the impact of Easter was by itself and I understand the weather headwinds in March with all the nor easters that came up the east coast, but at the same time it would seem like you had a pretty favorable January.","So I just wanted to get your thoughts there. Do you think it \u2013 is it fair to you know call out weather in March and not acknowledge the strength in January?","Paul Donahue","Yeah, so Chris the \u2013 and it\u2019s a fair question. The cadence of the quarter, certainly January started out pretty good and that cold weather helped our business for sure. February was pretty good as well. Where we began to see it tail off was in March and specifically in the second half of March. Easter had an impact. Probably to address your question specifically, Easter was probably less than 0.5% overall impact, but you know the \u2013 you take three nor easters that hit the Northeast in the month of March, we had numerous DC store shutdowns in both the Northeast and Atlantic and that absolutely had an impact. ","What we see right now Chris is that certainly too much winter weather is not a good thing. We\u2019ve seen our Ag business is off to a slow start, agriculture business. Our break business which is, you know we are usually taking off this time of the year is soft, but look in the long run the cold weather is a benefit for us. We think we\u2019ll see a pick up most likely in Q2 and on into Q3 as parts fail, maintenance come into play, pot holes begin to take their toll. So longer term it is going to be a positive for us.","Christopher Horvers","And then, you know it sounds like you know with the slightly positive U.S. comp and DIY better, was do-it-for-me thus down negative and I am just curious, you\u2019ve been around this business for a long time, what do you think has changed in the do-it-for-me business, because it\u2019s you know clearly DIY doing better than do-it-for-me is something very different from what had occurred for a long period of time.","Paul Donahue","Well, I again \u2013 and Chris look, it would be fair to point out that our NAPA business is not like our peer groups. We are improving our retail business and we\u2019ve had an initiative to upgrade our stores for some time. ","But retail for us DIY is still less than 25% of our overall business. We\u2019re still largely driven by our DIFM business and our commercial business. As I mentioned, we saw improved results in our auto care business which we have 17,000 NAPA auto care centers. That business was up low single digits, which has improved. Major accounts while improving somewhat from previous quarter, we\u2019re still challenged and what we hear in the marketplace Chris is that overall their business overall is pretty much flat. So specifically on your question about our DIFM business it was pretty much flat in the quarter.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then one last one. Just as you think about the SG&A dollar growth, can you talk about where that played, the SG&A dollars played out relative to your expectations for the first quarter and you know what\u2019s the stripping out all on the acquisitions. What\u2019s sort of the core growth rate in your, you know the SG&A structure this year. Thanks very much.","Carol Yancey","Yes so Chris, when we look at SG&A in the quarter and where our expectations were, so our core growth in U.S. automotive was not quiet where we thought it would be, much about what Paul mentioned earlier, what we saw certainly in March and then our business products division, their core growth was a little bit worse than what we saw. ","So having said that, it\u2019s Q1 and what we certainly, we look at the 300 basis point increase. Looking at, you got the deal costs in there, you got AAG, you\u2019ve got increased interests in amortization and that would be about half of the increase. The rest is really from the lower core growth and payroll is the biggest driver there. So we look at our businesses and we look at headcount and we look at headcount being flat as an organization, but these wage pressures, the increases we are facing in fuel, I mean those are real dollars. ","So the headwinds on wages and fuel are real and that was probably a little worse than we thought in the quarter and we mentioned the additional investments we are going to be making in IT and digital and certainly that was planned for. So where probably we were short was the lower core growth and then seeing the additional stronger wage pressures and increases in fuel and deliveries. ","Christopher Horvers","Thank you. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Matt Fassler ","Thank you so much and good morning to you. My first question just based on quantifying the impact of AAG to gross margin and I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s intrinsic marginrate and if it is that much higher, curious as to why or whether it\u2019s just kind of P&L geography. I know we saw this popup to a smaller degree in Q4 when you only had ownership of that business for part of the quarter, but just so that we can model that appropriately over the next couple of quarters, if you could talk about why this is driving the reported gross margin so much higher. ","Carol Yancey ","Yeah, happy to take that. So gross margin was up 170 basis points in the quarter and I would tell you AAG was about 100 basis points, and the remaining amount is due to improvement on the industrial side and also slight improvement on the automotive side offset by declines in business products. The reason that AAGs gross margin is stronger and we\u2019ve spoken to \u2013 sometimes we\u2019ve have acquisitions, Asia-Pac in particular and now AAG that come in with a higher gross margin and higher SG&A, but these are comparable from an operating margin basis. ","The big driver for AAG and I think we mentioned this early on when we made the acquisition, they have growth revenue that is more around slightly over $2 billion but the GAAP reported revenue, so growth billings will be much higher. The GAAP reported revenue is more like $1.7 billion. So when you look at the gross margin and the SG&A you are going to have higher gross margin by lowering your sales number. ","Matt Fassler ","Understood. The second quick question I have relates to operating leverage in the automotive business. If you think about the underlying intrinsic business ex-acquisitions, can you talk about the kind of sales growth that you think you need to breakeven in terms of automotive unit margin?","Paul Donahue ","Yeah Matt, this is Paul. We generally take about 3%. We have been kind of mired in this flat to 1%, 2% comp growth here now for few quarters in the row and we got to generate some top line growth. I covered our growth pillars with you earlier. Our team is laser focused on driving top line growth so that we can leverage that fixed expense that we have, but we generally look at 3% as a must. ","Matt Fassler ","And is that breakeven higher today, given both some of the discretionary investments that you are making also you spoke about the backdrop in terms of wages and fright and obviously that something that everyone is coping with. Does that take that number above 3% or is 3% still, is leverage still at...","Paul Donahue ","No, 3% is a good number Matt and we are absolutely our committed to the investments that Carol mentioned. But 3% is a good number. ","Matt Fassler ","And then very quickly finally. So I think you said in the other line items, just to understand P&L geography of the dealer related costs. I think you broke out $13 million of cost, part of it in gross margin, part of in SG&A, in your initial comments. Then you also saw about $13 million in other line item. I just want to make sure, and I\u2019m like just be in my own confusion that I understand where exactly that $13 million that we exclude, resides in your disclosure. ","A - Carol Yancey","Yeah, so in the segment information there are no deal costs in any of the operating segments. So we put the deal cost of $13 million the other net line and then when you look at the income statement, we had $5.8 million in cost of goods sold and $7.2 million in SG&A. ","Matt Fassler ","Got you. So you broke it out on that divisional P&L and you just articulated it where it shows up on the consolidated P&L, that\u2019s very helpful. ","Carol Yancey","Correct, but it\u2019s all the same $13 million. ","Matt Fassler ","Perfect. Thank you so much guys. ","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Matt. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys, Scot Ciccarelli. ","Paul Donahue","Hi, Scot ","Scot Ciccarelli","I had two questions. Hi, the first is, I know it\u2019s probably hard to figure out just given the changes occurring, wage expense, etc. Can you give us an idea how much of your cost structure in the auto business is fixed versus what you consider is variable?","Carol Yancey","Well, I would tell you on SG&A when we look at our cost in SG&A and we\u2019ve said as always at least two-thirds of our costs are payroll and payroll related. Having said that, when you look at facilities and a portion of the payroll being fixed, we are probably 55%-ish that we would say would be fixed, and that why when we talk about what we need to leverage, it keeps at that 3%ish growth in order to leverage. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Alright, so 55%...","Carol Yancey","Now having said that, we are working hard to make sure that we are address our cost base and whether we look at rationalization of facilities, investments in productivity improvements, optimizing our fright and delivery, all these things to help take some of these costs that could be fixed to lower basis. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it, understood. And then secondly, can you also comment on merchandise margin performance in the U.S. auto business just given the concerns out in the market place regarding price transparency?","Carol Yancey","Yes, so our gross margin on the U.S. automotive business was flat. We actually, I think this is our second quarter where we\u2019ve seen flat to maybe just up slightly gross margin and we\u2019ve talked about we are not seeing impact on our gross margin as it relates to price transparency. Having said that, we are looking and always trying to optimize gross margin dollars, we got several initiatives going on. So not really \u2013 again part of that gets back what Paul mentioned, being the next that we have of commercial versus retail too. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Understood, okay thanks a lot guys. ","Paul Donahue","Thanks Scot. ","Carol Yancey","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan ","Hey, good morning guys.","Paul Donahue","Good morning. ","Carol Yancey","Morning. ","Bret Jordan ","I was on a hare late. Did you talk about regional performance in the U.S. auto market?","Paul Donahue","We did not Bret, but I\u2019m happy to talk about it. We got a \u2013 about five of our eight divisions across the U.S. that are pretty well grouped together and they range from a point down to a couple of points up, so a very narrow band. ","Our outliers, and we\u2019ve got a couple of outliers, certainly one would be the Northeast as you might expect. As Chris asked earlier, that winter weather certainly has been a boon for Northeast business and our Northeast business has performed quite well. Despite the interruptions with the nor easters that business has performed quite well. ","On the flip we\u2019ve got one of our businesses, one of our divisions in the mid-Atlantic area that would include Memphis, Richmond that part of the country. They\u2019ve been hit hard again with winter disruptions and we\u2019ve had a number of store closers DC closures. They are not equipped to handle the snow like they are in the Northeast. So that\u2019s pretty much what we\u2019ve seen through Q1. ","Bret Jordan ","Okay, great. And then the comment on inflation, I guess not seeing a lot in the first quarter in auto. What\u2019s your expectation hearing more about Asian labor and obviously some material inflation and the cost of factoring for your suppliers? Do you think the bias is to more inflation in the second half of the year?","Carol Yancey","We do. In talking to our merchants and our suppliers, we do think we are going to be at a half a percent or maybe even a full percent for the year maybe in the later part of the year. And as far as, there is still a lot of uncertainty around the tariffs as I mentioned, so we are still just waiting on that but I think we are coming off of five consecutive years of having deflation. So the fact that we can come up with flat to up slightly, we do think we\u2019ll see that in the back half of the year?","Bret Jordan ","Okay and then one last question, on Smith Auto and some of the deals you have done, Merle's and of the little acquisitions. What\u2019s the percentage of auto sales that are company owned stores now versus independent?","Paul Donahue","It\u2019s a good question, perhaps let me think on that for just a minute. You are right to point out Smith and Merle's and we\u2019ve had three or four others in the past number of quarters. It\u2019s still holding fairly steady when you look at independent versus company stores, independence would acquire for better than two-thirds of our overall business. ","Bret Jordan ","Okay, great, thank you. ","Paul Donahue","And the mix of stores is staying pretty much the same. ","Bret Jordan ","Okay great, appreciate it. Thank you. ","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Jacob Moser","Hey guys, this is Jacob Moser for Chris. ","Carol Yancey","Good morning. ","Jacob Moser","So now that you have been involved with AAG for almost 6 months. We\u2019re curious to see what you\u2019re going about differences in the European market. And then for the semi related, like how mature is \u2013 thinking in terms of the growth outlook. Will that most be at Greenfield and existing markets there or do you think mostly growth in Europe will sort of opportunistic M&A driven.","Paul Donahue","Yeah, I\u2019ll take that one. Look the difference in between the European market place and the U.S. What we found, and again it\u2019s early. But it\u2019s very similar, we\u2019ve got many of the same suppliers when you think about our large global supplier base, its folks like Bosh, NGates and SchaefflerKYB, NGK they supply us around the world. ","The folks at AAG have a, they are more commercially oriented, much like we are here in the US. They have a blend of both company stores and independently owned stores. So the differences are really very subtle. ","If you think about our growth outlook, one of the things that drew us to Europe and to AAG is we are very bullish on the growth opportunities in the future and we think that the consolidation that is taking place now in Europe will only accelerate and certainly we intent to be part of that consolidation. But at the same time our folks at AAG are seeing, are seeing good comp store growth as well. So we are very bullish on our future and with our European partners. ","Jacob Moser","Great. Thanks for talking the question. ","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Mike Montani","Hey guys good morning, its Mike Montani on for Greg. ","Carol Yancey","Hey Mike.","Mike Montani","Just wanted to ask if I could a couple of quick ones. One was, if you could talk a little bit about some of the other acquisitions that you had made year to date thus far besides the AAG. Just want to make sure we have accurate total incremental revenue contributions in the model.","Carol Yancey","So it was really minimal in the quarter. We talked about Smith Auto that was the one that Paul mentioned. In Europe there was eight single store acquisitions that are just small bolt on acquisitions, but really in the quarter its Smith Auto that we mentioned earlier.","Paul Donahue","And just as a reminder Mike, you know AAG was actually late last year. So that was not a 2018 acquisition. ","Mike Montani","Yeah, got it. Okay and then if I could just follow up a little bit; you guys had mentioned there was optimism around industrial and seeing some margin expansion there as we work through the year. I guess I am just wondering, is the same sentiment fair for the U.S. automotive division give the thought that the comps will be improving here, at least towards that two to three range it looks like?","Paul Donahue","Yeah, well certainly two different industries. I\u2019ll make be touch on industrial first Mike and you are right, we are very optimistic. You know we had a terrific year last year with Motion and we have seen that continue on in the first quarter. Last year each quarter we were up 7%, first quarter this year we were up 8%. So they continue to rock along, PMI numbers, rig counts, industrial production, all are positive. Manufacturers are bullish right now about the U.S. and so we don\u2019t see any slowdown in industrial. ","Automotive, it\u2019s a different industry, differ business, but we are optimistic about our U.S. automotive business as well. We think as I mentioned earlier that certainly this winter weather that we experienced in Q1, although I think being offset somewhat with business disruptions in Q1, I think we will see the benefit in Q2 and beyond and again, most of the fundamentals in automotive remain positive. So there is no reason we shouldn\u2019t continue to grow our U.S. automotive business and get it back into those 3% to 4% comps that we historically have posted. ","Mike Montani","Okay and if I could just ask about sourcing for a minute, I know you all have done a lot of work in the past sourcing out of Asia. Can you just update us on what percentage of the buy you all will be doing there, especially in light of the S.P. Richards divestiture? How to think about just kind of the ability to source from other countries as well if that were to come up?","Paul Donahue","Yeah, so Mike we have a sourcing office in China, we\u2019ve had it for well over 10 years that services all of our businesses. The amount of volume rolling through that office as a percentage of our total is still a small percentage and a bit of that was in our office products business. ","What I would comment on Mike is, you know as we now move into Europe and Australia and New Zealand continues to expand, as we look across our souring and our supplier base, you have really four different sources if you will. You have your U.S. exclusive suppliers, you have European exclusive suppliers, you\u2019ve got global suppliers of which I\u2019ve already listed a number of those and then you have of course Asian sourcing as you just mentioned. ","We are working very closely with our team in Europe and working through that suppler base and that sourcing model and we think there is real opportunity for us to continue to build and to drive global synergies across all of our businesses. ","Mike Montani","Great. Thank you. ","Paul Donahue","Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America.","Jason Haas","Hi, this is Jason Haas for Elizabeth Suzuki. Thank you for talking the question. So I just got a follow-up regarding your comments on inflation. Can you provide color on what product categories you have the best pricing power in and might be the best position to pass along any inflation that we might see?","Carol Yancey","Well actually, the comments that we have, I mean right now we are flat in automotive and what we would look for if we do have some inflation in the back half of the year to around a half a point, those increases would be passed along to customers. So it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a different there is product categories and how we pass that along. Because these would be increases of such that are passed along in the broad market; this is not something specific to us or to a certain supplier. So they would be broad market related. And quite honestly, that\u2019s how the potential would be with tariffs or any of those changes is that it would be broad based. ","So out of those we\u2019ve got color on exactly what categories as we are going to come in, but we think about it in a much broader sense. ","Jason Haas","Thanks, and then as a follow-up. So we\u2019ve seen the weather in April has been a lot colder than last year. So I\u2019m curious just quarter-to-date if you have seen any sort of pickup in demand or do you think the weather is going to kind of push those sales later maybe into May or June?","Paul Donahue","Well its, Jason I mean it\u2019s early to comment on that, but what I would tell you is we need to get on with spring. I know you guys are getting some winter weather up there still in the northeast. We had \u2013 just last week we had over a foot of snow in the Midwest, many parts of the Midwest, that\u2019s not great for our business. We are in the time of the year where farmers got to get out in the field and we do a ton of business with agriculture, fields are frozen, covered with snow. This is break season; the break season is now really being delayed. So look I think that business will come but it\u2019s getting pushed out a bit because of this unseasonably cold winter weather in late March and April. ","Jason Haas","Thanks.","Paul Donahue","You are welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. ","Seth Basham ","Thanks a lot and good morning. ","Carol Yancey","Good morning. ","Seth Basham ","I have a follow-up question along those lines. Just thinking about your performance in the quarter in the U.S. auto business, can you provide color on how weather sensitive versus non-weather sensitive categories performed overall?","Paul Donahue","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question Seth. When you look at our key product categories, I guess not surprisingly with a little more severe winter weather, batteries were our number one growth business and I would tell you it\u2019s a little bittersweet because we had a good -- we had a really good quarter in batteries and we had some service interruptions early in the quarter that I think it even could have been better. ","Our tool and equipment business was good, our hydraulics business was good, chemicals as you would expect performed quite well, so all of those categories were strong in the quarter. Where we saw some underperformers was around our under car business. So again going back to what I had mentioned earlier, when you get into March we generally consider the month of March as the kickoff of break season and with some of the weather that we had across the U.S., I think that\u2019s going to get pushed out a bit. ","Seth Basham ","Got you, a follow-up on that, March beginning the break season. With your commercial customer focus, how does weather play into that? I can understand DIY-ers not being able to work on their cars outside, but it wasn\u2019t so bad that it created difficulties in taking cars to a shop to get fixed. ","Paul Donahue","No, it certainly wouldn\u2019t Seth but I just think that consumers are putting it off and it also certainly relates to, when you look at the categories performing well just as batteries it directly relates to failure. So I think just some of your maintenance categories are just going to get delayed, going to get pushed out a bit, and that\u2019s regardless of whether it\u2019s DIY or DIFM. I think that\u2019s the case. ","Seth Basham ","Got you. Thank you and then one housekeeping item, you may have addressed this before, but thinking about the seasonality of AAG business, can you remind us how it compares to the U.S. or the Global Auto business?","Paul Donahue","Very similar, very similar to the U.S. and on that note Seth as I now give the weather report across the U.S. I can talk about Europe as well and we got hit hard. The UK was basically shutdown for two days in Q1 that impacted AAGs business. I think we would have seen, I don\u2019t think \u2013 I know we would have seen even stronger numbers out of that team without that, but the weather patterns are very, very similar the U.S.","Seth Basham ","Thank you. ","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. ","Carolina Jolly ","Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Just one question I guess. This is another quarter where you have seen some weakness in your national account business. When you talk to those customers, do they give you any other factors outside of weather that might be affecting your business? ","Paul Donahue"," ","Well, and I didn't glean this directly from conversations with our major account customers. But as you look across some of the headwinds, Carolina you would have to, I mean certainly weather isn\u2019t always going to be near the top of the list. But let\u2019s face it, vehicles and parts are seeing less failure these days. Vehicles are much better made, the quality of vehicles are much better made and I think you are just seeing less failure. ","But I do believe in the long run this major account business will bounce back. We don\u2019t believe we are losing any market share with our key partners. We\u2019ll continue to drive to try to grab a greater share of their spend. As I mentioned in our key growth pillars that is absolutely our first and foremost is grab a greater share of wallet. So the business is there for our teams. We just got to promise that we got to execute a bit better.","Carolina Jolly ","Alright, thanks a lot.","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today.

The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We'll begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO.","Tom?","Thomas C.

Paul Donahue, our President, along with Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and I will each handle a portion of today's call. And once we've completed our individual remarks, we will look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.","Earlier this morning, we released our third quarter results and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,685,000,000, and this was up 9% over the prior year. Net income was $173.7 million, which was up 1%, and our earnings per share were $1.12 this year compared to $1.11 last year, which is also a 1% increase. We will get into the segment detail in a moment, but as a general statement, we would say that the third quarter proved to be challenging for us, more so in our nonautomotive businesses than the automotive segment.","As you will hear from Paul in a few moments, the automotive operations performed reasonably well for us and they showed good sequential trends in a number of key areas and automotive continues to make solid progress. However, the same cannot be said about the nonautomotive businesses and this is where we came up short of our expectations in the quarter.","And just to point out the contrast, Automotive revenues in the quarter were up 22% and operating profit was up 20%. Nonautomotive revenues were down 3% and operating profit was down 13%. Clearly, our expectations were for a bit stronger performance from the nonautomotive group in the quarter, but unfortunately, we saw deceleration in demand patterns across each of these businesses as the quarter progressed and this weighed heavily both on our revenue and operating profit results.","The Industrial segment is our largest nonautomotive business and they had a 3% sales decrease in the quarter. After showing modest sequential improvement in Q2, we regret somewhat over the past 3 months. And looking at the various customer categories, we see uneven levels of demand across the customer base. Key customers in segments like food products, automotive and lumber and wood products, among others, continue to grow. But then, customers in segments like equipment and machinery are finding it more challenging.","Equipment and machinery is our largest industry group and a number of customers in this group have been impacted by the slowdown in the oil and gas, and mining and resource industries, both domestically and globally. While a near-term pickup in oil and gas and mining and resource industries is not anticipated, we do anniversary the year-long slowdown that we've seen from each of these industries, and we see that anniversary in the fourth quarter, which will somewhat reduce the headwinds that we've encountered over the past 12 months in these 2 specific sectors. And that, combined with a steady performance from some of the other customer segments, should put us in a position to show a gradual improving revenue picture in the quarters ahead.","Moving to the Electrical segment, we had another challenging quarter here as well, with sales coming in 5% below last year. And we see some of the same disparity among industry segments as we've experienced in our industrial segment. Customers tied to the transportation and housing segments are showing growth, as are the contract manufacturers to the electronics industry. But then, these increases are being offset by decreases with customers in the coal and mining, alternative energy and defense contract segments, with the latter primarily due to sequestration.","However, while early, it appears that our business with the alternative energy and defense contractors is starting to stabilize and should not be as much of a headwind in the coming months. Additionally, we expect to close on a small electrical acquisition at month end, which should add an additional $10 million to $12 million to our revenue over the final 2 months. All of which should enable the Electrical Group to end the year with a more positive fourth quarter and position us for improved results in 2014.","Moving on to Office Products. This group ended the quarter down 3%, and as with several of the other businesses, we saw a more pronounced deceleration late in the quarter. From a product perspective, both the cleaning and break room supplies and furniture category showed positive growth in the quarter. But these increases were offset by decreases in the technology and office supplies categories.","From a customer perspective, our national account business was up low single-digits in the quarter, while our independent reseller customers were down low single-digits, and both the product category and customer segment results for the quarter follow a similar pattern on a year-to-date basis as well.","So it's been a challenging year thus far for our Office Products team. And unfortunately, we don't see any material changes in the external environment in the near term. As a result, the main areas of focus for our Office Products Group are our share of wallet and market share initiatives, both for our customers and ourselves, as well as continued work on product and customer diversification. Of all of our businesses, Office Products has the furthest to go to get back on positive footing. And our sense is that it's going to take a little longer than Industrial and Electrical to come back around.","So that's an overview of the nonautomotive segments and Paul will now cover the automotive operations.","Paul?","Paul D. Donahue","Thank you, Tom. I'd like to add my welcome to each of you this morning. I'm pleased to join Tom and Carol and to have an opportunity to provide you an update on the third quarter performance of our global automotive business.","As was mentioned in last quarter's conference call, we are now including in our automotive recap, the results GPC Asia Pacific, which was consolidated into our results on April 1. This business continues to perform as expected throughout Australia and New Zealand, and we are encouraged with the progress we have seen thus far.","As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, we are pleased to report that our overall global automotive business grew top line revenues by 22% in the third quarter.","Now let's move on to our North American automotive business. Our team delivered a 5.3% sales increase in the third quarter, consisting of core growth of approximately 4.5%, which is in line with our second quarter performance. This 4.5% increase was offset approximately 1% due to the impact from foreign currency, primarily related to our Canadian operations. On the plus side, we have the benefit of 1 additional billing day in the quarter, which contributed approximately 1.5% of sales.","We would also mention that as we look at our sales results across the regions of the U.S., we are encouraged to see that all are positively contributing to our sales growth, with our Eastern division performing exceptionally well.","Within our U.S. company-owned store group, comparable same-store sales growth in the third quarter came in at plus 4.3%. After a challenging first quarter, we have now rung up consecutive quarters of better than 4% comp store sales growth. This performance was driven by a strong 7.9% overall sales increase in the quarter or 6.1% on a per day basis in our commercial and wholesale side of the business.","Diving deeper into our commercial results, our non-fleet-related business turned in another strong quarter, generating a 9.7% increase or 8% on an adjusted basis. This segment was supported by double-digit sales growth among our major account customers and high single-digit growth from our 15,000 plus NAPA AutoCare centers.","Our fleet business held steady at 5.1% growth, 3.4% on an adjusted basis in the quarter, which is consistent with our performance in Q2. Our wholesale average ticket value increased low single-digit and our average number of tickets was up mid single-digit in this segment of our business. We are encouraged by both of these sales trends.","Turning to our retail business, we experienced a slowdown in this segment during the quarter and ended with sales down 1.8% or 3.3% on a same-day basis. The month of September was especially soft. We believe this is consistent with many other retailers' lackluster September store sales, implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and the first government shutdown in 17 years certainly impacted consumers' willingness to spend. That said, we were pleased to see our average retail dollar invoice trending up slightly for the quarter. However, this positive trend was offset by a slowdown in foot traffic and a slight reduction in our average number of invoices. We will continue to drive this strategically important segment of our business with a number of ongoing sales initiatives.","From a product category standpoint, we continue to see strong sales in our Electrical category, primarily driven by our NAPA battery business. Our Electrical business has been a key contributor in 2013, generating just shy of a double-digit increase.","An additional positive product trend is our improved sales in our all-important brake business. This is significant as we experienced slowing in this critical category back in 2012, and only began to see a modest recovery in the first quarter of 2013. Back-to-back strong sales quarters in our brake business confirms our team's efforts are succeeding in getting this business back on track.","One last mention on the product front is the comment about our seasonal air conditioning business. Milder summer temps in some parts of the country led to a downturn in our AC business for this past quarter.","So in summary, we are pleased to see both our North American and Australasian Automotive operations report another quarter of solid results. We remain positive about the core fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket and the growth opportunities available to us in both the retail and commercial sectors. Many of the key metrics remain positive. Total miles driven is tracking positive for the year. Fuel prices remain steady and the average age of vehicles on the road remains in excess of 11 years.","Our management team remains committed to driving profitable growth in the fourth quarter and we're optimistic we'll continue this growth into 2014.","We'd like to personally thank all of our associates, both at NAPA North America and at GPC Asia Pacific and Australia and New Zealand for their strong efforts in the third quarter.","So that completes our overview of the Automotive business. And at this time, I'll hand it over to Carol to get us started with a review of the financial results.","Carol?","Carol B. Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We will get started with a review of our third quarter and 9-month income statements and the segment information, and then we will review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back and wrap it up and then we'll open the call up to your questions.","As we turn to the income statement, we want to reiterate that our September 30th third quarter and year-to-date consolidated results referenced in our commentary include GPC Asia Pacific acquired April 1. And with that said, total sales of a record high $3.7 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 9% from last year, as Tom mentioned. And for the 9 months, our total sales of $10.6 billion, up 7% from 2012. Before the impact of the GPC Asia Pacific acquisition, total sales are up 1% for both the third quarter and year-to-date, reflecting the difficult conditions in our nonautomotive businesses.","Our gross profit for the third quarter was 29.9% of sales, up 100 basis points from 28.9% last year. And for the 9 months, our gross margin of 29.6% is up from the 29.0% for the same period last year or an increase of 60 basis points. Our improvement in gross margin can be attributed to the favorable impact of higher gross margins in our Australasian business, which owns 100% of its stores. This benefit was partially offset by a slight decrease in our core North American gross margins in the third quarter, primarily related to our Industrial business and to a lesser degree, our automotive business. In addition, in association with the GPC Asia Pacific acquisition, we recorded a $3 million expense to cost of sales in the quarter as the final piece of a purchase accounting adjustment related to the Australasian inventory writeup to fair value. The original $18 million adjustment was recorded in the second quarter for a total year-to-date impact of $21 million.","As an additional point of interest, we continue to see very little inflation in our businesses. Our year-to-date 2013 cumulative pricing is down 2\/10 of 1% in Automotive, up 0.9% for Industrial, up 0.5% for Office Products, and up 0.8% for Electrical.","Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses were $829 million for the third quarter, up 18% from 2012 and at 22.5% of sales. For the 9 months in 2013, our total SG&A expenses are $2.3 billion or up 10%, and at 22.0% of sales. Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales are up 160 and 80 basis points for the quarter and the 9 months, respectively, and this primarily reflects the impact of higher SG&A expenses at GPC Asia Pacific, again, due to their 100% owned store model.","We've also seen a decrease in our leverage associated with our nonautomotive businesses. Year-to-date, our SG&A includes the positive onetime pretax adjustment of $54 million, net of expenses, associated with the revaluation of our original 30% investment in GPC Asia Pacific that was required on April 1. Excluding this adjustment, our SG&A for the 9 months as a percentage of sales was 22.5%.","We continue to focus on effective cost management in every area of our business. A few notable cost control measures include ongoing investments in technology, which has positively impacted our operating efficiencies in our distribution centers and stores, as well as supply chain initiatives in areas such as freight and logistics.","Now turning to the segment results. Our Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.02 billion, and represents 55% of sales and is up 22.1%. Our operating profit of $180.2 million is up 19.6%, and our margin is down 20 basis points from last year to 8.9%. This relates to some slight gross margin pressure in our North American operations, which in part can be attributed to the lack of pricing which we mentioned earlier.","For the 9 months, our Automotive sales were $5.57 billion, representing 52% of total revenue and up 16.4%. Our operating profit of $487.6 million is up 16.6%, so the margin is up 10 basis points to 8.8% from 8.7% last year, which is a very good job.","The Industrial Group had sales of $1.11 billion in the quarter and this is 30% for our total revenue and a decrease of 2.5%. Our operating profit of $79.6 million is down 15.9%, so we saw the Industrial margin decrease to 7.2% from 8.3%. Through September, Industrial sales of $3.34 billion, which is 32% of our revenues, are down 1.6%. Our operating profit of $247.4 million is down 9.7%, and their margin is down 70 basis points to 7.4% from 8.1% one last year. We attribute the margin declines for the quarter and the 9 months to a decrease in volume incentives associated with lower purchasing volumes with our suppliers, general gross margin pressures in a weak demand environment and a loss of leverage on the lower sales volume.","Moving on to Office Products. We had revenues of $430.5 million, which is 11% of our total sales and down 3.1% for the quarter. Our operating profit of $28.1 million is down 6.2%, so their margin is down 20 basis points to 6.5% from 6.7%. Year-to-date, Office sales of $1.25 billion represent 12% of our total revenue and are down 2.4%. Our operating profit of $91.1 million is down 7.2%, and then margin is 7.3% versus 7.6% last year or down 30 basis points. For the quarter and the 9 months, this margin decline is due to the loss of leverage on the lower sales volume.","Our Electrical Group had sales in the quarter of $142.8 million, and up 4% in total revenue and down 5.3%. Our operating profit of $12.6 million is down 6.9%, so their margin came down to 8.8% from 9.0%, but that's still a very strong margin. For the year, Electrical sales were $425 million, which represents 4% of our total revenue and down 5%. Our operating profit of $35.3 million is down 8.2%, and their margin is down 30 basis points to 8.3% from 8.6%. And as with the Industrial and Office businesses, the decline in margin for Electrical for the quarter and the 9 months is primarily a function of the loss of leverage on the lower sales volumes for these periods.","So our total operating profit was up 4% in the third quarter and our operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 8.2%. For the 9 months, our total operating margin held steady with the second quarter at 8.2%, but it's down from the 8.4% for the same period in 2012. The decline in our operating margins thus far in 2013 continues to reflect the impact of weak sales conditions in our nonautomotive businesses, and we would add that the operating margin at GPC Asia Pacific remains in line with our core Automotive businesses, as we expected. We remain committed to expanding our operating margin in the periods ahead through some of our ongoing initiatives.","We had net interest expense of $7 million in the third quarter. And year-to-date, our interest expense is $18.2 million. Interest is up from 2012 due to an increase in the total debt. And based on our current projections, we would expect net interest expense of approximately $25 million to $26 million for the full year. This has slightly improved from our prior guidance of $26 million to $28 million.","Our total amortization expense was $7.7 million for the third quarter and $20.5 million for the 9 months. This is up from 2012 due to the Quaker City acquisition in May of last year, and April's acquisition of GPC Asia Pacific. We currently expect amortization to be in the $29 million range for the full year, which is down slightly from our previous projections.","The other line, which reflects corporate expense, was a $14 million expense for both the third quarter and the 9 months. This line also includes the net impact of the purchase accounting adjustments discussed earlier in association with gross profit and SG&A. In summary, this amounted to a $36 million favorable adjustment in the second quarter and a $3 million expense in the third quarter. We currently project this line to be approximately $30 million in expense for the full year.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 36.1% compared to 36.3% last year. And for the 9 months, our 33.9% rate compares to the 36.4% rate for the prior year. That current rate reflects the favorable impact of lower Australian tax rate applied to GPC Asia Pacific's pretax earnings.","In addition, the improvement in the year-to-date rate also reflects the favorable tax rate on the second quarter gain that was associated with the remeasurement of our Australasian investment. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to approximate 36.0% to 36.5% for an annual rate of 34.5% to 35.0% for 2013.","Our net income for the quarter of $173.7 million was up slightly and EPS of $1.12 compared to $1.11 last year was up 1%. For the year through September, our net income of $534.5 million is up 10% and our EPS of $3.43 compared to the $3.11 for 2012 was also up 10%.","Now we'll move on to the balance sheet. Cash at September 30 was $321 million, which was down from the $400 million at December 30 last year and December 31, 2012. We're pleased with our current cash position and continue to generate strong cash flows as a result of our increase in earnings, our effective working capital and asset management, as well as cost containment measures.","Our accounts receivable of $1.8 billion at September 30 increased 9.5% from the same period in 2012 on a 9% sales increase for the quarter. Our goal is to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth, so we have a little work to do in this area and we remain very focused on meeting this goal in the periods ahead. We are very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.","Our inventory at quarter end was $2.8 billion, which is up 12% from September 20, 2012, primarily due to the GPC Asia Pacific inventory added at the start of the second quarter. Excluding the impact of Australasia, our inventory is up just 1% from last year and down 2% from December 31. So our team is doing a very good job of managing our inventory levels, and we remain very focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move into the final period of 2013.","Our accounts payable balance at September 30 was $2.2 billion, up 26% from September 30 of last year. Excluding the impact of GPC Asia Pacific, our payables were up 18%. Our ongoing growth in trade payables reflects the positive impact of our extended payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're very encouraged with our improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital and days and payables. We expect this trend to continue in the periods ahead.","Our working capital of $1.8 billion at September 30 is down approximately 26% from September of 2012, primarily due to the increase in current debt in 2013. Excluding our current debt, working capital is down approximately 5% from last year. Effectively managing accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company and our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in tremendous improvement in our working capital position and cash flows. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at September 30 of 2013.","Our total debt of $834 million at September 30 includes 2 $250 million term notes which we've carried for some time now, as well as another $334 million in borrowings under our multicurrency syndicated credit facility agreement. This adds to total debt to total capitalization of approximately 21% at September 30, which is down slightly from the 23% at June 30, while up from the 14% at September 30 the prior year. We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time, and we currently expect total debt to approximate $850 million at December 31, 2013.","We should add here that as we mentioned in our last call, we plan to renew the $250 million term note that's due November 30 of 2013. Under this plan, we will extend this debt for 10 years at a 2.99% fixed interest rate, thus replacing the 4.67% fixed interest rate on the current note with more favorable terms. We expect the renewal to become effective on November 30 of 2013.","As we stated earlier, we continue to generate solid cash flows and expect another very strong year in 2013. For the 9 months through September, our cash from operations was approximately $837 million, and for the full year, we currently project cash from operations to approximate $900 million. Likewise, we expect free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $450 million to $500 million range. The continued strength of our cash flows is encouraging and we remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority for the cash is the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948, and have now raised for 57 consecutive years. This is a record that continues to distinguish Genuine Parts from other companies. Our annual dividend of $2.15 per share for 2013 represents a 9% increase from the $1.98 per share paid in 2012, and it's approximately 52% of our 2012 earnings per share, which is well within our goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward.","Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases.","Our investment in capital expenditures was $33.3 million for the third quarter, up from $20.3 million in 2012. For the 9 months, our capital spending totaled $84.1 million, an increase of -- an increase from the $71.6 million for the 9 months in 2012. We expect our capital expenditures for the full year to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million, and that's an increase from the $102 million in the prior year due to the addition of GPC Asia Pacific, as well as some anticipated expenditures for our North American businesses. The vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology.","Our depreciation and amortization was $35.2 million in the quarter, which is up from the $25.6 million for the third quarter in 2012. For the year, depreciation and amortization is $98.1 million compared to the $73.3 million for the same period in 2012. The increase on this line reflects the impact of GPC Asia Pacific, as well as the amortization expense related to Asia Pacific and Quaker City. We currently expect depreciation and amortization for the full year to be $130 million to $140 million.","Strategic acquisitions continued to be an ongoing and important use of our cash for us and they're integral to the growth plans for our company. We remain excited about the growth opportunities we see at GPC Asia Pacific, and we continue to seek new acquisitions across our businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. In fact, our current pipeline of potential acquisitions is building somewhat today, and we would expect to have more to report in this area over the next several periods.","Generally, our primary targets are those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally, we have been active in the company's share repurchase program since 1994. And thus far, in 2013, we've repurchased approximately 900,000 shares and we have another 11.3 million shares authorized and available for repurchase today. We have no set pattern for these purchases, but we would expect to be active in the program in the quarters ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment, and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.","So that is our financial update. And in closing, we want to thank all of our GPC associates, including our friends in Australia and New Zealand for all that they do everyday for Genuine Parts Company. In these challenging times, our team works even harder to execute on our growth strategy, our working capital and our cost-saving initiatives to help position the company for growth. We look forward to updating you on our future progress when we report again.","I'll now turn it back over to Tom.","Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Carol and Paul. So that recaps our third quarter results. And as we said at the outset, it proved to be a challenging quarter for us in many ways, especially so for our nonautomotive operations.","As Paul mentioned in his remarks, Automotive came through the quarter in pretty good shape with overall sales growth of 22%, or NAPA growth without acquisitions of 5.3%, and this was led by solid same-store sales growth of 4.3%, high single-digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare business and low double-digit growth in our major account business. And our expectation is for another solid quarter from Automotive in Q4.","And as Carol covered, we continue to make progress in the areas of cash generation and working capital efficiency with further improvements anticipated in the months ahead. Where we really came up short both on the revenue and operating side was in our nonautomotive businesses.","As we look ahead to the full year, we find that our revenue outlook today is quite different from our thinking back in July when we last updated our guidance. Today, we see our total sales picture down approximately $250 million to $300 million from our July guidance, with the majority of this decrease coming from our nonautomotive businesses. In the July timeframe, we remain hopeful for an economic recovery over the second half of the year, and this simply has not happened in the nonautomotive segments. At least from our perspective, the industrial recovery has been pushed out into 2014.","So at this time, we're not expecting any help from the economy in the fourth quarter and we currently estimate a total GPC sales increase of 7% for the full year, which is down from our previous guidance of 9% to 10%. As mentioned, the lower revenue guidance primarily relates to the more difficult sales environment in our nonautomotive segments. Our current expectation is for sales in our Automotive segment to increase by approximately 18% to 19% for the full year, including the sales contribution from GPC Asia Pacific. Without this acquisition volume, we expect our Automotive sales to increase in the 5% range for all of 2013, consistent with where we find ourselves now.","Turning to the other businesses, we currently project Industrial sales for the full year to be down 1% to down 2%, which is a reduction from our prior guidance of up 1% to up 3%. Our current expectation is for the Electrical\/Electronic segment to be down 2% to 3% for the full year, which is lowered from our previous guidance of flat to up 2%, and Office Products is currently projected to be down 2% to 3% for the year, lowered from our prior guidance of down 1% to up 1%. This lower sales projection, combined with our third quarter results, have impacted our earnings estimates for 2013 as well by approximately $0.20 the $0.25. As a result, we currently expect our EPS for the full year to be in the $4.30 to $4.35 range, which is down from our previous full year guidance of $4.50 to $4.60.","So that will summarize our outlook at this point. And certainly, we're disappointed in the continued sluggishness in our nonautomotive segments. We are encouraged by the continued solid performance in Automotive, however, and we think that we are starting to see a few encouraging signs in Industrial and Electrical. And the underlying fundamentals in each of these businesses remains generally favorable.","So although we find ourselves in a soft period right now in these businesses, we have been through times like these in the past and our folks know what needs to be done and we look forward to giving you an update on our progress in the next call.","At this point, we'd like to open the call up to your questions and we'll turn the call back over to Jennifer. Jennifer?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Lovallo of Bank of America.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question, Carol, would be on just how we should think about normalized incremental operating margins going forward. I mean, I understand what's kind of -- with the pressure on SG&A right now with the non-auto, but I'm just wondering, has the model changed given the consolidation of the auto APAC business?","Carol B. Yancey","No. On our automotive margins, our margins, the core business in GPC Asia Pacific really has similar margins. So the Asia Pacific margins are not dragging us down the automotive sector. I think, what we mentioned is we had some gross margin pressures in the North American operations, and really, just the lack of pricing and some other gross margin pressures. Our long-term outlook for margins is still to have 10 to 20 basis point improvement in each of our businesses with margins. Now where we struggle with that is if we don't have some strong top line growth. And so if you look at our year-to-date automotive margins, they're still up 10 basis points and that's where we were through to 6 months. So we really hope that we can hold there through the end of the year and look towards in the future having more improvement than that.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And Tom, how are you guys thinking about the Advance Auto Parts recent acquisition of General Parts? I mean, how is that going to affect the competitive landscape in your view?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, I think, we'd start by saying this is very recent news. It's only a few days old. But as we think about it, in the past, we've had 2 really good competitors in Advance and in CARQUEST. And I think, we would compliment both management teams on arriving at this point. But as we go forward, in those markets where we competed both against an Advance store and a CARQUEST store, it appears that we will be competing against 1 competitor and not 2, albeit 1 larger and 1 strong competitor. So it's very early in the days in terms of how we think it's going to affect things. But one thing that does appear evident is that we're going to have 4 players at the very top of the pyramid that are going to be significantly larger than those players position 5 and on down. And I don't know how that plays out over time, but it could lead to some additional consolidation as we go forward. And hopefully, we'll be able to participate in that as we see the opportunities arise.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The first question I'd like to ask relates to the government shutdown more broadly. Obviously, you saw your business trail off in a number of sectors late in September, and there were some extraordinary circumstances presumably associated with that. And at least, for the moment, those drivers came to some resolution a day or 2 ago. To what degree, as you think about -- and it was interesting that you did not call out government-linked businesses as essential drivers of the slowdown, there are other industries that seem to be behind it, to what degree do you think this was a factor as you spoke to your customers and it's probably way too early to say have you seen any kind of thaw but how would you expect that to play out going forward?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Matt, we'll try to take the first part of it. And it did in fact impact some of the demand in the quarter. I think, we saw some of that where we -- in our Electrical business, for instance, where we deal with defense contractors and they continue to have some issues in terms of builds. Certainly, we saw it in the Office Products business indirectly where we sell to customers who sell into the governmental agencies. So we saw that demand drop off somewhat. As far as what happens now that we have at least a temporary resolution, it is too early to tell and we'll just have to wait and see how it develops over the next couple of weeks.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. Secondly, within Automotive, your commercial sales numbers were quite strong. And presumably, they would imply some market share gains. So I guess I'd appreciate Paul's perspective on what you think your market share trends were in each of the commercial and DIY pieces of automotive?","Paul D. Donahue","Well, Matt, specifically on the commercial side, you're referencing both our major account business and our NAPA AutoCare business and we did have really good quarters with both businesses. I don't think their businesses overall are growing quite at the rates that we are, so you'd have to -- one would have to assume we're taking a bit of share. We also picked up a new customer, a new major account, some new major account business in the quarter that we hadn't enjoyed before, that will add about 600 stores for us on a go-forward basis. So we're very pleased with that win. On the DIY side, Matt, we were going along pretty good in June -- I'm sorry, in July and August, and really saw a slowdown in September. And back to your question about the impact of the government shutdown, so it's difficult to say directly that, that had an impact. But you got to believe consumers clammed up in those last couple of weeks in September because the falloff in the last week was fairly significant.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Was there any regionality to the slowdown that you saw in September? I know that this industry has gone through moments of regional volatility in 2012. Any signs of that here in this most recent episode?","Paul D. Donahue","No, not really, Matt. As I think I mentioned in my comments, we're -- this year, unlike last year, we're seeing growth across every division of the country. And I think I pointed out the northeastern part of the U.S., we're seeing stronger growth. But across the U.S., we're seeing single-digit increases across every division.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The last question I have, you mentioned M&A, and it sounded like bolt-ons more than anything else. Of course, with the Advance-CARQUEST deal, one wonders if you're kind of inspired to look at bigger deals, I don't know if there's much left in automotive of size. But are you thinking now about perhaps a larger-sized transaction than you would have done in the U.S.? Or are we still talking primarily smaller deals?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Oh, I think that we'd have to wait to see what opportunities present themselves. But we're very much open to strategic acquisitions that benefit the GPC shareholders, regardless of size. We'll look at any opportunity that may come forward. Matt, one other point I'd want to make, Paul mentioned the major account win that we had. And just to be clear, that really had minimal impact in the quarter. That's something that we think will help us to have some incremental growth in Q4 and then on through next year. It's still very early in its evolution.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I want to follow-up on the Auto margins, especially how they seem to inflect downward this quarter. Is the $3 million hit, was that -- I guess it's about 15 bps, so that really the margins may have been flattish in pricing. Is there an inability to pass through some price increases? Or is it that competition has actually taken price down to hit margin?","Carol B. Yancey","Well, let me just clarify this, the $3 million inventory adjustment is in the other net line, consistent with how we did at second quarter. So the purchase accounting adjustments have been pulled out of the Automotive margins that you see. So that's not in the 8.9%. And my reference really wasn't an inability to pass along price increases. There's just no pricing in the environment, it's just some downward pressure on gross margin. But again, we're kind of pointing back to the 9-month numbers and saying we're still in pretty good shape year-to-date. So it's not anything specific, it's just a little bit of gross margin pressures. And it's North America, it's a bit Canada, as well as the U.S.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Could the -- with DIY having sort of weakened sequentially or do-it-for-me side holding up, would mix have been a reasonable part of that?","Carol B. Yancey","Absolutely. Yes, absolutely.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, second, on the Industrial business. Tom, one thing we've noticed, it seems like a lot of the traditional metrics that lead your Industrial business, like industrial production, have actually been better than the results they've actually been. Do you think there's something going on? There's seems to at least be a disconnect. Do you see that? Or do you think there's something wrong with the traditional metrics that just don't matter as much anymore for some reason?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Greg, I'm going to try to answer it in a couple of different ways. First of all, if we look at our Industrial business, we've got segments that are performing fine and reacting, as you would expect them historically, to some of the leading indicators. So I called out automotive, food processing, lumber and wood products as 3 examples. But then, we have other segments that are not reacting as they might have historically. And there are more specific issues, whether it be in oil and gas or mining and resource. They are being impacted both by the slowdown in the U.S., as well as the global markets. So any of those companies that might have been producing for export, their export business is under pressure because of what's happening globally. So that would be one thing. The other thing is in looking at the indices, at least 3 of the ones that we follow, there seems to be some inconsistency there as well. If you look at the ISM Purchasing Managers Index, it is fairly strong right now and certainly, nicely up on where it was this time last year. If you look at industrial production and capacity utilization, you see a slightly different story, in that if we compare industrial production for Q2 to industrial production Q2 last year, it's up 1%, much less than what the PMI is up quarter-over-quarter. And if we look at capacity utilization, Q2 this year to Q2 last year, well, it's still at a historically reasonable level in Q2 of this year. It's actually down about 1% of where it was this time last year. So we see a lot of inconsistency within the numbers. We haven't yet concluded that there's any structural change. We think that, over time, all of this will start to even out a bit. We think that the fundamentals in the business are still favorable as we go forward. And we're optimistic that as we cycle through some of this that we'll get to more historical-type performance in these businesses. And maybe just to add a little color to what I mentioned earlier, if we look at the impact of what happened to us in those specific original equipment manufacturing sectors that I've called out, that cost us 3% in year-to-date revenue growth. That's how impactful it was. And the good news is that we've now anniversaried that and while we don't see those segments snapping back quickly, we certainly don't see the same headwind that we faced over the past 4 quarters. And if we go over to the Electrical business, if we look at what's happened there largely because of some slowdown in the defense contractor segment, that's cost us about 2% on a year-to-date basis. And again, we don't expect that to come back significantly in the near-term, but at the same time, we don't expect it to erode the way that it had thus far this year. So those 2 things in particular have impacted those 2 businesses, if that helps with any color.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That helps a lot, Tom. And if I could lastly, just on Office, the fact that the sales are falling but the margins are pulling pretty steady, just down a little bit. What's the real strategy there, especially with consolidation also appearing to take hold in the Office Products space?","Thomas C. Gallagher","It's largely helping our customers grow their business. And if we can help them enhance their share of wallet or their market share through different initiatives, then that in turn will benefit us. And then, we need to continue down the path of some diversification both on the product side, as well as on the customer portfolio side. We're working pretty diligently in both of those areas. And we've made some progress in each case, but we still have a bit more to do in both areas. But that's the strategy right now. And right now, this is the business that's most challenged and we don't think that there are as many early signs of encouragement for this business yet. But at some point, it will revert closer to the norm, even with the structural change from a product standpoint with pick the best product in secular decline. Eventually, this business is going to come back. And in the meantime, it generates a lot of cash, gives us a good operating margin, and it gives us time to continue to rebalance the business a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Gober with Morgan Stanley.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to touch back on the Advance GPI acquisition. And more specifically, on the independent stores at CARQUEST. I was wondering how you think about that basis stores and that base of owners? Are they're going through what's obviously going to be a big change, would you be interested in expanding the store count by trying to attract some of those independents? And I don't know if you've done any work in terms of store over the last or anything, but is that a base that might be attractive?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, as a general statement, David, part of our growth strategy is to increase the store count year-over-year 1% to 2% at a minimum, and we'll hit the low end of that this year, which we're proud of. If we have an opportunity to do it more rapidly because of whatever circumstance, certainly, we're interested in doing that. The one thing I would say is that it appears right now that NAPA may be the only national organization that still has a strong commitment to the independent ownership, and we'll continue to do everything we can to build on that base and to support the independent owner base as we go forward. So -- and I'd also say, we've done enough acquisitions over time to have learned that in any acquisition, certainly, there are some operating synergies that can be affected. But at least in our case, there've been very few, if any acquisitions, where we're able to retain all of the revenue. We've seen a number of reasons why, at least a portion of your revenue may be prone to a little bit of slippage. And if that happens in this particular case, then we hope we're in a position to perhaps pick up a little of that. But it's way too early for us to say categorically we know how it's going to work out. But we'll continue to follow it with a great deal of interest and hopefully, there's some positive in it for us as well.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's helpful. And I just wanted to go back to the inflation issue again. It sounds like that has clearly decelerated this year. And I think, last quarter, you mentioned that what you're saying is broadly speaking, competition was kind of keeping a lid on inflation. Is that still the case? Or is there anything else that's going on in terms of the inflation dynamics?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No. I think, that's generally the case. But I would also say that we don't see any evidence of predatory pricing or price wars going on. We've been through periods like that at times in the past. But that's not a situation today. Input costs have gone down for vendors in more recent times and that also has mitigated their need for some price increases.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I know maybe it's difficult to answer because it's hard to know what competitors might do. But Tom, you just talked about you really haven't seen anything on the irrational front in terms of pricing, et cetera. Do you think Advance buying CARQUEST Worldpac changes that dynamic at all going forward?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I don't have any reason to think that today. We'll have to wait and see. The nice thing about the larger competitors is that we're all publicly traded, and we've all got the need to report our numbers. And I think that leads to some rationalism or at least a degree of rationalism among each of these companies. So I don't know that we'll see that. And if we do, we'll just have to respond accordingly. We're not going to donate share after working so hard to gain share. So we'll continue to work our strategies and our initiatives for sell side and buy side.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Understood. And then, can I just clarify, I mean, you've talked about some of the things that should ease in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the government shutdown, hopefully, at least a temporary reprieve there. Also the 3% that you referenced in terms of now anniversary-ing some of the clients that we've seen previously. We also talked about trends decelerating through the third quarter on the non-auto side. So I'm just wondering, is there something else that you feel a little bit better about the fourth quarter? Or is it really just those 2 factors?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, those 2 factors for sure. And then, I mentioned that we had a small acquisition that we're going to do at month end for the Electrical Group. We have 1 or 2 others that we hope to add into the Industrial\/Electrical segments between now and yearend, which I think will help a little bit and set us up for a little improvement as we go into next year. And then, don't forget, our comps get easier in Q4. We had some difficult comps last year. So the comps in and of themselves are a little bit easier as we work our way toward yearend.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. So no real change in pace of business but easier comparisons through a couple of acquisitions in there, as well as the other things.","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think, that's right, Scot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A couple of quick questions, and one of them, I guess, the North America pricing looks pretty stagnant. How is actually pricing looking? Could you maybe give us a little bit more color on how we look on the Australian business and maybe all over the year ago of sort of what the growth trend have looked like down there?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we don't break out the segment data for those businesses. I will tell you, I will comment this way, as you probably know, the economy in Australia and New Zealand is pretty sluggish because of what's happened in the mining and resource sector down there and that has had a ripple effect through the economy. So it's slowed down a good bit. With that said, however, our team continues to do a very good job in executing their strategies. And their results would be outpacing the industry results down there and their results would be comparable to what we're doing here in terms of organic growth. So we're very pleased with what we see. And frankly, we're a bit optimistic as they continue to roll out some of the strategies down here. From a pricing standpoint, pretty much the same picture is what we see here.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then, a question on AP inventory, you've gotten that up pretty nicely. How much runway is left? And is the Automotive portion of your inventory pretty well levered on the payables model and you need to bring the industrial folks into the fold? Or is there room to move aggregate AP inventory much higher?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think, the latter comment is where we find it. There is room to move the aggregate higher. We were pleased with the progress that we've made through the 9 months. We see more progress that will be made over the upcoming 3 months. And we continue to work this as an important part of our overall strategy.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then, sorry for that, one, a regional performance question. I think, you used the word exceptional to describe the East. Is that -- does the feeling like there's pent up demand that's coming back to the market, or is it just such an easy comparison off of a top 2012 we're seeing this growth. Is it -- I guess, if you look over a cycle, does it feel like you're growing better than you would be just with the easy comparison that you saw?","Paul D. Donahue","I think, it's a little bit of both, Bret. But I would also tell you that our team has done a good job of capturing some new business up in that market as well. So it's a little bit of both, plus some new bids.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Great. And one housekeeping, your full year guidance does or does not include the second quarter $0.22 benefit?","Carol B. Yancey","It includes it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered but I have a couple of others. If you wouldn't mind parsing out the margins on the Auto business a little bit further. If I understand it correctly, gross margin was down slightly and SG&A margin was down slightly. As you look forward, do you expect that trend to persist if you maintain the same level of sales growth?","Carol B. Yancey","Seth, one is we don't specifically call out gross margins or SG&A by each of our segments. But in our commentary and what we did mention, on the Automotive side, their operating margin decrease was solely attributed to the gross margin impact. Their SG&A was actually slightly improved. So they're doing a very good job on the cost side. So again, if we can work through these gross margin pressures and we're working very hard on that and we looked to the year-to-date number again being up 10 basis points, again, we're doing a pretty good job in the SG&A area. So that wasn't an issue there. Our long-term margin outlook for all of our businesses is 8%, 8.5%. So we're really pleased to see Automotive where they are right now.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And on the DIY side, in the Auto segment, with the slowdown at the end of the quarter and now the government shutdown over, would you expect a rebound? Is there any pent-up demand that will come back? Or are those sales lost for good?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think those sales are probably gone. If you look at the history of the DIY business across the industry, it's been under pressure for a number of quarters. And I think that's partly attributable to the fact that do-it-for-me is going to grow at a faster rate for quite some time than the do-it-yourself will be. But Paul mentioned, we were a little bit encouraged actually by what we saw in July and August, and felt that maybe we were going to have a bit better quarter than the way it turned out. But we did, in fact, see a dropoff in September, and most of that dropoff happened late in the month. But if there's any encouraging information in there, it's that the basket size was actually up a little bit. But it was the ticket count that was off for the traffic in the stores. We'll have to see if it reverts back to the more normal pattern. We did see improved ticket count in July and August, but we gave it all back in September.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. And can you give any more color on the initiatives you're undertaking within the Auto segments to grow the commercial business beyond major accounts and NAPA AutoCare?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, they would be the 2 and we would not want to go any further than that on the call.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Last question on the Industrial side. Looking at the trends you're seeing, the OEM manufacturer customer base. Are those trends sort of stabilizing at low level, so that we'll see no impact on a year-over-year basis going forward? Or do you expect incremental headwinds on a year-over-year basis going forward?","Thomas C. Gallagher","They have -- they do appear to be stabilizing, albeit at a lower level. Whether or not we see some growth off of the current levels over the next quarter or 2, I don't have a feel for. But just because of the magnitude of the dropoff that we've experienced, we don't see that being the headwind that it has been for the last 4 quarters.","Operator","Our final question comes from Brent Rakers with Wunderlich Securities.","Brent D. Rakers - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Tom, I was hoping to follow-up on the comments you made within Industrial about the difference in OEM and MRO performance being about 300 basis points this quarter. Could you maybe take us back to the last 2 or 3 quarters as well and maybe talk to what the disconnect in performance was in these previous quarters as well?","Thomas C. Gallagher","It's actually 3% on a year-to-date basis, not one quarter specific. That's what the impact has been over the 9 months.","Brent D. Rakers - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Tom, I am reading that correctly. That is not specific to the specific verticals but it actually relates to the entirety of your OEM portion of that business?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No. It relates to the decreases we've seen with customers in the oil and gas and mining and resource sectors.","Brent D. Rakers - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay. And then, just one last point of clarification. I think, in maybe your opening comments or maybe in response to one of the other questions, you talked about encouraging signs in Industrial and Electrical. Is there anything beyond, I think, the earlier question was asked about an acquisition that's on the Electrical side and then the comps, are there other signs that are encouraging to you besides those?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, I'll give you one other data point and we track what we call our project work in the Industrial business. And we were encouraged in that the amount of project work that we've got has held steady from Q2 to Q3, which we think is a little bit of a positive. Part of the offset to that, though, is while we haven't seen any decline in the pending project work, we have seen some of these projects be pushed out. Our expectation is that they will start to flow through, some in Q4, some in Q1. But until we actually get the order and get the release, we can't be absolutely certain. But we are somewhat encouraged by the fact that we didn't see any dropoff. And these are projects that are going to be used to expand capacity within plants or improved productivity within plants. So there's somewhat of an indicator, we think, of the plants' willingness to make some capital expenditures and to continue to invest back into their businesses for future growth.","Carol B. Yancey","Well, we thank you for joining us on our call today and we look forward to talking to you at our fourth quarter and yearend results. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Sidney G. Jones","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts second quarter conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We'll begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Sid, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate your taking the time to be with us this morning.","Paul Donahue, our President, along with Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and I will each handle a portion of today's call, and once we've concluded our individual remarks, we will look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.","Now earlier this morning, we released our second quarter 2013 results, and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3,676,000,000, which was up 10% over the prior year. Net income was $216.4 million, which was up 28%, and earnings per share were $1.39 this year compared to $1.08 last year and the EPS increase was up 29%.","Now I do want to point out that these results include the contributions from our Australia and New Zealand acquisition that was completed on April 1. You will recall that as of April 1, we purchased the remaining 70% of the shares that we did not own, and both Carol and Paul will give you a bit more detail on how this impacted the numbers during their comments. But I would just say that we are really pleased to have this team as part of the GPC family and they will be strong contributors to our results in the quarters ahead.","A review of the results by business segment shows quite a contrast between our automotive and nonautomotive operations. Automotive revenues were up 22% in the quarter, including the contributions from the Australia and New Zealand acquisition, and they were up 6% without this contribution, and if we back out the 1 month of incremental volume we had with Quaker City, our ongoing operations were up 4%, and this shows good sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2.","The nonautomotive operations were down just over 1% in the quarter, with all 3 of the business segments experiencing modest decreases. The Industrial segment, which is our largest nonautomotive business, was down 0.6% in the second quarter. This is a slight improvement from the 2% decrease reported in the first quarter, but down all the same.","Our biggest challenges in the quarter were with customers in the original equipment manufacturing segment. Many of these customers have a fair amount of their sales volume tied to the export market and they're being adversely impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and by the overall slowdown in the global economy.","Conversely, customers in the automotive, lumber and wood products segments are examples of segments that are showing solid growth for us, and we think it's indicative of the stronger new car sales that we're seeing in the U.S., as well as the recovery that we're seeing in the housing segment in the economy.","And in going a bit deeper into the numbers, it's interesting to note that customers in our top 10 industry segments, exclusive of the original equipment manufacturing, were actually up mid single-digits with us in the second quarter and they're running low single-digit increases year-to-date, all of which probably ties with a gradual but uneven overall economic recovery that we're all reading about.","Fortunately, the most recent industrial production and capacity utilization indices both remain at historically healthy levels, which should turn out to be a positive for us in the quarters ahead. However, at this point, our sense is that customer demand patterns will remain a bit uneven and choppy over the remainder of the year. Or stated another way, although we do expect modest sales improvement in the second half, we feel that the end market demand will be somewhat sluggish and a bit unpredictable for a few quarters yet.","Moving on to the Electrical\/Electronic segment, sales for this group were down 4%, and many of the same comments made about our industrial business are applicable to the Electrical\/Electronic business as well. Sales to the original equipment manufacturers are showing the steepest declines year-over-year, and then specific to the Electrical segment, sales to defense contractors have been negatively affected by the impact of sequestration.","As with Motion Industries, we do anticipate some sales improvement over the second half of the year, but our sense is that it will be modest until we see further improvement in the overall economy.","We'll wrap up a review of the nonautomotive operations with a few comments about Office Products, which ended the quarter down 3%. After a 3% increase in the fourth quarter of last year and a relatively flat first quarter of this year, we're actually expecting a little stronger performance from this segment in Q2. Our business with the Mega Channel actually improved in the second quarter, ending up mid single-digits, but then our business with the independent Office Products resellers was down mid single-digits. From a product category perspective, we continue to see positive results in furniture as well as in cleaning and breakroom supplies, but these are being offset by decreases in technology products and core office supplies.","These latter 2, technology products and office supplies, are our 2 largest product categories, and they both softened a bit further in Q2 from Q1. Overall demand in the Office Products industry is being affected by the movement to tablet-style devices as well as the ongoing digitization of the office environment. Additionally, demand is currently being impacted by sequestration and a general reduction in governmental budgets at the local, state and federal levels and the expectation is that all of these will remain headwinds for the Office Products industry until we see stronger economic recovery.","In the meantime, our Office Products team remains focused on the key growth initiatives aimed at driving incremental revenue and market share gains.","So that's a quick overview of the nonautomotive businesses. And at this point, we'll ask Paul to cover the automotive operations. Paul?","Paul D. Donahue","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we are including in our automotive recap the results from our newly acquired business in Australasia, formerly known as Exego, and now known as GPC Asia Pacific.","Our 434 stores now operating in Australia and New Zealand were consolidated into our results on April 1, and this business performed as expected throughout the second quarter. We have an outstanding management team on the ground and we are pleased with the progress we see in their growth strategy. Our expectation is continued growth in this business over the balance of 2013.","Turning to our North American automotive business. Our team delivered a 6% sales increase in the second quarter. This 6% growth includes approximately a 2% benefit from 1 month of Quaker City Motor Parts revenues. As many of you will recall, we acquired this business back on May 1 of 2012. Our total automotive business, including the acquisition of GPC Asia Pacific, grew 22%. Our North American 6% revenue growth in the second quarter includes comp store sales growth of 4.5%, which is an improvement from relatively flat sales comps posted in the first quarter. These favorable results were driven by our commercial business. However, our team also made solid strides with our retail business in the quarter.","Within our U.S. company-owned store group, the commercial side of our business ended the quarter up 6%. This represents our strongest performance since Q1 of 2012.","Diving deeper into the results, our non fleet-related business turned in a strong quarter, generating an 8% increase. This segment was supported by high single-digit growth from our approximately 15,000 NAPA AutoCare centers, which we're proud to announce is at an all-time high record number. Our major account group also grew high single-digits and was a major contributor to our overall commercial growth.","Our fleet business grew 3% and reversed the trend we had seen of declining sales in recent quarters. Our wholesale average ticket value increased low single-digit and our average number of tickets was up mid single-digits in this segment of our business. We are very encouraged by both of these sales trends.","Now let's turn to our retail business. We saw significant improvement over our recent quarterly performance. After reporting a mid single-digit sales decrease in the first quarter, we are pleased to report our team drove positive sales growth in the second quarter. Our average retail dollar invoice was up low single-digits for the quarter, while our average number of invoices was flat, which again has improved from recent quarters.","As mentioned in our last call, our team has a number of initiatives in the works to drive our retail sales efforts, and while it's still early in the process, it appears our team is on the right track.","From a product category standpoint, we continue to see strong sales in our Electrical category, primarily driven by our battery business. We'd like to take this opportunity to give a quick plug for our Get Back, Give Back battery promo, currently running in the month of July in support of the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund. Our corporate-wide goal is to raise money and awareness in support of our returning military veterans.","So in addition to our strong battery business, we are seeing solid growth from our heavy-duty product category as well as our tool and equipment offering. An additional positive product trend is our improved sales in our all-important brake business. This is significant as we experienced slowing in this critical category in 2012, and only began to see a modest recovery in the first quarter of 2013. It would appear that our team's efforts to get this business back on track have taken hold.","Now a few comments regarding the overall state of the automotive aftermarket. We continue to believe the fundamentals of the aftermarket remain positive. This theory was tested during the prior 4 quarters, but as expected, the overall stable vehicle population, combined with the growing number of older vehicles, bodes well for ongoing and increased demand in the aftermarket. Our automotive business is well-positioned to capture our fair share of this increased demand.","So in summary, both our North American and our Australian and New Zealand automotive operations turned in solid results in the second quarter, and more importantly, provide us ample growth opportunity through the remainder of 2013.","We remain positive about the core fundamentals of our industry and our management team remains focused on driving positive growth for the balance of the year. We are encouraged by the renewed strength in our commercial segment and the growth we experienced in our retail business this past quarter.","We'd like to personally thank all of our NAPA associates throughout North America for their strong efforts in the second quarter, and we'd like to give a special welcome to our new associates in Australia and New Zealand.","So that completes our overview of the automotive business in the second quarter. And at this time, I'll hand it over to Carol to get us started with our review of the financial results. Carol?","Carol B. Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We'll get started with a review of our second quarter and 6 months income statement and the segment information, and we'll also review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up and then we'll open the call up to your questions.","To start off with, please note that any reference to our June 30 second quarter and year-to-date consolidated results include GPC Asia Pacific, which we acquired on April 1 of this year. In association with the acquisition of the remaining 70% in GPC Asia Pacific, we are required to revalue our original 30% investment. This remeasurement, net of certain onetime purchase accounting cost, amounted to a positive pretax adjustment of approximately $36 million reported -- recorded in the second quarter. In accounting for this adjustment, approximately $18 million in costs were reported to cost of goods sold and a $54 million gain, net of expenses, was recorded to selling, administrative and other expenses on our income statement. Additionally, the $36 million net adjustment is included in the Other net line on our segment information sheet. The $36 million net adjustment, combined with the lower tax rate for the remeasurement, favorably impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.22.","Now turning to our income statement, total sales were a record high of $3.7 billion for the second quarter, an increase of 10% from last year, as Tom mentioned. For the 6 months, total sales of $6.9 billion were up 5% from 2012. And overall, we remain optimistic in our outlook for future sales growth.","Our gross profit for the second quarter was 30.1% of sales, up from the 29.1% of sales last year. And for the 6 months, gross margin of 29.5% is up from the 29.0% for the same period last year. Our improvement in gross margin is primarily due to the favorable impact of higher gross margins in our Australasian business, which owns 100% of its stores. Additionally, our core gross margin was up slightly from the second quarter last year, which we were very pleased to see. These increases were partially offset by the $18 million onetime purchase accounting adjustment, as we referenced earlier, which relates to the Australasian inventory valuation.","Gross margin for the second quarter would have been 30.6% before the impact of these onetime costs. And looking ahead, we would currently expect our gross margin to trend toward the 30% range. As an additional point of interest, we continue to see very little inflation in our businesses. Our year-to-date 2013 cumulative pricing is down 0.3% in Automotive, up 0.6% in Industrial, up 0.5% in Office, and up 1% for Electrical.","Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses were $790 million in the second quarter, which is up 12% from 2012, and at 21.5% of sales. For the 6 months, our total SG&A expenses were $1.5 billion, up 7%, and at 21.7% of sales. Our SG&A expenses as a percent of sales are up 40 and 30 basis points for the quarter and 6 months, respectively. These increases reflect the impact of higher SG&A expenses at GPC Asia Pacific, again due to their 100% owned store model, as well as a decrease in leverage associated with our nonautomotive businesses. These increases were partially offset by the onetime net gain recorded to SG&A, as we previously discussed. Excluding this positive adjustment, SG&A as a percentage of sales was 23.0% for the second quarter, and 22.5% for the 6 months. We will continue to work to control our costs through several measures, including ongoing investments in technology, which have positively impacted our operating efficiencies in our distribution centers and stores, as well as supply chain initiatives in areas such as freight and logistics.","Now let's discuss the segment results. Our Automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.01 billion and represents 54% of total sales and is up 22.3%. Our operating profit of $186.4 million is up 21.8%, and their margin is even with last year at 9.3%. For the 6 months, our Automotive sales of $3.56 billion, which represents 52% of the total, is up 13%. Our operating profit of $307.4 million is up 15%, so the margin is up 10 basis points to 8.6% from the 8.5%, which we're very pleased to report.","Our Industrial Group had sales of $1.13 billion in the quarter. This represents 31% of our revenue and a decrease of 0.6%. Our operating profit of $88.9 million is down 6.5%, so we saw the industrial margin decrease from 7.9% -- or down to 7.9% from 8.3%.","Through June, our Industrial sales of $2.23 billion were down 1%, and our operating profit of $167.8 million was down 6.5%, so their margin was down 40 basis points to 7.5% from 7.9%, primarily due to the sales decrease.","Our Office Products have revenues of $402.3 million, which is 11% of our total sales, down 2.7% for the quarter. Our operating profit of $29.8 million is also down 3%, so their margin held steady at 7.4%, which is very good operating. Year-to-date, Office sales of $822.4 million, representing 12% of our revenues, are down 2%, and their operating profit of $63 million, which is down 7.6%, with margins going to 7.7% versus 8.1% last year, which is down 40 basis points, again to due to the sales decline.","The Electrical Group had sales in the quarter of $143 million, and that's 4% of the total revenue and down 4.3%. Their operating profit of $12.2 million was down 5.5%, so their margin came down slightly to 8.5%. For the year, Electrical sales were $282 million, representing 4% of our revenue, and down 5%. Their operating profit of $22.7 million is down 9%, and again, their margin is down 40 basis points to 8.0% from the 8.4%, due to the sales decline.","So our total operating profit was up approximately 9% in the second quarter and our operating margin decreased slightly to 8.6%. This follows a similar decrease in the first quarter, and for the 6 months, our total operating margin of 8.2% is down from the 8.3% for the same period in the prior year.","The slight decline in our operating margins thus far in 2013 continues to reflect the impact of our weak sales conditions in our nonautomotive businesses. The operating margins at GPC Asia Pacific were in line with our core automotive business as expected. We remain committed to expanding our operating margin over the balance of the year through our ongoing initiatives.","We had net interest expense of $7.9 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date, our interest expense was $11.2 million. Our interest for the quarter was up from 2012, due to the increase in our total debt. Based on our current projections, we expect net interest expense of approximately $26 million to $28 million for 2013. This has slightly improved from our prior guidance of $30 million for the year.","Our total amortization expense was approximately $9 million for the second quarter and is $12.8 million for the 6 months. This is up from last year due to the Quaker acquisition last May, and April's acquisition of GPC Asia Pacific. We expect our amortization to trend in line with the second quarter amount over the balance of the year.","The other line, which reflects corporate expense, was $14.3 million in income for the second quarter and is essentially flat for the 6 months. As we discussed earlier, this line reflects the net favorable purchase accounting adjustment of $36 million. Including this line item, we would project our corporate expense to be in the $25 million to $35 million expense range for the full year.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 31.3%, which has improved from the 36.9% last year. For the 6 months, our 32.8% rate compares to the 36.5% for the same period the prior year. The improved rate for the quarter and the year primarily reflects the favorable tax rate on our gain generated by the remeasurement of our 30% investment in GPC Asia Pacific.","In addition, our current tax rate reflects the favorable impact of the lower Australian and New Zealand tax rates applied to their earnings. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect our tax rate to approximate 36%, which would give us an annual rate of 34.5% to 35% for 2013.","Our net income for the quarter was $216.4 million or up 28%, and our EPS of $1.39 compared to $1.08 was up 29%. For the year through June, our net income of $360.7 million is up 15%, and our EPS of $2.31 compared to $2.01 is also up 15%. Without the one-time adjustments recorded in the second quarter, our EPS of $1.17 was up 8% and a new record for us. And for the year, the EPS is $2.09 without the adjustment, or up 4%.","Now let's discuss some of the balance sheet items starting with cash. Cash at June 30 was $197 million, which is up slightly from last June, although down from year end and also down from first quarter. This is due to the April 1 payment for GPC Asia Pacific. We will continue to generate strong cash flows, and as a result of the increase in our earnings, effective working capital and asset management and cost containment measures. Our accounts receivable of $1.8 billion at June 30 increased 10% from the same period in 2012 on a 10% sales increase for the quarter.","Excluding the receivables at GPC Asia Pacific, our accounts receivables were up 4%. Our goal is to grow receivables at a rate less than the revenue growth, so we have a little work to do in this area, but we remain focused on meeting this goal in the periods ahead. We're very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.","Our inventory at quarter end was $2.8 billion, which is up 11% from June 30 last year and primarily due to the GPC Asia Pacific inventory added at the beginning of the quarter. Excluding the impact of Australasia, our inventory is up just 1% from last year. So our team is doing a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move to the balance of 2013.","Our accounts payable balance at June 30 was $2.1 billion, up 29% from June 30 of last year. Excluding the impact of GPC Asia Pacific, our payables were up 21%. Our ongoing growth and trade payables reflects the positive impact of our extended payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're very encouraged with our improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital and days and payables.","Our working capital of $1.8 billion at June 30 is down approximately 26% from June of 2012. This is primarily due to the increase in our current debt in 2013. Excluding our current debt, our working capital is up less than 1% from last year. Effectively managing accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company and our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in tremendous improvement in our working capital position and our cash flow.","Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at June 30, 2013. Our total debt of $900 million at June 30 of 2013 includes 2 $250 million term notes, which we've carried for some time now, as well as another $400 million borrowings that are under our multicurrency syndicated credit facility agreement and also borrowings at GPC Asia Pacific. This adds to total debt to total capitalization of approximately 23% at June 30, which is consistent with March 31, and up from the 15% at June 30 last year.","We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time and we currently expect to maintain this level of debt over the balance of the year. It's worth adding here that we do intend to renew the $250 million term note that is due November 30 of 2013. While not finalized, we expect to extend this debt for 10 years at a 2.99% fixed interest rate, thus replacing the 4.67% interest rate on the current note with more favorable terms. We expect the renewal to become effective on November 30 of 2013.","As we stated earlier, we continue to generate solid cash flows and we expect another very strong year in 2013. For the 6 months through June, our cash from operations was approximately $467 million. For the full year, we would currently project cash from operations to exceed $900 million. Likewise, we expect free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $500 million range. The continued strength of our cash flows is encouraging and we remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority for the cash is the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948, and have now raised for 57 consecutive years. This is a record that continues to distinguish Genuine Parts from other companies. Our annual dividend of $2.15 a share for 2013 represents a 9% increase from the $1.98 paid in 2012, and is approximately 52% of our 2012 earnings per share, which is well within our goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward.","Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment and capital expenditures was $37.9 million for the second quarter, up from $34.5 million in the prior year.","For the 6 months, capital spending totaled $50.8 million, which is relatively in line with the 6 months in 2012. We expect our capital expenditures for the full year to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million, which is an increase from the $102 million in the prior year due to the addition of GPC Asia Pacific as well as some anticipated expenditures in our North American businesses. The vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology.","Our depreciation and amortization was $36.9 million in the quarter, up from $24.7 million for the second quarter in 2012, due to the impact of GPC Asia Pacific. For the year, depreciation and amortization is $62.9 million compared to $47.7 million for the same period in the prior year. We currently anticipate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $135 million to $145 million for the full year.","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of our cash for us and are integral to the growth plans for our company. We remain excited about the growth opportunities we see at GPC Asia Pacific and we continue to seek new acquisitions for our businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Generally, we would expect to target those bolt-on types of strategic acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally, we have been active in the company's share repurchase program since 1994. And thus far, in 2013, we've purchased approximately 350,000 shares and we have another 11.8 million shares authorized and available for repurchase today. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we would expect to be active in the program in the quarters ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment, and combined with the dividend, provides the best returns our shareholders.","In closing, we want to thank all of our GPC associates for their hard work and dedication to their jobs and the success of Genuine Parts Company. We've seen these same tremendous effort from the team at GPC Asia Pacific and we welcome them to the family. We also want to thank them for such a great job during this transitionary period. The progress we achieved in the quarter was due to the collective efforts of the entire GPC team and it's much appreciated.","Looking ahead, the company is well-positioned to generate continued sales and earnings growth over the balance of the year. And as always, we will support our growth with strong cash flow, a healthy balance sheet and further maximizing our return to shareholders.","That concludes our financial review and I'll now turn it back over to Tom.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, thank you, Paul and Carol, for your updates. Well done in each case, as usual.","So that's a recap on our second quarter results. And as we look back over the quarter, we feel that our folks made good progress in a number of key areas. Our sales and earnings set new quarterly records with and without the impact of acquisitions. On the balance sheet, accounts receivable and inventory were managed well and accounts payable continue to trend in the right direction. Cash from operations improved nicely and working capital efficiency improved as well.","On the revenue side, it's clear that our Automotive segment is the bright spot for us right now. The Automotive operation showed good sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2, both with and without about the acquisition impact. We are pleased with the progress being made in this segment and we feel that the prior full year -- revenue guidance of plus 5% to plus 7% without acquisition volume, and plus 18% to 20% with the GPC Asia Pacific volume, remains appropriate at this time. And we think that this would represent a solid performance from our automotive team.","Our challenges right now are more concentrated in our nonautomotive operations. End market conditions in each of these segments remain challenging. And while we do expect to see second half revenues to improve somewhat compared to first half, we think that it's appropriate to trim our prior full year revenue guidance for each of these businesses.","In our prior guidance for Industrial, we said that revenues for the year would be up 4% to 6%, and currently, we think it's more appropriate to say that they're going to be up 1% to 3%.","Prior, we had guided for Electrical\/Electronic to be up 4% to 6% as well, and now we'd say even to up 2%. And prior guidance for Office Products was up 1% to up 3%, and currently, we would say it's down 1% to plus 1%.","In putting all of this together, we give GPC a full year sales increase of plus 9% to plus 10%.","On the earnings side, our prior guidance was for an EPS range of $4.45 to $4.60. And at this point, we think it appropriate to raise the bottom end of the guidance to $4.50. This would give us a new range of $4.50 to $4.60 with a bit of a bias toward the mid to lower end of the range until we see how the overall economy performs in the second half of the year. And this will give us an EPS increase of 9% to 11% for the year, and we want to remind you that we did have a pension curtailment gain in the fourth quarter of last year that was $0.09 per share. And if we back this out, the gain -- the increase for the EPS will be up 11% to up 14% without that onetime gain that last year.","So with all of that said, at this time, we'd like to take your questions. And we'll turn the call back over to Jasmine.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Gober from Morgan Stanley.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Paul, just a quick one for you on the automotive business. Just curious if you could talk at all about either the monthly cadence within the quarter. I know you'd said at the last quarter that you're starting to see some green shoots. Just curious if that scaled throughout the quarter or if it was relatively even? And then, I guess, a follow-on to that also, if you're seeing any -- what you're seeing in terms of regionality. I know, obviously, there was -- for the better part of last year, you had some significant differences across regions and just curious if you're seeing that reversers, have you seen different regions normalized in the automotive business?","Paul D. Donahue","Yes, great question, David. And let me take the first one regarding the trending throughout the quarter. The quarter actually strengthened as we moved through the quarter. So May was a bit better than April. And on a per day basis, June was a bit better than May. So we do remain encouraged by what we're seeing in automotive and we're encouraged by the trend that we're seeing. In terms of regionality, David, we did see -- if you recall, in our previous calls, we were challenged, as I think many were, in the Midwest, Eastern, central parts of the country. We have seen that area of the country. Certainly, the East and the Midwest have come back strong. The Southwest has been a good performer for us last couple of years. They continue to do well. And the rest of the country is pretty much performing as we expected.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And Tom or Carol, I guess, just on the overall EPS guidance, I just wanted to confirm that that includes the $0.22 benefit from the recast on the Exego deal? And just curious if that also was kind of contemplated in the prior guidance?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Yes, it does include that. And yes, it was contemplated in the prior guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scot Ciccarelli. Just one more clarification on the EPS. Does that include the gain as well or just kind of the run rate of Exego?","Thomas C. Gallagher","It includes the gain. And the $4.50 to $4.60 is an all-in number.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But you didn't previously anticipate the $0.22 gain when we got the original $4.45 to $4.60, correct?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, we anticipated that it would be a gain. And it might be instructive just to say that you're probably familiar with the accounting on this. And we had a higher range and a low range on the anticipated gain and it's a very complicated process, and you can't narrow it down until you get to the very last moment. And we tried to take an appropriate look at it when we gave you that prior guidance. And as it turns out, we were reasonably close with what it actually turned out to be.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then, regarding the comments about kind of gross margin SG&A run rates, I guess, is there anything that's impacting maybe that little bit of a shift that we've seen to higher gross margin and higher SG&A other than the Asia Pacific business or is that -- it really center on that?","Carol B. Yancey","Well, so we gave you the onetime amounts that are in both of those numbers. So taking those into account, what we would say that our gross margins, our core gross margins were up slightly, excluding the impact of GPC Asia Pacific and the onetime adjustments. And SG&A, because of the decline in the sales in the nonautomotive businesses, our SG&A, really, we didn't have the improvement there and that's the loss of leverage and you see that in the operating margins. So what we're saying on a go-forward basis is you are going to see just a slight shift there, if you will, that's due to GPC Asia Pacific, but we're going to continue to focus on our normal improvements in both of those lines.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One question on the Office Products business. If you could comment on the divergence between the Megas and the independents and sort of the nature of the business you do with those 2 channels and what you think might be leading to that? Is that a function of their end markets? Is it a function of your role with respect to channels? Any color you could give there would be terrific.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, just as a reminder, Matt, the independent channel was down mid single-digit and the Mega Channel was up mid single-digit. And we've seen variations in this over time and we can go back 1 year or 2 and see that the independents may have been growing at a little faster rate with us than the Mega Channel. So it does undulate a bit up and down, just depending upon the circumstance. At this point, I would say that the independents, as a general statement, the independents that seem to be doing reasonably well right now have embraced some of the newer things that S.P. Richards has been introducing. So as for instance, the independents that have embraced, in a big way, the cleaning and breakroom category are enjoying pretty good revenue growth with that. And of course, we benefit from that. And the same thing could be said for the Megas as well. As you know, they've embraced some of the new growth opportunities also. Those independents that have a strong presence on the Internet, I think, as a general statement, would be doing a little bit better than those independents that don't have a strong presence on the Internet. So it varies depending upon the particular circumstance of the independent channel. I was just at a meeting where S.P. Richards had a number of their independent customers in attendance. And I'd have to say that I was encouraged by the determination that I heard from the number that I got to talk with. And while they're not happy with where they find themselves as a general statement through midyear, many of them have a little bit of optimism for the second half of the year and they're determined to embrace some of these things that they know can enhance the revenue growth in the quarters ahead.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have 2 quick ones on Automotive. One is operational and one is financial. The operational one, I'll address to Paul. So you're showing very nice transaction growth, particularly in commercial. And interested in what your sense of the source of that is. Is that market growth, for clearly the market has improved to some degree? Or in your view, is that market share growth for the NAPA franchise?","Paul D. Donahue","I would think a little bit of both, Matt. As I mentioned in my comment are 2 key initiatives for us certainly is our AutoCare business, and as I mentioned, we had a record number of AutoCares in the past quarter. And our major account business has bounced back nicely. So those 2 areas have grown nicely and I think will continue to do so. So that certainly is driving our overall commercial business.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And are the major accounts typically large jobber chains and such, or is it fleet customers? Who typically is the population in that group?","Paul D. Donahue","So when we talk about major accounts, Matt, our key partners in that world are folks like Firestone, Goodyear, Tire Kingdom, Midas, AAA, certainly.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's great. And then, finally, just to think about the $0.22 of the accounting adjustment, and then, what I think is separate, which is the accretion associated with the Exego deal that you discussed at the outset of the year, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think it was a $0.15 to $0.20 number, just to make sure that those are 2 different numbers, the accretion from Exego is exclusive of that $0.22 number?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, it's inclusive of that number, Matt. We tried to bake that in when we gave you some guidance at the time of the transaction.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So the assumption then that the -- if you sort of exclude the accounting adjustment that if you think about the -- if you think about on an operating basis, if you will, it's more a breakeven kind of transaction with, I guess, potential to get more accretive over time?","Carol B. Yancey","No. One thing to keep in mind is when we did our original guidance, when we assumed we were going to have a 30% investment for the full year, we had given an EPS guidance. And then we came in and said we're going to do the 70%. And we put in an incremental amount. But there was already some amount in the beginning number, if you will, but the $0.15 to $0.20 was a range of the incremental amount adding in the 70% and knowing we already had something in there for the 30%, but it's not a breakeven. In fact, it's -- the $0.15 to $0.20 range for the 9 months were just what their operating numbers are. It's pretty close to what it is.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the remeasurement, if you will, and it might be too detailed for this call, but I think we're all getting some questions on this. Is this a reassessment of the value of the original investment? Kind of what drives that remeasurement process? I understand you have to do it, but what's the nature of the assessment?","Carol B. Yancey","So the 30% investment, there's purchase accounting rules and we're happy to have Sid go into more of this with you later. But the purchase accounting rules cause you to have a fair value valuation done by a third-party independent valuation firm. And they look at a lot of market metrics and they look at the results of the company and they look at a lot of different variables and it's a very in-depth process. So it's a fair value valuation of that original 30% that was $166 million, and you revalue it to the April 1 date.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani from ISI Group.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask in automotive 2 questions. The first one is, was there any impact from holiday shift, either good or bad this quarter? I know that you mentioned it was a headwind last quarter. So is that actually a tailwind or neutral? And then, secondly, on the margins within automotive, they were down slightly, but if you were to exclude Exego from that with the core, North American margin actually have been up?","Paul D. Donahue","I'll take the first one first, Michael. Certainly, Easter having a shift into the first quarter, the Easter holiday, that negatively impacted our numbers in Q1. So I think you could then surmise that it was a tailwind for our Q2 numbers. And the second question regarding our margin performance, I'm going to have Carol address that because I'm not sure I understood what your question was.","Carol B. Yancey","So if you recall, in the first quarter, our Automotive margins were up 10 basis points. And then, this quarter, we're showing a really strong 9.3%, and they were flat. And for the 6 months, we're still able to show 10 basis point improvement. And what we would say is just for the quarter, our core business probably was up slightly. But we're saying, on a full year comparative basis, margins for GPC Asia Pacific are very similar to our normal business, our core business. You could have some differences quarter-to-quarter because if you -- you may or may not know, but their quarters are completely opposite of ours. So our second and third quarters here in the U.S. are our strongest throughput quarters. And these are pretty high operating margins for second and third quarters. But for Australia, it's the reverse on their quarters. So their stronger quarters are first and fourth.","Thomas C. Gallagher","They're in the southern hemisphere and have the flip in terms of the seasonality.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. So seasonality has an impact. That's helpful. And maybe the last one, which is for Tom, which is the industrial guidance of up 1% to 3% sort of versus the year-to-date trend seems to imply an assumption that the business could be up maybe in the 3% to 4% range in the next 2 quarters. Is there anything in particular that's driving that outlook, whether it be different initiatives that you have or a thought that inflation might pick up a bit? Or how are you guys looking at that outlook?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think we'd start with making the point that you may recall that at the end of the first 2 quarters last year, our industrial business was up 10%. And we ended the year up 7%. So we saw some deceleration in the second half of 2012. So the comps get a little easier. And then, I think, as I mentioned in my comments, some of the challenges that we have in the original equipment manufacturer segment, we're going to anniversary some of that, and here again, the comps get, I think, a little easier for us. And then we've got specific initiatives that are underway that we think could generate some incremental volume in the second half of the year. So it's a combination of factors.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Following up on a couple of questions. So first in the auto business, on the DIY side, you mentioned the business was up low single-digits in the quarter. Is that a comp number or does that include maybe 100 basis points for the extra -- the Easter shift? Is that the right way to think about it? And then, as you think about it going forward, how do you think about the growth in this business? Clearly, spring got pulled forward last year out of the second quarter. You would think you would get a lift here in the second quarter of it just going back. Do you think sort of plus low single-digits is the right trend for the back half of the year in DIY?","Paul D. Donahue","So Chris, your first question was around the impact of Easter and was that a comp number or did Easter have an impact on our retail number. The way I'm looking at our retail business, Chris, we had a nice bounce back in Q2. And whether that's because Easter was in Q1, it's hard to determine. But I do know this, our retail business rebounded nicely in Q2. And we have a number of initiatives in the works that I do believe are beginning to take hold. And there's no reason to believe that we shouldn't continue that retail growth in Q3 and Q4. Again, we have a number of initiatives in the works and I'm excited with what the team is doing and we're pleased with what we're seeing.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Paul, if I could add to it. Chris, if we look at our retail business, both ticket count and basket size across the 3 months in the quarter, there was a pretty consistent performance on a per day basis across the 3 months in the quarter. So I think that would suggest that maybe we did get to benefit in April from the Easter transition year-over-year. But the May and June numbers, I think, would validate a bit of what Paul is saying and that is the retail business is better. It's not booming by any stretch. But it's better than what it was and we're encouraged by what our team has accomplished on a monthly basis over the course of the quarter.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Perfect. And then, on the brakes side, does it -- can you maybe put some frame out how much is brakes in the NAPA business? What was it down? And did it flip to positive in the second quarter and grow as you talk about the momentum in the business improving throughout the quarter?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I might take the first stab at that, Chris. We don't break out the volumes or percentage of the total volume on any of the product categories. I suggest we just leave it that it's a significant product category for anybody that's in the automotive aftermarket. And in terms of the relative performance, I think the industry was probably down in the brake category this year. And our numbers, if they're indicative of what's happening in the industry is probably a positive through the first half of this year, certainly, we are.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then jumping back to a prior question. So on the Motion side, the compares do get a lot easier as you look at -- into the fourth quarter in getting back to positive. Is that something that's more weighted to later in the year, more of the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as you think about your annual guidance?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Yes. I think we would expect the fourth quarter to be a bit heavier -- a bit better than the third quarter, at least the way we see it right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question would be, I guess, kind of a housekeeping, if you will. The other revenue line, kind of the offset line for discounts and incentives, seem to be running quite a bit higher than it has over the past several quarters. What's really driving that?","Carol B. Yancey","The increase in that is GPC Asia Pacific. So the sales discounts that we have to show, by putting in their revenue, we had to show the offset on that line. So it's entirely related to GPC Asia Pacific. So the run rate that you see for this quarter will probably be the way that it is for the rest of the year.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then, on the auto side, are there other assets, distribution assets globally that may make sense for you guys? I mean, are there potential acquisitions that are coming to the market or in the market right now?","Thomas C. Gallagher","It very well may. And we're always open to having any discussion. At the end of the day, it's going to really come down to does it make sense for the shareholders of Genuine Parts Company? But yes, we'd be open to continue to have discussions with folks.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Helpful. And the final question would be on the raw material prices seem to continue to kind of trend lower here. Where in the value chain does this get captured? I mean, do you guys see any benefit from kind of lower input costs?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, the input costs would affect our supply base more than they would us. If, in fact, we see sustained lower input cost, that should theoretically translate into reduced purchase prices and enable us to pass on lower prices to our customers as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm still a little confused on the guidance. The previous range, does it include the full $0.22 of the issue we're talking about here in the second quarter?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Keith, we could not quantify precisely what the gain was going to be. We knew there would be a gain. And as I mentioned, we had a range. And when we gave the guidance at the time, we tried to pick what we thought would most closely approximate what actually turned out to be the gain. And we came pretty close in the final analysis. So yes, it includes it. And then, as Carol said, you need to back out from that the 30% equity stake that we had when we set up the guidance for the full year.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","What EPS number is that?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I don't have that here but I'd...","Carol B. Yancey","We didn't give that out. So that was just in our number.","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think, if you want really a lot more of the detail, what might make the most sense is if you'll call Sid after this call. He'll be happy to try to walk you through it.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, please. That would be helpful. So I think it looks like, in the back half of the year, you're going to be up low single-digits in terms of EPS. And you gave us the guidance on the revenues by segment, which I average out, it'd be low single-digits, so I assume you're assuming no margin changes despite the weaker forecast on automotive business. Is that fair to say?","Carol B. Yancey","Well, what we're trying to say is that we'd like to have margin improvement. And you may see that on the automotive side, that if on the nonautomotive we don't have the top line growth, you may not have that. So it's -- we would say that margins would be relatively flat to up slightly and that's what we're trying to accomplish.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Keith, one other comment on the EPS improvement. Just keep in mind that we did have the onetime curtailment gain, the pension curtailment gain in Q4 of last year. And that was $0.09 a share. So take that into consideration as you build your model.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Quick question. As we look at Exego, sort of in a year-over-year standpoint, how did it comp in the quarter, just carving out that Australian business separately?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we don't break out the individual units. But I think Paul mentioned that they performed right at expectation for us in the quarter. So they did a good job.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, in North America, are you seeing any shift in maintenance versus failure parts demand? Are you seeing any reduction in maintenance deferral as we're getting into 2013 middle of the year?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, I don't know if I'd refer to it as reduction in maintenance deferral. But we do know, based upon Paul's comments, that our major account and our AutoCare business both enjoyed good solid growth, which would suggest perhaps that we're getting some of that repair that's been hanging out there.","Paul D. Donahue","I think, Bret, that's indicative of both categories. I mentioned we had a very strong quarter in our battery business on the failure side, but we also saw nice comeback in our brakes business.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then, one last question. I guess not to get too granular, but you mentioned that the business improved as the quarter progressed. And regionally, the Eastern and Midwestern markets that were tough last year were showing improvement. But I guess, if you look at that Atlanta to New England market in June, you certainly had a historically wet month. Do you think you lost anything to the weather in the latter part of the quarter? Or was that really not an impact?","Paul D. Donahue","No. It's interesting, Bret, because I recently read where the month of June across the country was the warmest in many years, but it was also the wettest. And our business in the South and certainly the Mid-Atlantic areas just got pounded with rain in the months. So again, it's difficult to quantify but I have to believe it had an impact on business because people just aren't getting out and working on their cars and visiting the retail stores. So your comments are, I think, dead on.","Operator","We have time for one last question from the line of Brent Rakers from Wunderlich Securities.","Anjali R. Voria - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","This is actually Anjali Voria for Brent today. If I could just ask a couple of questions on industrial. I think you mentioned earlier your top 10 industry segments, excluding the OEM side, are actually up mid single-digits. I'm curious as to how they performed in Q1, if it accelerated or decelerated from Q1 levels excluding OEM? And whether maybe some of your broad line initiatives are helping these numbers? Outside of your core power transmission fluid power, is your broad line initiative ramping up here? Maybe you could talk about that a little bit.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Sure. We'll take the first part of the question first. And we did see sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2. I think, in my comments, I mentioned that we're up mid single-digit in the second quarter in those industry segments, and we were up low single-digit or up low single digit year-to-date. So we did see some sequential improvement. As far as any specific initiatives, we would prefer not to get into those on the call. But I would say that we do have specific initiatives trying to continue to drive revenue in all of the customer categories that we have, as well as all product categories that we have. So that's a significant area of emphasis for us right now.","Anjali R. Voria - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Did you see any difference in performance in various geographic regions, such as maybe Canada or the Gulf or other parts of the country that saw some variability?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I don't think we could say specific differences geographically due to any geographic regions. We would see differences geographically, depending upon how closely aligned they are to some of these OEM customers that I referenced in my comments.","Anjali R. Voria - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. On the Office side, I think you noted sequestration as impacting some of the business there. I don't know if you've said in the past, but what is your exposure to the government side or government exposure in your S.P. Richards business?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we don't have any direct exposure because we don't sell direct. We sell only through Office Products resellers. But it's that customer category that would have exposures. So we would have many, many customers that do business at different levels of government, they would do local, state, federal business. And that customer segment at all 3 levels is really being impacted currently.","Anjali R. Voria - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And when you look at the -- I know it's a little ways out, but I think the initial Depot-Max combination was approved by shareholders. How do you view the opportunity for wholesale in interim as they consolidate their business? And maybe how do you think things will shake out after the full consolidation is completed? Any thoughts on that?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, what we would say is they're both good companies and they're both good customers to S.P. Richards. And I think, as a general statement, if there is overcapacity in the industry, at least at the store level, over the medium and longer term, this will be a good positive for the industry overall and for the companies that we're talking about specifically. As far as more direct impact, I think there are some pluses and some minuses at any combination like this. And certainly, in the very near term, there will probably be some redundant inventories that will be burned off and that might create some headwind to revenue growth. But there'll also be, I think, some opportunities for other customers to find ways to grow their business as we go through this process. And if, in fact, those customers are customers of S.P. Richards, that's a net positive for SPR.","Anjali R. Voria - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to jump back to industrial for a second here. When you look at how July has progressed and what the month-to-month progression look like during the quarter, do you have any thoughts on how that's shaking out?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, as far as the second quarter, if we look at it on a per day basis, the month was fairly even as we worked our way through the month. At this point, I think it's too early to make any comments on the July numbers.","Operator","And that concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn it back over.","Carol B. Yancey","We want to thank everybody for participating in this quarter's call. And we look forward to talking with you with our third quarter release. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Sid Jones","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company third quarter 2018 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for the full year. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.","A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call also may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","Now let me turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Sid, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our third quarter 2018 results. I will make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for the full year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions.","So we entered the third quarter with positive momentum, having just reported record sales and earnings in the second quarter. Our teams carried this momentum over into the third quarter, producing a strong sales performance, while also improving our total operating margin, earnings and working capital position. This was encouraging as the quarter also presented our teams with a few challenges. The unfortunate passing of Tim Breen, one of our key business leaders, the termination of our proposed merger agreement with Essendant, and the effect of Hurricane Florence all impacted our businesses and our associates in the quarter.","Despite these challenges, our team stayed focused and delivered total GPC sales of $4.7 billion, up 15.3% driven by the favorable impact of strategic acquisitions and a 4.3% comp sales increase. This 4.3% comp sales increase has improved from the 3.4% increase we delivered in the second quarter and 2% in the first quarter. It\u2019s also worth noting, our performance this quarter was our strongest comp growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2014.","Net income was $220 million and earnings per share was at $1.49, excluding the net impact of transaction and other cost related to the acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group and the recently terminated agreement to spin off the Business Products Group, net of the $12 million termination fee, adjusted net income was $218 million, up 28% and adjusted earnings per share was $1.48, up 29%.","We will kick off our business segment overview with our Global Automotive Group. Total Automotive sales were up 23.3% in the third quarter, including a 3% comp sales increase. This has improved from the 2% increase in the second quarter and a 1.5% increase in the first quarter. So we are pleased to see the steadily improving comps, which are driven primarily by our U.S. Automotive results. Our total sales also benefited from acquisitions, net of an unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 2%.","We'll first review our performance for our largest business segment, our U.S. Automotive division. Sales for our U.S. Automotive operations were up 4.9% in the third quarter, with comp sales up 3.2%. This has much improved from the 1.5% comp increase we delivered in the second quarter and the slight increase we reported in Q1. This is also our best U.S. sales comp since the first quarter of 2016. This year's steady improvement in our core sales reflects the ongoing execution of our sales plan as well as the continued strengthening of the underlying sales conditions for the automotive aftermarket in the U.S.","The warmer-than-average temperatures for much of the quarter came on the heels of a hot summer and a colder winter, which likely increased parts failure and maintenance and grow the improved demand. Our growth in Q3 was fueled by increased sales to both our retail and commercial customers, and for the first time in two years, sales to the commercial segment outpaced our retail sales. This was driven by the continued strengthening of our NAPA AutoCare sales, which were up 3.4% for the quarter. This is a significant commercial program for NAPA, and we are encouraged by the positive sales trends with these accounts.","Looking forward, we believe the improving conditions will drive further commercial growth for both our AutoCare and Major Account customers. And while our Major Account sales lagged the strength of our overall growth in the third quarter, we are optimistic for stronger sales in the quarters ahead.","Turning now to our retail business, our growth in this segment reflects the positive impact of initiatives such as NAPA Rewards Program, now 8.5 million member strong, expanded store hours and our retail impact store project. We have completed the rollout of the retail impact initiative to our company-owned stores and have now shifted our focus to our independently-owned stores. We expect these strategic initiatives to drive further sales growth for our retail segment, which represents 20% to 25% of our total U.S. automotive sales.","So in summary, we are encouraged by the ongoing improvement in the sales environment for our U.S. Automotive operation and its positive impact on our operating results. As mentioned in last quarter's call, we believe this trend will continue in the quarters ahead for several reasons. We are seeing the positive shift in demand for failure and maintenance parts due to return of normalized weather pattern. We expect the number of vehicles in the aftermarket sweet spot to further stabilize and, ultimately, become a tailwind in 2019 and 2020.","The long-term fundamental drivers for the automotive aftermarket remained strong, with a growing and aging fleet and increasing miles driven among consumers. We also expect our ongoing acquisitions and overall footprint expansion to further contribute to sales. Previously we discussed the addition of Smith Auto and Sanel Auto Parts to the NAPA network, and these businesses are performing well for us. Most recently, we announced the acquisition of Hastings Auto Parts, a four store group in the Detroit area, which joined NAPA on October 1. Hastings significantly enhanced our presence in the Detroit Metro area and will contribute approximately $10 million in annual sales. We welcome the Hastings leadership group to our NAPA team. Our accretive tuck-in acquisitions remain an important part of our growth strategy, and we see additional opportunities to expand our U.S. store footprint.","Now let's turn to our international automotive businesses in Canada, Mexico, Europe and Australasia. These operations account for 40% of our total automotive revenues and delivered a collective 5% total sales increase, including a 2.7% comp sales increase. We'll lead off with our key North American automotive operation. Total sales were up mid-single digits at NAPA Canada and up low single digits in Mexico. In Canada, we continue to drive our core sales growth with the solid execution of our sales initiatives, while also adding strategic tuck-in acquisitions to further expand our Canadian presence. We continue to look for further growth in Canada and Mexico as we move forward.","Turning to Alliance Automotive Group, this business continues to operate well across its European footprint in France, the UK, Germany and Poland. Comp sales grew low to mid-single digits and were positive across all four regions, with the strongest results in Germany and the UK. Additionally, the European team continues to drive strong sales growth from its ongoing acquisitions. AAG's robust acquisition strategy resulted in several additional bolt-on acquisitions in Q3, including TMS Motor Spares, which closed on August 31. TMS, headquartered in Carlisle, England, is a leading automotive parts distributor and adds 24 locations to the AAG network. TMS further expands our U.K. footprint with seven locations in England and provides for our first company-owned stores in Scotland, with 17 locations there. We expect this strategic acquisition to generate approximately $30 million in annual sales, and we are pleased to extend a warm welcome to the TMS team. ","We also announced AAG's October 2 acquisition of Platinum International Group headquartered in Manchester, England. Platinum is the leading value-added battery distributor, serving primarily the automotive industry from nine U.K. locations and one in the Netherlands. Platinum strengthens AAG's position in the U.K. battery market and is expected to generate estimated annual revenues of $75 million. We want to welcome both the TMS to welcome both the TMS and Platinum teams to the AAG family. ","Wrapping up our AAG overview, we continue to work towards the closing of the previously announced acquisition of the Hennig Group in Germany. They are leading supplier of light-duty and commercial vehicle parts, with 30 branches across Germany and estimated annual revenues of $190 million. Subject to final regulatory approvals, we currently expect to close on the Hennig acquisition later in the fourth quarter. The addition of these businesses, a full pipeline of other potential acquisitions and our continued focus on underlying core growth is supported by relatively solid economic and industry fundamental across the European markets we serve. ","We are also pleased with the continued progress on our integration plans, and as we approach the one-year anniversary of this acquisition, we remain encouraged by the opportunities we see for our European operations and are confident the AAG team will continue to deliver for GPC. Our growing operations in Australia and New Zealand posted another solid quarter.","Total sales in local currency were up mid-single digits while comp sales were up low to mid-single digits in the third quarter. The Asia-Pac team continues to drive its sales growth with a combination of initiatives to grow core sales and accretive acquisitions, while also executing on plans and initiatives to enhance our customer service capabilities and overall operating performance. We expect Asia-Pac's growth plans combined with the continued backdrop of solid economic and aftermarket fundamental to generate strong results in the quarters ahead.","In summary, our U.S. business continues to strengthen, with September being our strongest average daily sales month of the year. The strong finish to the quarter enabled our U.S. team to post another quarter of improved comp sales growth. Our European operations performed well with solid core growth and the added benefit of ongoing acquisitions. Our remaining international automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada, and Mexico are all performing to plan. We continue to build size and scale as we expand our automotive operations around the globe.","So now let's turn to our Industrial Parts Group. The sales environment for this business remains strong across our operations in U.S., Canada and Mexico. Total sales of $1.6 billion were up 8.3% in the third quarter including a 7% comp sales growth plus a benefit of acquisitions. This 7% sales comps further builds on the 4% to 6% comps achieved over the previous five quarters and reflects Industrial's strongest sales comp since the fourth quarter of 2014. This ongoing pattern of solid sales growth is consistent with the positive impact of our growth initiatives for this business and the favorable economic and industry-specific factors benefiting the industrial marketplace.","These include the continued strength in major industrial indicators such as the Purchasing Managers Index, industrial production, active rig counts and U.S. exports. Further supporting the broad strength across the industrial marketplace, all 14 of our major product groups, including the electrical specialty group posted sales gains in the quarter and each of the top industries we serve were up as well. Iron and steel, chemicals and allied products and oil and gas extraction industries were especially strong, with each showing low double-digit increases.","On October 1, we announced the acquisition of Hydraulic Supply Company in Sunrise, Florida. HSC is the leading full-service fluid-powered distributor, with a broad product offering of hydraulic, pneumatic and industrial components and systems. HSC operates from 30 locations, primarily in the Southeastern U.S. and further enhances Motion's footprint for additional fluid power product. HSC is expected to generate estimated annual revenue of $85 million. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to John Serra and the HSC team to our Industrial operations.","We are encouraged by the strong results in the Industrial business thus far in the year. Looking forward, we expect our plans and initiatives to drive both core and acquisitive growth combined with the extended industrial growth cycle, which still has strength to support strong results for this segment in the quarters ahead. We also remain pleased with our investment in Inenco, the Australian-based industrial distribution company we partnered with in 2017. This team just wrapped up a strong fiscal first quarter. While we currently have a 35% investment in Inenco, we will look to increase our investment in 2019. Their strategic supplier base lines up well with Motion's and they give us a strong hold not only in Australasia, but also in strategic markets like Indonesia and Singapore. ","As we reflect on our Industrial performance and future growth prospects, we are especially proud of the resilience this team has demonstrated following the loss of Tim Breen, the President and CEO of Motion Industries. On August 20, we announced Tim's sudden passing, and we are all deeply saddened by the loss of such a good friend and colleague. He will be truly missed. Randy Breaux and Kevin Storer, both very talented and seasoned executives, have stepped up to lead the Motion team, and we are certain that the Industrial Group is in very capable hands as we move forward. And we know Tim would be very proud of his Motion team. ","So now let's turn to S.P. Richards, our Business Products Group. This segment reported total sales of $496 million, up 1.3% for the third quarter. The increase was driven by the growth in comp sales and marks the first positive sales comp since the third quarter of 2015. And more encouraging, this improvement reflects the increase in sales for three of our product categories: core office supplies, technology and FPS, our facilities break room and safety supply category.","As mentioned earlier, our definitive agreement with Essendant announced in April April, whereby GPC would spin off the SPR business and merge it with Essendant, was terminated in September. Despite our best efforts to proceed with this agreement, Essendant's Board of Directors determined that the competing acquisition proposal from Staples was a superior proposal as defined in the merger agreement. While we disagree with this determination, the SPR and Essendant merger agreement was terminated and GPC was paid a $12 million termination fee. ","Considering these circumstances, GPC will continue to operate the S.P. Richards business. We believe with \u2013 that with further industry consolidation, there is significant opportunity for this business to grow and deepen its relationships with both independent dealers and other customer channel, and we'll continue to invest in these growth opportunities when and where appropriate. ","Finally, we extend our thanks to all of our associates at S.P. Richards. Our team, led by Rick Toppin, has done a terrific job of staying focused on what truly is important, and that is providing exceptional service to all of our customers. So that is a summary of our consolidated and business segment sales results for the third quarter of 2018. We were pleased to show progress in our operations and report improved results and will continue to build on these positive trends as we move through the fourth quarter of the year and on into 2019.","So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide our updated outlook for 2018. Our total sales in the third quarter were up 15.3% or up 4% on a comp basis, which excludes acquisitions and a 1% unfavorable foreign currency translation. Our gross margin for the third quarter was 31.43%, which compares to 29.95% last year. Consistent with the first half of 2018, this strong increase primarily reflects the higher gross margin associated with AAG and other acquisitions.","In addition, we continue to see improved margins in our core U.S. Automotive and Industrial businesses. The Industrial business has also benefited from a slight increase in supplier incentives. We remain focused on enhancing our gross margins through several key initiatives, including ongoing supplier negotiations, both globally and across our businesses; the investment in more flexible and sophisticated pricing and digital strategies; improved analytic capabilities around product and customer profitability.","We expect these initiatives to support our current gross margin rates in the quarters ahead despite the growing competitiveness across the markets we serve. The pricing environment has been more inflationary in our Industrial and Business Products businesses thus far in 2018. We also saw the initial signs of inflation in our Automotive segment in the third quarter, and we would expect to see this trend continue over the balance of the year and into 2019 due to the current tariff regulation.","While the impact of tariffs has been fairly minimal through the nine months, the most recent list of goods subject to the 10% tariff is extensive and something that our teams are managing with our suppliers as we move forward. We continue to expect to pass along any increases to our customers as we have thus far. Our cumulative supplier price increases through the nine months of 2018 were up 4.1% in Automotive, up 3.2% in Industrial and up 1.5% in Office.","Our SG&A and other expenses for the third quarter were $1.19 billion, which represents 25.25% of sales. This has improved from the first and second quarters due primarily to our stronger core sales growth. In addition, while we continue to experience ongoing pressure from rising costs in areas such as payroll, freight and delivery, our teams are addressing these factors and making progress on our cost-saving plans and initiatives.","Finally, we would add that our third quarter SG&A included a $3.1 million benefit associated with transaction and other costs related to AAG and the attempted transaction to spin off S.P. Richards, which is net of the favorable impact of a $12 million termination fee. Now we will discuss the results by segment.","Our Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.6 billion, which is up 23% from the prior year. And our operating profit is $227 million was up 27%, with operating margin of 8.6% compared to 8.3% margin in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in operating margin relates to the improved leverage on our 3% comparable sales growth in the U.S. and reflects our first quarterly margin expansion since the first quarter of 2016. We are optimistic for further expansion in the quarters ahead.","Our Industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, a strong 8% increase from Q3 of 2017. Our operating profit of $119 million is up 10% and our operating margin is 7.6% compared to 7.4% last year, with the 20 basis point increase due to another quarter of solid gross margin expansion and leverage on expenses from the 7% comp sales increase.","The Industrial business has been consistently strong since the start of 2017, and based on our outlook for continued strength, we expect to see further margin expansion at Industrial as we move forward. Our Business Products revenue for $496 million, up 1% from the prior year. Their operating profit of $20 million was down 17% and their operating margin is 4%. So despite positive total sales growth and the first positive comp for this group since the third quarter of 2015, this business continues to be pressured by the lack of expense leverage, challenging industry conditions and an unfavorable product and customer mix shifts.","With that said, we have plans and initiatives in place to further improve revenues for the Business Products Group to better leverage our expenses and stabilize the margin. Our total operating profit in the third quarter was up 18% on the 15% sales increase, and our operating profit margin was 7.7% compared to 7.6% last year. This is our best performance of the year, and while pleased to report the margin improvement, we will continue to execute on our initiatives to deliver further expansion.","We had net interest expense of $22 million in the quarter. And for 2018, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98. This is down from our previous guidance of $98 million to $100 million and is primarily due to lower interest from the decrease in debt as well as some beneficial cross currency strategies.","Our total amortization expense was $24 million for the third quarter, which is an increase from $12 million last year, primarily due to the amortization related to AAG. For 2018, we expect full year amortization to be in the range of $88 million to $90 million. Our depreciation expense was $37 million for the quarter, and for the full year, we continue to expect total depreciation to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million.","On a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $230 million to $240 million. The other line, which represents our corporate expense, was $29 million for the third quarter, which includes an approximate $3 million benefit associated with transaction and other costs, net of the favorable termination fee that we recorded in the quarter. Excluding this benefit and the transaction and other costs that were incurred in the third quarter of 2017, our adjusted corporate expense was $32 million or a $6 million increase from last year, which is primarily due to payroll pressures, including incentive and variable pay, increased costs for minority interest and ongoing investments in IT and security initiatives.","For the full year, we currently expect our corporate expense to be in the range of $120 million to $125 million range, excluding transaction-related costs. This compares to our previous guidance of $115 million to $125 million. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 24.5%, down significantly from the 35.7% tax rate in the prior year due mainly to the benefit of the U.S. tax reform. Looking forward, we continue to expect a 25% tax rate for 2018, and we anticipate a higher fourth quarter tax rate as we finalize our provisional tax reform adjustment.","So now let\u2019s turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our accounts receivable of $2.7 billion is up 23% from the prior year and up 7% excluding the impact of acquisitions, primarily AAG and foreign currency. This increase is greater than our 4% comp sales increase for the third quarter, but it primarily relates to one less collection day in September. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at September 30 was $3.5 billion, which is up 5% from September of last year and down 1% excluding AAG, our other acquisitions as well as foreign currency. Our teams continue to improve the inventory levels in our core businesses and will continue to manage this key investment to the appropriate levels as we move forward.","Our accounts payable of $4 billion at September 30 is up 23% in total and up 9% over the prior year excluding AAG, other acquisitions and foreign currency. The net increase in payables reflects the benefit of improved payment terms with certain suppliers, and at September 30, our AP-to-inventory ratio improved to 114% from 110% at June 30. We are especially pleased with our progress in managing our trade payables and its positive impact on our cash flows.","Our total debt of $2.9 billion of September 30 is up from $1.1 billion last September, but is down from $3.2 billion at June 30. The increase from September last year reflects our borrowings for the AAG acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our debt arrangement vary in maturity, and currently the average interest rate on our total debt stands at 3%. We\u2019re comfortable with our current debt structure and have a strong balance sheet and financial capacity to support our growth initiatives, including strategic acquisitions and large investments such as AAG and the Inenco Group in Australia, which we believe serves to create significant value for our shareholders. So in summary, our balance sheet is a key strength of the company.","Turning to our cash flows, we have generated $926 million in cash from operations for the nine months in 2018, which has much improved from the last year due to the increase in net income and the improved working capital position. Our cash flows continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value.","For 2018, we are increasing our projected cash from operations to the $1 billion to $1.1 billion range, up from our previous guidance of $950 million to $1 billion. Likewise, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. Our priorities for cash remain the dividend, reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. Regarding the dividend, 2018 represents our 62nd consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. Our 2018 annual dividend of $2.88 represents a 7% increase from 2017. We\u2019ve invested $92 million in capital expenditures thus far in 2018, and for the year, we\u2019re planning for capital expenditures in the range of $175 million to $200 million, which accounts for the impact of AAG and certain technology, facility and productivity investments that we have planned for in association with our tax savings.","Regarding our share repurchase program, we have 17.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase, and we expect to be active in the program over the long term. We continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment, and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.","So now let\u2019s turn to our guidance for 2018. Based on our performance thus far in 2018, our growth plans and initiatives, including our announced acquisitions and the market conditions that we see for the foreseeable future, we expect total sales for 2018 to be in the range to \u2013 of plus 14% to plus 15%, and this guidance excludes the benefit of any future acquisitions and represents an increase from the previous guidance of plus 13% to plus 14%.","By business, we\u2019re currently expecting plus 22% to plus 23% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, which is an increase from the previous guidance of plus 21% to plus 22%. Plus 7% to plus 8% total sales growth for the Industrial segment, which is an increase from the plus 6% to plus 7% previously. And a sales decrease of minus 1% to minus 2% for Business Products, which has improved from the prior guidance of down 3% to down 4%.","On the earnings side, we currently expect adjusted earnings per share excluding any transaction- related costs and fees incurred during the year to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.70. This represents a small change from our previous EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.75 and better reflects our performance through the nine months, as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter.","So that\u2019s our financial report for the third quarter, and we\u2019re pleased to build on the positive momentum from the first half of 2018 and show progress in several areas, including SG&A, our total operating margin and working capital. As we noted before, further progress in these areas remains a top priority for us as we move forward","And at this point, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Paul.","Paul Donahue ","Thank you, Carol. In our closing comments last quarter, we alluded to a few areas requiring improvement and we outlined our plans to drive these improvements. We called out the need to show progress in our core operating results, specifically our U.S. Automotive margins. We discussed the need to drive core sales growth to better leverage our fixed expenses. We also discussed rising cost and the need to aggressively attack operating cost, while continuing to provide exceptional customer service.","We are pleased we can report progress in just about every facet of our U.S. Automotive operations along with our other business units. As we look to the highlights from the third quarter, there are many. Sales remained strong at $4.7 billion and up 15%. Comp sales were up 4.3%, our strongest comp increase in almost four years, driven by improvement across all of our business segments. Automotive comp sales plus 3%, including a 3.2% increase for our U.S. operations, the strongest comp since Q1 of 2016. Industrial comp sales at plus 7%, the strongest comp since Q4 of 2014.","And finally, Business Products Group comp sales 1.3%, their strongest comp growth since Q3 of 2015. We saw a continued gross margin expansion and improving SG&A expense trend. Our operating margin expansion driven by 30 basis point improvement in Automotive and 20 basis point improvement in Industrial.","Adjusted EPS of $1.48 was up 29%, and we strengthened our balance sheet, improved our operating cash flows, with the excellent working capital management. We announced strategic acquisitions with Automotive adding TMS and Platinum in Europe and Hastings in the U.S. and Industrial adding HSC.","And finally, we increased our full year sales guidance to plus 14% to plus 15%, and we fine-tuned our full year adjusted EPS guidance to plus 19% to plus 21% over last year. So, it was a productive quarter for GPC, and we entered the final quarter of 2018 with plans and initiatives to further improve on our operating results. We remain committed to an organic and acquisitive sales strategy to drive long-term sustained revenue growth while also focusing on the continued improvement in our gross margins and cost management. We are excited for the future, and as always, we look forward to updating you on our progress when we report again next quarter.","With that, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good morning.","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Chris.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Christopher Horvers","Nice acceleration in NAPA U.S. and upside in industrial.","Paul Donahue","Thank you.","Christopher Horvers","Wanted to ask a little bit about the do-it-for-me side of NAPA in the U.S. Looking at the past two quarters, we had you about down 1% in the U.S. do-it-for-me in 1Q and then up a similar modest amount in 2Q. It seems like the do-it-for-me side accelerated to, call it, a 4% to 5% trend. Is that about right? And broadly, can you talk about the category performance that you saw that drove this acceleration?","Paul Donahue","Sure, Chris. Happy to do so. When you say category, you're talking product categories, Chris?","Christopher Horvers","Yes, please.","Paul Donahue","Yes. So, strong-strong quarter in our battery business, strong quarter in our filter business. Those two categories are two of our single largest categories. We had another good quarter in our tool and equipment business. So those would be three that certainly would warrant being called out. But we also called out AutoCare, our NAPA AutoCare business, which is a $1 billion-plus business for us. We had our really -- our second really good quarter in a row. Many of the initiatives our team has put into place are beginning to take hold, which is great to see. And on the Major Accounts side, our nationally-branded chain, all showed solid growth in the quarter as well. So a combination of things. And Chris, we always talk about the weather. That certainly did not hurt us at all in the quarter as well.","Christopher Horvers","So I had a question about that, I mean, I could understand having strong AC business given the hot summer in July, in August in the battery, but you commented that September was your best month, I think, in the U.S. on a days -- day basis given the extra Sunday that you had. So what would you attribute the strength in September to? Is it just that sort of lag effect? Is it more pricing coming through on the inflation front? Any comment there?","Paul Donahue","Well, September was still -- again, if you go back to the weather, Chris, September was still really warm month in many of our markets. But I think it's also, as we have said many, many times on these calls, that the weather tends to build on itself. So you had a really cold winter followed by a hot summer. That hot summer -- the batteries and the like aren't going to fail immediately when you hit the months of June and July. It does tend to build on itself. And I think, what we saw with our strong average daily sales in September was just really the culmination of all that wear and tear, and certainly, we saw it in the failure-type products as well as the maintenance products.","Christopher Horvers","And then the last question is on the inflation front, I mean, some of the CPI data seems to be accelerating here in the third quarter. You talked about auto inflation, I think, 40 bps cumulatively through the first nine months and I think the first half was sort of flat. So does that imply that maybe a 100 bps of the comp acceleration is pricing coming through on the inflation front?","Carol Yancey","Yes, I think on the inflation front, we did see a bit of inflation in Q3 and you mentioned the 40 bps that really is what we saw in the latter part of the nine months. We'd be lucky to get to a full point by the end of the year, maybe more like a 0.5 to maybe 0.75 at the end of the year, excluding any kind of tariff impact. So again, positive for us to see but truly not a significant impact on our true same-store sales. I mean, we had, just as Paul mentioned, strong commercial growth with a couple of our major wholesale-type programs and improvement across the board in a lot of product categories.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. Thanks very much. That\u2019s great.","Carol Yancey","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Livers","Hi. This is actually Jonathan Livers on for Scot this morning. Thank you for taking my question and really nice quarter guys.","Paul Donahue","Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Jonathan Livers","Yes. Could you give us a sense of what geographies performed well, especially in the U.S. auto side of the business?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Happy to Jonathan. We saw real strength in some of our biggest markets. We were certainly led in the quarter by our Midwest business, our Midwest team had a terrific quarter with strong single-digit comps. Our Northeast part of the country also had a very strong quarter, and that team has been performing well all year. Some of our warmer markets to the Southeast and Southwest performed well. Again, the Southeast has been stepping up most of the year for us. So those would be four that I would definitely call out.","Jonathan Livers","Yes. Thank you for that. And just a quick follow-up if I could, what kind of \u2013 could you perhaps quantify or discuss? You mentioned it briefly at the beginning that the impact of Hurricane Florence in the quarter that had on the business? I know you just mentioned the Southeast was strong, but any impact it had there?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Well, first Jonathan, I appreciate you asking that question. The -- we had two events, one really hit in October and that would be Michael, but Florence definitely had an impact across our business and more in our Atlantic division, which is up in the Carolinas. We had close to, I think, 100 stores closed at one time in NAPA, but we also had many of our Motion branches that were closed. We'll pick up some of those sales with storm-related-type products, generators, cleanup supplies and the like. And -- but I would tell you, a good bit of our focus was really assisting both our associates as well as our independent owners, just helping get back on their feet and recover from some of the damages in the stores. Michael, which, as we know, was I think the worst hurricane to hit the U.S. in 50-plus years. We still have parts at the Panhandle that do not have electricity. We had stores as well as Motion branches in the Panhandle. Panama City had significant damage, significant water damage. But other stores in the Panhandle as well as South Georgia as well were impacted.","Jonathan Livers","Got it. Thank you very much for the color.","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Fassler","Thanks so much. Appreciate it. I want to start with a couple of quick ones on Automotive. First of all, you spoke about the pace of the trend through Q3 and through September in particular. Can you talk about the organic automotive comp implied in your guidance for the fourth quarter?","Carol Yancey","Sure. We are implying for an Automotive comp guidance would be similar to where we are through the full year. So if you look at Automotive, and our total Automotive comps excluding AAG through the nine months around 2%, so we would assume in Q4 that we would have 2% to 3% comps, but maybe more towards the 3% range. So that's implied in our guidance. Matthew","Matt Fassler","Got you. And I know that we're only on October 18, for there's only 18 days. Anything that you've seen quarter-to-date to shake you off that?","Carol Yancey","Well, that's consistent with what our implied Q4 guidance is. So again, we're going to be comfortable with that range.","Matt Fassler","Got you. Understood. And then, second question, in Industrial, you spoke about some of the factors, some of the cross wins, I guess, impacting the ability to leverage in that business, and your sales have clearly recovered and you're closing the gap with your peers on the comp store sales line as well. Can you talk about what you need to see or what you can do to extract more leverage from that sales strength? Is it a function of industry conditions? Is it a function of getting the comp above that 7% level? If you could talk, maybe if there are cost initiatives that are underway. And I know you referred to some of them that you think you can get more traction as we move through the year and then into 2019.","Carol Yancey","Yes. So great question. And look, we are pleased with where Industrial is from a sales basis, and actually, as we called out all year, they've had really nice improvement on the gross margin line. So for the quarter and year-to-date, nice, close to 40 bps improvement on the gross margin line. Where the headwinds are is in SG&A, and as we pointed out all year, I mean, they saw, as with many businesses, significant increase in freight and freight-related cost. So to the tune of 20 to 25 basis points is what we are seeing. We saw it in Q2 and seeing in Q3. Also, have some payroll pressures, which, again, we talked about before. So it's causing them -- despite having a strong 7% growth, causing them not to quite have as much leverage on the SG&A side.","Having said that, our industrial teams are working really hard to make sure that they can pass along these increases and look forward to passing those along. You don't always are able to pass it along as quickly as you'd like because so much of their business is under contract. But they're working hard to kind of drive the freight recovery through higher cost of invoicing, and they're also looking to leverage better on their staffing levels and just overall SG&A. So again, we see improvement there but really the things that are holding us back are on the SG&A line.","Paul Donahue","And Matt, I would just add to that, the team at Motion is always looking at opportunities to consolidate facilities and branches where possible and where necessary. We are also looking at further investing in productivity-enhancing technology in our operations as well. And then last is, as we do in our Automotive business, we're just looking constantly at tools that will help us optimize our pricing approach and pricing strategies.","Matt Fassler","Understood guys. Thank you so much for that.","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re Welcome. Thanks Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Just one question on, as we look out to next year and you guys start to do your planning, and do you think there's any reason to believe that if we have a normal winter that demand would for some reason be slowing in 2019 in the auto business particularly versus 2018? I mean, anything in like the macro or demographics that you're seeing, fleet of vehicles that you think is \u2013 would be cause for a concern on the demand side.","Paul Donahue","Elizabeth, thanks for your question, and no, there is nothing on the horizon that would suggest that we should see a slowdown in our parts business here in the U.S. If anything, we think some of the tailwinds that we'll get from the car park \u2013 the aging of the car park as we further distance ourselves from 2008 and 2009 will actually be a benefit. So you started out with assuming we have normal weather, that's always an impact. We'll just \u2013 we'll continue to hope for the best. But no, they are \u2013 we are bullish on our parts business here in the U.S. and expect to see it to continue to perform well.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Great. Thanks.","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Please proceed with your question.","Seth Basham","My first question is on the gross margins. Another good performance, of course, driven by AAG. I was hoping you could quantify the contribution of the gross margin increase from AAG as well as the gross margin improvement in the U.S. auto businesses?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So what I would speak to on gross margin, if you strip out the impact of AAG, our gross margin in the quarter was up probably 20 to 25 basis points. And I would say that, that came from a combination of the Industrial improvement that I talked about earlier and also the U.S. Automotive improvement as well. Now these are being offset by a decline on the Business Products side, which is primarily related to the mix issues that we've faced basically all year. So our core gross profit, again, has been up pretty consistently for a couple of quarters, and we would expect to be able to continue to see improvement there.","Seth Basham","Got it. So with Industrial up 40 bps or so, that would suggest the U.S. Automotive business is probably up somewhere in the 20 bps range year-over-year for the quarter?","Carol Yancey","Yes, that's a fair estimate.","Seth Basham","All right, great. Thank you. And then secondly, as we think about the impact of tariffs, you guys mentioned that you expect to be able to pass along any tariffs that you \u2013 the price increases related to tariffs going forward. Could you give us some perspective on if you've already started raising prices as a result of tariffs and if you've been able to recoup all those costs?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So I think the first comment I mentioned is on the Industrial side. You saw pretty heavy inflation that they've seen year-to-date, 3.2%. That \u2013 some of that is indirectly tariff-related because there are a number of \u2013 there are manufacturing partners that have materials and components from China that could be part of their final products. So there is some implied tariff that's in the Industrial business, and we talked about passing that through and there is a little bit of a lag there. But as it relates to the Automotive side and Business Products, I mean, through the nine months, we would say that there was minimal impact of tariffs. As you know, the more significant tariff, the List 3 came into effect the last quarter \u2013 for the last week in September. So as we look ahead on that, we would expect to be working, and we have been working very closely with our suppliers, and our intention would be to pass those along to the customer.","Paul Donahue","Seth, I would just add a couple of comments to what Carol said. One of the things that doesn't get talked about much as we discussed tariffs, there's a positive outcome to the situation with tariffs as well and that's for Motion. If you recall, one of our top- performing business segments this past quarter is an iron and steel. We've got mills coming back up online in the U.S., and those are a few of our biggest customers promotion. So that business is benefiting from the tariffs, continues to do very, very well. But at the end of the day, Seth, our expectation is that we will pass along the price increases as we have in the past. But I would also tell you that we'll monitor the situation very closely. We'll watch we are lining up competitively in the marketplace and we'll respond accordingly.","Seth Basham","Got it. And just a follow-up on that Paul. I think you guys have mentioned some 40% of your U.S. auto COGS are from China. As a mitigation strategy, would you look to find other sources for some of those products coming from China?","Paul Donahue","Yes, we would, Seth. And I would just say that the 40% is our total amount of our imports coming into the Automotive parts group. We would say, directly out of China is closer to sort of 20%. But as I said, we'll continue to monitor it, and if we have to look for alternative sources, we will do so. The advantage of having a extremely strong brand like NAPA is we can shift and we can shift very quickly to other countries and other sources if we find that we can't remain competitive in a particular market.","Seth Basham","Got it. Thank you very much and good luck.","Paul Donahue","Your welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Bret Jordan","Good morning guys. Question on AAG, and as you lever working capital, I guess, how have you done on an AP-to-inventory basis in Europe? And then, as you build in incremental businesses like the battery distribution, how do we think about maybe EBITDA margins looking out a year or two given the business mix?","Carol Yancey","Yes, so I'll start off with a working capital for AAG and just comment that our improvement in working capital in Q3 was completely driven by our core existing business, primarily Automotive, with the impact of extended terms with some of our U.S. vendors and then also more normalized level of purchasing. So we have not seen the impact of the working capital improvement, specifically for AAG.","But having said that, we've got a number of things in process that we know that we will be able to achieve those synergies and the working capital improvement within the next \u2013 at the end of three years is what we've got out there. So we are certainly encouraged by the opportunities we have coming on working capital from AAG and know that there are opportunities there.","Paul Donahue","And then Bret, I would just \u2013 the second part of your question, with some of our acquisitions, our expectations is those will not be dilutive to our overall margins. And as you know, we've been quite active on the M&A front in Europe and we intend to continue to be. I think what has been encouraging for us in 2018 is our core growth, and we continue to see same-store sales in the core markets we currently compete in, in the 3% to 4% range. And that's been \u2013 that's honestly been very encouraging for us, and we expect that \u2013 and intend to keep that moving forward.","We're excited with the acquisitions of both TMS and Platinum and then Hennig, which will be, we suspect, finalized in Q4. All three will be additive to AAG in 2019.","Bret Jordan","Okay. Great. And then one final question on the U.S. auto. You mentioned national accounts were strong. Have you picked up new national accounts? Or is this strength with existing national accounts? I'm just \u2013 I guess, the real question is, is your 3.2% U.S. comp, do you think that that's a share gain number? Or do you think that was sort of in line with the underlying market growth?","Paul Donahue","Well, I guess, Bret, we'll have to wait and see how the other public companies report. You never quite know for sure.","Bret Jordan","I was hoping you were going to tell us. That was the point.","Paul Donahue","When you're the first one out, you'll have to kind of wait and see. But look, we're pleased with the 3.2%, and as I said in my prepared remarks, Bret, our team has worked awfully, awfully hard, and it's great to see the turnaround and the continued sequential improvement in our same-store sales. I would just give you a little bit more color on our Major Account business. The growth that we're seeing, I called out our nationally-branded chain, they are doing well. Where we've seen a little bit of a softness is in some of our government business and a bit of our fleet business, and that's an opportunity for us to get that back on a growth curve in Q4 and on into 2019.","Bret Jordan","Okay great thank you.","Paul Donahue","Yes, you welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich","Hi thanks and great quarter guys. I wanted to follow up on a couple of things. Carol, I think you mentioned that pressure was more in SG&A and actually freight cost showing up in SG&A. Is that the reason that the guidance actually was unchanged or trend a little bit at the top end despite sales being stronger? Was there anything else that sort of factored into that, the guidance shift calculation?","Carol Yancey","Yes. I'll just mention, and you're right, on the payroll and the freight, both of those in Q2 and also Q3 are growing at a pace much further than our sales. So if sales are growing without AAG 5%, freight and delivery is up something like 10%, 11% and payroll's up 6% or 7%. So you're certainly seeing that and we're expecting that to continue in Q4. The real modification, and again, we were pleased to be able to raise our sales guidance when we considered where we were thus far in nine months, consider the acquisitions. And then quite honestly, net of an FX headwinds, we are pleased to raise the sales guidance. We really just fine-tuned the earnings guidance based on where we are thus far. And look, FX had a negative impact of $0.02 in the quarter, and there may be a little bit more pressure in Q4.","As I mentioned, we still have the pressures from payroll and freight. We called out a little bit of a corporate expense number, too. So just \u2013 really just narrowing, refining where we think we're going to be based on where we are through nine months.","Greg Melich","Got it. And then Carol, another follow-up on the balance sheet, and then Paul, I had a strategy question. We're at a level now we have, I guess, 1.5 times debt to EBITDA, so plenty of ability to do other things. When the new lease accounting comes in, we get to back to around three times debt to EBITDA. Is that \u2013 do you think that's about a rough \u2013 add a little bit of over a turn when we think about the new standards? Or you haven't even looked at that yet?","Carol Yancey","Actually, if we \u2013 we're still looking at that. When you look at our minimum lease payments, which is something like $1.1 billion and when you add some of the other items that will go in there, you're probably fairly close. But quite honestly, as I think all companies probably facing this, I think there will be a consistent change in how everybody looks at this and whether everybody pulls it out and would start it without leases or it just adjust. But again, we \u2013 the idea is we have a reasonable level that we are at right now. We certainly have capacity and flexibility, and with our working capital improvement, we're really pleased with that.","So I don't think the lease number is going to change the basic strategy of our capital allocation or debt or acquisition strategy.","Greg Melich","Got it. And Paul, there's been a lot of \u2013 on the \u2013 you mentioned the retail side of the auto business. For the first time in a while, it's great to see do-it-for-me growing faster. But we have seen a lot of competitive shifts and actions going on this summer, and just this week, Advance doing a store within a store with Walmart. I'd like to just hear your opinion, if something like that would be interesting to sort of \u2013 or is it something that could put too much conflict with the do-it-for-me side of the business? Or are there other considerations that you think about if thinking about doing something like that?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Greg, as far as yesterday's announcement, it's a bit early for us to have any real specific reaction. We didn't really get any details as what their plan is or how the mechanics of this are going to work. What I would tell you from Genuine Parts Company and NAPA, what we are excited about and we'll continue to invest in is our own online initiatives and driving our omnichannel strategy. We launched an app online, which is our flagship here in the U.S. We're seeing over 0.5 million visits now per month.","We have customers both click and collecting in our stores as well as having products shipped directly to home. We reached \u2013 recently launched in Australia. We've had over 3.5 million visits to our new site there, averaging 25,000 a day in terms of site visits. We launched in Canada as well. So we're focused on our omnichannel strategy. Greg, feel good about what we're doing, we feel good. And I'm glad you called out that our commercial businesses, which is our real focus. And when you think about the new sites and the announcements of yesterday, I think that's going to be more DIY-centric than it would ever be DIFM- type centric.","Greg Melich","Got it, thanks a lot and good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Due to time constraints, our final question will come from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thanks. I want to follow up on the 20% China. It was kind of lower than I was expecting. Is that just a direct source mix? Does that include Chinese sales from U.S. suppliers, the sourcing in China?","Carol Yancey","Yes, Chris. And again, I just want to be clear that what we gave out, so for our U.S. Automotive business, which, again, is probably about \u2013 if you look at our total cost of goods sold for the company, U.S. would be, say, 75% to 80%. When you look specifically at Automotive, we said 40% is directly sourced outside the U.S. and 20% of that would be China impacted by tariff. And so, as we work and look down through Industrial, as I mentioned, very, very small amount.","It's more indirect. Office products, we would have something like 10% of their cost of goods sold that's subject to the Chinese tariffs, even though they source a lot more outside the U.S. There's products that aren't subject to it. So at the end of the day, when you look for GPC in total, you're talking about less than 10% of our cost of goods sold. In total, something more like maybe 7% or 8% that is impacted.","Paul Donahue","Chris, I would also \u2013 when you start to break it down on the Automotive side and you start to look at the various product categories that are impacted that we know of right now, you also need to look at what's not impacted. So our biggest categories, which I mentioned earlier, where we saw a significant growth in Q3, batteries, filters, oil and chemicals, none of those product categories are impacted by the tariffs.","The tariffs, really, you're looking at undercar, some brake rotors friction, chassis-type product. So yes, it's impactful. We've got cross-functional teams working between our pricing groups, our sourcing groups, our product groups that are pouring through the data. And again, as I said in my earlier comments, our intention is that we will pass it through as we normally do, but we will also continue to monitor where we are from a competitive standpoint.","Chris Bottiglieri","That's really helpful. And then, these numbers you've provided, are those just tariffs that have already been passed? Or does this include proposed tariffs that haven't officially been passed through yet?","Carol Yancey","So what we are talking about is the List three, the 10% tariff, about $200 billion in goods that just went into effect at the very end of September. And so what we're talking about is what is specifically impacted by the ones that have just been passed. And again, remember, there is \u2013 there was no really \u2013 no impact, virtually no impact on our business through the nine months.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. That makes sense. And then just unrelated. So even an update on your U.S. fleet business. I would take like rig count and oil and kind of rebasing. Just want to get a sense for, how that business is performing? And to what extent that, that's contributing to your high levels of commercial comp growth?","Paul Donahue","Yes. I mentioned earlier, Chris, when I break down our Major Accounts business, you really got to get into the detail and look at the various segments. Our Major Accounts business was basically flat, down slightly in Q3. But our nationally-branded chains, all performed well in the quarter. Where we saw some \u2013 where we saw a bit of softness was in our fleets and some of our government business. So our team's working really hard to understand where some of that softness is coming from in the fleet business, and we're going to work really hard to turn that around in Q4 and heading into 2019.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Carol Yancey","Well, we want to thank each of you for listening to and participating in our earnings call today. And we look forward to reporting back to you with our Q4 results in February. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."],"10119":["Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) Q4 2013 Results Earnings Conference Call February 18, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Thomas Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Paul Donahue - President","Carol Yancey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sidney Jones - Vice President, Investor Relations","Analysts","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Anjali Voria - Wunderlich Securities","Operator","Good morning. My name is Bridget, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter and 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Sid Jones, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Jones, you may begin your conference.","Sidney Jones","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts fourth quarter and 2013 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2014.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","This morning we will begin with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Thomas Gallagher","Thank you, Sid, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, the President of Genuine Parts Company along with Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and I will each handle a portion of today's call. And once we've completed our individual comments, we will look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.","Early this morning, we released our fourth quarter and year-end results and hopefully you have all had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,518,000,000, which was up 13%. Net income was $150.5 million, which was down 6% on a reported basis but up 3% on a comparative basis taking into consideration the one time pension curtailment gain of $23.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Earnings per share were $0.97 this year versus $1.03 last year, which was down 6% on a reported basis but up 4% on a comparative basis. For the full year sales were $14.78 billion which was up 8%. Net income was $685 million, up 6%, and earnings per share were $4.40 this year versus $4.14 last year and that\u2019s an EPS increase of 6%. Sales, net income and earnings per share each reached record levels for us in 2013 which we were pleased to see. And we are also pleased that our fourth quarter results in each of these areas helped us to slightly outperform the full year guidance that was provided at the end of the third quarter, indicating a bit stronger fourth quarter than we had originally anticipated.","As we look at our segment results, we continue to see the automotive operations outperforming our non-automotive businesses by a pretty good margin. Paul will comment on automotive in a few minutes but just to help illustrate this point, automotive sales were up 18.5% for the year while the combined non-automotive operations were down 1.3% which shows quite a contrast in performance. And I will make a few comments about each of the non-automotive businesses starting with industrial.","2013 was a challenging year for Motion Industries right from the offset. First quarter sales were down 2% followed by 1% decrease in the second quarter and 2.5% decrease in Q3. We were a bit encouraged by the 3% increase in the final quarter however, and Motion ended the year down about one-half of 1%. If we look at the results by customer category, as a group those customers in the automotive, food products, pulp and paper and lumber and wood products segment, among others, each showed nice growth for the year. Our challenges were primarily in the equipment and machinery category largely a result of several heavy equipment manufacturers who experienced sluggish demand both in North America and in their export markets. And as a result, the equipment and machinery segment was down for the year.","We are encouraged, however, by the fact that nine of our top ten customer categories had positive growth for the year and this combined with historically healthy industrial production and capacity utilization levels, as well as our recently completed industrial acquisition of CSI in Western Canada, all position us to look for a stronger performance from our industrial operations in 2014.","Moving on to EIS, our electrical segment. It is very much a similar story to the industrial business, with decreases of 5%, 4% and 5% over the first three quarters of the year, followed by a positive fourth quarter of plus 6% aided by an acquisition completed at the end of October. And EIS ended the year down 2%. There were a number of factors that influenced the EIS results in 2013, including the impact of sequestration on the defense contractor customers and also the fairly significant decline in copper pricing. However, as we look forward, we are a bit more optimistic. Although copper pricing may continue to be a bit of headwind at least in the early part of 2014, business seems to be improving and a bit more stable for our defense contractor customers.","Additionally, we ended 2014 with two consecutive quarters showing the ISM Purchasing Managers Index above 50, which is a stronger position than we found ourselves in going into 2013. And in addition, over the past few months, we have completed a couple of strategic bolt-on type acquisitions for EIS. And the combination of improving end-market conditions and the recent acquisitions put EIS in a position to deliver a much stronger performance in 2014.","And the final of our non-automotive businesses is office products. After the positive results in the fourth quarter of 2012, we went into 2013 cautiously optimistic. However, we saw conditions soften again as we worked our way through the year and we were down 1% in the first quarter, down 3% in quarters 2 and 3, and down 4% in the final quarter and we ended the year down 3%. And looking at the office product results from the product category side, we had positive results for the year in cleaning and break room supplies as well in the furniture category. But then these increases were offset by decreases in the technology and core office supplies categories.","On the customer side, the mega channel grew modestly for us for the year but our independent reseller segment was down as it had been through all four quarters of the year. So it was a difficult year for our office products team and of our four business segments this is the one that will be the most challenged in 2014 due to continued end-market sluggishness. With that said, however, we will still be looking for an improved year from office products in the year ahead. A combination of continued product and customer portfolio initiatives and the recently completed acquisition in the janitorial supply category should enable us to produce modest growth in the year ahead.","So that\u2019s a quick overview of the three non-automotive businesses and we will now ask Paul to give you an update on the automotive operations.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. It's good to be with you today and to have an opportunity to provide an update on the fourth quarter performance of our automotive business. As was mentioned in both our second and third quarter conference calls, we are now including in our automotive recap the results from GPC Asia Pacific, which was consolidated into our results on April 1.","To kick off our automotive report, we can tell you that despite the challenging economic environment in this region, our Australasian business continued to perform as expected throughout both Australia and New Zealand and we are encouraged with the progress we have seen thus far. This group led by CEO, John Moller, has put plans in motion to have another solid year in 2014.","As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, our automotive business grew top line revenues by 25% in the fourth quarter. To further explain, the numbers breakout as follows. Acquisitions contributed 19% of the 25%, our core business grew 7%, and currency had a negative impact of 1%.","Now let me take you through our North American numbers and provide an overview of our fourth quarter performance. As mentioned earlier, our team delivered a 7% sales increase in the quarter. When evaluating our performance, we are encouraged to see that all regions of the U.S. are positively contributing to our sales growth. The top performers in the quarter, not surprisingly, were those that were most impacted by the colder winter temperatures. So our division stretching from the plains across the Great Lakes to the Northeast, led the way for us in the fourth quarter. These colder temperatures provided positive momentum for a number of our key product categories as well. That said, the most recent extreme weather in some southern states as well as up and down the eastern seaboard has forced numerous store and customer closures and had a negative impact on our business.","The net-net of all this extreme weather we believe will be a positive for automotive business in the long run. Now turning to our U.S. company-owned store group. Comparable same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter came in at plus 7%. This improved performance gives us three consecutive quarters of strong same store sales growth. As a reminder, after a slow start to 2013, our team posted a 5% increase in Q2 followed by a 4% increase in Q3. So we are delighted to report steady and consistent growth throughout the year.","Our sales growth in Q4 was once again driven by a healthy 7% increase in our commercial and wholesale business. Diving deeper into our commercial results, our non-fleet related business turned in another stronger quarter generating a 9% increase. This segment was supported by double-digit sales growth among our major customers as well as double-digit growth from our 15,000 plus NAPA AutoCare centers. We are very pleased with the progress our team continues to make in this all important segment of our business. Our fleet business held steady at 5.7% growth, again a positive sign as head into the New Year. Our average wholesale ticket value increased low single-digits and our average number of tickets was up mid-single digit in this segment of our business for the second consecutive quarter. We are encouraged by both of these trends.","The fourth quarter was also the strongest of the year for our retail business as our team generated a 3% increase. Both our average ticket value and our average number of tickets grew in the low to mid-single digit range. It is encouraging to see that the initiatives our team is focused on are beginning to drive improved results. From a product category standpoint, we continue to see improved sales in our electrical category, primarily driven by our NAPA battery business. Not surprisingly, the colder winter temperature throughout much of the country also drove increased in both our starter and alternator business. Our electrical business was a key contributor throughout 2013 and this group has gotten off to another impressive start in 2014.","An additional positive product trend is our improved sales in our all important brake business. This is significant as we experienced slowing in this critical category in 2012 and into the first quarter of 2013. We began to see our business ramp up in Q2 and we have experienced double-digit increases in both Q3 and Q4. This improved performance confirms the initiatives we put into place have succeeded in getting our brake business back on track.","So in summary, we are encouraged to see both our North American and Australasian automotive operations report another quarter of solid results. We remain positive about the core fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket and the growth opportunities available to us in both the retail and commercial sectors. Many of the key metrics remain positive. The average cost of fuel has declined in many regions of the country and this serves to drive the all important miles driven metric, which is trending up despite a very slight one-tenth of 1% decline in the month of November.","The average age of vehicles on the road remains in excess of 11 years and deferred maintenance remains at historically numbers. All of these fundamentals are trending in the right direction and should continue to drive industry-wide growth in 2014 and beyond.","So in closing, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results and encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw throughout 2013. We are very proud of our management team and know they remain committed to driving profitable growth in 2014. While we have much work ahead of us, we remain optimistic that the initiatives we have put into play are having a positive impact on our results. We would like to personally thank all of our associates, both at NAPA North America and at GPC Asia-Pac and Australia and New Zealand, for their efforts in the fourth quarter and throughout 2013.","So that completes our overview of the automotive business, and at this time I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We will get started with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year income statements and our segment information and then we will review a few key balance sheet items. Tom will come back and wrap it up and then we'll open the call up to your questions.","As Tom mentioned, our total revenues were $3.5 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 13% from last year. And for the 12-months, total sales of $14.1 billion, up 8% from 2012 and another record sales level for Genuine Parts Company. Before the positive impacts of our fourth quarter acquisitions and the GPC Asia Pacific acquisition on April 1, 2013, our total revenues were up 4% in the fourth quarter and this was offset by 1% headwind from currency. For the year, total sales were up 1% before acquisitions, reflecting a 4% underlying sales increase for our automotive group, offset by 1% sales decrease for our non-automotive businesses.","Our gross profit for the fourth quarter was 31.0% of sales, which is up 180 basis points from the 29.2% of sales last year. And for the 12-months, gross margin of 30% is up from the 29% for the same period last year or an increase of 100 basis points. Our improvement in gross margins for both the fourth quarter and the full year can be primarily attributed to the favorable impact of higher gross margins in our Australasian business which owns a hundred percent of its stores. Excluding the impact of GPC Asia Pacific, our underlying gross margin for the quarter and the year was up slightly despite the headwind of lower volume incentives in our non-automotive businesses, primarily industrial, during the year.","In the second and third quarters of 2013, we recorded expenses of $18 million and $3 million respectively to cost of sales as purchase accounting adjustments for the write-up of inventory to fair value at GPC Asia Pacific. This write-up negatively impacted our full-year gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. So a good amount of activity impacting our gross margins in 2013, especially as it relates to GPC Asia Pacific and their hundred percent-owned store model. Looking ahead, we will continue to seek opportunities for further margin expansion and currently expect gross margin to improve slightly from the 30% achieved in 2013.","As an additional point of interest, we continue to see very little inflation in our businesses. For 2013, our cumulative pricing was down negative 0.1% for automotive, up 1.1% for industrial, up 0.5% for office products, and up 1% for electrical.","Sidney Jones","Excuse us. We understand the line went out for a few minutes, so I am going to back Carol up to -- come at the beginning of your session, Caro. They couldn\u2019t tell us exactly where we went out, but we got a notification the audio was dead. It may have been just for a few minutes. Operator, if you can tell us anything more specific, we will try to start at the appropriate spot.","Operator","It would probably be where she started, at the beginning of hers.","Sidney Jones","We apologize for the problems folks, but here we go.","Carol Yancey","Okay. We will start off with total revenues for the fourth quarter were $3.5 billion an increase of 13% from last year. For the 12 months, our total sales of $14.1 billion, were up 8% from 2012, another record sales level for Genuine Parts Company. Before the positive impacts of our fourth quarter acquisitions and the GPC Asia Pacific acquisition on April 1, 2013, total revenues were up 4% in the fourth quarter and this was offset by 1% headwind from currency. For the year, total sales were up 1% before acquisitions, reflecting a 4% underlying sales increase for our automotive group, offset by 1% sales decrease for our non-automotive businesses.","Gross profit for the fourth quarter was 31.0% of sales, up 180 basis points from the 29.2% of sales last year. And for the 12-months, gross margin of 30% is up from the 29% for the same period last year or an increase of 100 basis points. Our improvement in gross margins for both the fourth quarter and the full year can be primarily attributed to the favorable impact of higher gross margins in our Australasian business which owns a hundred percent of its stores. Excluding the impact of GPC Asia Pacific, our underlying gross margin for the quarter and the year was up slightly despite the headwind of lower volume incentives in our non-automotive businesses, primarily industrial, during the year.","In the second and third quarters of 2013, we recorded expenses of $18 million and $3 million respectively to cost of sales as purchase accounting adjustments for the write-up of inventory to fair value at GPC Asia Pacific. This write-up negatively impacted our full-year gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. So a good amount of activity impacting our gross margins in 2013, especially as it relates to GPC Asia Pacific and their hundred percent-owned store model. Looking ahead, we will continue to seek opportunities for further margin expansion and currently expect gross margin to improve slightly from the 30% achieved in the prior year.","As an additional point of interest, we continue to see very little inflation in our businesses. For 2013, cumulative pricing was down negative 0.1% in automotive, up 1.1% in industrial, up 0.5% in office products and up 1% in electrical.","Turning to SG&A. Total expenses were $856 million in the fourth quarter, representing 24.3% of sales. For the 12-months in 2013, total SG&A expenses are $3.2 billion or 22.6% of sales. SG&A as a percentage of sales are up 320 and 140 basis points for the quarter and the full year respectively. Much like the change in gross margins, this primarily reflects the impact of higher SG&A cost at GPC Asia-Pacific, again due to their hundred percent-owned store model. The decrease in leverage associated with the weak sales levels of our non-automotive businesses also served to negatively impact our operating cost in both the quarter and the year.","In addition, certain year-end expense adjustments in areas such as legal and professional services, insurance and employee benefits were recorded in the fourth quarter, which slightly increased our expenses in the period. It's also important to point out in the fourth quarter of 2012, the company recorded a onetime non-cash curtailment gain of $23.5 million associated with our December 2012 decision to freeze our pension plan which was effective January 1, 2014. Our total year SG&A also includes the positive onetime pretax adjustment of $54 million net of expenses associated with the reevaluation of our original 30% investment in GPC Asia-Pacific that was acquired on April 1, 2013.","Excluding both the 2012 and the 2013 onetime adjustments, SG&A as a percent of sales is 22.9% in 2013 compared to 21.4% in 2012. With the increase due mostly to GPC Asia Pacific but also reflecting a 30 to 40 basis point increase related to the loss of leverage in our non-automotive businesses, which we tend to improve on in 2014. Our focus remains on effective cost management in every areas of our business. A few notable cost control measures include ongoing investments in technology which has positively impacted our operating efficiencies in our distribution centers and stores, as well as supply chain initiatives in areas such as freight and logistics.","Through these initiatives and in consideration of the GPC Asia Pacific store model for the full 12-months, we expect our SG&A for 2014 to be relatively consistent with the prior year. Now let's discuss the segment results. Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.92 billion and represents 54% of sales and is up 25%. Our operating profit of $154 million is up 26% and their margin held even the prior year at 8.0%. For the full year, automotive sales were $7.5 billion representing 53% of our revenue, and up 18.5%. Operating profit of $641.5 million is up 19% and so their 8.6% margin is the same as the prior year.","Our industrial sales were $1.09 billion in the fourth quarter and this is 31% of total revenue and up 3% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $73.3 million is down 6% and our operating margin of 6.8% was down from the 7.4% in the prior year. For the 12-months, industrial sales were $4.43 billion which is 31% of total revenue and down 0.5%. Our operating profit of $321 million is down 9% and their margin of 7.2% is down 70 basis points from the 7.9% in 2012. Some margin decreases in industrial for both the quarter and the year are due to the loss of leverage on weak sales and a decrease in volume incentives with our suppliers. Some improved top line growth in 2014 will help these margins.","Our office products revenues were $386 million in the quarter which is 11% of our total revenues and down 4.3%. Our operating profit of $31.4 million is down 13.6%, so their margin was down to 8.1% from 9.0% last year. For the year, office sales were $1.64 billion, representing 12% of total revenue and down 2.9%. Operating profit of $122.5 million is down 8.9% and their margin is 7.5% versus 8.0% last year or down 50 basis points. This is due primarily to the loss of leverage on their weak sale and also to a lesser degree, lower vendor allowances.","The electrical\/electronic group had sales in the quarter of $144 million, that\u2019s 4% of our revenue and that was up 6.3% driven by acquisitions. Their operating profit of $12.3 million is down 1.4%, so their margin came down to 8.5% from 9.2%. For the year, electrical sales were $569 million representing 4% of revenue and down 2.4%. Operating profit of $47.6 million is down 6.5% and their margin was down 30 basis points from 8.7% to 8.4%. As with industrial and office, the decline in margin is primarily a function on the loss of leverage on their lower sales volume in 2013.","The total operating profit was up approximately 9% in the quarter and operating profit margin of 7.7% was down 30 basis points, which is a slight improvement from the 40-basis points year-over-year decrease in the third quarter. For the full year, our total operating profit is up 5% and our margin of 8.0% is down 30 basis points from the 8.3% in 2012. The decline in our operating margins for the quarter and the year reflects the continued impact of our weak sales conditions in our non-automotive businesses. That said, the automotive business has held their margin constant for a few periods now and we think we can improve on this by 10 to 20 basis points in the periods ahead.","Thus far, the operating margin at GPC Asia Pacific remains comparable to the margin for the total automotive group as we expected. We have room for improvement in each of our core businesses and we remain committed to expanding our operating margin in the periods ahead through improved top line growth as well as our ongoing initiative. We had net interest expense of $6 million in the fourth quarter and for the year our interest expense is $24.3 million, which is up from 2012 due to the increase in our total debt.","Based on our recently renewed term note, discussed in further details in a few minutes, as well as the possibility of reducing our current debt somewhat in 2014, we expect net interest expense to improve to approximately $20 million for the full year of 2014. Our total amortization expense was $8.5 million for the fourth quarter and is $29 million for the full year. This is up from 2012, due primarily to the Quaker City and GPC Asia Pacific acquisitions as well as the other industrial and electrical acquisitions that were completed in the fourth quarter. Currently, we expect amortization expense to be in the $35 million range for 2014.","The other line which reflects corporate expense was a $21 million expense item in the fourth quarter and $35 million expense for the full year. The full year number includes the $33 million net benefit of the purchase accounting adjustments related to GPC Asia Pacific which were recorded in the second and third quarters of 2013. Likewise, the $23.5 million pension curtailment gain reported in the fourth quarter of 2012 is also included in this line for the prior year. With these items in mind, we project the corporate expense line to be in the $60 million to $70 million range again for 2014.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 36.2% compared to 36.4% last year. For the year, our 34.4% rate compares to the 36.4% for the same period last year, with the improved tax rate due to the favorable impact of lower Australian tax rate applied to GPC Asia Pacific pretax earnings, as well as a favorable tax rate on the purchase accounting gain generated by the re-measurement of our 30% investment. We expect our tax rate in 2014 to approximate 36% to 36.5%.","Net income for the quarter was $150.5 million and EPS of $0.97 compared to $1.03 last year or down 6%. After considering the pension curtailment gain of $23.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 which impacted EPS by $0.10, EPS in the fourth quarter was up 4% on a comparative basis. For the full year, net income of $685 million and EPS of $4.40 are both up 6% from the prior year.","Now, we'll discuss a few key balance sheet items. Our cash at December 31 was $197 million, which is down from the approximately $400 million at December 31, 2012. Strong cash flows from the increase in our earnings and our ongoing working capital initiatives were offset by the use of cash for acquisitions and other investing activities. With that said, we're still very satisfied with our current cash position at December 31. Our accounts receivable of $1.7 billion at December 31 increased 12% from 2012 on a 13% sales increase for the quarter. So we're pleased with this level of receivables and we remain focused on our growth goal of growing receivables at a rate less than the revenue growth in the periods ahead. We're also very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.","Our inventory at the end of the year was $2.9 billion, which is up 13% from December 2012, primarily due to the GPC Asia Pacific and our other acquisitions in 2013. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our inventory is up 1% from last year. So our team continued to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels. We remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward into 2014.","Our accounts payable balance at December 31 was $2.3 billion or up 35% from December 31 last year, due to the positive impact of our extended payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors, as well as the impact of GPC Asia Pacific. Our improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital and days in payables is quite encouraging. We expect this trend to continue in the periods ahead. Our working capital of $2.0 billion at December 31 compares to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2012.","Effectively managing accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable is a high priority for our company and our ongoing efforts in these key accounts have resulted in tremendous improvement in our working capital position and cash flow, and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition as of December 31, 2013. Our total debt of $765 million at December 31, 2013 includes two $250 million term notes as well as another $265 million in borrowings under our multi-currency syndicated credit facility agreement. This adds to a modest total capitalization ratio of approximately 18.5% at December 31, 2013.","We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time and although we may choose to pay down some of our current debt under this syndicated credit facility during 2014, it's dependent on other investment opportunities that could arise. Additionally, since our last call, we have renewed our $250 million term note previously due November 30, 2013. This new 10-year note extends to 2023 at a 2.996% interest rate. This provides us more favorable terms and projected annual interest savings of approximately $4 million.","As we stated earlier, we continue to generate solid cash flows and in 2013 our cash from operations was approximately $1.1 billion, and free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends was approximately $600 million, both representing new records for us. Looking ahead, we currently expect another strong year for cash flows in 2014 with cash from operations in the $900 million to $1 billion range. And at this level of cash from operations, we would expect free cash flow to be in the $500 million range for 2014. We're pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and we remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority for the cash is the dividend which we've paid every year since going public in 1948, and we have now raised for 58 consecutive years effective with yesterday's board approval of a $2.30 per share annual dividend for 2014. This represents a 7% increase from the $2.15 per share paid in the prior year and it's approximately 52% of our 2013 earnings per share which is well within our goal of 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our four businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate, and share repurchases.","Our investment in capital expenditure was $40 million for the fourth quarter, up from $30.4 million in the prior year. Our full year capital spending totals $124.1 million, which is an increase from the $102 million in the prior year. We expect our capital expenditures to further increase in 2014 and to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million, which accounts for a full year with GPC Asia Pacific as well as the anticipated expenditures for our North American businesses. The vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in the technology area.","Our depreciation and amortization was $36 million in the quarter, up from the $25 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the year, depreciation and amortization is $134 million compared to $98 million for the same period in 2012. The increase on this line reflects the impact of GPC Asia Pacific as well as amortization expense related to Asia Pacific and Quaker City. We currently anticipate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $145 million to $155 million for the full year in 2014.","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash for us and are integral to our growth plans for the company. We continue to seek new acquisitions across our businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Since we last reported to you, the company has closed on six acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, Motion added two industrial distribution companies to their operations and EIS added one acquisition which complements their fabrication capabilities. The combined annual revenues for these three acquisitions are approximately $125 million. Thus far in 2014, we've added another three acquisitions including one each in the industrial, electrical and office businesses.","With the estimated revenues for these three acquisitions totaling approximately $235 million, we are pleased to have added these companies to our operations and we expect them to be accretive to our earnings in 2014. We will remain active in seeking new acquisitions for our businesses in 2014, generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally, in 2013, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock under the company's share repurchase program. And we have another 10.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase today. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we would expect to be active in the program again in 2014 as we believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","So, that is our financial update and in closing we want to thank all of our GPC associates for all that they do each and every day. Through their hard work we were able to set new records in several areas in 2013 and we're planning for another successful year in 2014. We look forward to updating you on our future progress when we report again.","That concludes the financial review and I'll now turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Gallagher","Thank you, Carol and Paul, for those updates and thanks also to each of you and your respective teams for the fine job that you continue to do for Genuine Parts Company.","So, that concludes our comments on 2013 and in looking back, it was an interesting year in many ways. And as you've heard, a year in which we had quite a contrast in results with automotive sales being up 18.5% and operating profit being up 19%, but non-automotive sales being down 1% and operating profit down 9%. Certainly, we'll be looking for a stronger performance from the non-automotive operations in 2014 and a bit more consistency in our results.","But in looking back, there were a number of significant achievements by the GPC team in 2013. Sales, net profit and earnings per share each reached record levels. Cash from operations and free cash flow set new records as well. We continued to see nice improvement in our working capital and working capital efficiency as well as in our return on average assets and return on invested capital. And with the action taken yesterday by the GPC board, dividends have been increased for the 58th consecutive year. We're proud of the GPC team's achievements in each of these areas and we expect continued improvements in the year ahead.","As we turn our attention to 2014, although there's still a degree of uncertainty about the strength of the recovery for a few of our businesses, we do think 2014 will be a solid year for GPC. At this time, we feel that reasonable revenue expectations for each of the segments would be, for automotive to be up 5% to 7%, industrial up 5% to 7%, office products up 1% to 3%, and electrical being up 25% to 30%. For the total GPC, that would give us an increase of 5% to 7%. And with revenue growth at this level, our guidance would be for earnings per share to be in the $4.47 to $4.57 range, which will be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis before the onetime purchase accounting gain in 2013 but up 7% to 9% on a comparative basis.","And we would point out that our sales and EPS guidance accounts for approximately 1% anticipated headwind from currency. Additionally, it would be helpful to point out that our first quarter sales will be above the full year guidance, primarily due to the inclusion of three months worth of sales from GPC Asia Pacific that were not in last year's results, but the 5% to 7% full year range is a reasonable expectation. We will look forward to updating these numbers as the year progresses.","And that will complete our prepared remarks and at this point we'd like to turn the call back over to Bridget for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Congratulations on your quarter. Two sets of questions. First of all, obviously, the weather is very topical for the automotive business and it's been a couple of years since we've had a cold winter. Can you talk about the way this tends to play out over the course of the year? I know that the impact can have some duration to it. And then I'll ask my second one as a follow-up.","Thomas Gallagher","All right, Matt, I'll try to answer that. And I would say that, obviously, the extreme temperatures tend to drive incremental growth in certain product categories like batteries and rotating electrical, I think as Paul referenced. So, we get a positive there. Part of the offset to that in the automotive business is with the number of, either our facilities that are closed or even our customers' places of business that are closed. So while we consider it to be a net positive, it's not as pronounced because of some of the loss of business due to the weather conditions.","As far as it plays out going forward, historically when we have seen significant weather situations as we've experienced in January and February of this year, we would tend to think that we will see some improved demands as we get into the warmer months for some of the front-end and chassis type products which will tend to get a bit damaged. And then if we go a little deeper into the year, if we were to have a very hot summer in parts of the country, we would probably get the benefit from some increased demand on batteries or rotating electrical that will weaken but didn't fail in the winter months. I might also add that the impact on the other GPC businesses, the non-automotive businesses, is a net negative because not only did we have a number of our facilities that had been closed but we also have quite a number of our customers' facilities that were closed. So, I hope that answers your question.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","It does very thoroughly. Thank you. And then, my second question relates to the fact that you've seen consolidation in office products, in two of your businesses really. In office products from -- involving one of your customers, and then auto parts involving one of your competitors. I know that these are topics that are on the mind, I think, of a lot of investors. Any preliminary comments from you on what you've seen play out to date in those arenas and how you might expect them to play out to date as far as that consolidation impacts Genuine Parts?","Thomas Gallagher","Well, I'll try to answer that as well and we'd start on the office products side. We did see two of the three megas come together, as you know, and they're in the midst of bringing their two fine companies under one management team. It's much too early to have any feel for what the impact might be, but I know our teams are working very, very carefully and closely with the new entity and looking for whatever the opportunities might be that present themselves.","On the automotive side, again, it's very, very early and perhaps a bit premature to offer any indication of what might happen. But we do think that as those two companies come together, we're confident they'll do a good job as they work their way through the combination and the integration. But our past experiences have been that when you put two organizations together, there's always a degree of spillage that happens despite the best of planning and the talent that is applied to the integration. So our expectation would be that, there may be a bit of spillage. We don't know how much and if there is, our folks are working hard to make sure that we're in a position to benefit from that.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Just as a final follow-up. Have you seen any franchisees on the CARQUEST side begin to drift away at this stage or is it too early to say?","Thomas Gallagher","I think it's too early to say on that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Question is more on the industrial side. As you go into the year, it seems to have turned a little bit here to the positive. I guess, what are you hearing from customers? Is the first quarter weather going to impact them or is this one more about, just kind of Industrial production we're going to see in 2014?","Thomas Gallagher","I think, Keith, clearly, those areas that had experienced significant weather situations that we've seen in January and February, they're going to be impacted if their facilities were shut down and they weren't running their equipment and weren't producing product. So we are going to see a bit of headwind from that. In terms of what we're hearing from customers in a more general sense is still a degree of caution, but a slight bit more optimism because of what we saw in the further strengthening of industrial production and capacity utilization and, frankly, as well as the ISM. If you look at the fourth quarter, for each of those indices the fourth quarter of the year was the strongest for all three. So, generally speaking, people are encouraged a bit by that, but they're also a bit cautious and trying to contain any optimism with a dose of reality.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Second question. I think I heard in the prepared comments on SG&A, you're expecting SG&A to be flat year-over-year. Were you referring to as a percentage of sales or in dollars, dollars including acquisitions? Any kind of detail there would be helpful?","Carol Yancey","It would be on a percentage of sales. What we've really found on the SG&A line is, it's primarily due to the loss of leverage with our non-automotive businesses. So as we see that top line come back, we should be able to see some improvement there. But we talked about really it being more as a percent of sales. But remember, we still have one more quarter of comparability with the GPC Asia Pacific and their hundred percent-owned store model. So, a lot of the impact in SG&A comparability is Asia Pacific but there is just a loss of leverage. So use the percent of sales as a guide.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","I wanted to follow-up on couple of those prior questions. On the industrial side, can you talk about what the organic ex-acquisition growth was in the fourth quarter? And can you talk about what changed in the business because it improved beyond just easy compares. So, what was the light switch, which businesses saw the most change at the margin in the fourth quarter?","Thomas Gallagher","What we saw ex-acquisition in the quarter was modest growth. Acquisition actually added about seven-tenths or just under 1% to the total, the 3%. And what changed, I think you saw what's happened with the GDP, at least the advanced indices and indication of a little bit more robust activity, and then the same thing would be true on the industrial production capacity utilization and the PMI, all showed a little stronger performance. So all three of those had their strongest quarters of the year in the fourth quarter. So, I think we did see a little bit of uptick in activity in the quarter, but we're hoping that that's sustainable as we work our way through the early part of this year.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","And would you think that given sort of a negative weather impact in the first week of the quarter some of that organic growth, can it hold up or does it maybe tick down just because of the weather impact?","Thomas Gallagher","Well, it's just a guesstimate on our part at this point. We know that we lost business in January and again in February because of the weather in the Industrial segment, and it's true across all of our non-automotive businesses. How much of that we can recover through the remainder of the quarter, we'll just have to wait and see. But I would say that our expectation for the year is positive and we think that we have an opportunity to have a better year in the underlying business in industrial than what we had in 2013.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","And then similarly as you think about the automotive business and the near-term impact of having major regions shut down, such as your home area there, do you think that the organic growth in the automotive, let's say company-owned comps, do you think that ticks down in the first quarter as well because of some of this weather noise?","Paul Donahue","Yes, Chris, this Paul. We could see a slight hit. I will tell you that -- and you hit on it. Our home turf down here in Georgia, the southern up through the Atlantic, last week we had stores shut down for one to two days. So, 60 to 75 stores for sure were closed down. So, yeah, that could have an impact. On the plus side, certainly the cold weather, the road conditions are going to drive business on the product side. So, where it all ends up, hard to say. We do believe though at the end of the day that we're happy to see the cold weather, for sure, we could do without the ice.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","And then on the gross margin SG&A, you'll fully anniversary GPC Asia Pacific in the first quarter here. That's going to provide some continued noise in the gross margin and SG&A. You mentioned gross margin up slightly for the year for the total company. Will gross margins see improvement outside of the first quarter?","Carol Yancey","Well, I guess, it'd be hard to say quarter-by-quarter. What we're saying on gross margin and why we think it could be up for the year and we're giving it just a little bit above the 30% is, we did have an impact of lower volume incentives in our non-automotive businesses, more so in Industrial and a little bit in office. And then also we had some of the onetime adjustments that were negative this year with the GPC Asia Pacific that we talked about in the second and third quarter. So a combination of those two things, we do feel like we should see a bit of improvement, but haven't really put it down on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Sure. And then one last question. You mentioned auto margins up in 2014, any comments on the other divisions would be helpful. Thanks very much.","Carol Yancey","Well, I think on the other divisions, again, if we can see some of the top line growth coming back, we may get some of those volume incentives back. Not sure if we'd get all of them back, and then certainly we'll be able to offset some of the loss of leverage that we've had. So it's really dependent on getting some of the top line growth back. We would hope to at least have more of a maintain perspective on those margins with some growth.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","Just wanted to follow-up on a couple of things. The trend in North America, just to make sure I got that right, Paul, in the first quarter so far it sounds like we're actually running a little bit less than we were in the fourth. Is that true or wrong?","Paul Donahue","That would be accurate, Greg.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","Okay. But obviously all the other stuff could kick in later given your historical trends?","Paul Donahue","Exactly.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","The second part was on pricing. Carol, you gave the impacts on pricing. What do you assume for 2014 in terms of inflation in each of the businesses in terms of your guidance? Do we think auto, looks like maybe it's flattening a little bit. Could we actually get some pricing power there again?","Carol Yancey","Well, we are on our second year of deflation in Automotive, and really had -- we're seeing less than normal levels of inflation in all of our businesses for 2014. We've talked to a couple of our business units and I would say it would be very little and it maybe another year like we've had this year, but we're certainly not seeing much in the way of pricing. We'd like to see it but we're just not anticipating it for 2014.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","Okay. Great. And then lastly on pensions. Was there anything with pension in the quarter? I know you called out last year's hit in the fourth quarter. Was there anything this year, and then in your guidance for this year, do you expect any pension costs or benefits?","Carol Yancey","So, we did not have any -- our pension costs for 2014 were very similar with the exclusion of the 2012 onetime gain that we've talked about. So, there was really nothing unusual in the 2013 numbers. I would tell you that our guidance for 2014 takes into account a lower pension expense given that we do have the freeze taking effect for 2014. But what we've got offsetting that is some increased cost in our 401(k) as well as some increased healthcare cost with the Affordable Care Act. So, we have factored all of that into our guidance.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","Okay. So, basically the lower pension expense offset by the other increased cost. Do you care to quantify that, just roughly?","Carol Yancey","We don't at this time.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","My question on the APd inventory and what you've picked up so far in extended terms benefits. If you looked at that, automotive where it's sort of the tradition versus some of your other non-automotive businesses, is there a big dispersion in your leverage of accounts payable? And I guess as we look at Exego in the Australian market, is that something where it's a meaningful difference in extended terms adoption down there and is there a fair amount of running room you can pick up?","Thomas Gallagher","Bret, I'll try to answer that. I think the majority of the progress that you see is attributable to the automotive segment and primarily the North American component. We do think that there is some possible improvement yet with GPC Asia Pacific. We have seen some progress and there's a bit more there. And then we continue to think about the possibilities perhaps in the non-automotive businesses. So, I think there's upside yet. I don't think we'd suggest the magnitude of the improvement that we've seen to this point but we do feel there's still some upside.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","If you were to quantify it, I guess, is it something that you see this -- are we three quarters away there or are we halfway to what we can get from an APd inventory?","Thomas Gallagher","I think we're closer to the former rather than the latter. That's about as far as we would go.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then one last question. I guess, it's quite a comp for the fourth quarter and if you looked at it, is it either a benefit of the geography of your stores, or do you see some benefit from a market share gain standpoint in that comp? How do you feel you did at that 7% growth relative to your physical markets?","Thomas Gallagher","Well, I'll take a first stab at that and Paul may want to chime in. But I would say that, certainly the stores, as Paul mentioned, basically from the plains all the way to the Northeast, saw some benefit from the weather. Conversely the stores basically from Atlanta on up to Washington did not get any benefit from the weather and actually had a little bit of impediment. But if we look at the results across the country, we were pleased with the progress we made in all of the areas and I think it's more attributable to the strength of the initiatives. Paul pointed out the strong results we had in the quarter with both major accounts in NAPA AutoCare. And that was fairly consistent across the entire country, and I think our teams are doing a good job continuing to develop those initiatives.","Paul Donahue","Brad, I'd just also add to that, as I commented, we had a good quarter on the retail side, but there's -- and Tom kind of hit on it, there's certainly nothing magical. Many of the initiatives that our team has been working very, very hard on really started to take hold. So, basic blocking and tackling is what I would attribute it to.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Two things. One, your office EBIT margins, even though they have struggled a little bit lately, still about 8%. I think they're higher than any other listed player by around 250 basis points. I'm wondering if you could just remind us why they're so much different than the peers and why that's going to stay that way, would be appreciated?","Thomas Gallagher","I don't know that I could address that question categorically. I would just say that in our case we always have been pretty efficient company in the way we operate and our team continues to do a good job in operating efficiently despite the headwinds that they faced on the revenue side. As Carol mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in all of our businesses and largely in technology initiatives, either intended to give us better information to run the business or intended to help us be more efficient in handling the business. And certainly that is true for office products as well as the other businesses.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","And historically your operating margins of your segments have clustered pretty tight to one another. If one of them were to deviate meaningfully from that bunch, would that be kind of, I don't know, something you would take seriously and kind of think about more structural activity, divestiture or anything like that?","Carol Yancey","We look for an 8% and 8.5% operating margin for all of our businesses and for the company in total. And that's really a long-term outlook. So, there's times that we'll be outside of that, but I think on balance we're looking for the 8% to 8.5% for the whole company.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Okay. Thanks. And if I could just follow-up, one more thing. You mentioned in your remarks that technology has kind of benefitted you, I think, in your warehouse and some other areas. Can you talk to us about both the advantages and maybe some of the risks that technology is bringing? Just wanted to get a little bit more detail on that topic if you don't mind?","Thomas Gallagher","Well, I think we'd rather not get into the specifics of the individual initiatives that we have underway. I think we'd rather just leave it as I said earlier, and that is, that we're looking for ways that we can have better information to manage the business or ways that we can have better capabilities in handling the business. And we continue to -- our team continues to work hard on this and they continue to find ways that we can move a bit further. The only other thing I'd add to you is that we're not a company that will go out and look for a big bank type result. So, we're not about to embark upon some technology initiative that we think could be beneficial but also could have significant downside risk. So, we go at things incrementally and we test them rather thoroughly. We prove the concept and then we move somewhat deliberately in how we roll them out in the respective businesses in order to avoid any significant downside risk.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","A couple of quick questions for you on the auto business. Just I wanted to better understand, if you had any major customers that you won in the quarter to help drive success in that business?","Paul Donahue","Seth, this is Paul. No, there was no major account activity that swung that number to the positive. Again, it was, our team just really put in some of the initiatives that we'd been working on for many quarters now into place and all came together for a good quarter.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Got you. And on the retail side of the business, you guys had a very much improved comp this quarter versus Q3. Was there anything besides the weather that drove that from your perspective?","Paul Donahue","Well, again, Seth, I'd just say that there is a number of initiatives that we've been working on, testing in some markets. And I would like to think that some of those initiatives are beginning to take hold. Our team has been working very, very hard to get our stores looking good, to get our folks trained to sell at the retail level, and it's good to finally see that coming together in Q4. The real question is can we maintain that going forward which we certainly hope to.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Are you adding incremental services to the customers that walk through the door or is it just a matter of better selling processes?","Paul Donahue","No, I would lean towards the latter there, Seth. Just really working on our training and our sales techniques but no real, again, no real change in our approach at the store level.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Got you. And then, lastly on your store count. How does that change year-over-year and what are your expectations for 2014?","Thomas Gallagher","We came on the low end of our guidance, which is to say that we'll grow our store count 1% to 2% per year and we were at the bottom end of that range for the year. And, going forward, we'd offer the same guidance and that's 1% to 2% growth.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Brent Rakers with Wunderlich Securities.","Anjali Voria - Wunderlich Securities","This is actually Anjali Voria in for Brent this morning. My first question is on the industrial side. Could you talk about the difference in OEM and MRO growth differential? And have you now reach the anniversary of the underperformance in some of the oil and gas and mining segments?","Thomas Gallagher","I'll take the second part of that question, first. We have not reached the final stage there yet but the headwind diminishes as we work our way through the early part of this year. So, we should get, from a comparative standpoint, we should get a little bit of benefit as we get into Q2 and on through the remainder of the year. In terms of the demand patterns, it was more MRO demand than it was on the original equipment demand.","Anjali Voria - Wunderlich Securities","Okay. Was there any new business or maybe sales pushed out from Q3 into Q4 for the industrial segment or--?","Thomas Gallagher","No, no there wasn't.","Anjali Voria - Wunderlich Securities","Okay. And I apologize if you've already addressed this, but on the auto segment margin side, were there any LIFO benefits or any other unusual benefits in that number?","Carol Yancey","No, there really wasn't. I mean as I mentioned, we had really deflation and it was only 10 basis -- it was 10 basis points. And there really wasn't any impact in our automotive margins. We were glad to hold those flat and there really wasn't any onetime adjustments in there.","Anjali Voria - Wunderlich Securities","Is it fair to say that the acquisition at Exego Australasia, did that help by something like 30 or 40 basis points because of the seasonality on the margins side?","Thomas Gallagher","No. No, no. It was pretty consistent.","Carol Yancey","Their margins are consistent with our margins.","Anjali Voria - Wunderlich Securities","Okay. But isn't this a seasonally stronger period for them or\u2026?","Thomas Gallagher","Well, they're into their summer months. But if we look at margin contribution across the businesses, it was fairly consistent with what we did in our automotive business.","Operator","Thank you. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments.","Carol Yancey","We want to thank you for joining us and participating in our call. And again, we apologize for the technical difficulties that we had and especially if you had, if you missed anything or you had to listen to it twice. So we apologize for that.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Sid Jones","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2020. I\u2019m here with Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today\u2019s discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.","Today\u2019s call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company\u2019s latest SEC filings, including this morning\u2019s press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Sid, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. We thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our business units. Carol will provide an update on our financial results and our outlook for 2020. After that, we will open the call up your questions.","Our financial results in 2019 reflect the positive impact of our strategic growth initiative and continued focus on improving our operating performance, maintaining a strong balance sheet, driving meaningful cash flows, and effective capital allocation.","Our strategic growth initiatives drove the third consecutive year of record sales for Genuine Parts Company with positive comp sales and the benefit of several key acquisitions across our automotive and industrial platform. Additionally, to further optimize our portfolio, we streamlined our operations with the sale of several non-core businesses, including Auto Todo in Mexico, EIS, and GCN and Canadian operations of our Business Product Group.","In 2019, we also accelerated our initiatives to improve our operating performance. Our team executed well and we were successful in increasing our gross margin rate for the fourth consecutive year.","Additionally, in accordance with our cost savings initiatives announced last October, we took action to streamline field management layers, restructured field support operations, and consolidate facilities across the organization.","We also continue to assess all areas of the business to identify and act on additional opportunities that increase efficiency and productivity as well as reducing cost. As announced on November 18th, Will Stengel join the company as EVP and Chief Transformation Officer. In his first 90 days, Will has attracted talent and created a disciplined approach to help drive improved performance in partnership with the global operating teams. Our efforts thus far primarily reflect the savings associated with company's voluntary retirement program, which we will begin to realize this quarter.","As a result of these initiatives, there were a number of one-time items recorded in the fourth quarter, which Carol will touch on shortly. We fully expect these steps to best position the company for improved profitability and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our targeted $100 million cost savings run rate by the end of 2020.","Now, turning to the result. Fourth quarter sales of $4.7 billion were up 2.2%, or nearly 7%, excluding the impact of our divestitures highlighted by approximately 3% comp sales growth and our automotive segment. The strongest growth in automotive came from our U.S. and Australasian businesses, and these two groups also posted solid operating results. In addition, we produced further gross margin improvement for the quarter, and the industrial segment reporting continued operating margin expansion.","In review of our business segment highlight, global automotive sales, which represented 59% of our total fourth quarter revenues were up 8.7% from last year, and improved from 5.3% growth in Q3. Comp sales were up 2.9%, which was a sequential acceleration from the plus 1.8% in Q3 and acquisitions, net of the Auto Todo divestiture another adjustment, added another 7.2% to sales.","In our North American operations, U.S. automotive sales were up 5.2% in the fourth quarter with comp sales up 3.3% and solid growth and operating profit. This has improved from our 2.5% comp sales increase in the third quarter, and it's on top of the 3.3% growth in the fourth quarter of 2018.","In Canada, our automotive sales were up low single digits with flat comp sales. Canada remains a large and strategic market for us, and we expect to deliver positive sales growth and market share expansion in 2020, driven by key commercial programs such as NAPA Autopro and NAPA AutoCare.","We are also confident in the ongoing strength of the North American automotive aftermarket. We expect improving car park dynamics, such as the increase in the number of vehicles in the aftermarket sweet spot, an aging fleet and reasonable gas prices to further support continued industry growth.","In the U.S., we produced another quarter of positive sales growth with both our commercial and retail customers. Likewise, sales to the commercial segment, which is nearly 80% of our total automotive sales, both in the U.S. and globally, outpaced our retail sales growth in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year.","Sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center and major account customer segments continue to drive our commercial sales growth. NAPA AutoCare is an industry leading commercial program, representing approximately 18,000 independent repair shops in the U.S., as well as another 2,000 and Canada. The major accounts group consists of national and retail customers, including fleet and government accounts, national tire centers, regional tire and repair chains, and OE dealers through our joint business planning, but these major accounts as well as expansive inventories, advanced technological offerings and best-in-class service capabilities, NAPA is well-positioned to serve these large and growing customer groups.","And this holds true across all of our automotive operations. Similar to our strategy in North America, we serve the European and Australasia and commercial markets with effective banner program for the independent installer base and comprehensive products and services required by major account customers.","Globally, our capabilities and selling to these customer segments distinguish our automotive businesses from our competition and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the years ahead.","In our retail segment, we continue to benefit from initiatives such as NAPA rewards program, now 12 million strong and growing every month. And our retail impact store project, which we are rolling out across our independently owned store based. Today, our company-owned stores and approximately 200 of our independent stores have been updated for this initiative. And we have plans for another 300 plus remodeled stores in 2020.","In addition, our retail sales reflect the favorable impact of our promotional activity in the quarter, which offset some of the early headwinds we began to see in December, related to the mild winter weather.","In Europe, we were pleased to experience improving market trend and report our second consecutive quarter of sequential progress and our comp sales performance. Overall, our sales comps were flat in the fourth quarter, which is significantly improved from the mid to high single-digit declines in Q2 and Q3.","While economic growth in the U.K. was relatively unchanged with the previous quarter, we were encouraged by stabilizing industry activity associated with higher confidence in a Brexit agreement. As a result, comp sales were much improved from the third quarter.","In addition, our battery sales in the U.K. outperformed in the fourth quarter. And we continue to gain traction with the rollout of the NAPA brand and categories such as batteries, rotating electrical, shocks and timing belt. We anticipate the continued growth of private label in this region will enhance our brand positioning and sales penetration with all of our customers.","In France, comp sales growth was basically flat with the prior year, and in line with the previous quarter, which had shown considerable improvement from the second quarter. The acquisition of the Todd group, effective 10-01-2019 also positively contributed to our total growth in the fourth quarter.","As a reminder, Todd is expected at 85 million in annual revenues and positions AAG as the market leader in the heavy duty segment across the French market. Rounding out our European operations, we reported positive sales comps in Germany, and our June acquisition of Parts points in the Netherlands, performed a plan. We enter 2020, excited for additional growth opportunities in both Germany and the Benelux region of Europe.","Looking forward, we expect improving conditions for top line growth in Europe to positively impact our comp sales, as well as leveraging our expense base. And as discussed throughout 2019, our team continues to execute on a variety of initiatives to generate additional expense savings. With these things in mind, we expect to improve Europe's profitability and operating margin in 2020 and beyond.","In Australia and New Zealand, we posted another quarter of mid single digit comp growth, with solid operating profit. And we had point out that our performance in this region was fairly consistent throughout 2019. Our finish to the year was especially encouraging, given the trend of more challenging economic conditions over the last half of 2019.","In addition, the people of Australia have experienced one of the most devastating and widespread bushfires on record across the region. We are proud of our team for their continued focus on safety and excellent customer service despite these incredibly difficult circumstances. In response to this crisis, the company was pleased to contribute to the Australian Red Cross, which has been instrumental in serving and protecting the many individuals and families in the communities we serve.","So that\u2019s a recap of the global automotive group and our fourth quarter performance. With these results, and the many growth prospects we see for this segment across our operations, we are well positioned to produce additional sales growth and operating improvement in 2020.","Turning now to our global industrial parts group, which represented 31% of our total revenues. Fourth quarter sales were $1.5 billion. Excluding EIS sales were up approximately 7% with the benefit of Inenco and Australasia and other industrial acquisitions, partially offset by a 1.2% comp sales decrease at Motion. Inenco, which we acquired in July, operated well and in line with our expectations for the quarter, as well as the first six months.","The growing pressure on our North American sales reflects the slowing trend in the industrial economy that persisted throughout the quarter and the second half of the year. For perspective, three of our 14 product categories posted positive year-over-year sales in the fourth quarter. This was down from 8 of 14 and the third quarter, while sales by industry sector held steady with Q3, with seven of 12 industry showing improvement.","These results align with our downward trend for indicators such as manufacture and industrial production and the Purchasing Managers Index. Although, the January PMI improved over 50 for the first time in five months. We remain optimistic that the industrial economy will further strengthen over the course of 2020, primarily in the second half of the year.","In summary, the industrial group produced a solid quarter and performed well all year, with operating margin improvement in each quarter, despite slower sales comps in the second half of the year. We entered 2020 with strategic plans to capitalize on our market presence in both North America, and Australasia and improve our operating results.","Now, a few comments to update you on our business products group, which accounted for 9% of total revenues. For the fourth quarter, this segment reported sales of 428 million, down 6.3% with the decrease primarily due to the continued softening demand for traditional office supplies and technology categories, competitive dynamics and lower volume with our national accounts group.","On a positive note, we delivered another quarter of increased sales for facilities and safety supplies. And this category has grown to represent 35% of total sales for this business segment. While the growth in FBS is encouraging and represents an important element of our growth strategies for the Business Product Group. We will continue to evaluate our future plans for this business, as we move forward in 2020.","With that in mind, we recently streamline this business segment with the sale of GCN, a small non-core operation in late 2019 and the sale of our Business Product Operations in Canada on January 1st of this year. So, that's a recap of our consolidated and business segment results for the fourth quarter of 2019.","Before turning over to Carol, I'd like to make a few comments on the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China. While this situation is very fluid, we thought it would be helpful to provide a few more details on our level of exposure to this -- to the impacted region.","From a topline perspective, we're not considering any sales weakness related to the outbreak as we do not have any sales exposure in China. We do however have exposure to affected areas throughout our supply chain including direct and indirect sourcing from China from North American Automotive, Australasia, and Business Products with only minimal impact in Industrial and European Automotive.","And while we are in good standing today and do not foresee any material product shortages based on the current situation, we are very aware of the potential for a worsening scenario and we remain in constant contact with our suppliers across the globe to plan for any disruption in supply should the virus continue beyond the near-term.","So, with that, I'll hand it over to Carol.","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide our full year outlook for 2020. Total GPC sales of $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter were up 2.2% from 2018 or up approximately 7% excluding the impact of divestitures. These results drove the continued improvement in gross margin up 20 basis points to 33.7% from 33.5% in 2018.","For the full year, sales of $19.4 billion increased 3.5% and our gross profit improved 55 basis points to 32.57 from 39.14 in the prior year. The improvement in gross margin for the fourth quarter and full year reflect a variety of factors including the benefit of enhanced pricing strategies and favorable product mix, as well as the favorable impact from acquisitions and divestitures.","With the continued efforts in our gross margin initiatives, we expect our 2020 gross margin rate to remain relatively in line with our full year rate for 2019. This sustains reasonable inflation of now more than 1% 2% and consistent levels of volume incentives.","In 2019, Automotive and Business Product inflation primarily reflects the impact of tariffs. And while tariffs were not affected for Industrial, this segment experienced approximately 2% price inflation.","Throughout 2019, we were successful in passing on the price increases to our customers to protect our gross margin. So, we continue to believe the current of levels of inflation has been a net positive to our results.","Specific to tariffs, their impact in the fourth quarter primarily reflects a 25% tariffs on less 133 items although Business Products was also impacted by the 15% tariff on List 4 items that was effective September 1st. As expected, tariffs were approximately 2% of sales for both U.S. Automotive and Business Products in Q4 and in the 1% to 1.5% range for the full year.","Looking ahead, tariffs would be less significant in 2020 as their effective dates will anniversary throughout the year.","Turning to our selling, administrative and other expenses. These expenses were $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 3% from last year and 26.6% of sales. The fourth quarter reflects the lowest percent increase in our SG&A in 2019. For the year, these expenses were $4.9 billion, up 7% from last year and 25.4% of sales.","So while we were encouraged by the progress and better aligning our fourth quarter expenses to sales and gross profit growth, our SG&A continues to be impacted by rising cost in several areas including payroll, freight and delivery, legal and professional, IT and cybersecurity.","In addition, we remain challenged to leverage our expenses on low single-digit sales comps. These cost pressures and the lack of leverage let us to develop our 2019 cost savings plan, which we announced last quarter and Paul covered earlier. Through these initiatives, which are well underway today, we expect to generate meaningful savings as we move forward in 2020 primarily in the areas of personnel and headcount associated with various organizational changes.","In accordance with the savings plan, the company recognized $112 million in restructuring cost in the fourth quarter that are accounted for as a component of operating expenses. These restructuring costs reflect severance and other employee cost including a voluntary retirement program, as well as facility and closure costs related to the consolidation of certain operation.","The company also recorded $43 million in special termination costs related to that retirement benefits provided to employees that expected this voluntary retirement package. These costs are presented as non-operating expenses. The combination of restructuring and special termination costs reflects the one-time expenses that were record to generate annualized savings of $100 million by the end of 2020. This is a significant return on our investment and we look forward to updating you on the positive impact of these initiatives throughout the year.","Separately in the fourth quarter, the company reported an $82 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our Business Products Group. Several factors that developed in the quarter including greater uncertainty associated with the longer term industry trend, as well as the competitive environment led us to this decision, which effectively eliminates the goodwill for this business segment.","Rounding out our operating expenses, our depreciation and amortization expense was $73 million in the fourth quarter and $270 million for the full year. Depreciation was $48 million and $173 million for the quarter and the year, respectively. And we expect this to increase to $180 million to $190 million in 2020, which is due to the increase in capital expenditures related to our ongoing growth plans for reinvesting in the company.","Intangible amortization was $25 million for the quarter and $97 million for the full year. We expect intangible amortization to increase to approximately $100 million in 2020. So, on a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $280 million to $290 million in 2020.","So now let's discuss our fourth quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 8.7% from the prior year and operating profit of $201 million was up 1% with an operating margin of 7.2% compared to 7.7% margin for the fourth quarter of the prior year. The 50 basis point decline reflects the headwinds in our European business and to a lesser extent, the Q4 results in Canada.","Our U. S. and Australasian group have solid operating margins for the quarter. As we move forward, we expect a steady sales environment and additional cost savings to support our initiatives for improved operating results in 2020.","Industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, a 6% decrease from Q4 of 2018 or up approximately 7% excluding EIS. Our operating profit of $127 million was down 3% or up 9% excluding EIS. Operating margin improved to 8.6% from 8.3% last year with the 30 basis point increase due to margin expansion in the core industrial business as well as the favorable impact of the EIS divestiture.","In Business Products, our revenues were $428 million, down 6.3% from the prior year. Their operating profit was $14 million and the operating margin declined to 3.3%. These results correlates to the decline in core sales for the quarter and further deleveraging of expenses.","Total company operating profit in the fourth quarter $342 million and our operating profit margin was 7.3% compared to 7.7% last year. We had net interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter and for 2019 net interest was $91 million, which is down slightly from 2018. In 2020, we expect net interest of $86 million to $88 million, reflecting lower interest rate and lower debt levels.","The corporate expense line was $36 million in the fourth quarter, down from $41 million in 2018. For the year, this was $138 million, which was flat with the prior year. We expect our corporate expenses to be within the $140 million to $150 million range for 2020.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.5%, a slight decrease from the 26.6% rate in the prior year. Excluding one-time restructuring cost, our adjusted rate of 24.2% was improved from the 26.9% in 2018, due primarily to geographical income mix shift. For the year, our effective tax rate was 25.2% or on an adjusted basis 24.5%. And we are planning for our full year tax rate of approximately 24% to 26% for 2020.","Our net income in the fourth quarter was $9 million and our EPS was $0.06, while our adjusted net income was $197 million or $1.35 per share. Net income for the full year was $621 million or $4.24 per share and adjusted net income was $833 million or $5.69 per share.","So now let's turn to the balance sheet, which remains strong in an excellent condition. We continue to closely manage our accounts receivable, our inventory and our accounts payable to improve our working capital position. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables and the progress our team is making to enhance our supply chain, which has positively impacted our inventory investment in our gross margin trends.","At December 31, our AP to inventory ratio is 107% and our total working capital, represents just 8% of revenues. Our total debt of $3.4 billion at December 31 is unchanged from September 30 and up from the $3.1 billion in 2018.","At December 31, our average interest rate on all our outstanding debt is 2.2%, which is improved from the 2.7% at December 31 last year. With a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.34 times, we remain comfortable with our current debt structure and we have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our future growth initiatives and our ongoing priorities for effective capital allocation.","In 2019, we generated another year of solid cash flows with approximately $900 million in cash from operations. We expect another solid year in 2020 and we're currently projecting $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion in cash from operations, with free cash flow after the dividend in the $300 million to $350 million range.","Strong cash flows continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our key priorities for cash remain reinvestment in this businesses, strategic acquisition, dividend and share repurchases.","We invested $298 million in capital expenditures in 2019, which was up from $232 million in 2018. This increase reflects our growing operations and the incremental spend in areas such as technology and other productivity enhancing investments in our facilities.","For 2020, we have plans for continued investment in our businesses and we expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million for the full year. Acquisitions remain an important component of our growth strategy.","And in 2019 we used approximately $700 million in cash, commercially funded by the proceeds from divestitures, to acquire new businesses and expand our global footprint. In 2020, we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisition in the automotive and industrial segments. Although, these future acquisitions have not been considered in our guidance for the year.","Turning to the dividend. Earlier this week our Board approved a $3.16 per share annual dividend for 2020, which marks our 64th consecutive annual increase in the dividend paid to shareholders. This represents a 4% increase from the $3.05 per share paid in 2019 and it's approximately 56% of our 2019 adjusted earnings per share, which is in line with our targeted payout ratio.","Finally, as part of our share repurchase program we purchased approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock in 2019 and today we have 15.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We expect to be active in the program again in 2020 and over the long-term, we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividends serves to maximize the return for shareholders.","So, now, let's discuss our outlook for 2020. In arriving at our 2020 full year guidance, we considered our performance in 2019 as well as the recent trends and our current growth plans and strategic initiatives. In addition, we take into account the current market conditions than what we anticipate for the foreseeable future in each of our business segment and the geographies that we operate.","With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2020 to be in the range to -- of flat to up 1% or plus 3% to plus 4% excluding the impact of the EIS and SPR divestiture. As mentioned earlier, this guidance excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisition. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 5% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, which includes plus 2% to plus 3% comp sales growth. A sales decrease of minus 6% to minus 7% for the Industrial segment or plus 2% to plus 3% excluding the impact of EIS. This reflects a decrease in comp sales of approximately 1.5% to 2%. For the Business Product segment, down 4% to down 5% total sales decline or down 1% to down 2% excluding divestitures.","On the earnings side, we currently expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.80 to $5.90. This represents a 2% to 4% increase over our adjusted earnings per share in 2019 or a 5% to 7% increase excluding the earnings related to the divestiture of EIS.","With this guidance, we move forward into 2020 confident that the management teams have the strategic plans and initiatives in place to meet or exceed these targeted results. We are excited by the cost savings potentials we've identified and encouraged that our transformation office is also focused on identifying additional opportunities for us. In addition, we believe that the underlying fundamentals of our broad and growing business platform will continue to provide us with sustained long-term growth opportunities.","So, that's our financial report for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 as well as our outlook for 2020. We were pleased to finish the year with solid results and we look forward to reporting more progress in the coming quarters. I'll turn it back over to Paul.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Carol. We're pleased to perform at the high end of our expectations in the fourth quarter and finished the year with solid results. Allow me to recap the few highlights. We achieved another quarter of positive total sales growth, driven by a 3% plus from sales growth in our U.S. Automotive business, which represents our best comp in five years. So, congratulations go out to our U.S. NAPA team.","We further improve the gross margin by 20 basis points in the quarter and by more than 60 basis points for the full year, our fourth consecutive year of improved gross margins. We experienced improving market trends in Europe and reported significantly improved sales comps relative to the second and third quarters.","Our Industrial business continue to operate well, generating a 30 basis points improvement in operating margins. We streamlined our operations with the successful divestiture of several non-core business segments. We took action on our initiatives to achieve $100 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2020.","And effective this week, our Board of Directors approved of 64th conservative increase in the dividend, up 4% from 2019. So, as you can see our team has been busy executing on our growth strategy as well as several initiatives to improve our operating results. Combined, these efforts have served to further optimize our portfolio and we expect to continue our strategic transformation in 2020.","GPC enters a new year with strategic plans and initiative to drive sales and profit ability, working capital improvement, and significant value for all of our stakeholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress towards these objectives as we move through the year.","So, thank you for listening. And with that, we'll turn back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good morning everybody.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Horvers","So wanted to start with the comp acceleration in U.S. NAPA, which is impressive in light of what we've seen from your peers with generally seeing deceleration. Can you talk about where you saw that? Maybe break that down between DIY and do-it-for-me? You did mention promotional effectiveness in December around the weather that would seem to me like that's more of a DIY versus commercial benefit. But sure -- wanted to get your thoughts there? And any comment in terms of was there any incremental inflation benefit that you kept in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter?","Paul Donahue","Well. Okay, Chris thanks for the question. I I'll do my best to cover all this point and maybe have Carol weigh in on a bit of an inflation discussion. You know, you mentioned commercial versus retail, our commercial business was solid. Our two big programs, Major Accounts, AutoCare both were inline with our overall commercial sales in the quarter, which was up significantly over 2018. So we're pleased with our commercial business and our retail business was solid as well.","You mentioned the promotional activities Chris, so we had set out really to focus on all three of our big sales channels, retail, commercial as well as online. And I think that some of the initiatives that we put into play maybe be offset the impact of some of the mild camps we saw hit the business in December -- October, November still -- the weather was still fairly favorable. December and January, obviously, have done a good bit. Warmer they're taking a bit of a toll on some of our more seasonal categories. But our hard parts business remains solid and we're pleased with the performance of our U.S. automotive business in the quarter.","Carol Yancey","And just a comment on the tariff impact for automotive business in the quarter. It was as expected about 2% related to tariffs. And so the second half being at 2%, first half at 1% gave us a blended 1.5% for 2019. And then just as a reminder as we go into 2020, we'll anniversary some of that. So we're looking for maybe a first half of 1% and a blended half a point for the full year. And that excludes any further inflation.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. I'm not sure of -- again maybe as you think about relative to the third quarter you saw acceleration clearly in both sides of the business really impressive. But did you see more in DIY? Or did you see more in commercial? Any insights there?","Paul Donahue","Certainly I would say our commercial outperformed our retail, Chris even though both were solid. And we continue to rollout our impact store initiatives to now we're \u2013 now working closely with our independent owners. But commercial both AutoCare and Major Accounts have performed well. You haven't asked about originality Chris, but I'll touch on it as I'm sure some will ask the \u2013 we saw really strong growth up in the north, certainly in the central part of the United States, Midwest. Our Mountain team had a really solid quarter. Where we saw some of the softness was out west, as well as in the Northeast part of the U.S.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. And then as you think about 2020, you gave guidance for the overall automotive division. How are you thinking about the U.S. NAPA business? And any comments on how the weather is impacted your business quarter-to-date and how it could \u2013 how that could sort of way on the year overall?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Well, Chris, as it relates to the weather just to make a comment that we\u2019ve got a fairly diversified business model and really if you start to break our business apart only about 30% of our total revenues would really be susceptible to U.S. weather patterns. The industrial business, the Business Products Group, Europe, Australia, look we track weather we track weather around the world.","I'm looking at floods in the U. K. and mild winter in Europe, record heat in Australia. So we look at whether around the world. And honestly, I tend not to dwell on it that much anymore since there's not a heck of a lot we can do about it. We're six weeks into the New Year, Chris. We'll see some ebbs and flows throughout the year. But I would tell you as we sit right now, we're confident in our full year guidance for automotive.","Carol Yancey","And Chris, we are implying a comp increase for our U.S. business in 2020 of around 2% to 3%, which is very consistent with what we saw for 2019. And that's what we've modeled into our guidance.","Christopher Horvers","Got you. And one last one. I'm not sure if you have this but Carol, do you \u2013 can you help us out with, so there's a lot going on with acquisitions and divestitures sizable ones. Can you just help us, as we think about 2020 versus what you just reported for 2019, what's the net impact at the operating profit and operating margin line from the mixture of everything that's going on? I'm not sure, if you have that but clearly I think you got some rate benefit but maybe some profit dollar loss. So help us reconcile that. Thanks so much.","Carol Yancey","Yes. That for 2019, the core business if you will was without the impact of the acquisitions and divestitures was something around at $0.20 is what was factored in there.","Christopher Horvers","$0.20 headwind?","Carol Yancey","You're talking about 2019 Or 2020?","Christopher Horvers","2020 versus 2019?","Carol Yancey","I'm sorry. I was \u2013 for 2020 \u2013 and that's \u2013 I'm sorry for that. But for 2020, we have implied, we will have operating margin improvement in our automotive and industrial businesses. And we have implied a 20 basis points improvement in our operating margin that largely relates to the cost reductions that we talked about and the work that the transformation office is doing. And that would be what would be in our numbers for 2020 and it would obviously be greater than that going into 2021. So that excludes all the impact from acquisitions and divestitures.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. Thanks so much. Best of luck.","Paul Donahue","Thanks. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of the Liz Suzuki of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Liz Suzuki","Great. Thank you. First, I just wanted to ask about capital allocation priorities in 2020. I know you laid out the four bucket there. But it seems like you're kind of taking down the debt levels a little bit despite very low interest rates. So I was curious, if a large acquisition opportunity came up that would be in the auto or the industrial business, where you might have to lever up a little bit to do it. Do you have a threshold to which you would aim to keep that leverage?","Carol Yancey","Yeah. That's a great question. As you know, we have certainly taken our leverage up and we're definitely comfortable in the 2.5 to 3 times indefinitely for the right acquisition opportunity. That is something that -- when we think about a larger more strategic acquisition opportunity, those are things that you can always control. The timing, there's nothing in the horizon right now.","We'll continue with our bolt-ons which are probably in the 1% to 2% range, as we look ahead. So we think the leverage that we have right now comfortable with that we know we have flexibility as we look ahead. And we would again just take into account what we already have coming into our numbers for 2020. We have a carryover impact to this is pretty nice -- on acquisition. So probably more of just the bolt-ons just for 2020.","Liz Suzuki","Great. Thank you. And I'll just take on one more if you wouldn't mind. Did you guys -- I may have missed this and did you talk about transaction growth versus average ticket in the U.S. auto business? And how that's been trending versus the last couple of quarters?","Paul Donahue","No, Liz. I did not cover that. But it's a similar trend as we'd seen over the last few quarters, which is, nice growth in Q4 in our invoice in the size of our invoices. So nice mid-single-digit growth with a slight decrease in the number of invoices per store per day.","Liz Suzuki","Great. Thank you.","Paul Donahue","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Matt McClintock of Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.","Matt McClintock","Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone.","Paul Donahue","Good morning.","Matt McClintock","I was wondering, you bought up the impact project and you have now done that in 200 independents. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color or update us on what you saw in those independents in terms of lift, et cetera, in 2019. And then how quickly can you accelerate that, the adoption of new independents, should you decide that this is where from -- were of continued efforts. Thanks.","Paul Donahue","Great question, Matt. This has been a multi-year project for us. We're at -- between the last couple of years we've done over a couple of hundred of our independent stores. And it's a comprehensive upgrade. It's everything from extending store hours; improving the retail storefront, changing out some of the product assortment.","Probably one of the most important aspects of the program is adding business development managers in the stores as well. So we're expecting to ramp this project up in 2020. And actually looking for 300-plus stores in 2020, on the independent side. We fully completed and rolled out our company-owned store group and we are seeing some significant increases over our typical run rate when we do the full impact program.","Matt McClintock","Okay. Thanks for that color. And then if I could have one more. Just on coronavirus, understand that for the Industrial business probably limited impact of new supply chain. But I suspect there's probably potential meaningful impact on your customer supply chains and that could lead to less activity.","Just wondering I know this is a tough question to ask, but you're probably at a better position to give us color or help us to conceptualize how the impact on your customers' supply chains will actually flow through to your own topline? Any color there at all would be helpful from a derivative standpoint or a secondary standpoint. Thanks.","Paul Donahue","Yes. Matt look it is -- as you know and it is a tough question because it's an incredibly fluid situation. We've been on the phone only with all of our business unit heads talking about not really our own supply chain which I covered in my prepared comments, but also some of our good customers as well. I would tell you it's early. We have not felt any downward pressure on our numbers from our customers at this point, but I would tell you that we are staying incredibly close to it and will continue to monitor the situation.","Matt McClintock","Thanks for that color. I know it's hard, appreciate it.","Paul Donahue","Yes. All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your questions.","Daniel Imbro","Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking our questions.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Daniel Imbro","Paul would love to hear your update on the European market. I think you noted a growth return of relatively flat year-over-year. Pretty nice sequential proven. Can you talk about what the primary drivers of that will maybe industry versus company specific and kind of how you're thinking about that growth as we head into 2020?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Thanks Daniel. We're quite pleased with the progress we've made with our European business. We had no doubt a tough Q2 and Q3 in Europe. What's interesting as you dive into those numbers, they're different markets. So, Q2, our French team and a challenging quarter; Q3, our U.K team had a challenging quarter. Both rebounded nicely in Q4 to get us to flat overall comp.","Germany on the other hand showed growth in Q4, which certainly we were pleased to see. I would tell you that from our perspective, our team in 2018 and in the first half of 2019, they were very focused on integrating this business and doing all the things necessary to bring a privately-held European business under the umbrella of the U.S. publicly-traded company.","I would tell you that that focus now has shifted in the second half of 2019 and as you going to 2020 more on growing this business, taking market share, and doing other things that this business has been for the past 30 years. So, despite some remaining complicated economic issues and some of those markets, we are certainly more bullish going into 2020 just because our team is focused on all the right things and focused on driving market share and growing our business.","Daniel Imbro","Got it. And as a follow-up on that. It sounds like looking for more growth over there, that should I would think lead the margin leverage given the weaken sales led to deleverage last year. But Carol I think your answer just said most of the auto expansion should come from cost-cutting. So, how do I reconcile maybe those two statements? And what kind of impacts should be expected Europe to have on the automotive operating margin in 2020?","Carol Yancey","Yeah. So for our automotive business and as Paul mentioned, their comps were down something around 3% for the full year, and in the fourth quarter about 40 bps of the 50 bp decline in our automotive margin was Europe and then other smaller impact was due to the slowdown in Canada in Q4.","When you look at the full year, we would say that all of the decrease in the automotive margin was Europe, so stronger margin, obviously, in our U.S. business and Australasia business. So when we look ahead and remember that team started on their cost cutting in Q2 and they have been working very hard. And we actually saw some progress on -- in the second half of the year and we're certainly seeing further improvement that will come in 2020.","We're modeling the comps of up 1% to up 2% for Europe in 2020. And with all the cost reductions that they've done and the further changes they made at the end of the year that gives them a flattish margin in 2020 and certainly as we look ahead, we would see that to be improved in 2021 and beyond.","Daniel Imbro","Got it. And then maybe my last follow-up. Carol, just switching to the industrial site. I think you said the outlook calls for 2% or 3% growth, which includes slightly positive comps. One, did I hear that correctly? And two, what do you think the cadence of that growth should look like given -- you noted the recent infection higher in PMI and some of the leading indicators? Thanks.","Carol Yancey","Yeah. So the 2% to 3% for the industrial outlook for 2020 and I would tell you, you have to remember to take into account that excludes the EIS amount. So the 2% to 3% implies something of 1.5% to down 2% comp. And I would tell you that that is primarily our Motion, North American business, probably more so in the first half, a little weaker, hopefully a little bit better in the second half. Our Australasian business and Inenco, they have comps of around up 2% in 2020. So we've implied something of a 1.5% to down 2% for 2020.","Having said that, again with the cost reductions and the work that the transmission team is doing and the work that that business has done all-in 2019, they will have some operating margin improvement in 2020 despite having comps down 1.5% to 2%. So the team's done a great job in that area as we look ahead.","Daniel Imbro","Got it. Best of luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Bret Jordan","Hi, good morning guys.","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan","Carol, I might have missed this, but did you talk about how you've done on the payable side on the AAG business?","Carol Yancey","We have not. And it's a great question Bret. We -- while you didn't necessarily see the impact directly in our Q4 working capital. I would tell you with the introduction of the private label and some of the works that our global procurement teams have done, they were able to achieve about $50 million in working capital improvements in 2019, and then we look ahead in 2020, we think we'll have another $50 million. And those are even greater than just Europe because we\u2019re getting some global savings, global working capital savings as well.","And then on the other side, we are definitely on track and we will have our $25 million of procurement gross margin synergies by the end of 2020. And we were right on track with that as well. And that does not take into account the implied income statement benefit on these payable terms. So we've implied that in our 2020 working capital guidance to see that $100 million-plus coming into 2020.","Bret Jordan","Okay. Great. And then I guess, when you look at Europe, what is the private label mix over there? And I think Paul called out some real strength in the U.K. battery business in the fourth quarter. I think they have had a mild winter. Are you guys doing something differently there on the promotional side or market share shifts that you're seeing?","Paul Donahue","Well, to your first question Bret, the private label market in Europe is minimal. And AAG, our business there, they had a number of different private labels in different product categories. But it was certainly not an impactful part of their overall product mix. We have launched the NAPA brand now and in a few categories in the U. K, we're in the process of rolling that into Germany \u2013 I mean, into France and ultimately into the Netherlands.","We're quite pleased with the acceptance we\u2019re seeing from our customers and you know, we have a separate battery business in the U.K. Bret that we acquired 12 to 18 months ago, called Platinum. And it is a strong player in the U.K. in the battery business. So it's a part of AAG, but that would account for some of the strength that we\u2019re seeing in and again, they've gotten behind the NAPA logo and the NAPA brand and are doing quite well. So we're pleased. And our goal will be to roll that NAPA brand across Europe.","Bret Jordan","Okay. So the U. K. strength is more your strategy in the U.K. and not the category in the U.K.? ","Paul Donahue","Correct. That would be accurate.","Bret Jordan","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next quarter comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Seth.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Seth Basham","My question just reverting to the U.S. NAPA business. Can you give a sense of cadence for the comps through the quarter? And how your thinking about that cadence of comps through 2020? That would be helpful.","Paul Donahue","Yes. The cadence for the quarter Seth, if I look at GPC in total automotive, we're pretty steady throughout the quarter with actually November and December, slightly stronger than October. Automotive trended positive, U.S. automotive trended positive really every month with a solid December, probably unlike some of the other reports that we've heard but we did find in December, and again I think part of that goes back to some of the initiatives that our team launched in the quarter. I mean in the month and in the quarter.","As I look across 2020, hard to say Seth, we again I mentioned earlier, we're we only six weeks into the year. We're going to see ebbs and flows as we go. But one thing we are encouraged is we're seeing some really cold weather hit the Midwest this week and looks like some big snow up in the Northeast. So that will blow out a lot of the inventory that's sitting in our customers shelves and hopefully propel us into a better spring.","Seth Basham","Got it. Thank you. And then as a follow-up question. You guys have been doing a great job on gross margins with improvement for the past four years. You talk to a flattish gross margins in 2020. Can you just help us understand why we're likely to see a slowdown in that progress?","Carol Yancey","Yes. I would say that our team has done a great job, especially in the tariff environment and really pleased to see it across the automotive and industrial businesses. A lot of our pricing strategies and a lot of our supply chain initiatives we're doing, we believe there still is some opportunities for that to increase.","We're just sort of modeling flattish and maybe a bit of improvement. Now, remember, some of the improvement this year is related to the net improvement from acquisitions and also, honestly, acquisitions and divestitures. So some of it is coming from that, which we would anniversary that next year.","Seth Basham","Understood. Thank you very much and good luck.","Paul Donahue","Thanks, Seth. ","Carol Yancey","Thanks.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hey, guys. It's Scot Ciccarelli. So a question on kind of the 2020 guidance. I guess, I'm trying to understand your expectations for, let's call it, core margins in auto and industrial versus what's the impact from cost-reduction action? So like, if you were to kind of take a step back, would you expect kind of core auto and industrial to have flat core margins?","And the 20 basis point lift for the full year comes from layering in those cost efforts? Or are you expecting some deterioration because of the low top line growth? But it's more than made up for the cost reductions. I think that will help everyone understand kind of the cadence for both 2020 and then how these trends may roll through into 2021? Thanks.","Carol Yancey","Yes. So as we mentioned, when you look at our automotive and industrial business, we are implying operating margin improvement there. That is coming from - the majority of that is coming from improvements in their cost savings. So you would say, without the cost savings it would've been more like flat.","I would tell you, what we're really pleased to see is, especially like in the automotive business, for example, with comps of 2% to 3%, we're able to leverage and improve operating margin for the first time in a couple of years. So, again, this cost reduction and the transformation that we're talking about is giving us something better than a flattish margin with some of these low comps.","And remember, the industrial businesses got a comp of down 1.5% to down 2%. And yet, they will, as well, have operating margin improvement. What you - and this gets back to the gross margin thing, you're going to see that more in the SG&A line. And that's why we've kind of implied a flattish gross margin with our improvement coming through SG&A.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. That's very helpful. And so, as you kind of think about the amount of cost savings that flow through - that you actually capture in 2020, because it's a run rate by the end of 2020 that gets you to $100 million. You're capturing, what, about half, kind of $40 million to $45 million, would be my estimate?","Carol Yancey","Yes. That's reasonable. The $100 million in saving is about 2% decrease in our SG&A. So we're modeling about half of that in our AG&A, about a 1% decrease. And so, then again, as you look ahead in 2021 we would have the full benefit of that.","And the other thing I'd mention, our transformation office and transmission team, they're hard at identifying other opportunities. So we're not just stopping with this first lift, if you will, of the $100 million. They've got a pretty exciting packet with all of our businesses and a team that's working on a lot of new initiatives that we hope to be able to speak about in the quarters ahead.","Scot Ciccarelli","Yes. All makes sense. Thanks a lot guys.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Scot.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to follow up on Scott's question for a bit. So that $40 million to $45 million that you're anticipating for 2020, what is like the cadence of that? Seems like you've taken a lot of non-GAAP cost in Q4 which I think would mean the cost of taking out of this point. But wanted to get a sense of cadence of how we see the cost takeouts planning throughout the year?","Carol Yancey","Yes. I mean I guess it would be -- we did -- you're right -- and remember a majority of these first round of the $100 million, the majority of that is headcount because as you know 60%, 65% of our SG&A is headcount. So, with the payroll -- we did recognize those costs in Q4, the payroll start to -- you start to see that into Q1, but you definitely some of the other things will come a little bit later in the year. So, that's why we have some of the initiatives that come maybe in Q2 through Q4. So, it's not exactly divided by four quarters. But again as we've got some facilities, some consolidation amongst branches and operations those would come later in the year.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. Okay. And then more of a longer term question, as you have the dependence on making it a necessary store-up on investments to position their businesses to the future. Have you been to kind of rethink your long-term store potential? Do you still expect the majority of your stores will be independently owned versus company-owned or do you foresee the opportunity for some of these conversations to precipitate like higher store ownership of the company?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Interesting question Chris. We -- look we're always evaluating our store models and store mix. Today of our 6,000 stores, roughly 5,000 are independently owned. We've had that mix for a number of years. We do not see any massive shift here in the quarters or even a year or two to come.","We've got some great independent owners who are investing in their business, expanding their business. We have owners coming into our model all the time and so at this rate -- at this point in time, Chris, there is no strategy to shift to a 50\/50 mix per se of independent and company stores. We're pleased with the progress. We're pleased with some of the new talent that will bring into our independent store group.","I would also tell you that it is our intent to expand our company store group and to continue to open new company-owned stores and if you look at our recent history, Chris, we've closed a number of underperforming and non-profitable stores. We think a good bit of that heavy lifting while there is always some of that to be done, a good bit of that is now behind us and it's our intent to grow our company-owned store base from here going forward.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. That's really helpful. Thank you for the time.","Paul Donahue","All right. Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back quarter management for any closing marks.","Carol Yancey","We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's year end conference call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Sidney G. Jones - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company second quarter 2016 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We'll begin this morning with comments from our Chairman, Tom Gallagher. Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman","Thank you, Sid, and let me add my welcome to all of you on the call this morning. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us. I would start by saying that I've anticipated this call with somewhat mixed emotions. On the one hand, I've been on every one of our calls since we started doing them in February of 2001, so today is my 63rd call, but it's also my last. As you know, Paul Donahue, he was named Chief Executive Officer on May 1, and Paul is only the fifth Chief Executive in our 88-year history, certainly indicative of the management's stability within our organization. I will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board, and as such, I will remain active around GPC. But going forward, Paul and Carol will be doing all of the work on these quarterly calls.","And I just couldn't feel any better or more positive about the future of our company with Paul as our President, Chief Executive Officer; and Carol as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer leading the way. These are two very talented and capable executives, and they are highly regarded both inside our organization and externally as well. And they will do a fine job in leading our company and creating shareholder value in the years ahead. With that said, I want to thank each of you on the call for your past and ongoing support of Genuine Parts Company, and I'll turn the call over to Paul.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Tom. I appreciate the kind remarks and the ongoing support. I'm both honored and humbled to follow you as CEO of this great company. You've had an admirable 46-year career at GPC, and the performance of the Company under your leadership for the last 12 years has been impressive. That said, working closely with you for the last nine years has been invaluable. And I feel well prepared for this new role, and importantly, the compensation of our management team remains in place to build upon our performance. So thank you, and I look forward to working with you in your role as the Chairman.","GPC has a long and rich 88-year history of steady, consistent growth and sound financial, and has been an effective steward of capital. Under my leadership, we intend to build on these achievements over the many years to come. In my first 75 days as CEO, I've taken considerable time to visit with our operations, both around the globe and across our business segment. And I'm more encouraged than ever about the good work being done and the growth opportunities available in each of our businesses.","As this quarter would indicate, we have our share of challenges to overcome, but I also believe we can reinvigorate our sales growth in the coming quarters. This is our most critical near-term objective, and I'm committed to making this happen. We will provide more details later on the call to this point. Now, turning to our second quarter, I'll make a few remarks on our overall result, and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions.","A quick recap of our second quarter results shows, sales for the quarter were $3.9 billion, which was down 1%. Net income was $191.4 million, down 2%. And earnings per share were $1.28 in line with the second quarter of last year. Total sales in the quarter included a 2% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you'll hear more on our acquisition activity as we review our business results. Currency exchange was still a headwind to our overall results with the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and Mexican currencies impacting our results by approximately 1% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in EPS.","Turning to our Automotive operations, for the quarter ended June 30, our global Automotive sales were down 0.7%, and included approximate 2% benefit from acquisitions, offset by currency headwind of approximately 1.5%. Our U.S. results were down 2% in the quarter which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter, and primarily due to the softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring. While we are not pleased with this deceleration, we would point out that our second quarter sales in 2012, the last year we had similar mild winter patterns, we were also down 600 basis points from the first quarter. So we have seen this pattern before and would expect to see a more normalized growth within the next few quarters as the impact of weather plays out and we execute on our growth initiatives.","Our U.S. results varies widely by geographical region with our better performing markets in the Western, Southern and mountain regions of the country. The Central, Eastern, and Southwest regions of the country all underperformed. Again, we would attribute the soft results in the Central and Eastern regions till the mild winter temperatures, and this is evident in the failed transfer of weather-related goods such as batteries, heating and cooling, and ride control products, which were weak through most of the second quarter. We are pleased to report however that our batteries and air conditioning sales recovered significantly with the hot June temperatures, with both up double-digits.","In the Southwest, we remain challenged by the ongoing negative impact of the oil and gas sector on fleet and general installer (06:38) business. Same-store sales for our U.S. company-owned store group were flat in the second quarter, and this compares to a 3.6% increase in the first quarter. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post a low single-digit increase in April, likely bolstered by the shift in the timing of Easter, followed by a low to mid single-digit decline in May, and flat results in June. So a mixed cadence with the month of May being our most challenging month.","Taking a deeper look into our same-store sales for the quarter, our commercial wholesale side of the business slightly outperformed the retail, DIY business, driving the overall flat same-store sales results. Despite the ongoing DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group, fairly weak market conditions resulted in a slight sales decrease for our company-owned retail sales. We believe however that the current market conditions will prove to be short-lived, and we remain confident in the long-term positive benefits of our retail initiatives. As a reminder, these broad initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates, and the nationwide launch of our NAPA Rewards program to name just a few.","Furthermore, we continue to expand on our retail impact initiative, which was initially piloted at 20 stores in 2015, with plans to implement this concept in 150 company-owned stores in 2016. We are encouraged by the positive impact of these initiatives at our updated stores, with early results exceeding our expectations on both the retail and commercial sides of the business. For the second quarter, our retail transaction counts were down low single-digit, while our average basket size was up low single-digit.","Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business, this segment of our Automotive business was basically flat in the second quarter, which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center (8:47) around our major accounts business, and our NAPA AutoCare Centers, and the results for these key customer groups are good measures for the weak market conditions we encountered this quarter.","On the major accounts front, sales were down low single-digits, which we believe reflects the challenging sales environment these customers are seeing. Sales to our AutoCare Centers were up low-single digits, driven by the ongoing increase in memberships, now totaling over 16,400 members strong. As an additional point of reference, our fleet business was off slightly for the quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was down slightly with no benefit from inflation, and we are flat in the average number of tickets.","Turning now to our import parts business in the U.S., we continue to be encouraged by the strong underlying growth for this business. And with the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business acquired this past February. We have positive momentum in this category as we enter in the second half of the year. We continue to make solid progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we are excited about the growth prospects for our import parts business overall. Given the positive attributes of this product offering, we closed on another import parts acquisition in Canada on July 1, which we'll cover a little bit later in the call.","Also on the acquisition front, we are pleased to report that we closed on an Atlanta-based heavy-duty truck parts business on May 1. Global Parts operates six branches in three states, and with the expected annual revenues of approximately $20 million, it serves as a nice complement to our growing business in the heavy-duty segment of the U.S. automotive aftermarket. Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket, the fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gain.","After strong growth of 3.5% in 2015, miles driven increased 2.6% in April, the most recent data available, and is up 3.7% year-to-date. April marks 26th consecutive month of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.35 in the second quarter, well below last year, and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. Before closing out our Automotive review, we want to update you on our international businesses which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, our core Automotive business is performing well, and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs acquisition and its 21 branches in Western Australia.","Likewise, we are excited by the June 1 acquisition of AMX, a Melbourne-based retailer of aftermarket, motorcycle accessories and parts, with four stores and approximate annual revenues of $12 million. Our team in Australia has a multi-year growth plan for this business, which further expands our growing product offering in the motorcycle category. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has now grown to 527 locations, resulting in net new store growth of nearly 100 locations over the past three years. At NAPA Canada, we continue to produce low to mid single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada, and of course the devastating wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta back in May.","On July 1, we closed on the acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of original equipment import parts in Canada. Auto-Camping, with 20 locations across Canada, specializes in original equipment automotive parts for the European vehicles, and they sell to foreign repair specialists as well as original equipment dealers. This business should generate approximately $50 million in annual revenues, and much like the Olympus acquisition in the U.S., complements our existing product offering and distribution capabilities for import parts in Canada. Finally, in Mexico, our sales growth continued to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We have 21 NAPA stores in Mexico today, and have plans for additional store growth in the future. We are encouraged by the long-term growth prospects we see for NAPA in Mexico.","So in summary, the second quarter proved challenging for our U.S. Automotive business, although this was partially offset by the ongoing strength of our international operation. We believe the weakness in our U.S. sales relates to the impact of mild winter and early spring, and we expect to improve on this quarter's performance as we move ahead. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and major accounts, executing our retail strategy, and driving global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions.","Let's turn now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter, down approximately 2% which compares to a 2.5% increase in the first quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions and currency, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 3%, basically unchanged from their adjusted sales decrease in the first quarter. So for the second quarter overall, our Industrial business seems to have stabilized, which is consistent with the industrial indicators we tend to follow such as the industrial production and capacity utilization.","With that said, a quick review of our business by industry segment, by top customers, and by top product category shows that the markets remain uneven and choppy. Among our top 12 industry segments, three generated sales increases, seven were down, and two were essentially flat. Looking at our top 20 customers, 15 of them increased sales, while five were down consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. And among our top 12 product categories, we saw six that increased and six that were down, also consistent with the first quarter.","So the takeaway here is that our results were quite mixed among our customers and product lines, with solid results in a number of areas, being offset by weaker results and others. We have been operating in this type of difficult and choppy environment since the first quarter of 2015, and as mentioned before, believe we are seeing at least some early signs of a stabilized and industrial economy. This would certainly bode well for a stronger cycle ahead.","Shifting to the third quarter and the balance of the year, we will be executing on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth. We remain active with strategic bolt-on acquisitions for this business, and expect to close on a few of these over the balance of the year. We can tell you that effective August 1, we will close on ATCO (16:18), a regional industrial safety product distributor, with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million.","Moving on now to our Electrical business, EIS, Sales for this group were down 5%, and remaining challenged by many of the same factors that impacted our Industrial business. Things such as the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower copper pricing again in the quarter which cost us 1% of sales growth, the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers, and just the overall sluggish economic climate. We're expecting to see these factors carry over to some degree for the balance of the year, but it's interesting to look at the individual performance of the three segments that comprised EIS.","The Electrical segment is our largest, representing 40% of this group's revenues and sales were down low double-digits. Fabrication was down low single-digits and our wiring and cable business was up low single-digits with each representing another 30% of the EIS business.","But certainly, there is room for improvement across the EIS segment and our greatest sales challenges are primarily concentrated in the electrical portion of the business. Looking ahead, our team is executing on its initiative to drive meaningful sales growth over the long-term.","And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business which reported a 1% increase in sales for the second quarter, which was driven by a 5% contribution from acquisitions. Sales for the Safety Zone acquired on June 1 represents the majority of our acquisition revenues for the Office business, and we are pleased to report that the integration of this business is progressing very well.","By customer group, our mid single-digit growth in the mega channel was partially offset by a mid single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the Products side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category, or FBS, performed very well in the quarter, while the Office Products segment category was down low single-digits. Furniture was down mid single-digits and technology products were down low double-digits. We continue to make solid progress on our acquisition strategy and the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category.","As previously announced, we acquired certain janitorial and sanitation business from Rochester Midland Corporation effective July 1. We expect this business to further enhance our FBS product offering and contribute approximately $20 million in annual revenues.","Our Office team will continue to look for these types of strategic bolt-on acquisitions, as well as execute on our ongoing share of wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and look forward to showing more progress over the balance of the year.","So that is an overview of our performance by business, and we want to thank our teams across all of our businesses for their efforts day-in and day-out. We appreciate all that they do to make GPC the great company that it is.","So at this point, I'd also want to come back to my earlier comment that reinvigorating our sales growth is our number one priority. During this call, we talked a great deal about our sales environment and the execution of our initiatives to drive sales growth. And I thought it might be helpful to pull it all together and outline a few of the key action steps we are taking to achieve this goal.","The four building blocks of our growth strategy are comprised of the following: the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive a greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused both on geographical as well as product line expansion; the building out of our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses; and the further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint.","We are confident that our intense focus in these four key areas will positively impact our sales and support the steady and consistent growth we strive to achieve at Genuine Parts Company.","Now, I'll hand it over to Carol who will provide a financial update and a full year guidance. Carol?","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Paul, and congratulations on your promotion to CEO. It is certainly well deserved and we look forward to the execution of your key sales strategies. And, Tom, I would also like to thank you for your tremendous leadership of the company and, on a more personal level, your guidance and counsel over the years.","We will begin this morning with a review of our financials and look at the second quarter income statement and segment information, and then, we'll finish up with a review of a few key balance sheet items.","Our total revenues of $3.9 billion for the second quarter were down 1%. Our gross profit for the second quarter was 29.9%, which was equal to the prior year. Our management teams are focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term.","The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively steady, with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through six months in 2016 were Automotive down 0.7%, Industrial up 0.2%, Office up 0.2% and Electrical down 1.3%.","Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses for the second quarter were $865 million or 22.2% of sales, which is up slightly from last year, primarily due to this lower sales levels for the quarter. This was partially offset by our tight cost control measures which continue to positively impact our results and drive our progress towards greater operational efficiencies.","Now, if we look at the results by segment, our Automotive revenue for the second quarter of $2.1 billion was down 1% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Our operating profit of $204 million is down 2% and the operating margin for this group is 9.7% compared to 9.9% in the second quarter last year.","Our Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter were a decrease of 1.7% and 30% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $88 million is down 0.7% and our operating margin is up 10 basis points to 7.6% which is driven by a nice gross margin improvement (23:07).","Office Products revenues were $482 million in the second quarter, up 1% and 12% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5% and our operating margin is 6.8% compared to 7.2% last year.","For the Electrical Group, our sales were $185 million in the quarter, down 5% in the prior year and also 5% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $16 million is down 14% and the margin for this group is 8.7% compared to 9.5% last year or down 80 basis points.","So for the second quarter, our total operating profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.9% in the second quarter last year. This basically reflects the lack of leverage as mentioned earlier. With that said, we are intensely focused on showing progress in this area in the periods ahead.","We had net interest expense of $4.7 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest of $20 million to $21 million.","Our total amortization expense of $9.2 million for the second quarter, and we would expect our total amortization expense for the full year to be $36 million to $38 million.","Our depreciation expense was $26.7 million for the quarter and for the full year, we project total depreciation to approximate $110 million to $120 million. So our combined depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the second quarter, and we would expect the combined number to be in the range of $145 million to $160 million for the full year.","The other line which primarily reflects our corporate expense was $26.5 million for the quarter compared to $24.8 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range.","Our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 36.2% compared to 37% in the second quarter last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings as well as a favorable non-taxable retirement plan valuation adjustment compared to last year.","We expect this rate to show a slight increase in the last half of the year, but we are projecting our full year rate to be 36.3% to 36.8%. Our net income for the quarter, as Paul mentioned, was $191.4 million compared to $195.4 million last year, and our EPS of $1.28 was equal to last year.","Now, turning to the balance sheet, we continue to further strengthen our balance sheet with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at June 30 was $234 million, up slightly from June of last year.","Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our businesses. Accounts receivable of $2 billion at June 30 was up 1% from the prior year, and we continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with our quality at this time.","Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, which is actually down 3% when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward.","Our accounts payable at June 30 was $3.1 billion, up 12% from last year, due to improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and also our days in payables, and we would add that our AP to inventory ratio at June 30 reached 100% for the first time.","Our working capital of $1.5 billion at June 30 continues to show steady improvement from quarter to quarter and is down nicely from the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable remain a high priority for our company.","Our total debt is $775 million at June 30 compares to $850 million in total debt last year, and this includes two $250 million term notes, as well as another $275 million in borrowings, under our revolving line of credit. We would also add that one of our term notes is due November 30 of this year, and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date.","Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 19%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe that it provides the company with both the flexibility and financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may want to pursue.","So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of our company. We continue to generate strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we remain well-positioned for another solid year in 2016.","We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year, and our free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $400 million to $450 million range.","We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash includes strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses, and the dividend.","Our strategic acquisitions remained an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to our growth plans. Through July 1 of this year, we've added a number of new businesses across our Automotive, Industrial, and Office operations. These are excellent strategic fit for us and collectively, we expect these acquisitions to generate approximately $450 million in annual revenues.","Looking forward, we will continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on acquisitions of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range. But we're also open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investments.","Turning to share repurchases, we purchased 765,000 shares in the second quarter and 1.3 million shares for the six months. To-date, we have 4.9 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program and the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.","Our investment in capital expenditures was $38 million in the second quarter and is $50 million through June. For the year, we're currently planning for capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million, so we expect CapEx to increase slightly over the balance of the year due to the timing of several large projects.","Turning to our dividend, our 2016 dividend is $2.63 per share or a 7% increase in the prior year dividend of $2.46. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.","So that concludes our financial update for the second quarter 2016 and, in summary, our non-Automotive businesses continue to operate in a challenging sales environment. And in the second quarter, our U.S. Automotive sales were impacted by rather weak conditions. Fortunately, we see these as transitory issues and we look forward to improving conditions as we move ahead.","Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong performances in our international automotive operations. For the quarter, we offset some of the market headwinds with key sales initiatives, steady gross margins, and tight expense cost controls.","In addition, we further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases.","Now, turning to our guidance for the full year. On the revenue side, we are maintaining our guidance for total sales to be at plus 1% to plus 2% for the full year. Among our business segments, we are maintaining our Automotive sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3% for the full year, and we're increasing our Office guidance for sales to be plus 2% to plus 3% from the original amount of down 1% to up 1%.","We are lowering our Industrial sales to flat to up 1% from the previous plus 1% to plus 2%, and we're reducing the Electrical sales outlook to down 2% to down 3% from the previous up 1% to up 2%. This sales outlook includes all acquisitions that have closed through July 1 as well as the ATCO (32:39) Industrial acquisition that Paul mentioned earlier.","On the earnings side, we are updating our earnings guidance to be $4.70 to $4.75 from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the full year.","So this completes our prepared remarks, and we would just close by saying thank you to all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the success of GPC.","Paul, I'll turn it back over to you.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Carol. A good update on the quarter. So without a doubt, we are experiencing a challenging quarter, and frankly, it has been a challenging six months. But as you can tell from our guidance, we are planning for an improved second half to the year, and our teams are energized to execute on the action steps we outlined earlier.","We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.","So now, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot. Good morning.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And Tom, all the best to you as you continue to move forward. I have two sets of questions. The first relates to the Automotive business. It was interesting that you talked about June being flat compared to April up slightly even as some of the weather-sensitive businesses really popped with some of the heat that we saw in parts of the country.","So can you talk about what's transpiring with other categories and how weather-related softness away from the areas like batteries might be, just sort of how we got to flat rather than an increase with some of the weather businesses surging late in the quarter?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","And are you referencing specifically the month of June, Matt?","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I believe so. I'm talking about the cadence that you...","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","...spelled out where I think April was up low singles, May down low to mid singles, and June flat. I believe that related to your same-store sales number, though I'm not sure.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. So product-related movement we're seeing is, certainly, batteries were soft in the quarter. Ride control was soft in the quarter. However, we saw a slowing in our brakes business in the quarter, which we attribute some of that, we believe, to some of our brakes business probably moved into the first quarter given the warmer temps.","On the plus side, we're continuing to see nice growth out of our import lines. We're seeing nice growth out of our tool and equipment categories, but unfortunately, they weren't enough to offset some of the softness we saw in the other categories.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And as we're 20 or so days into a new quarter, any sense of how the current run rate compares to what you saw in June?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. I would have to tell you July \u2013 Matt, even though we're only a couple of weeks in and it's looking a lot like June. It's choppy is the best way I think I could describe it. The hot weather has to be a benefit to us and we believe with the continuing warm temps we're seeing across the country will be a benefit to us. And related to that, we are seeing those products that are related to the hot temps, products like batteries, products like rotating electrical, and our AC is picking up. So that's why we're cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then, my second question relates to Industrial, and specifically to the margin trends within that business. Historically, the gross was within Industrial, I believe were largely volume-driven and tied closely to volume rebates. You had a quarter where I think the volumes were not quite up to your expectations. The margins was quite good. And, Carol, on the call, you cited gross margins within that business. So any sense of the margin dynamics beneath the surface in Industrial, please.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I guess, and you're exactly right, we certainly have headwinds on the volume incentives in that business. What we've been pleased to see is for the first six months of the year, Industrial's core gross margin has improved, and that's due to a lot of things that they put in place over the last 18 months or so, and it's both on the buy side and the sell side. And those things have been put in place, and it helped (37:19) their gross profit. We had, for the six months, a slight decrease in their volume incentives, but they were flat in the quarter. And additionally, on the SG&A side, they've adjusted their cost structure to be more in line with the revenues.","So it's the combination of those things. So I would say that we're really pleased to see what they did in Q2. And we are expecting a slightly better second half for the Industrial business on the top-line. So hopefully, we can maintain that slight margin improvement as we finish out the year.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it and understood. Thank you so much, guys.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thanks a lot and good morning and best of luck, Tom.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Seth.","Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman","Thank you, Seth.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","First question is just on the difference regionally between \u2013 well, within the Auto Parts business. If you could provide some color as to how the regions performed through the quarters, the delta between the Central and Eastern, as well as the rest of the business, say from April, May relative to June.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. It's a bit like we saw in the previous quarter, Seth, the cold weather in the Northern division. So I called out specifically the Central and the Northeast. The delta between those businesses and some of our Southern businesses, our Southeastern, even down into Florida Atlantic, even out West, was a significant gap, we're talking close to 400 basis points, 500 basis points gap between those that are performing well and those that are continuing to be challenged.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. So that's 400-basis-point to 500-basis-point gap. Was that for the full quarter? Or do you see that gap narrow as you moved into June with the weather improvement?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","No. That was full quarter.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. And did the gap narrow in June?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Not \u2013 it's not much. We're pretty consistent throughout the quarter in both the Northern divisions as well as those warmer weather divisions.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, second question is just on major accounts, a slowdown there in major accounts. Can you provide any color on that maybe like you have done for the Industrial large customers, how many up or down or what's driving the slowdown in major accounts, do you lose customers? Just any other color will be helpful there.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. We stay close to our major customers, as you would imagine, Seth, and have a lot of conversations. Not all of them are down, but I would tell you that we have seen a drop in their business. We discussed with them often how their business is trending. Their tire sales have been challenged and those big tire guys that we do business with.","So again, I don't think boy, I can tell you we haven't lost any of our big major customers, and I don't believe we're losing share in any of our major customers. I would tell you that I think our business is the reflection of their business.","And I would also share, Seth, that as we look at the Automotive aftermarket, in general, we have had many top-to-top meetings with many of our big suppliers here in recent weeks and months. We do have constant dialogue with our major accounts at our NAPA AutoCare Centers. And again, that sluggishness that we experienced in our numbers, what we hear is all of those parties that we're discussing with it are seeing similar results.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Understood. Best of luck for improvement in the second half.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Seth.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Seth.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Hey. Thanks. I want to follow up a little bit on the Industrial business and then SG&A. Paul, you mentioned some signs of stability in the Industrial business, although if you think about the number of categories that were up or down being the same as last quarter and Industrial production seems to be a little bit better than your actual sales growth or organic. What are those specific signs of stability that you're pointing to? Then I wanted to follow up with Carol.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. So if I look at the numbers, Greg, that we've seen quarter-to-quarter since back in early 2015 where our sales were declining dramatically from one quarter to the next, culminating in an 8% drop in Q4, we rebounded, if you want to call it that, to a low single-digit increase in Q1 and we've seen that again in Q2.","So when I say stabilizing, it has stabilized from really the drop that we were seeing \u2013 significant drops that we were seeing in 2015. In talking to our team, our Motion business in Canada has seemed to stabilize and even is showing some slight improvement. We watch very closely our project work. And our project work \u2013 well, the projects are smaller than we would like. They're steady. And the number of projects that we see out there are steady.","So we're hopeful and we're starting to see it play out in the numbers a bit at our Industrial business, which also impacts our Electrical that has bottomed out. And hopefully, we'll see a better second half.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Great. And Carol, what was the thing helping you to actually take down SG&A dollars? I mean you did it in the first quarter and in the second quarter. Can we assume that SG&A dollars are down in the back half as well?","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I guess there's a lot of activities going on across all of our businesses. We said that each business, a lot of our investments are in technology and productivity. So as we can put in some of these efficiencies, we would be improving our volume per employee, so certainly, looking at efficiencies in distribution centers.","Also, you're just adjusting your cost structure to a different level of revenue. So on the Industrial side, and looking at some of their facilities, and looking at their operations, and making adjustments to, say, where we're not going to have business in certain areas and possibly we need to go from three branches to two branches.","And so, I think it's a number of projects going on. Our Automotive folks have done a very good job on SG&A, and even with a little softer Q2, they still have some SG&A improvement. So we would expect it to continue. We need to have a little bit better second half, which we're forecasting on the revenue and we would expect these things to stay in place, yes.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","That's great. Good luck.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Greg.","Operator. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I had a couple of questions on Industrial. A few of your competitors seem to have referenced furloughs and plant shutdown. Have you seen anything similar or any reason why your customer mix might not be feeling the same headwinds?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","We have, Chris. We're seeing certainly some of the same things I think our competitors and other folks in the industrial world are seeing. If we look at specifically some of the big oil and gas producers which has a big impact on not just our Industrial business, but our Automotive as well. The thought is that and it appears that some of the large oil producers are set to weather their storm. But many of the small oil producers are going under, and I don't know that that's going to change much going forward.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. And then, taking all the context, I mean a 3% organic decline really isn't that bad. Do you think relative to your performance to peers, like what do you think is driving that right now? Is it your maintenance mix versus new equipment? Are there any current growth drivers that you've added that are allowing to take share right now? Like, what are you seeing in that business?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, certainly, Chris, some of the new focus product category that we have gotten into in recent years, products like industrial supply, safety supply, material handling equipment, those products and product lines are performing well, and actually, are generating increases year-over-year.","Where we're seeing some of the pressure is on the traditional industrial products, hydraulics, bearings, power transmission. But I think that much like our strategy in our Office Products business, as we segue into new categories, growth categories, that's certainly helping our numbers.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. Then, actually, one last follow-up related to that. In terms of Office, I mean obviously, you've done a nice job of diversifying into jan\/san and some other growth categories. But what are your core, like, technology office products? How are those performing right now? And is there a point in time where you see that business becomes less of a headwind to your consolidated Office number?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. Our tech products \u2013 our tech categories were down in the quarter, Chris. And our team is, certainly, focused on getting that back in the plus column, but for now, that is a \u2013 our tech business is a bit of a headwind.","Our strategy is I think we've articulated in the past is continuing to drive our overall Office Products business more into the facility, breakroom safety product categories. You're seeing that with most of the acquisitions that we've completed of late, certainly, the most recent being the Safety Zone and the division of Rochester Midland. So we believe that that tech headwind will become less and less of a factor as we move forward.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. Okay, cool. Thank you for the help (48:01).","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","You're welcome. Thank you.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. If we look at organic revenue growth backing out the FX impact and positive contribution from acquisitions, every business segment was down year-over-year and for Auto, it sounds like you attributed that to weather specifically. Is there anyway to quantify what that growth would have been if weather had been consistent year-over-year and is mid-single-digit growth for the second half of the year achievable for that business?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","I'm sorry, Elizabeth. Are you referring specifically to Automotive or across all four?","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","To Auto specifically.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Okay. So Auto, in the first half of the year, our core Automotive business was actually up 1% and our expectation is that in the second half of the year that we are going to generate low to mid-single-digit growth in our core Automotive business and that does not include the potential assistance we'll get from acquisitions.","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","And Elizabeth, if you were to ask me as a follow-up, so how do you intend to do that, I would tell you that we're still very focused on our core initiatives in Automotive. While the quarter was certainly not up to our expectations, by no means are we in a panic mode and going to shift our focus, we have terrific opportunities to continue to grow our retail sales.","We are rolling out our top store initiative which will, as mentioned in my comments, will total 150 stores in 2016. We'll reinvigorate our business in our NAPA AutoCare Center, and then, new distribution will be a factor as well. So we're confident we'll drive the kind of numbers that we talked about in the second half.","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And do you think without the weather impact, the second quarter might have seen that kind of low single-digit growth in core for Auto?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","One can only assume, Elizabeth. If you look at our first quarter, certainly, we were there. If you look at our previous number of quarters, certainly, we were there. So Q2, we believe, is an outlier, and again, I think that the key initiatives that our team is focused on will get our business back on track in the second half of the year.","Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks very much.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks for your questions.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move on to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning and congrats, Tom, on all your success as a CEO over the year and Paul, congrats to you and good fortune to you as you move forward as CEO as well.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Chris.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A couple of follow-up questions at this point. So you talked about June flat, July choppy, like June flattish. What's still soft, if you're seeing some of the weather-sensitive business pop, what categories continue to be a drag in performance?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. As we saw in the second quarter, Chris, it's still some of those same core lines. It's ride control. It's brake business. Our brake business, we have been on a tremendous run over the last six quarters to eight quarters in our brake business, and we're seeing that tail off just a bit.","Again, there is nothing that we have fundamentally changed. We haven't raised prices. We haven't changed product categories. So those big categories, ride control, brakes, that's where we're seeing some of the softness which we're certainly trying to outrun with the growth that we're seeing in tool and equipment, imports, and in our temp related businesses.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so as you \u2013 I guess, do we have to wait around for \u2013 because it sounds like some of that's like, it's corrosion from the winter that didn't happen, it's potholes that didn't happen. And so do we have to wait around for the winter to see improvements like \u2013 forget your initiatives, but maybe just the industry growth rates, do you have to wait around for the winter to see improvements in those categories or is it \u2013 does 2012 suggest that, well, the further you get away, that drag mitigates and you can start to see growth, and maybe later in the third quarter in those businesses?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","I think you're spot on, Chris, with that comment. I referenced in my prepared remarks, what we saw back in 2012, and I do believe that will be the case. But I can assure you our team is not sitting on the sideline, they have a tremendous sense of urgency. No panic, but a tremendous sense of urgency working with our good customers out in the field, certainly working closely with our AutoCare Centers to understanding where they need our support, how we can help them grow their business. So we are intensely focused on getting our growth curve back going in the right direction in Q3, Q4. And as we have projected on our numbers, we do believe that that will be the case.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just to clarify, you mean, as the further you get away from the winter, you can start to see growth as you proceed through the year. You don't have to wait for winter weather to reinvigorate those businesses.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","That's correct. That's correct.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then on July, someone asked about the regional differences in June, is the July acceleration in some of those weather-sensitive categories more focused in the Northern tier of the country?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","I think it's maybe just a bit early to go there, Chris. You had the July 4 holiday where we lost essentially a week. I think it might be a bit early to go there, but I will tell you that the hot temps that we're seeing, heck, I heard St. Louis is supposed to be 100 degrees-plus. That goes across the Northeast. That's going to drive business, and it's going to drive certainly those temp-related products. There's just no two ways about it. We've seen it in the past, and I don't think 2016 will be any different.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then one last clarifying question to your response. When you say, sort of July looks like June, there's no negative calendar impact in there. You're sourcing on the days adjusted business, (54:55) business looks similar, right?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Correct. Yes, sir.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","All right. Thanks, Chris.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you. Congrats, Tom and Paul. Welcome and look forward to working with you as we move forward.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Tony.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","I wanted to talk a little bit more about the initiatives you have in place to sort of drive the sales growth, and you laid out some of those related to auto. But if you look across your four segments, and then identify the four sort of buckets that you attempt, whether it's (54:35) or acquisition, or digital, or expansion of footprint, can you sort of maybe give some more color of how you would align each one, and where the most opportunity along those four buckets would be for each one?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, certainly, we're looking at strategic acquisitions, Tony, in every single one of our businesses, and I think that in 2016 we've had impactful acquisitions in three of our four businesses. We have activity going in, in all four, but we have closed on deals in Industrial, Office, and of course Automotive. As it relates to specifically expanding footprint, both domestically and internationally, that's really targeted at our Automotive businesses. And as you know, we have new distribution initiatives in place both in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I mentioned earlier we've had terrific success in our GPC Asia-Pac business, and that's a business we'll continue to grow. As we look at our digital capability, that goes across all four businesses, and we're driving e-commerce initiatives across every one of our businesses. And then, of course, a greater share of wallet which really, that underpins all of our efforts. Again, that growth goes across all four businesses (57:13), and really is that what we need to drive our core growth.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","And then, especially on the distribution side, are you \u2013 as you continue to cross-sell and leverage across each of the segments, some of the SG&A savings, is that perhaps coming from your ability to be more effective across your distribution at all your locations?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","We believe so, Tony. Certainly, as we look at some of the recent acquisitions, the bolt-on acquisitions that we've done, The Safety Zone would fit that category, Rochester Midland, that Jan\/San acquisition, we believe we have opportunities to cross-sell and take full advantage of the structure or the infrastructure we have in place. And I would say the same as it relates to acquisitions that we've done in the automotive space, whether it'd be on our import business or our heavy-duty business. We're leveraging that structure that we've had in place for many, many years across all of our businesses.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I think one thing I may add \u2013 Tony, one thing I may add and you said on just SG&A, we also see opportunities that come on the cost of goods sold side as well. So on these acquisitions \u2013 and we look at the product categories, we're able to take that and leverage across the organization, our total spend. So we'll see that coming from the gross margin side and the SG&A side.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","So it's just a 2016 (58:47) this continue for a period of time beyond as a result of integration and efficiency gain?","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then last one question. I just want to clarify, what was your revised guidance on the Industrial? Did you say down to flat, is that correct (59:06)?","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Our Industrial is going to be flat to up 1% for our new guidance.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Flat to up. Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Flat to up 1%.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","All right. Thanks, Tony.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. How are you?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hey, Scot.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Specifically asking about auto at this point, any change in the competitive environment worth noting? There's obviously been a lot of changes in the industry over the last, let's call it, 12 months or so. I think we also kind of generally get the weather impact given the industry's experience in 2012. But there was also a period in 2008 and 2009 where your Auto business started to significantly lag the performance of a bunch of your peers. And if I remember right, it was a function of uncompetitive pricing in a couple of categories. In fact, it may have even been ride control, now that I think about it. So any change overall in the competitive environment? And then also specifically on your pricing relative to the market. Thanks.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. So I would say this, Scot, on the first question as it relates to our competition, we have not seen any major shift in the competitive landscape. I think pricing remains sane across all of our competitors. Look, everybody is scratching and clawing for market share in a challenging environment, but we've not seen any major shift across our key competitors. As it relates to our pricing by product or pricing by product category, I recall quite well your reference to 2008 and 2009, and that did occur and we did adjust, and I think we certainly benefited from it. We don't see anywhere, at this point, where we're an outlier in a particular product category. Our guys do price jobs on a very regular basis. We get input from the field on a daily and weekly basis, both from our stores as well as our independent owners. And there is always the occasional tweak we make here and there based on the competitive landscape, but now I would say, generally we are not seeing any significant change in the competitive landscape.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And Paul, can you remind us how you did wind up in the pricing quandary that you did back in 2008, 2009 because I thought you guys were doing kind of a price scans and competitive pricing general check, if you will, back then as well. I'm just wondering how it wound up gaining (01:01:56) so skewed relative to the market.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. So I joined the Automotive Parts Group, Scot, in 2009. And if I recall, the shift that occurred, and maybe we were a bit slow on the trigger, was our competitors dropped the prices, and certainly, our retail competitors dropped their prices specifically. We ultimately regrouped, reacted and the business bounced right back, but when I joined in 2009, we were on our way out of that.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. Okay. Very helpful, guys. Thanks a lot.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","All right. Thank you.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Scot.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hey, Bret.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Congratulations to Tom and Paul also.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you Bret.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","You called out the energy market as another region that had some softness, and is that specifically Texas and Oklahoma? Does it spread any further around that range? And then maybe could you compare, you said maybe 400 basis points or 500 basis points spread between the north and the central in the Northeastern markets, versus a strong market comp, could you tell us maybe how the energy market comp compared to the average also?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. So when we look at our energy-related market, Bret, certainly, the first place everybody goes is Texas, Oklahoma and I get that. And certainly, that has been impacted, no doubt, and continues to be. And that's not just in Automotive, we see that in Industrial as well. But we also see it in the fracking regions. So we see it in portions of the Mountain Division. We see it in Montana, Dakotas a bit. We see it in Pennsylvania where fracking was blowing and going here a couple of years ago. And in addition, we also see it up in the oil sands in Canada, certainly Alberta has been a headwind for both our Automotive business in Canada as well as our Industrial business. So yes, not just Oklahoma and Texas, I wish it was. And then \u2013 I'm sorry, Bret, your second question related to the Northern division gap between their numbers and our warmer weather?","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","I was just going to ask you to compare your energy weakness to the rest of the market. You said that the Northern and Northeastern was 400 basis points or 500 basis points spread. I was wondering, if you could sort of give us a feeling for how bad the energy market was relative to average also.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's actually \u2013 if we focus in on your opening comments there, Texas, Oklahoma are very similar. It's that 400-basis point or 500-basis point gap. I mentioned Mountain as one of our better performing divisions. So we're able to overcome some of the shortfall in the Dakotas with some strong performance in the Denver area, for instance, that have made up for that.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then a final question, you talked a couple of times about air conditioning or temperature-related products being up double-digits. Are in-stock levels fine there, is demand exceeding supply, or is everything okay in the inventory?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. I will tell you, Bret, on the inventory comment, we are looking at our inventories across our entire business. We have a new predictive modeling engine that we've put into place, and we're looking at our inventories, and especially in some of the categories where we're challenged, and we are pumping up our inventories in some of those categories. Our AC products, we have not had an issue at least that I'm aware of at this point. I think we're well-positioned as we race head long into the back half of the summer.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","All right. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our final question from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli.","Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Hi, Tom. Hi, Paul. Congratulations to you both.","Thomas C. Gallagher - Chairman","Thank you, Brian.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Brian.","Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Two real quick ones. Carol, another great job on working capital. Was any portion of that attributable to changes in currency?","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. Well, there was \u2013 our currency-neutral numbers were smaller this quarter than they have been in the past. But the bulk of that working capital improvement is just coming from accounts payable, and it's broadly all of the segments quite honestly. And then, really, where we saw a nice improvement this quarter was inventory. We had about $85 million source of cash from our inventories this quarter, and that was \u2013 a lot of that came from Automotive. So we were pleased to see additional improvement coming out of inventory, and we feel like we'll have some more in the back half.","Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. That's great and encouraging. And then just on getting my numbers right for the NAPA comps, company-owned stores were down 2% in the U.S. Were they down international?","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They were actually up international.","Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We had said they were up. So I think Canada was low single-digits, and Australia, New Zealand was mid single-digits.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","And Brian just to clarify one point, you mentioned our company-owned stores, our company-owned stores same-store sales were flat in the quarter. Overall, our Automotive was down 2%, U.S. automotive.","Brian C. Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","That's why I asked. Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much and good luck in the coming months.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks very much, Brian.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And we'll now take our follow-up question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Sorry to prolong the call, but I just had felt the need to follow up on Brian's last question. If we think about that delta between the flat comp in the U.S. and the total down 2%, is that lower sell in to the franchise stores or to the network, or some other factor driving that decline?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","No, you've got it. That's exactly it, Matt.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Any sense of their sell-through relative to that decline, or was it that tough to depot back an inventory because that's a bit of a different pace of business from what you're seeing at the company-owned stores?","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","It is. Our independent owners are competing just fine in the marketplace. I don't think there's anything specific to our big independent owners. They did do a little bit of an inventory build towards the end of Q1, which may have had an impact. But no, we don't see, we certainly don't see anything different happening on the independent side from our company-owned stores.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you so much.","Paul D. Donahue - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for additional and closing remarks.","Carol B. Yancey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we would like to thank everyone for participating in today's call, and we look forward to reporting out with our third quarter results. And once again, we like to thank Tom Gallagher for all of his leadership over the last 46 years, and wish Paul all the best. So thank you for joining us.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Sid Jones","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts' fourth quarter and full year 2014 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the 2015. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses.

And once we have completed our individual comments, we will look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.","Earlier this morning we released our fourth quarter and year end results and hopefully you've all had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3.822 billion, which was up 9%, net income was $165.6 million, which was up 10% and earnings per share were $1.07 this year versus $0.97 last year, which was also up 10%. So we feel that our team came through the final quarter of the year in good shape. For the year sales were $15.342 billion which was up 9%. Net income was $711 million up 4% on a reported basis and up 9% on a comparative basis. You'll recall that in 2013 we had one time purchase accounting gains that were related to the GPC Asia-Pacific acquisition and that had a onetime favorable impact on the 2013 results.","Earnings per share for the year were $4.61 and EPS was up 5% on a reported basis and 10% on a comparative basis. Sales net income and earnings per share, each reached record levels in 2014 which we're certainly pleased to report and we're also pleased that the sales in EPS results both came in a bit above our full year guidance that was provided back in October with all four of our business segments contributing nicely.","Turning to the individual segments, I will cover the non automotive operations first followed by Paul who will then review the automotive performance. Starting off with industrial, the motion industries team came through the year in good shape. Sales for the year were just under $4.8 billion and this was up 8% and we were pleased with the cadence of the year with sales being up 4% in the first quarter, 7% in the second and then 10% in each of the final two quarters of the year, and these solid results were underpinned by broad based positive contributions across the major product categories as well as the major customer segments.","On the product side we ended the year with 11 of our top 13 categories showing growth and encouragingly all 13 were up in the final quarter. Among our top 12 customer segments 11 posted positive results for the year and all 12 were positive over the final three months, again encouraging trends. Among the strongest growing segments for the year in no particular order were automotive, coal aggregate and cements, iron and steel, lumber and wood products. This a diversified cross section of the North American manufacturing base and we feel that these solid results are reflective of the improved conditions that we currently see in the overall economy, which is encouraging as we head into the new year.","Before ending our comments on industrial, we do want to mention that we completed the acquisition of Miller Bearing as of February 1st of this year. Miller is a highly regarded regional industrial distribution company headquartered in Orlando, Florida. They operate 17 branches and have annual revenues of approximately $40 million. This will be a great addition to our Industrial group and we\u2019re pleased to have the Miller organization now a part of Motion Industries.","Turning to the Electrical segment EIS was up 23% in the fourth quarter and they were up 30% for the year. So it was a strong performance from this team in 2014. While certainly pleased with the overall results, we do want to point out that acquisitions were the major contributor to the sizable sales increases. In fact the EIS underlying business was only up 1% for the full year. However we were encouraged to see the underlying business up 4% in the final quarter which was the strongest performance of the year and hopefully a sign that demand is starting to pick up a bit in this segment.","As we enter 2015, EIS will continue to see sluggish demand among our telecommunications customer base at least for the first half of the year and the deflation in copper pricing will also present a headwind, but the EIS team has a number of strong revenue initiatives underway and we expect a solid performance from this team in 2015, especially over the second half of the year.","And finally office products. Total revenues came in at $1.8 billion and this was up 10%. As with our Industrial segment office product sales get stronger as the year progressed. After being flat in the first quarter they were up 4% in the second quarter, 15% in the third quarter and 22% in the fourth quarter. This progression clearly shows the positive impact of our enhanced relationship with a significant customer that kicked-in in the second half of the year, as well the nice contributions from the Impact Products acquisition that was completed mid-year. ","But beyond this we\u2019re also pleased to see single digit growth from our independent office products reseller channel for the entire year and this segment actually firmed up as the year progressed and we were also pleased to have ended the year with solid growth in all four of the major product categories. So the results from the Office Products group were broad based from both a customer and product perspective which is encouraging and this team goes into 2015 with a bit of momentum, which is good to see. ","So that\u2019s a quick overview of the non-automotive businesses and as this point I\u2019ll ask Paul to bring you up-to-date on the Automotive segment. Paul?","Paul Donahue","Yes, thank you Tom. Good morning everyone. And let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I\u2019m pleased to join here today and to have an opportunity to provide you an update on the fourth quarter performance of our Automotive business. We\u2019re pleased to report to our global Automotive business grew top line revenues by 4% in the fourth quarter. This 4% number consists of 6.5% core Automotive growth which includes slight benefit from acquisition offset by 2.5% of currency adjustment.","The currency adjustment was a bigger headwind than we had anticipated for the quarter. Our team was able to overcome this challenge with stronger than expected core growth. When reviewing our quarterly performance, we continue to be encouraged by the solid results our teams are generating across our entire automotive business.","During the fourth quarter we saw our U.S. team posted 7% sales increase, while our International businesses including Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand grew mid-single digits. In the U.S. all regions of the country are positively contributing to our sales growth. The Atlantic, Western and Midwestern divisions led the way for our Company in the fourth quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn to our same store sales numbers. Our U.S. company owned store group grew comp same store sales in the fourth quarter by 7%. This 7% is on top of the 7% increase we generated in the fourth quarter of 2013, which gives us a two year stack of plus 14%. This solid performance continues the strong same-store sales run dating back to the fourth quarter of 2013.","Our quarterly breakdown for 2014 is as follows. In the first quarter we generated an 8% same store sales increase and in Q2 we posted a 7% increase and in Q3 we\u2019re plus 6%. Rolled up that gives the U.S. automotive businesses a full year same-store sales number of plus 7%. We are proud of our team for generating these solid results but we are also well aware we have a steep hill decline in 2015 to continue to build on these comps. Our 7% sales increase in Q4 was driven by a combination of strong sales on both our commercial wholesale side of the business and by our retail business. ","Let\u2019s start with our retail results. As mentioned in previous calls we have put renewed focus on this segment of our business and we are pleased to report these initiatives are beginning pay dividend. Our team did an outstanding job in the quarter, driving an 11% increase in our overall retail business. As generally is the case, there was no one single initiative that drove this double digit increase, but rather a combination of things that our team has been working on for the past 12 months that really began to take hold in the quarter.","Retail basic such as extended store hours, proper staffing, dedicated retail associates and increased training all played a part. In addition we have fined tuned our radio and our print advertising. We focused our team on [indiscernible] compliance and we are driven to increase both the size of our average ticket and the number of tickets falling through our stores.","In Q4 we saw a significant increase in our average retail ticket and an increase in the number of retail tickets. We are by no means satisfied with where we are today and we have a great deal of work left to do. However it is a testament to our team's hard work that we are moving the needle on this important initiative.","So now let's turn to our commercial wholesale business or our Do It For Me segment. This segment turned in a 6% increase in the fourth quarter. Recapping our year's performance, our commercial business was at or exceeded 6% growth in each quarter of 2014. Highlights for the quarter included solid performances by our two major wholesale initiatives NAPA AutoCare and major accounts. Starting with our major account business this strategic segment delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth, a terrific accomplishment by our entire major account team, and our NAPA AutoCare centers now totaling over 15,500 nationwide posted a high single digit to sales increase in the quarter. This performance insured another year of low double digit increase for our AutoCare business.","We'd also like to report on our fleet business. This important segment continued a solid year-over-year performance by posting a 5% increase in the quarter and we wrapped up 2014 at plus 6%. We can also report good trends in our average wholesale ticket value which add positive growth in the month and in the quarter with little or no inflationary support. We also saw a year-over-year growth in the average number of tickets flowing through our stores.","Now a quick review of the product categories driving our growth. In the fourth quarter, we experienced double digit growth in our Bright business, our tool and equipment business and our NAPA Import Parts business, a great job by our sales teams in all three of these important categories. As we look ahead to 2015 and beyond, we continue to be encouraged by the fundamentals in the Automotive aftermarket. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years, the size of the fleet continues to grow, and not surprisingly the all-important miles driven metric recorded its largest growth in the past five years.","After relatively flat to even negative numbers in recent years, miles driven was up 1.4% through 11 months. We saw a jump in miles driven as the price of the gasoline dropped in late Q3 and Q4. Miles driven was up 2.3% in September, 2.6% in October and 1.1% in November. This growth is a direct result of the lowest fuel prices we've seen in six years. That said, we are beginning to see fuel prices bench back up in early February, however the national average is still significantly below last year's fuel prices.","So in summary we are pleased with our fourth quarter results as well as our full year performance. Our teams in the U.S, Canada, Mexico and Australasia continue to post solid growth, and as good as we feel about 2014 and our industry in general, we are facing our share of headwinds as we move into 2015. ","Foreign currency has a significant headwind for non-U.S automotive businesses which we'll continue to monitor. In addition we will face challenging 2014 comps in every quarter of 2015. That said, we are confident in our strategy, the key initiatives we've laid out and the management team we have in place to make it happen.","And in closing, we want to thank our management teams, both in North America as well as our team on the ground in Australasia for another fine year for the GPC automotive business.","So that completes our overall view of the GPC automotive business and at this time I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you Paul. We'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year income statements and our segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back at the end of my remarks and then we'll open the call up to your questions.","Our total revenues were $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 9% from last year. This consists of underlying sales growth of 8% and a 3% contribution from acquisitions. These items were offset by a currency headwind of approximately 2%. For the year our sales increase of 9% was 5% of core growth with another 5% from acquisitions offset by a 1% currency headwind. Our gross profit for the fourth quarter was 30% of sales and this compares to the 31% gross margin last year.","For the 12 months, our gross margin of 29.9% compares to 30% reported last year or 30.1% excluding the onetime purchase accounting adjustment in 2013 that was previously disclosed and also referenced in today's press release. We're pleased that our fourth quarter gross margin was in line with our expectations. We also recognize the need for further progress on this line and as we've stated before, this area has our full attention. As we move forward in 2015, we will rely on well executed margin initiatives across all of our businesses to offset the ongoing customer and product mix shifts that are pressuring our gross margins today. ","Additionally, our initiatives are important in addressing the generally low inflationary environment, especially in the Automotive segment. Our supplier price increases for 2014 were flat for Automotive, up 1.5% for Industrial, up 1.4% for Office Products and up three tenths of 1% for Electrical. And currently we are planning for about the same pricing environment again in 2015.","Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses of $881 million in the fourth quarter were up 2.9% from 2013 and at 23.1% of sales. This is 130 basis points improvement from the 24.3% reported last year. For the full year our total SG&A expenses are $3.5 billion, which is 22.7% of sales compared to the 22.6% in the prior year or 22.9% before the purchase accounting adjustment mentioned earlier. So this is a 20 basis point improvement on a comparative basis for the full year.","The improvement in our fourth quarter and full year SG&A expenses reflect the benefit of effective cost management in every area of our business, as well as greater expense coverage especially across our non-automotive businesses in 2014. Our teams remain focused on effectively managing our cost and we expect to show continued progress on our SG&A line in the periods ahead.","Now let's discuss the results by segment. So Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.99 billion and that represents 52% of our sales and is up 3.7%. Operating profit of $150.3 million is down 2.3%. So their margin declined by 40 basis points to 7.6% from the 8.0% last year. For the year automotive sales of $8.1 billion, which is also 53% of our total revenues was up 8.1%. Our operating profit of $700.4 million is up 9.2% and our margin is up 10 basis points to 8.7%. So despite the pressure on our margin in the fourth quarter, we're very pleased to report a slight increase in our operating margin for the full year.","Our Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which is 31% of our revenues is up 10.4% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $96.3 million is up 31% and our operating margin showed strong expansion this quarter of 120 basis points to 8.0% from the 6.8% last year. For the year our Industrial sales of $4.77 billion represents 31% of our total revenues and is up 7.7%. Our operating profit of $370 million is up 15% and our margin is 7.8%, which is up 60 basis points from last year. This is a solid margin improvement for industrial and we're especially pleased to see the expansion come from both core gross margin improvement as well as SG&A leverage. In addition we had the benefit of stronger supplier incentives in 2014. So this was a very good year for Industrial.","Our Office Products revenues were $469 million in the quarter or 12% of our revenues and up a very strong 21.7%. Our operating profit of $35.3 million is up 12%, so their operating margin was down 50 basis points to 7.5%. For the year office revenues of $1.8 billion or 11% of sales are up 10%. Our operating profit of $134 million is up 9% and our margin is down 10 basis points from last year to the 7.4%. Again, our customer mix shift is imposing our net margin for this business but we're pleased with our overall top line growth.","The Electrical group had sales in the quarter of $177.4 million, up 5% of revenue and up 23%. Operating profit of $15 million is up 23%. So their margin is basically unchanged at 8.5%. For the year sales for this group are $739 million or 5% of our revenues and up 30%. Our operating profit of $65 million is up 36%. So our margin is up nicely to 8.8% from the prior 8.4%, a solid 40 basis points improvement.","So in total, our operating profit was up approximately 10% on a 9% sales increase in the fourth quarter and our operating profit margin improved 10 basis points to 7.8. Operating margin expanded in all four quarters for 2014 and the full year is up 30 basis points to 8.3%. We are very encouraged by this progress and we remain focused on continued margin expansion in the periods ahead. We had net interest expense of $5.5 million in the fourth quarter and this is down from $6.1 million last year, and for the 12 months interest expense is $24 million, which is consistent with the prior year.","Looking ahead for 2015, we currently expect net interest expense to be approximately $22 million to $24 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense was $10.5 million for the fourth quarter and $37 million for the full year. Our amortization for both the quarter and the year is up in 2014 due to the acquisition activity across all four of our segments. For 2015, we expect amortization expense to be in the $40 million to $42 million range. The other line which reflects our corporate expense was $15.7 million expense for the fourth quarter, which is down from the $20.7 million in the prior year.","For the full year, our corporate expense is $90 million, which is up from $35 million from the prior year or up $67 million before the one-time purchase accounting adjustment that we previously discussed. The favorable fourth quarter comparison primarily reflects certain yearend adjustments from the prior year which slightly increase our expenses in the fourth quarter of 2013.","For the year the increase from 2013 reflects a variety of items including higher overall expenses in areas such as legal and professional, insurance and incentive based compensation. In addition, an unfavorable $7 million swing for 2014 associated with our retirement plan valuation adjustment also impacted this line item. With these and other factors in mind we expect corporate expense line to be in the $85 million to $95 million range again in 2015. ","Our tax rate was approximately 37.6% for the fourth quarter, up from 36.2% in 2013 as the mix of income by country and relative foreign income tax rate primarily drove the overall higher tax rate. For the year, our 36.4% tax rate is up from the 34.4% in the prior year due to several factors, including the favorable rate on the one-time purchase accounting gain in 2013. In addition our lower retirement plan valuation adjustment and our foreign income and rate mix also contribute to increase in our rate in 2014. Looking ahead, we would expect our tax rate for 2015 to be in the 37% range. Net income for the quarter was $166 million compared, to the $150 million in the fourth quarter or up 10%. Our EPS of $1.07 compared to the $0.97 reported last year also up 10%. ","Now let\u2019s discuss a few key balance sheet items. Our cash at December 31st was $138 million, which is down from the $197 million in the prior year. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives in all of our businesses and we remain comfortable with our cash position. Our accounts receivable of $1.9 billion at December 31st increased 12% from 2013 on a 9% sales increase for the fourth quarter. We remain focused on our goal of growing receivables at a rate less than revenue growth and we\u2019ll be working hard to achieve this objective in the periods ahead. We continue to be satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.","Our inventory at the end of the year was $3 billion which was up 3% from the prior year or up just 1% excluding the impact of acquisitions. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we\u2019ll remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward in 2015.","Accounts payable balance at year end was $2.6 billion or up 13% from the prior year, due to the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We remain encouraged by the continued improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital in our days and payables.","Our working capital of $2 billion at December 31st is down slightly from the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital and in particular our accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company. Our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in solid improvement in our working capital position and cash flow for the last several years and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition.\\","Our total debt of $755 million at December 31st is down approximately $70 million from the nine months ended in September and is basically unchanged from the prior year. This represents approximately 19% of total capitalization, which is also consistent with the prior year. Our debt includes two $250 million term notes as well as another $265 million in borrowings under our multi-currency credit facility, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. ","We continue to generate solid cash flows and in 2014 our cash from operations was approximately $800 million and our free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends was $335 million. While not at the level of the historical record achieved in 2013, we\u2019re very pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows. For 2015 we currently expect cash from operations to be in the $800 million to $850 million and the free cash flow to be approximately $350 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority for cash is the dividend which we\u2019ve paid every year since going public in 1948, and have now raised for 59 consecutive years, effective with yesterday\u2019s Board approval of $2.46 per share annual dividend for 2015. This represents a 7% increase from the $2.30 per share paid in 2014 and it\u2019s approximately 53% of our 2014 earnings per share, which is within our goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate, and share repurchases.","Our capital expenditures were $34 million in the fourth quarter, down from $40 million in the prior year and for the year our capital spending totaled $108 million, which is a slight decrease from the prior year. The decrease in expenditures for the fourth quarter and the year primarily reflects the timing associated with certain projects. With this in mind, we currently expect our capital expenditure to pick up again in 2015 and we look for our CapEx spending to be in the range of $125 million to $145 million for the full year.","As usual, the vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million in the fourth quarter, up from $36 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year and its $148 million for the full year which is up from $134 million in the prior year. The fourth quarter and full year increases reflect the impact of our capital expenditures, as well as acquisitions and we currently depreciation and amortization to be approximately $155 million to $165 million for the full year in 2015. ","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an important use of our cash and they're integral to the growth plans for the Company. In 2014 we made seven acquisitions including at least one in each of our four business segments and we expect this new business to contribute annual revenues of approximately $390 million. We also have remained active in 2015, acquiring JAL associates for the office segment in January and Miller Bearings for the Industrial segment on February 1st that Tom discussed.","Combined, we expect these two acquisitions to generate approximately $50 million in annual revenues and to be accretive to our earnings in 2015. We will continue to seek new acquisitions across all of our businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth, generally targeting new [ph] bolt-on acquisition with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally in 2014 we used our cash to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock under the Company's share repurchase program. Additionally we have purchased another 500,000 shares thus far in 2015 and currently we have 9.1 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock as an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","So that concludes our financial update. It was a solid fourth quarter and a record year but as always there is opportunity for improvement in the periods ahead. We look forward to updating you on our future progress when we report again in April and in closing I would also like to thank all of our GPC associates for all their hard work and dedication.","I'll now turn it back over to Tom. Tom?","Tom Gallagher ","Thank you, Paul and Carol for your updates and thanks to both of you and your respective teams for the fine job being done and also for the important role that each of your plays in the overall success of Genuine Parts Company. So that concludes our prepared remarks on 2014, and in closing I would say that we're pleased with our overall results. As we look back there were a number of notable achievements. Sales and earnings rose to record levels in all four of our business segments and this enabled GPC to report a record year with sales going over the $15 billion mark for the first time. The 9% sales increase follows an 8% improvement in 2013, indicating a good two year progression. Operating profit improved by 30 basis points with three to four business units contributing nicely.","We kept the balance sheet strong and flexible with debt to total capitalization being 18.8%. Cash generation, although down from last year's historic levels were still strong with cash from operations coming in at $790 million and free cash at $335 million. And working capital efficiency improved nicely again in 2014. We returned over $440 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends and with the 7% dividend increase approved by our Board of Directors yesterday, we've now increase the dividend for the 59th consecutive year.","So in summary we're proud of the achievements in 2014 and we're appreciative of the fine job that was done by the GPC associates throughout our organization. Now in looking ahead we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals for each of our business and all of the GPC businesses have well thought out growth strategies for 2015. We're a bit less certain however of the overall impact of the strength of the U.S dollar as well as the impact of the global economic and geo-political issues. But to the best of our ability we have tried to take all of these factors into consideration as we set our expectations for the year ahead.","With that said, our initial revenue guidance for total GPC is to be up 3% to 4% for the year, but we want to quickly point out that this includes a 2.5% to 3% negative impact from currency over the course of the year. So you can see that currency will be a significant factor for us in 2015. Adjusting for this translates to a 6% to 7% comparable revenue increase, and this basically reflects core growth. So our underlying growth expectations remain in line with the core revenue growth that we experienced in 2014.","And looking at by segment, for Automotive business which is the segment that will be most impacted by currency, our expectation is to be up 2% to 3% for the full year, which includes a 4% negative impact from currency. Adjusting for this currency impact, it represents 6% to 7% increase in the underlying revenues for automotive. In Industrial, we anticipate a 5% to 6% increase and this accounts for 1% negative currency exchange. So before the impact of currency our Industrial sales should also increase 6% to 7%.","Office Products should be up 6% to 7% with no material currency impact and we anticipate the Electrical segment to be up 5% to 6%, also with no material currency impact. On the earnings side, our initial guidance would be for EPS to come in between $4.70 to $4.80 and included in this is approximately $0.15 per share that's due to unfavorable exchange rates and the related increase and the tax rate which Carol referenced in her remarks. Stated another way, before the impact of currency and the tax differences, we're guiding to a range of $4.85 to $4.95, which will be up 5% to 7% on a comparative basis.","So that will conclude our prepared comments and at this point we'd like to turn the call back to Nicole to take your questions. Nicole?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matthew Fassler ","Just start by asking you briefly about Automotive margins. You alluded to the fact that they declined. I don't think you gave a lot of color as to why they were down as sharply as they were with very strong revenue growth. So any color you could give there would be terrific.","Carol Yancey","Yes, Matt, I'll speak to the fourth quarter margins and then kind of talk about it on a full year basis. So our gross margin was down a bit in the fourth quarter within Automotive and we talked about customer and product mix and we offset [ph] some of the foreign currency pressures and some of that flows through to the gross margins as well. And in addition our SG&A wasn't as favorable in the Automotive segment in the quarter. So what I'd point to is -- what we are really pleased to show is that for the full year our Automotive margins were up 10 basis points and I would tell you that, that primarily came from SG&A leverage.","Matthew Fassler","I think all my follow-ups are probably going to relate to this question. First of all, if you think about FX and you think about translational impact versus transactional impact, it seems like you had some transactional friction in there. And if you could just tell us how big -- whether I'm right and how big a hit that was to you? In other words paying in dollars and selling in foreign currency?","Carol Yancey","Yes, we're not going to quantify what the transactional impact is, but just to say that it was somewhat of a headwind in our margins in Automotive in the fourth quarter. The currency was a little worse than what was anticipated and you certainly sell that on the top line. You sell that a bit and then margins as well.","Tom Gallagher","This is Tom. I might also add -- perhaps this might be helpful to you and others on the call and that is that our core NAPA business, the operating margins were strong and improved more than our overall automotive margins. The biggest contributor in the quarter, and frankly even on a year-to-date was the currency exchange and if you recall back to my guidance comments a few moments earlier, we said that automotive was going to be impacted by our estimate, 4 points on the revenue side in 2015. So what's happening outside of U.S. with the strength of the dollar is causing us to see the impact in a pretty heavy way.","Matthew Fassler ","Totally understood. Just two more very quick ones that follow from that initial response. As we think about -- was incentive compensation part of the equation? You clearly had a very good year in Automotive from a revenue perspective. Was there any catch-up for bonuses in fourth quarter? ","Carol Yancey","Absolutely. I'd point out again while we're pleased to see the great results in Automotive, the extent that we had on the top line, that flowed through on the incentives. So we had less of a favorable year if you will in the fourth quarter as it related to that incentive compensation. You're exactly right.","Matthew Fassler ","And then my final question relates to mix. So I know you spoke about customer mix and product mix really across the collective enterprise. If you think about Automotive, obviously the standout number was DIY or retail. Was that a part of the mix impact on margin? And if so, was that the innate mix -- the innate characteristic of that business, or what you had to do to capture that business? ","Carol Yancey","I guess I would say on the quarterly margins again for automotive, when we talk about the customer and product mix, the examples that they would point to our major account business and the AutoCare business as those businesses continue to have the strong growth. And when we talk about that being in a lower margin, also Paul called out a couple of product categories, one of them being T&E, batteries, our heavy duty products, that's sort of the product and customer mix that we're talking about. Certainly you had something that was more favorable on the retail side that those are unfavorable on the other side, on the commercial side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli ","Tom, you were able to outline the expected EPS impact for 2015 of roughly $0.15. Do you guys have a number for the fourth quarter? Is there a reason you can\u2019t give a little bit more detail on that?","Tom Gallagher","I don\u2019t think we have that number here, You can follow up with Sid and he might be able to give you a little more input on that, Scott.","Scot Ciccarelli ","Okay, all right. And then I guess a little bit follow up on Matt\u2019s question. You had retail sales outpace commercial in the quarter. I know it\u2019s on lower base but I guess -- why do you think you saw that shift? That\u2019s little bit more pronounced than what you guys have typically seen given your commercial focus, number one. Number two, is that a trend that you\u2019re expecting to continue for the next couple of quarters there?","Paul Donahue","Scott, this is Paul. Our retail business, we did have a good fourth quarter and we had a good year. Our overall retail business was high single digit year-over-year, and that scenario that we intend to continue to focus on. Now I do want to point out that we\u2019re not going to forget where we came from and that\u2019s our commercial wholesale business and that's still -- that\u2019s our bread and butter. But if we can pick up some share on the retail side, and as I mentioned Scott, it\u2019s with some of the very basic blocking tackling in relation some of the things our team is doing on the store hour side, staffing side, just compliance side with our planogram. So we\u2019re very pleased with our retail business and honestly if we can continue to grow that mid to high single digit in \u201815, we\u2019ll be pleased.","Scot Ciccarelli ","Got it. And how much would you attribute -- I know this always tricky to figure out. Historically we\u2019ve seen a little bit bigger impact from changing gas prices on the retail side and the commercial side. A, do you think that\u2019s an accurate statement, and B, is there any way to estimate that?","Paul Donahue","I\u2019ll give a shot, Scott. I think -- listen, the consumer has got, I think I read recently about $70 more disposable income in their pocket. Does that help our retail business? I think absolutely it does and how it impacts the commercial business? Well, if you look at what\u2019s happened with Miles Driven and the spike that we saw in late Q3, early Q4 in Miles Driven which are at some of the highest levels we\u2019ve seen in a number of years, that\u2019s going to drive -- obviously that drives our miles driven number up and that\u2019s going to increase our parts business overall.","Tom Gallagher","And Scott, I might add just one additional comment to Paul\u2019s and that is if we look at some of the discretionary items, I think we saw a little bit of an uptick in the flow through of those, which perhaps is attributable to more discretionary income.","Scot Ciccarelli ","And that will be mostly on the retail side where you saw that tone?","Tom Gallagher","Yes, it would be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Becks from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Mark Becks ","Just a follow up on that. Was the decline in gas prices, if you look at the 7% comps in the fourth quarter, it was roughly 200 basis point improvement on the two year. Anyway to sort of get a sense of how much of that is gas versus weather versus some of the internal company initiatives that you guys have been delivering upon.","Tom Gallagher","Mark, I don\u2019t think we can get that granular. There are just so many variables, it\u2019s really hard to try to pinpoint specifically which one is impacting it, we would just say that with the lower gas prices, it is positive and a significant positive for the automotive aftermarket in our opinion.","Mark Becks ","Okay. And then on the gross margin side, just trying to get an idea of the direction going forward in 4Q more specifically. Just curious; why was it so severe in the fourth quarter? Was it simply a compare issue, a LIFO? Was there any one-time things in there? And how do you feel about the ability for gross margin expansion in 2015? ","Tom Gallagher","If you look -- I might take a stab at it and then Carol will add more color. But if you look, first of all at Q4 last year, it was clearly the strongest gross margin quarter of the year and we were going up against a tough comparison there. As we think about gross margin across the enterprise in \u201815 all of our businesses have gross margin improvement initiatives and our expectation is that we will show some gross profit improvement over the course of 2015. ","Carol Yancey","Yet another thing I would add, the prior year fourth quarter we had more of a one-time non-recurring adjustment that didn\u2019t repeat in this year fourth quarter, which we knew all along because we've been staying around 30%. And the second thing I would say is, if you think about the volume incentives and our inventory was only up 3% for the year and our team has done a very good job of keeping that inventory down, certainly a good bit than the sales increase. So to the extent that we have volume incentives and those wouldn\u2019t have been necessarily at the same level, that was some pressure on gross margins. And also the Office Products margins were down 10 basis points for the year and that was primarily attributed to gross margin. So we \u2013 again we were in line with where we were for the full year at 30% and I think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption going forward.","Mark Becks ","Tom, you alluded to some gross margin initiative. To the extent on a call on a public forum you'd be willing to, can you share some of the specific margin improvement initiative that you guys are working on?","Tom Gallagher","Not we wouldn\u2019t want to get into the specifics. I would just say that we\u2019re looking at both sides of the equation and you've got buy side and sell side initiatives and we're working on both of those. ","Mark Becks ","And then one just quick follow up then lastly. On the guidance if you look at Automotive, you're expecting up 2% to 3% in the year, which is a little bit below what you delivered in fourth quarter. If we think about automotive margin profile in 2014, assuming you guys hit your sales guidance what does that suggest for automotive margins in 2015?","Tom Gallagher","Well, I'd first respond to that by just reminding that we're looking for our core Automotive to be up 6% to 7% before the impact of exchange rates and we think that all of our businesses can and should show operating margin improvement over the course of 2015.","Operator","Your next comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Hello? Nicole, we might need to go on. We didn\u2019t get anything come through on John Lovallo's call. We might need to go to the next caller.","Operator","Certainly. The next call is from Brian Sponheimer from Gabelli. Your line is open.","Brian Sponheimer","Hey it's Brian. Few things here. One within Motion, any impact from decline in price of oil in the quarter, particularly in some of those Western Canada markets you got into?","Tom Gallagher ","Yes Brian this is Tom. Certainly we're going to be impacted like anybody else that services the oil patch. I would say that for us it\u2019s a low single digit percentage of our total volumes. So while it's significant in terms of gross dollars, it's not as big as it might be for some others.","Brian Sponheimer","Low single digit of motion. ","Tom Gallagher","Of motion. And the other thing I would say is that importantly we are going to see a near term decline in demand coming out of those areas. But the segment is not going to go away. It's going contract but it's still going to be there. And potentially an offset for Motion is the lower fuel prices that Paul referenced, that give the consumer a more discretionary income and as that money starts to get spent, it will flow through other segments of the economy, which could and should impact in a positive way some of the other manufacturing customers that Motion deals with. So near term we think it will be a bit of a headwind. Medium and longer term we think it will probably balance out.","Brian Sponheimer","Just thinking about the fourth shut down. Have you guys seen any impact on some of your vendors been able to get product to you?","Tom Gallagher","We look at it a couple of ways; one, with what's happening with some of our vendors; and two, what's happening on some of the direct importing that we're doing. And what we've seen is I think most people are doing a pretty good job of working through the situation. I know in our own case we've had to divert shipments to other ports. So it has not had a significant impact on service levels but it has added to our lead times but it's something we're watching pretty carefully.","Brian Sponheimer","All right, and as I'm thinking about the guidance up 4%, that implies roughly speaking at the high end $15 billion revenue for 2015. What impact do you factor acquisitions for that? Is that the $390 million you referenced before?","Tom Gallagher","No in that would be the acquisitions that were completed in 2014. But we have not factored in anything for any future acquisitions. We do have the Miller Bearing acquisition in there that we mentioned promotion $40 million on an annualized run rate. But anything that happens subsequent is not factored in there.","Brian Sponheimer","And what's the non-comp revenue number that you're implying with that $16 billion.","Tom Gallagher","When you say non-comp?","Brian Sponheimer","Acquired business that you expect to flow through, is it upwards of 250 million?","Tom Gallagher","We don\u2019t have that here Brian. We can have Sid get back to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham ","My question is around NAPA. You mentioned that core NAPA operating margins were strong and improved overall auto margins in 4Q. Just to clarify, the NAPA U.S margins increased year over year in the fourth quarter and how did that compare to recent quarters trends?","Tom Gallagher","The margins improved on a quarterly basis and for the full year. So the NAPA organization performed quite well for us this year again. ","Seth Basham ","Got it. So the entire drag was really driven by business outside of the U.S.","Tom Gallagher","That\u2019s right.","Seth Basham ","And then\u2026.","Tom Gallagher","And Seth, just one other thing. That was due to a currency exchange. As Paul referenced we had local currency growth and improvement in these other businesses but when we translated, we lost all of that.","Seth Basham","Got it. Understood. Clearly you guys put up some good core numbers for NAPA U.S. Do you have a sense of where you might be taking share from? ","Paul Donahue","Hey Seth, this is Paul. That's always difficult to tell, especially as you look at some of the good numbers our publically traded competitors put out, but I would have to think that if we're taking a bit of share, it may be from of the smaller regional players that are out there, that perhaps are not growing quite at the level that we are and perhaps some of our publically traded competitors.","Seth Basham","Okay. And what about the independent side of the business in the U.S.? How did that perform, and are you acquiring more independents for that business? ","Tom Gallagher","Independent, the thing we liked about the performance honestly is how balanced it was. Both our Company store group and our independent group grew at comparable levels.","Paul Donahue","And to answer the second part of that question Seth, in terms of -- continue to expand our independent business and to our convert other independent owners out there, absolutely that's core to our business and something that our team is very focused on every year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Higginbotham from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Robert Higginbotham ","Question about a recent transaction in the Automotive space. Uni-Select recently sold their US Automotive business to Icahn. And so I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about what the new owner of that business might do with that asset; how you view that as either an opportunity maybe to pick up jobber stores, or a threat competitively. And actually on that front, when you look at other wholesale, independent versus owned store business models, you guys have been a clear standout in terms of consistently executing that business, where others have struggled. What would you point to as kind of your secret sauce to success? And what is and would be difficult for others to replicate?","Paul Donahue","Hey Robert, this is Paul. I'll take the first part of that question and I know you're referring to Uni-Select U.S. and the acquisition by Carl Icahn. Very early on in the process and honestly we probably know about as much as you do at this point. It does not change the competitive landscape. So Uni-Select U.S., I think I read where they were ranked as the No. 5 player in the U.S. So that doesn't really change the competitive landscape at all for us at this point. It may open up some opportunities and I would say that in terms of other Icahn owned business, which of course is Federal-Mogul, they are a long time supplier to NAPA, they are a long time supplier to our industry and they are a good supplier. So for us at this point, until we learn a whole lot more Robert, it's essentially business as usual.","The second part of your question then, as it relates to the secret sauce, I don\u2019t know that we have any secret sauce. We have a good strategy each year. We tend to stick to our core. We have a very good group of independent entrepreneurial owners in the marketplace who are very good at what they do and we provide them what we think is best in class training and programs to enable them to compete everyday out there on the street. And so if there is any secret sauce, that may be the takeaway.","Robert Higginbotham ","Okay. And switching gears to Office Products, how should we think about the potential impact of the pending Staples\/Office Depot merger? Could you help us at least maybe size what you see the opportunity -- and risk on the flip side of that of being to maybe gaining some first call volumes; and again on the flipside maybe potentially losing some first call volumes. And then how to think about just overall margin trends, as presumably that bigger entity will push you on price.","Tom Gallagher","Robert, I'll take a stab at that and I start by saying that these are both good companies and this transaction seems to make good strategic sense for each of them. As you probably know they're both fine customers to S.P. Richards who are first call with Office Depot; and we've got a significant second call position with Staples. From the published reports, and that's all we can go on but from the published reports that we've seen, the transaction is probably going to be consummated toward the later part of the year. So between now and then it's business as usual and we're going to continue to provide the best service that we can provide, and the best support that we can provide to both entities, and certainly post transaction will hope to be the first call -- a wholesale provider to the new entity. As far as trying to size it, we wouldn\u2019t want to get into that here. But we\u2019re optimistic about what\u2019s going to happen in the future. We think there is a lot of upside there potentially. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from BB&T. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan ","Most have been hit, but could we talk a little bit about the Mexico initiative? I think you were ramping that up in the fall of 2014; and maybe some early signs on success there?","Paul Donahue","Yes, absolutely, Bret, we did launch our NAPA Mexico initiative back in October. We opened our distribution center and a number of company owned stores in the marketplace. It\u2019s very early on. We\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making and it\u2019s going to be a long initiative for us for sure. But in the early days we\u2019re pleased with the progress that our team is making down there.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then one follow-up question on an earlier topic and you're picking up independent distributors and clearly there's been some transition out there on the Carquest side. Could you give us any color? Have you added -- and the numbers that you have added to Carquest, ex-Carquest distributors? ","Tom Gallagher","This is Tom, Bret. I think the way we\u2019d like to answer that is that we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made to-date. We continue to see opportunities and we think we\u2019ll continue to make progress but we would not want to disclose the absolute numbers.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Melich ","I had one follow-up on the margin progression on the guidance, and then a little more mechanical question for Carol. First, it sounds like although margins were down only because of FX in the fourth quarter, and so when you look at your guidance for this year, when you say that you expect the margins to be up, is that in core in Auto? Or do you think that once you bring in the FX, they could actually be down a bit at least for the first few quarters? ","Carol Yancey","I guess our gross margin guidance that we would be giving would be in total, since we don\u2019t really get into it by segment. And I think our around 30% guidance assumes probably flattish in all of our businesses. I think the operating margin improvement that we\u2019ve talked about in each of our segments and we\u2019ve talked about the 10 to 20 basis point improvement and coming off of this year and have 30 basis points, we\u2019ve been really pleased to see that, that we\u2019ve got certainly some headwinds going into 2015. That's primarily going to probably more come through the SG&A line more so than the growth margin line.","Bret Jordan","And then, Carol, on working capital, given the nice improvement that you saw, if I\u2019m not mistaken the cash from ops actually came in a little bit lower than the guidance you had earlier in the year. I think it was 900 million and ended up being about 100 million less than that. What was driving that? Was that the receivable growth that you talked about? And could you help explain a little bit what your business has been and how that will normalize? Thanks. ","Carol Yancey","Yes. So, you\u2019re right. We were a little bit short what we had anticipated from our cash from activities and I would tell you the two primary areas for accounts receivable that you mentioned and that's primarily in the Automotive and Office Sector and again with the stronger revenue growth in what we had, on some of that is we have additional terms. I would tell that our day sales outstanding, we look at it over the course of the couple years. In the past four years that\u2019s been flat. So we\u2019ve been pleased to see that.","The second factor in working capital was accounts payable which you mentioned and it goes to a little bit earlier when I mentioned our team really did a good job in the inventory area. So we had in a couple of the segments and it was certainly Industrial and Electrical that slowed down their purchases if you will. So you didn\u2019t see as much on the accounts payable side. And then the other thing is on automotive, which is certainly where we see a lot of the improved terms, we have anniversaried some of those. And it was largely a timing thing that we didn\u2019t have as much coming into the quarter. So we\u2019re looking for improvement on those lines. And again, it was a strong number but not quite where we thought it would be. ","Greg Melich ","Would it be fair to sum up that last year\u2019s earlier goal, the $900 million, included a bigger working capital benefit? Instead now you\u2019re going to see that benefit over a few years, and that\u2019s why now we\u2019re using $800 million to $850 million. Is that a fair summary? ","Carol Yancey","I think that\u2019s a fair summary, yes. And I think that and we don\u2019t talk about it as much is our [indiscernible] to inventory was 84% this year and 77% last year. So it\u2019s improvement each year but I think it spread out over little longer period.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Carol Yancey","We want to thank you for your participation today and your support of Genuine Parts Company and we look forward to reporting back to you in April after our first quarter numbers.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Sid Jones","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company first quarter 2019 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2019. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.

Good morning and thank you for joining us for our 2019 first quarter conference call. Earlier today, we released our first quarter 2019 results. I will make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our businesses. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2019. After that, we'll open the call to your questions.","To recap our first quarter performance across our global platform, total sales were $4.7 billion, up 3.3% from Q1 of 2018, driven by 3.3% comp sales increase and a 2% benefit from strategic acquisitions, net of a 2% headwind from foreign currency translation. Net income in the first quarter was $160 million and earnings per share were $1.09. Excluding the impact of currency losses and transaction and other costs related to the sale of Auto Todo, one of our two automotive parts businesses in Mexico, adjusted net income was $187 million, or $1.28 per share, up 1% from adjusted EPS in Q1 of 2018.","Overall, our sales and earnings were in line with our plan for the first quarter, which assumed a stronger currency headwind than we were expecting for the full year, as well as one less selling day relative to Q1 last year. In addition, as discussed in our year-end call, our plans accounted for the sale of the Auto Todo business. We can report we've successfully closed on the sale of this business in the month of March.","We are pleased to report another quarter of positive sales comps across each of our business segments, while also benefiting from the favorable impact of ongoing strategic acquisitions. Our sales performance was indicative of the continued improvement in our U.S. automotive business. And the steady growth we continue to generate in our Australasian and Canadian operations.","Our strength in these areas offset the pressure on our core automotive results in Europe related to mild winter weather and broad economic and political considerations. In addition, our industrial business remain strong and we made further progress in stabilizing the business products group.","Turning to a review of our business segment, total sales in our Global Automotive Group were up 2.3%. This includes a 3.1% comp sales increase and a 2.9% benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation of 3.4% along with the impact from the sale of Auto Todo.","Breaking it down further, sales for our U.S. automotive division were up 2.5% in the first quarter, with comp sales at 3.5%. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of improved sales comps and reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. automotive aftermarket, as well as the effective execution of our ongoing initiatives to drive both DIFM and DIY sales growth.","To sum it up, we believe the aftermarket has benefited from a second consecutive normalized winter and ongoing sound fundamentals. These positive factors led to improved sales growth with both our commercial and retail customers. Sales to the DIFM segment, which represents 75% to 80% of our total U.S. automotive sales were driven by improved results across our primary commercial programs, both NAPA AutoCare Centers and major accounts.","NAPA AutoCare is an industry leading commercial program for our independent repair customers and a key sales driver for us. We entered 2019 with over 18,000 members and sales to NAPA AutoCare Center customers were up 5% in the first quarter, following approximately 3.5% growth in 2018, and the strongest growth for this program since the first quarter of 2016.","In addition, sales to our major account partners were up 2.2% in the quarter. This improvement follows basically flat year-over-year sales in 2018, and represents the strongest quarterly sales performance for this group in three years.","Major accounts, which include fleet and government customers, national tire centers, and OE dealers among others, are a large and important customer segment for us. And the positive sales trend with these accounts is significant.","We want to recognize our NAPA AutoCare and our major account teams for their hard work in driving growth with these key customers. We're also pleased with the positive sales results in our retail business as the initiatives such as the NAPA rewards program, which has now reached 10 million members strong and still growing, expanded store hours across our network and our retail impact store project, continue to make a difference and drive steady growth.","With the rollout of the retail impact initiative completed in our company owned stores, these stores are outperforming and driving stronger retail sales growth than in our independent. So as we look ahead to the multi-year implementation of this initiative in our independent NAPA stores, which we began in 2018, we see opportunities to drive additional retail sales through our NAPA network in the period ahead.","Turning to NAPA Canada, we took advantage of mid-single digit comp sales and the added benefit of accretive tuck-in acquisitions to produce another quarter of solid results. We were especially encouraged by the step up in comp sales relative to last year, and importantly this converted to improved operating profit. So our Canadian operations are performing well, and we expect to build on this trend in the quarters ahead.","As I mentioned earlier, we closed down the sale of Auto Todo, our legacy automotive business in Mexico. This business generated $100 million in annual revenues, and was not a significant contributor to our overall profitability. ","Going forward, our focus will be on expanding our presence in Mexico under the NAPA banner. In Europe, the first quarter presented a challenging sales environment due to the combined impact of a mild winter across most of the regions which we operate. The continued disruption of business associated with Brexit concerns in the UK, social unrest in France and the overall softening economic environment. While these factors pressured our core automotive growth in Europe, AAG\u2019s acquisition activity more than offset the decrease in comp sale.","2018 acquisitions such as TMS and Platinum in the UK, and the Hennig Group acquired in Q1 which expands our presence in Germany have been accretive to our sales and earnings, and we're excited to have these businesses as a part of our AAG operations.","In March, we also announced the acquisition of PartsPoint Group in the Netherlands, which we expect to close on in June of this year. PartsPoint is a leading supplier of automotive parts and accessories in the Benelux marketplace, with a network of one national distribution center, six regional warehouses and 147 branches. This new business is an excellent strategic fit for AAG and we're excited for the opportunities we see in the Netherlands and Belgium. We expect PartsPoint to generate estimated annual revenues of $330 million and we look forward to welcoming CEO and Managing Director, Cor Baltus and the entire PartsPoint team to the AAG and GPC family.","So, despite the current challenges we face in Europe, our team is fully prepared to push through these near-term issues via the continued execution of their growth plans, and cost savings initiatives. We remain confident in the growth potential we see for our European operations over the longer term.","In Australia and New Zealand, we produced another quarter of steady growth, with low to mid-single digit sales increases for both total and comp sales. We're also pleased that the Asia-Pac team further improved on their operating results. This business unit continues to operate very well. And with the backdrop of economic stability and sound aftermarket fundamentals, we expect to see additional growth in our Australasian automotive business in the quarters ahead.","In summary, our global Automotive Group posted solid overall results in the first quarter, despite the slowing we experienced in our core automotive business in Europe. Our team in Europe has initiated plans to address these concerns and we move forward with expectations for additional sales growth and operating improvement over the balance of the year.","Turning to our Industrial Parts Group, this business continued its long run of consistent sales increases, with first quarter sales of $1.6 billion, up 5.7% including 4.2% comp sales growth, plus a 1.8% benefit of acquisitions, which was partially offset by a slight currency headwind. As a reminder, our recent acquisitions include the October 2018 addition of a hydraulic supply company, a fluid power distributor, in the March addition of Axis Automation, a leading automation in robotics business that further expands our capabilities in the area of industrial plant floor automation.","Overall, our Q1 results were driven by the effective execution of our growth initiatives and the generally favorable economic and industry specific factors, which continue to benefit the industrial marketplace. As we move forward, we remain focused on our key growth initiatives and those factors we control to drive additional sales and earnings growth.","Looking at our product and industry sector sales performance, 13 and 14 major product groups posted sales gains, with especially strong results in the material handling and hose and pumps category. Additionally, 9 of the top 12 industries where we compete had sales increases consistent with last quarter, highlighted by strong growth in the iron and steel, automotive, aggregate and cement and fabricated metal product sectors for the second consecutive quarter. Offsetting these positive results were softer sales and the electrical specialties group. And our team is working hard to improve the sales performance for this group going forward.","As we look to the balance of the year, we remain confident in the growth outlook for our North American industrial business. In addition, we are excited for the opportunity to expand our industrial footprint into Australasia later this year, as we expect to acquire the balance of Inenco.","This Australian based industrial distribution company has operations in New Zealand, as well as a growing presence in Indonesia and Singapore. In 2017, GPC made a 35% investment in Inenco and they have performed extremely well, while growing both top and bottom-line for past two years. Inenco's current annual sales are approximately $400 million and the business is a solid strategic fit with motion industries. Aligning well with our global supplier base, and providing for a market leading presence in Australasia, Indonesia, and Singapore.","We will wrap up our business unit updates with S.P Richards, our Business Products Group. We have been pleased to stabilize this business over the last two quarters. In Q1, sales were up 1% for both total sales and comp sales. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive comp sales, driven by improved sales in three of our four product categories, including positive results in core office supplies, technology and facilities and safety supplies category.","Most encouraging is our sales to our independent reseller, national account and internet reseller customers, which were all positive. We believe that our growth and these product categories and customer channels reflect the opportunities we have to further grow the business, as the only independent national business products wholesaler in the U.S. We will continue to invest in these growth opportunities where and when appropriate.","So that is a recap of our consolidated and business segment results for the first quarter of 2019. As stated earlier, we are pleased to report results that were in line with our plans for the quarter. And we are confident that the progress we made in Q1 will set us up for a successful 2019 and an even brighter future for GPC over the longer term.","With that, I'll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide our updated outlook for 2019. Our total sales of $4.7 billion in the first quarter were up 3.3%, driven by improved sales in each of our business segments. Our gross margin for the quarter was 31.8% compared to 31.3% in 2018, with the improvement in margin relating to several factors.","Primarily the increase reflects higher margins in our automotive and industrial businesses due to their ongoing margin initiatives, including global supplier negotiations, more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies and favorable product mix.","In addition, the increase in supplier incentives due to improved volumes for these segments also had a positive impact on gross margins. In the Business Products Group, our gross margin was pressured due to unfavorable shifts in product and customer mix.","Moving forward we continue to expect our 2019 gross margin rate to remain relatively in line with our current run rate, assuming reasonable inflation of 1% to 2% and consistent levels of volume incentives. The pricing environment remain inflationary across our businesses in the first quarter with tariff price increases for raw materials, commodities and supplier freight each having an impact on our total costs.","We continue to pass along our price increases to customers to protect our gross profit dollars and to maintain our gross margin wherever the market conditions will allow. And we would say that the current levels of inflation have been a net positive to our results. We expect this to continue through the balance of 2019. Our supplier price increases thus far in 2019 have impacted our purchases by one half of 1% in automotive, 1.2% in industrial and 2% in office.","Turning to our SG&A, these expenses were $1.2 billion in the first quarter and represents 25.3% of sales. These operating costs were up from last year as a result of several factors including the effect of rising costs in areas such as payroll, freight and delivery, IT and cyber security, as well as the loss of leverage on our expenses in Europe related to the slowdown in their core sales.","To offset these and other increases, we continue to work towards a lower costs, but highly effective infrastructure in the quarters ahead. Our plans include steps to effectively integrate our acquisitions to drive facility consolidations, productivity solutions, and other initiatives that will drive efficiencies across all our operations. We expect to benefit from these initiatives and other cost control measures across our operations in the quarters ahead.","Moving down the income statement, we would point you to the other non-operating expenses line. The change in this line primarily reflects the $27 million realized currency loss related to the divestiture of Auto Todo as noted earlier.","Now let's discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $2.6 billion, up 2.3% from the prior year, and our operating profit of $179 million was down 3%, with an operating margin is 6.8% compared to 7.2% margin in the first quarter of 2018. So while we're seeing improvement on our gross margin line, we continue to be impacted by the rising costs. And we were also impacted by the deleveraging of expenses in Europe. ","With that said, several of our automotive operations produced improved operating results in the quarter and we expect to see more improvement in the periods ahead. Our industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, a solid 6% increase from Q1 of 2018. Our operating profit of $121 million is up 8% and our operating margin improved to 7.4% from 7.2% last year, with the 20 basis point increase due to gross margin expansion and the ability to leverage their expenses.","The industrial business has been operating well for nine consecutive quarters and remain strong as we head into the second quarter.","Our business products revenues were $479 million, up 1% from the prior year and their operating profit of $21 million is 4.4% of sales, which is down slightly from 2018. We've been pleased to stabilize this business over the last few quarters and we're working hard to improve their operating results.","Our total company operating profit in the first quarter was up 1% on a 3% sales increase, and our operating profit margin was 6.8% compared to 6.9% last year. This follows two consecutive quarters of margin expansion and we are planning for improved margins again in the quarters ahead. We had net interest expense of $23 million in the first quarter, which was flat from the first quarter of the prior year.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect net interest expense to hold steady and to be in the $91 million to $93 million range for the full year. Our total amortization expense was $23 million for the first quarter, and for 2019 we expect full year amortization of approximately $92 million.","Depreciation expense was $39 million and the first quarter and we continue to expect depreciation of $170 million to $180 million for the year. On a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million for 2019.","Continuing with the segment information presented in our press release the other line which primarily represents our corporate expense was $64 million in the first quarter, which includes $34 million in transaction and other costs related to the sale of Auto Todo. Excluding these costs, our corporate expense was $30 million, which is a slight improvement from 2018 when we adjust for the $13 million in transaction and other costs that was reported last year.","For 2019, we continue to expect our corporate expense to be in the $125 million to $135 million range. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 24.2%, which is an increase from the 23% rate in the prior year, but likely our lowest quarterly rate for the year. For the full year we continue to expect our 2019 tax rate to be approximately 25%.","Now let's turn to the balance sheet which remains in strong and excellent condition. Our accounts receivable of 2.7 billion is up 4% from the prior year, and this compares to our 3.3% sales increase for the first quarter. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at March 31 was $3.7 billion, which was down 2% from March of last year. This improvement reflects the positive impact of our current initiatives to improve the inventory levels in our core businesses and we remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward.","Our accounts payable of $4.1 billion is up 8%, due mainly to the increase in purchasing volume, as well as the benefit of improved payment terms with key global partners. At March 31st, our AP to inventory ratio stands at 110%.","Our total debt of $3.4 billion at March 31, is up slightly from the $3.3 billion in 2018. We remain comfortable with our current debt structure, and we have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our future growth initiatives and our ongoing priorities for effective capital allocation.","In the first quarter, we generated $62 million in cash from operations and for 2019, we continue to expect $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash from operations. And free cash flow, which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. These estimates are in line with the solid cash flows generated last year and continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of cash which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our key priorities for cash remain reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions and the dividend. Regarding the dividend, 2019 marks our 63rd consecutive annual increase for the dividend paid to our shareholders. Our dividend of $3.05 represented a 6% increase from 2018 and is approximately 54% of our 2018 adjusted earnings, which is in line with our targeted payout ratio.","We invested $46 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019, which was up from $32 million in 2018. This reflects the planned increase in our investment in areas such as technology and productivity in our facilities. And for the full year, we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $300 million.","Regarding our share repurchase program, we currently have 16.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. Thus far in 2019, we have not made any purchases under the program as we have been active with other investment opportunities, such as M&A and capital expenditures. ","Moving forward, we expect to be active in the program as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","Now let's discuss our current outlook for 2019. We are reaffirming our full year 2019 sales and earnings guidance established in February. Our outlook is based on several factors, including our performance in the first quarter, our current growth plans and initiative and the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future across our operations.","In addition, we took into account the impact of a strong U.S. dollar and continue to estimate a 1% currency headwind for the full year. Although we do expect this to be greater than 1% again in the second quarter, which is similar to the first quarter.","Finally, our outlook account for one additional selling day in the third quarter relative to 2018 to make up for the one less selling day in the first quarter this year. With these factors in mind, we reaffirm our outlook for total sales in 2019 of plus 3% to plus 4%, or plus 4% to plus 5% before the 1% headwind from currency translations. As is customary, this guidance excludes the benefit of any future acquisitions.","By business, we continue to guide to plus 2.5% to plus 3.5% sales growth for the automotive segment, or plus 4.5% to plus 5.5% before the impact of an approximate 2% currency headwind, plus 5% to plus 6% total sales growth for our Industrial segment, and flat total sales for our Business Products segment.","On the earning side, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.56 to $5.71, which accounts for the transaction and other costs incurred in the first quarter. We're also reiterating our outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $5.75 to $5.90, or $5.81 to $5.96, before the impact of the 1% currency headwind. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes any first quarter as well as any future transaction or other costs.","We are optimistic that our management teams have the plans and initiatives in place to show additional progress in 2019, and to successfully operate through the near-term challenges in Europe, as well as the potential for a slowing industrial economy. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our broad and growing business platform, which provides us with the same long-term growth opportunities.","So that completes our financial update. And we're pleased to report results that were in line with our plans for the quarter. And we made progress in several important areas that better position us for the future. ","Paul, I'll turn it back over to you. ","Paul Donahue ","Thanks, Carol. We entered 2019 excited for the opportunity to build on the positive momentum generated last year. And for the first quarter, we were pleased to report accomplishments in a number of areas. ","Our total sales and earnings were in line with our plan. Our teams produce positive sales comp in each of our business segments; we experienced the continued strengthening of our U.S. automotive business; we reported another quarter of consistent and steady growth in our Canadian and Australasian automotive businesses, our industrial business remain strong and continues to perform well; we further stabilized our results in our Business Products Group; we closed on two accretive acquisitions, Hennig Group for the automotive business and Axis in industrial.","We closed on the sale of our legacy Auto Todo business in Mexico. And finally, we announced entry into the Benelux region of Europe with the addition of PartsPoint Group planned for June of 2019.","We enter the second quarter of 2019 focused on further strengthening of our global platform, driving consistent and sustainable sales growth and improving our operating results. We plan to support these objectives with a strong balance sheet, strong cash flows, and effective capital allocation. We believe our continued focus in these areas will create significant value for our shareholders as we move forward through the year.","These are exciting times to Genuine Parts Company and we're optimistic for the future and the additional growth opportunities we see across all of our businesses. As always, we look forward to updating you on our progress when we report again.","So with that, we'll turn it back to the operator and Carol and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","Carol Yancey","And before we turn to Q&A this morning we want to mention that we're going to have our inaugural Investor Day at GPC's headquarters in Atlanta on Tuesday, June 4th. We will also have a store tour and reception beginning on the afternoon of June 3rd. This event is for institutional investors and analysts and will be a great opportunity to hear from our business leaders. If you're interested in joining us or have any questions, please email us at investor_day@genpt.com. Operator, please continue.","Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good morning. ","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Chris. ","Christopher Horvers","Can you -- just first that clarification the 3.5% U.S. that includes a headwind for one less day or that excludes that headwind?","Paul Donahue","Yes, that includes Chris. ","Christopher Horvers","So it would have been 4.0 ex-that, is that right?","Carol Yancey","Well, we would give -- we would say it's about 1.5%, 1.6% for the shorter day in the quarter. So probably more like a 5% on an average day basis.","Christopher Horvers","Average daily basis. Got it. And then in terms of -- I want to dig in a little bit on the cadence both in the U.S. business, U.S. NAPA business, as well as in Motion. So maybe first on the U.S., the U.S. NAPA business, was there a lot of noise around tax refunds or weather in February, how would you describe the overall cadence of the business? And then on Motion, you did a six in the fourth quarter, which decelerated pretty sharply. How would you describe sort of cadence to that business, and then how you're thinking about that going forward?","Paul Donahue ","Yes. So we'll start with U.S. automotive Chris, and pleased to report that business got stronger as the quarter progress. So, January soft out of the gates a little bit with a warmer first half of January polar vortex kicked in, in the second half and we\u2019ve really took off from there, we had a good February and a better March for the automotive parts business.","On the industrial side, pretty consistent and one thing I'd point out Chris, when you mentioned the slowdown. The industrial business if you break out just the core motion business, that business was up 7% in the quarter which is pretty consistent with where we've been the last really two plus years. The Motion business, as you look at the average daily sales really good January, softened a bit in February and then rebounded nicely again in March.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then typically if you could just maybe share some light on April and refresh on what the U.S. NAPA business look like last year from a cadence perspective, in 2Q I think that some of the more DIY-oriented auto parts retailers out there talked about, April being pretty tough because of the weather last year. Is that something that you experienced and could you share any comments on how things are trending now?","Paul Donahue ","Well, Chris, there's not a lot we can say at this point about Q2. The one thing I would mention then and we always end up talking a good bit about weather on these calls. Blizzard in early April are necessarily great for the automotive parts business where we're ready to get into the spring selling season break fees.","And so it's early yet, but look, what we're encouraged mostly about Chris is the turnaround we're seeing in our U.S. automotive business. We have new leadership in place, we've seen steady improvement over the past few quarters. The weather has certainly normalized with the exception of what we saw in early April. Industry fundamentals continue to be really sound and we're seeing nice improvements in our -- both our AutoCare and our major account business on the DIFM side. So, lot to be encouraged about as it relates to our U.S. automotive business.","Christopher Horvers","Super, have the great rest of the year, guys.","Paul Donahue ","Thanks, Chris. ","Carol Yancey"," Thanks, Chris. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Scot Ciccarelli ","Good morning, guys.","Paul Donahue ","Good morning. ","Scot Ciccarelli ","Hi. Sounds like there's a lot of moving pieces on the auto side that impacted EBIT margins. Can you provide some more color specifically on what you saw with the U.S. auto margins, please?","Carol Yancey","Yes, so as it relates to our automotive margins, and we kind of as we talked about in our comments, we have seen continued improvement from our automotive gross margins and that would be across the board and also include U.S. automotive. So gross margins has been improved for all of last year. We're running on probably six or seven quarters.","When we look at our U.S. SG&A, little bit of headwinds there that we've called out before, but what I would tell you is they were more flattish. And so we had improved margins for Canada, for Australasia, flattish for U.S., and as we mentioned, with kind of a loss of leverage for Europe that's where we really saw the pressure in our automotive margins.","Scot Ciccarelli ","So just to be very specific, so flat U.S. EBIT margins, is that basically what the message is? ","Carol Yancey","Yes. ","Scot Ciccarelli ","Got it. Okay. And then can you clarify your comment regarding inflation, when you talk about your costs of goods change that you already highlighted for the different categories, is that all the flow through? Because I thought the expectation was a little bit higher inflation than what you pointed out specifically on the auto side?","Carol Yancey","Yes, so what I commented on is the price increases we've received thus far in Q1 on our purchases. And when we look forward, what our full year expectations are, we would say for automotive, for example, they were only up half a point in Q1. And some of that is flowing through to the sales line, and obviously, for all of our businesses.","But as you know, the timing and the way that that can be passed through, you're probably getting more like half of that benefit that's flowing through on the top line. But our full year inflation expectations for automotive would be more like 1% to 1.25% on a full year basis. And then for industrial and business products, probably more like a 2%.","Scot Ciccarelli ","Got it. Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. ","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of clerical ones upfront. What was the difference between the U.S. auto up 2.5% and the comp 3.5%, did you close doors or something else that caused that spread?","Paul Donahue","Well, it's a combination of things, Chris, your comment of closed stores is accurate from a year ago. But there's also consolidation of stores, as well as stores that we sold off. So if you go back a year ago from Q1, it was about -- the impact was about 60 stores that were -- that would fall in one of those buckets of consolidated closed or sold. And that was the explanation for the difference in the comp versus total.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. That's really helpful. Okay. And then Easter. So last year, Easter was like a combined one point headwind for the Northeaster [ph] and the Easter shift. So what I understand how much you think you benefit of this quarter from Easter? And then similarly, what do you think the headwind will be for Q2 as we kind of think through the cadence?","Paul Donahue","Yes, so Chris last year. I believe our comment was it was about a half point. And we feel that's about what we've picked up in Q1 of this year. So as we look at April falling in -- or Easter falling into April, we would expect it to be about the same.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay, got you. Okay. And then my first real question, I know this is a lot. But -- so Europe, I guess, one key quantify, that you are going to grow, I don\u2019t think you've done that yet. And then two, if I'm following the call correctly, Europe's about 20% of your automotive sales or it sounds like it drove that 40 basis points margin decline. So is that right that 20% of your business drove a 40 basis points decline?","Paul Donahue","Well, let me comment on your first question on the overall comp. I think you asked that did you not Chris for Europe.","Chris Bottiglieri","Yes, for Europe, please. That will be really helpful. The comp in the prior acquisitions.","Paul Donahue","Yes, so our total sales were up high-single digits in Europe, which was largely driven by acquisitions if you go back and look pure organic, and that would be between the UK, France and Germany. Our organic would be down about 1% year-over-year.","Carol Yancey","And just a comment on the automotive margins, as we've mentioned before, our European business does carry a higher operating margin than what the total number is. So there's 1% comp decline and knowing that we really can't leverage on that. And look, our teams have got plans in place to address that over the balance of the year. But how quickly that happened in the quarter and then being able to react to it did drive the basis point decline in the quarter.","But again, we're working hard to turn that around over the balance of the year. And I would tell you in the balance of the year, we would expect to show margin improvement on a full year basis of more in the magnitude of 10 to 15 basis points for both automotive and in total.","Paul Donahue","Chris, just an additional comment or two about Europe since you raised the question. We see the issues that we're facing there, which I think a number of companies are facing is largely transitory. And you've couple some of the economic what we believe are short-term challenges with the fact that in our markets between the UK, France and Germany they literally had no winter weather.","And just as we see here, we never talk about the weather in Europe, but just as it impacts our U.S. automotive business that had a huge impact on our European business. So few short-term challenges, but ones that we believe are largely transitory and we'll get by.","Chris Bottiglieri","That makes a lot of sense. Good luck. Thank you.","Paul Donahue","Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Great. Thanks, guys. From a foreign exchange standpoint, when do you think the year-over-year impact starts to reverse or improve, because you're only expecting about a 1% headwind for the year and it was a 2% headwind this quarter. So, do you think there's a risk to the 2019 outlook if foreign exchange plays out somewhat differently than the way you're modeling?","Carol Yancey","Yes, so a couple comments, as we mentioned earlier, we do expect you to be very similar to Q1. So definitely a greater impact in Q2 at a similar rate as it was in Q1. So we would expect to see it a little bit better for Q3 and Q4. We based our guidance and we've modeled that full year 1% based on the rate that we started with at the beginning of the year. As we look ahead, we think that's still appropriate, but obviously we'll continue to keep an eye on that over the balance of the year.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Okay, great. And how quickly can you adjust pricing or anything else or your contracts to offset factors like both the supply or price increases or foreign exchange and when there are a rapid changes, is it a three months impact or six months? Like how long is that usually an impact on your earnings?","Carol Yancey","Yes, look I would say our teams have done a really good job in the gross margin area, and we're balancing a lot of things that are coming in. So with having more of an inflationary environment has given us an opportunity to drive a little bit of lift in our gross margins. We are balancing any currency impact that comes into there. And then, as we look at what our pricing constraints may be, we also look at pricing opportunities. As we've mentioned before, both our automotive team and industrial teams are doing a lot around pricing, data analytics, their pricing strategy and being more nimble and being able to react quicker. ","So, we are obviously looking at that as it relates to the market and the competitive environment. But again, if we just look at our gross margin, we feel like we've done a pretty good job of getting those pass through.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Great, thank you. ","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. ","Bret Jordan","Good morning, guys. ","Carol Yancey","Good morning. ","Bret Jordan","On the European business I guess, could you sort of bucket what was winter versus the economic issues you referenced maybe as far as impact?","Paul Donahue","It's hard to say Bret, how it splits out between the two both are certainly impactful. I would say though, if you were to ask me, which was more impactful in the quarter. I would say it was the weather. And, look the European economy has not been the greatest in the last few quarters. So the outlier is that really, really warm weather they had in Q1 that really impacted the business, especially as it relates to a lot of our winter goods category categories that were impacted greatly in the quarter.","So hard to break it down specifically, but if you were to ask me, I'd say weather was more impactful than some of the economic issues.","Bret Jordan","So how is the cadence, I guess, is the cadence stabilizing or did it improve as the quarter went as you got out of the cold weather selling season or is it just continuing to drag?","Paul Donahue","It was pretty flat throughout the quarter. I mean, pretty straightforward. You've heard me mentioned earlier, our total sales in Europe are up high-single digit, our comps were down one which were pretty consistent through the three month period.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then, Carol, as far as payables in Europe, how you find the ability to manage the working capital over there with a few deals done now?","Carol Yancey","Yes, so great question. And we still continue to believe and are pleased to see some improvement in our synergies, both from margin initiatives and on the payable side. So in working with a lot of our global suppliers, we do have programs that have been put in place, we have additional terms that have been negotiated, those will be falling more in the second half of the year. And that's actually been factored into our working capital guidance that we've given.","So those are actually coming along quite well. And there's even an offset that comes to the U.S. where we're getting some improved terms based on European supplier relationships. So it actually works on both sides.","Bret Jordan","Great. And then, Paul, one last question on U.S. auto, could you comment on any major regional dispersion that either outperformance or underperformance in the U.S.?","Paul Donahue","Yes, much like Q4, Bret, the strength and not surprisingly is those cold weather region. So our best performing region again in Q1 was our Midwest team who had just an outstanding quarter followed right closely by our Central Division and our Mountain Division also had a very strong quarter. Northeast was good.","And then trailing those four northern divisions would be our southern businesses, which were flat to down -- or flat to up low-single digit, good business but certainly the outliers were the strong performance in our northern divisions.","Bret Jordan","All right, great, thank you. ","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Montani ","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask first of if I could, for Carol, with the 3% plus organic growth, just wanted to think through for the remainder of the year what kind of organic growth do you think you would need to show leverage on SG&A given some of the headwinds that you had flagged?","Carol Yancey","Yes, so as we mentioned, and we are definitely seeing that operating margin improvement on our industrial business, and again, that's coming through there greater comp, and we're seeing the nice improvement there.","On the automotive side are and we've pointed out our U.S. automotive, even with a comp of 3.5%, while those margins were flat in Q1, that's the best they have been in eight quarters. We've seen tremendous progress they've made in some areas such as payroll and freight with some of their investments. ","So some of the things that are staying in the SG&A, which would -- whether it's depreciation and IT and some of the investments we're making and still some headwinds on payroll and freight. We're definitely making progress. And I would say by the end of the year, we would see margin improvement. So we're close to having that comp now and as we kind of mentioned, Europe was the one thing that was really a headwind on the margin. ","So certainly end of the year if comp stay in that 3% to 4% range, we would expect to have that 10 to 15 basis point margin improvement.","Michael Montani ","Okay. And then if I could, just from an U.S. Automotive perspective, I was hoping that you guys could unpack a little bit kind of the traffic versus ticket dynamic within 3.5% comp. And then secondly, I apologize if I had missed this, but did you give a split in terms of the DIY versus the DIFM comp?","Paul Donahue ","Yes. Mike, I'll take both of those. The -- between DIFM and DIY, both showed positive sales growth in Q1 and both were up in the low to mid-single digits range. So we're pleased with the growth we're seeing in both. Even more pleasing is the fact that for another quarter, I believe in fact two quarters in a row now, we've seen improvement in our number of invoices running through our stores, but also the average ticket size coming through. ","And as you know, Mike in recent quarters, while we've seen an increase in the size of the invoice, our number of tickets were down, very pleased to report this quarter that we're seeing a lift in both for the second consecutive quarter. So great job by our team in the U.S.","Michael Montani ","Great, thank you. ","Paul Donahue ","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Sponheimer","Hi, it\u2019s Brian Sponheimer pinch hitting for Carolina. ","Carol Yancey","Good morning. ","Brian Sponheimer","Hi, everybody. Couple of questions on the acquisitions that you've made in Europe and maybe the valuation multiples that you're seeing their relative to the attractiveness of making similar acquisitions in your core markets.","Paul Donahue ","Well, Brian, a couple of comments. So the couple of acquisitions that we've done, one which we closed on, which was Hennig, which is an automotive parts business in Germany that closed earlier in Q1. And then, we recently announced PartsPoint Group out of the Netherlands and Belgium, which we hope to close in early June.","I would say from a valuation and multiple standpoint it's very similar to what we've seen in the U.S. these are not -- these businesses we've got relationships with again much like our approach here in the U.S., Brian. And we're not getting into bidding war auctions with private equity. So it's been very same I will leave it at that.","Brian Sponheimer","Just kind of following on that, for both auto and for motion you chose Australia first for international expansion in Australasia. What are the dynamics as far as Motion either looking into Europe or further in the U.S. as far as acquisitive growth there, given that your suppliers are large multi-national companies and your customers are large multi-national companies.","Paul Donahue","Yes so -- I'm sorry, Brian, didn't mean to cut you off. Look, our industrial business has been a solid performer for going on 10 quarters now. We're excited to move into Australasia. We took a 35% investment in an En. Co. [ph] a couple of years ago. We\u2019ve gotten to know that team very well, we've gotten to know their business and the market that they serve today, which is generally Australia, New Zealand as well as into Southeast Asia.","Great business one that we hope to close on the balance later in 2019. That will give us a nice foothold in that part of the world with a $400 million MRO player which arguably is a leader in their market. We have no designs right now on taking our industrial business into Europe, Brian. But -- and partly because we have big opportunities to continue to grow here in the U.S. as big as we are we still have less than 10% market share.","So we think we have ample opportunity to continue to grow in North America as well as we'll look at potential bolt-on opportunities in Australasia as well.","Brian Sponheimer","All right terrific. Well, thank you very much. ","Paul Donahue","You're welcome.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Carol Yancey","We like to thank you today for your participation in our first quarter earnings call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Sid Jones","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company second quarter 2019 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2019. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.","Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses.

And I\u2019ll add my welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our second quarter 2019 results. I\u2019ll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our businesses. Carol Yancey, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2019. After that, we'll open the call up to your questions.","To recap our second quarter performance across our global platform, total sales were a record $4.9 billion, up 2.3% from Q2 of 2018, driven by a 1.6% comp sales increase, and a 2.7% benefit from strategic acquisitions, net of a 1.5% headwind from foreign currency translation, and a 1.5% impact from the Auto Todo divestiture. Net income in the second quarter was $224 million and earnings per share were $1.53. Excluding the impact of transaction and other cost related to acquisitions, adjusted net income was $230 million, or $1.57 per share.","Our second quarter results were highlighted by positive total sales growth in each of our automotive regions, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australasia and in our industrial segment, while the business products group had a slight decline in sales. Our core automotive performance in Europe was pressured by the ongoing transitory factors of a mild winter season and broad economic and political consideration.","Turning to a more detailed review of our business segments, total sales in our Global Automotive Group, which represented 56% of our total revenues were up 1.4%. This includes a 1.3% comp sales increase and a 3.5% benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency of 2.5%, and the impact from the sale of Auto Todo in Q1. ","By region, our U.S. automotive sales were up 2.3% in the second quarter with comp sales at plus 3%. This marks the continuation of solid U.S. sales comp in our fourth consecutive quarter of 3% comp sales growth, despite the challenge of wet conditions across much of the country throughout the quarter.","We remain confident in the strength of the U.S. automotive aftermarket over the balance of the year, and we look forward to executing on our growth initiatives to cease the opportunities provided by both the positive business climate and sound industry fundamental.","In the second quarter, we had positive sales growth with both our commercial and retail customers. We were especially pleased with the strength of our sales to the commercial segment, which represents close to 80% of our total U.S. automotive sales. While we experience sales gains across our commercial customers segment, sales to our NAPA AutoCare Centers drove the outperformance.","Sales to our AutoCare customers were up 5%, in-line with the first quarter and improved from the 3.5% growth in 2018. This was a direct result of the increase focused by our new management team to drive a greater share of wallet with these strategic customers. NAPA AutoCare represents the fastest growing customer segment for our U.S. automotive business and is targeted to represent well over 18,000 members this year. ","We expect continued growth from these customers in the quarters ahead. Sales to our major account partners were up 2% in the quarter [technical difficulty] regional accounts and OE dealers among others represent a large and important customer segment. Driving improved sales with this group is meaningful to our overall results and an important element of our growth strategy.","Turning to our retail segment, sales to this group were positive as noted before, but pressured somewhat from the wet weather that persisted throughout the quarter. We believe our retail business will bounce back as the weather normalizes. Our retail impact stores, which represent those stores that have been renovated and reset continued to outperform our overall retail performance, and we have significant opportunity to further expand this initiative across our network.","While we have successfully completed this initiative in our company stores, we\u2019ve really just begun to implement these changes at our independent stores. In addition, the NAPA Rewards Program, which now has reached 10.7 million members strong continues to drive additional retail sales and positively impact our overall results. At NAPA Canada, our business remains strong having produced another quarter of solid sales growth driven by mid-single digit comp sales growth and the added benefit of accretive tuck-in acquisition.","Our Canadian team maintained a strong margin and we expect to continue to build on this positive momentum. In Europe, our automotive business continued to operate in a challenging sales environment. The mild winner across most of the regions in which we operate, disruption of business associated with Brexit, and the overall softening economic environment each weighed heavily on our core sales and significantly pressured our operating results.","Our management team in Europe began taking step to address these issues early in the first quarter by implementing comprehensive cost saving initiative to mitigate the effects of this downturn. We are ramping up these ongoing efforts and expect to personally offset our property clients in Europe over the balance of the year.","During the quarter, we announced the closing of the PartsPoint acquisition effective in June. This new business is an excellent strategic fit for AAG and we\u2019re excited for the growth opportunities we see in the Netherlands and Belgium. The Benelux region of Europe has not been impacted by the economic and political factors affecting much of Europe, providing a more stable operating environment. We expect PartsPoint to generate estimated annual revenue of $330 million and look forward to growing this business and further strengthening our European operations.","And finally, yesterday we announced that AAG has entered into an agreement to acquire the Todd Group, a leading distributor in France for heavy-duty and truck parts and accessories for the independent heavy-duty aftermarket. The European heavy-duty market has avoided the economic and other pressures in Europe and continues to grow at solid rates. With the addition of Todd, AAG becomes the undisputed leader in the independent heavy-duty aftermarket in France with well over 300 total locations.","We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2019 and for this business to generate $85 million in estimated annual revenues. Undoubtedly, we are all disappointed with our recent results in Europe. We remain committed to our growth plans, while also taking proactive steps to immediately reduce our cost structure and work through these challenges, which we believe to be transitory in nature, but impactful in the near term as we have seen in this quarter\u2019s results.","In Australia and New Zealand, we are pleased to report another solid quarter with low to mid-single digit sales increased for both total and comp sales. This steady growth reflects the positive impact of a well-executed growth strategy combined with the effective cost controls and sound aftermarket fundamentals. As part of our growth plans for this business, we increased our investment in Sparesbox to 87% effective July 1.","While not significant to our financial results, Sparesbox is Australia\u2019s leading online automotive parts and accessories business. As a cutting-edge digital specialist, this partnership served to enhance our understanding of the digital marketplace and grow our digital sales capabilities in Australasia and potentially across our global operation. We are excited to expand our partnership with the Sparesbox team and look forward to growing our business together.","In summary, while our European business remains challenged, our automotive businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Australasia are performing well thus far in 2019. We are confident that we can continue this positive trend, while also working to improve our European results in the quarters ahead.","Turning now to our Industrial Parts Group, this business continues to perform well with sales of $1.7 billion, up 4.9%, including 3.1% comp sales growth, and a 2.1% benefit from acquisitions, which was partially offset by a slight currency headwind. Importantly, this quarter\u2019s sales growth drove improved profitability and a 30-basis point improvement in operating margin. So, we are pleased with the continued progress we are making in our industrial business.","Overall, we continue to effectively execute on our growth initiative and operate in a stable industrial economy. In addition, our acquisitions continue to perform well and positively contribute to our overall results. Looking to our product and industry sector sales performance, our results were consistent with the first quarter. 12 of 14 major product groups posted sales gains with especially strong results in the industrial supplies, material handling, and hose and pumps category leading the way.","Additionally, 9 of the top 12 industries, where we compete, generated sales increases, highlighted by strong growth across several sectors, including iron and steel, fabricated metal products, chemicals and allied products, aggregate and cement, food products, and automotive sectors. Offsetting these positive results were softer sales in the electrical specialties group, primarily driven by the impact of lower copper pricing. We remain confident in the growth outlook for our North American industrial business for the balance of the year.","In addition, as previously announced, we expanded our industrial footprint into Australasia with the purchase of the remaining 65% stake in Inenco, effective July 1. We originally purchased a 35% stake in Inenco in 2017 and held the opportunity to acquire the balance of the company at a later date. Throughout our two-year partnership, this team consistently exceeded our expectations, and we look forward to growing our business together for many years to come. ","Inenco, is already one of Australasia's leading industrial distributors with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore. In total annual sales of approximately $400 million. Inenco is an excellent strategic fit with motion in North America from a products and services perspective, and presents tremendous opportunities with our global suppliers and extensive and diverse customer base. Likewise, we expect to realize additional cost-related synergies associated with our automotive business in Australasia.","So, we are excited to move forward with full ownership of this outstanding organization and we officially welcome Roger Jowett and the Inenco team to GPC. Now, we want to update you on our performance at S.P. Richards, our business products group. For the second quarter, total and comp sales for this business were down slightly. While business products has performed well for several quarters, we experience a bit of softening in our core office supply business in Q2, although our facilities and safety supply supplies business delivered solid results.","FPS represents 35% of our total business products revenue and is the fastest growing segment in the industry, providing us with additional future growth opportunities. In addition, during the second quarter we operated well and we held our operating margin constant with last year. This bodes well for margin improvement as sales strengthen and we build on our position as the only independent national business products wholesaler in the U.S. So, that's a recap of our consolidated and business segment results for the second quarter of 2019.","With that, I'll hand it over to Carol for her remarks.","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide our updated outlook for 2019. With our second quarter total sales of $4.9 billion, representing a 2.3% increase and including 1.6 comparable sales growth, our gross margin in the quarter was 32.4%, compared to 31.6% in 2018 with the improvement in margin relating to several factors.","Similar to the first quarter, the increase primarily reflects higher margins in our automotive and industrial businesses, due to the ongoing initiatives, including taking advantage of a global supplier presence, more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies, and favorable product mix. In addition, the increase in supplier incentives across our business segments also had a positive impact on gross margin.","Our team has done an excellent job of improving our gross margin and for the balance of the year, we continue to expect our 2019 gross margin rate to remain relatively in line with our current run rate. This assumes continued inflation in the 1% to 2% range and consistent levels of volume incentives. The pricing environment has been relatively inflationary thus far in 2019.","In automotive, price increases primarily reflect the impact of tariffs, while industrial and business products have seen increases associated with general inflations in areas such as raw material pricing, commodities, and supplier freight. Thus far, we have been successful in passing on the price increases to our customers to protect our gross margin overall. So, we continue to believe that the current levels of inflation have been a net positive to our results. We expect this to continue through the balance of 2019.","Specific to tariffs, their impact in the second quarter as well as the six months relates to the 10% tariff previously implemented. By segment, the impact of tariffs on our sales in the second quarter were 1.2% for U.S. automotive, 0.3% for industrial, and 0.3% for business products. As mentioned before, we have maintained our gross margin related to the 10% tariffs and we expect to do the same as we incurred the 25% tariff impact going forward. As a reminder, 10% of our U.S. cost of goods sold is subject to this tariff, including 20% of our U.S. automotive cost of goods sold, and 9% of our business products cost of goods sold. ","Turning to our SG&A, these expenses were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, which represents 24.7% of sales. These operating costs were up 6% from last year as a result of several factors, including the effect of rising cost in areas such as payroll, freight, IT and cyber security, as well as the loss of leverage on our expenses in Europe and business products due to the declines in their comparable sales for those businesses.","As we have discussed in several of our past earnings calls, we have ongoing initiatives to offset the rising cost environment and to better leverage our expenses as we move forward. These include steps to more effectively integrate our acquisitions, facility consolidations, productivity solutions, and other initiatives to drive efficiencies across our operations. As Paul will cover later, we recognize the need to produce greater cost savings and we\u2019re developing additional plans to get that done.","So, now let\u2019s discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.8 billion, up 1.4% from the prior year, and our operating profit of $228 million was down 6% with an operating margin at 8.2%, compared to 8.9% margin in the second quarter of 2018. So, while they continue to see improvement on our gross margin line, we were also impacted by rising costs, as well as the deleveraging of expenses in Europe, which accounts for more than half of the decline in our margin.","As mentioned earlier, we are enhancing the initiatives to address our cost in the quarters ahead. Our industrial sales were $1.7 billion in the quarter, a solid 5% increase from Q2 of 2018. Our operating profit of 136 million is up another solid 9%, and operating margin improved to 8.1% from 7.8% last year with a 30-basis point increase due to gross margin expansions and the leveraging of expenses. The industrial businesses continue to operate well with 10 consecutive quarters of strong sales and operating results.","Our business product revenues were $478 million, down 1% from the prior year. Operating profit was $21 million and 4.4% of sales, which is consistent with 2018. They are solid operating results as this business continues to stabilize. Our total company operating profit in the second quarter was 386 million, down 1.2% on a 2.3% sales increase and our operating profit margin was 7.8%, compared to 8.1% last year. We had net interest expense at 23 million in the second quarter, which was consistent with the first quarter, but down from the 26 million in the second quarter last year.","Looking ahead, we\u2019re currently expecting net interest to be in the $97 million to $98 million range for the full-year, which is up from our previous estimate of $91 million to $93 million. This accounts for the new debt assumed for the PartsPoint and Inenco acquisitions. Our total amortization expense was $24 million for the second quarter, and for 2019 we are updating our full-year amortization to approximately $100 million from the previous $92 million, also due to our recent acquisitions.","Our depreciation expense was $42 million in the second quarter and we continue to expect depreciation of $170 million to $180 million for the year. On a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $270 million to $280 million for 2019. Continuing with this segment information presented in our press release, the other line, which primarily represents our corporate expense was $37 million in the second quarter, which includes $4 million in transaction and other costs, primarily related to the PartsPoint acquisition.","Excluding these costs, our corporate expense was $33 million, which has improved slightly from 2018 when adjusted for the $9 million in transaction and other costs recorded last year. For 2019, we continue to expect our corporate expense to be in the $125 million to $135 million range. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 25.7%, which is an increase from the 24.4% rate in the prior year. This is primarily due to the non-deductible transaction, and other costs, as well as statute-related adjustments that are reported in these periods. For the full year, we continue to expect our 2019 tax rate to be approximately 25%. ","Now, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet, which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our accounts receivable of $2.8 billion is up 6% from the prior year. This compares to our 2.3% total sales increase and it also includes a 3.7% impact from our acquisitions, including PartsPoint, which was acquired in June. We remain very pleased with the quality of our receivables.","Our inventory at June 30 was $3.8 billion, up 8% from June of last year. This increase primarily relates to the additional inventory that was acquired through the acquisitions over the last 12 months, which added 6.5%. In addition, the increase in inventory includes the impact of inflation, as well as tariffs. We remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward.","Our accounts payable of $4.1 billion is up 6%, due mainly to the increase in purchasing volumes and to a lesser degree the benefit of improved payment terms with our key global partners. At June 30, our AP to inventory ratio stands at a 108%. Our total debt of $3.9 billion at June 30 is up from $3.4 billion at March 31, and this is due primarily to the additional private placement debt that we assume for the recent acquisitions of PartsPoint and Inenco. We entered into these agreements with favorable rates and maturity periods ranging from 5 to 15 years.","At June 30, our average interest rate on our total outstanding debt stands at 2.5%, which has improved from 3.0% at June 30 last year. We remain comfortable with our current debt structure and have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our future growth initiatives and our ongoing priorities for effective capital allocation.","Turning now into our cash flows, we have generated approximately $300 million in cash from operations thus far in 2019. For the full-year, we currently expect approximately $1 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow, which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million. So, we expect our cash flows to continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value.","Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, the dividend, as well as share repurchases. We have invested a $107 million in capital expenditures thus far in 2019, which is up from $65 million in 2018. This reflects our growing global platform and a planned increase in our investment in areas such as technology and productivity in our facilities. For the year, we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $300 million.","Our 2019 annual dividend of $3.05 was increased 6% from 2018 and is approximately 54% of our 2018 adjusted earnings, which is within our targeted payout ratio. 2019 marked our 63rd consecutive annual increase in the dividend paid to our shareholders and it\u2019s a record we are proud of.","Regarding our share repurchase program, we continue to have 16.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have not made any purchases under the program in 2019 as we have been active with other investment opportunities such as the recent M&A activity and capital expenditures that were discussed in this call.","So, now let\u2019s discuss our current outlook for 2019. In consideration of our results thus far in the year, our current growth plans and initiatives and the market conditions we see for this foreseeable future across our operations, which include the slowing global economy and continued softness we expect in Europe over the balance of the year, we are updating our full-year 2019 sales and earnings guidance.","In addition, we took into account the recently added PartsPoint and Inenco acquisitions, as well as the impact of a strong U.S. dollar, which we continue to estimate as a 1% currency headwind for the full-year.","Finally, our outlook accounts for one additional selling day in the third quarter relative to 2018 to make up for the one less selling day in the first quarter of 2019. With these factors in mind, we expect our full-year sales to increase 4.5% to 5.5%. This updated sales outlook represents a change from our previous guidance for a plus 3% to plus 4% sales increase, and it includes an approximate 2% sales contribution from the PartsPoint and Inenco acquisitions. As is customary, this guidance excludes the benefit of any future acquisitions.","By business segment, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 5% for the automotive segment, which is improved from our previous guidance of plus 2.5% to plus 3.5%, due to an approximate 2% contribution from PartsPoint; plus 7% to plus 8% for the industrial segment, which is up from plus 5% to plus 6% previously, and this is inclusive of an approximate 3% sales contribution from Inenco; and essentially flat to down slightly for total sales for the Business Products segment.","On the earnings side, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.42 to $5.52, which accounts for the transaction and other costs incurred through the first six months of 2019. We are updating our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $5.65 to $5.75 from $5.75 to $5.90 previously. This represents a $0.15 to $0.20 change in earnings before an approximate $0.05 contribution from PartsPoint and the additional 65% investment in Inenco. As a reminder, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes any first half, as well as future transaction and other costs.","So that completes our financial update and outlook for 2019. We enter the second half of the year committed to our initiatives to grow the business and improve our operating results. We also remain focused on further strengthening our balance sheet and generating strong cash flows to support an effective and meaningful capital allocation.","Paul, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Carol. With this quarter's challenges and the need to modify our full-year outlook, it\u2019d be easy to overlook our team\u2019s accomplishments, which include the following. We achieved record quarterly sales of $4.9 billion, including positive comp sales growth in our U.S., Canadian and Australian automotive businesses. We improved our gross margin significantly with a 91-basis point gain.","Our industrial business continues to perform well with operating margins improved 30 basis points. We further stabilized our Business Products operating margin, which was unchanged from last year; and we expanded our global footprint with two large strategic acquisitions, PartsPoint Group in The Netherlands and Inenco in Australia.","That said, we also thought it would be important to remind you of our multi-year efforts to optimize our portfolio and position the company for a sustained long-term growth. We spoke to this journey at our June 4 Investor Day and want to highlight a few key points for you now.","First, we expanded our automotive footprint beyond North America and into Australasia six years ago. And this group has performed very well for us and added significant value. More recently, since 2017, we\u2019ve added 45 acquisitions to our portfolio, which have provided $3 billion in incremental revenues and positively contributed to both our automotive and industrial footprints.","While the majority of these new businesses have represented strategic bolt-on types of acquisitions, we've all stepped out and taken advantage of more significant opportunities, including our entree into Europe in late 2017 via Alliance Automotive, which we have further expanded with key strategic acquisitions in 2018 and 2019, and effective this month, our industrial expansion into Australasia with the purchase of Inenco.","And while our European operations performance has impacted our first half results, we believe the challenges for this business are transitory, and we remain 100% confident in the industry fundamentals and longer-term growth prospects for this group, as well as the value it will create as part of our portfolio.","In addition to these expansionary initiatives, we have also taken steps to streamline our operations. In 2018, we consolidated our electrical business into motion industry to build a larger, stronger, and more cost-effective industrial business. Effective this year, we consolidated several automotive operations representing our in-house supply network in NAPA to a more efficient North American automotive supply chain.","And finally, earlier this year, we divested of our legacy automotive business in Mexico Auto Todo to more effectively focus on the growth potential of our NAPA Mexico model established just a few years ago.","Today, we go to market with a strong and cohesive automotive network and enhanced global industrial operation and a re-energized Business Products group. We remain confident in our overall strategy and the additional growth opportunities we continue to pursue across our global platform. Make no mistake; we are not satisfied with our overall results in the quarter.","That said, we are confident the plans we are implementing will have a long-term positive impact on our cost structure. Our immediate focus is on the execution of our initiatives to control costs and improve our profitability. While this has been a consistent theme for us throughout our transformation process, and we have had some success through our investments in technology and automotive supply and industrial realignments, we have yet to fully realize the savings we need to outpace the pressures of rising cost and the increase in the spend for necessary investments.","So, to this end, we are accelerating our ongoing cost savings plans and developing aggressive expense reduction initiatives to more effectively address our cost structure, drive meaningful savings and ultimately deliver incremental value. The senior leaders across our business and corporate office have been tasked with this mission, and we will be held accountable to work together to execute on plans to eliminate costs, as well as standardize and automate processes while ultimately enhancing our productivity to further support our ongoing growth.","As examples, through our early efforts, we have identified opportunities to restructure and consolidate several functional areas and facilities, reducing both personnel and occupancy cost such that we can operate more efficiently and at a lower cost. Clearly, the successful execution of these and other cost initiatives will require some heavy lifting and the focus of our entire organization.","In addition to these initiatives, we will also be working to aggressively drive incremental revenue growth capturing a greater share of wallet with our existing customers, securing new business opportunities, driving our digital strategy, and finally, securing additional bolt-on acquisitions will all play a part in delivering an improved topline performance.","We have a highly capable management team and anticipate delivering improved results and creating value for our shareholders. We will update the investment community on our action plans and progress in our third quarter earnings call.","Thank you for listening, and with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Great, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question here is from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Daniel Imbro ","Yes. Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. ","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Daniel Imbro ","Wanted to start actually with a clarifier, Paul. I may have missed it in the prepared remarks, but could you just share what were European overall comp sales during the second quarter? Did you guys share that in the prepared remarks?","Paul Donahue","Daniel, the comps out of Europe, if you recall Q1, we were down slightly in Europe and in Q2 that deceleration \u2013 really it was amplified and our comps in Europe were down closer to 7% to 8% in the quarter.","Daniel Imbro","Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just digging into that a little bit deeper, are there certain geographies that are meaningfully weaker than others? Obviously, you noted that Benelux is more resilient. And then, just within that we didn't get much of a winter, but we did get some recent extremely heat, did that drive any uptick? Or how was the cadence through 2Q across Europe?","Paul Donahue","Yes. That\u2019s a great question, Daniel, and as you know, our three primary markets are France, the UK, and Germany. We\u2019ve just entered Benelux, we\u2019re also in Poland. We\u2019ve seen Benelux and Poland have largely escaped some of the downturn we've seen in France, UK, and Germany. The biggest challenge for us in Q2 was France followed by the UK. Germany actually bounced back in Q2.","They had a soft first quarter, but actually showed a slight increase in Q2. And I would also \u2013 you commented on the recent warmer temps, record high temps in Europe, and what we\u2019ve seen out of the blocks in July and its early, Daniel, but we have seen better sales performance in the month of July and we would attribute some of that certainly to the extreme heat that we've seen in our markets.","Daniel Imbro","Great, thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. ","Paul Donahue","Welcome.","Daniel Imbro","And then, last one for me. Just on the U.S. auto side, you know, weather you noted was disruptive given the rain. Could you maybe quantify what kind of headwinds that was to your business here in the U.S.?","Paul Donahue","Yes. It's hard to say \u2013 to pinpoint exactly, Daniel, but look, I think Q2 was just one more reminder for all of us that, you know, the impact that mother nature can have on our business. We were \u2013 if you look at the cadence of the quarter, we were \u2013 in the U.S. automotive, we were up slightly in April. May was our most difficult month, and certainly when you look at the weather patterns, May was the most challenging weather-related month. It was awfully wet, still cold. And then, we bounced back in June with a much stronger June. So, hard to pinpoint exactly, but we absolutely know it had an impact.","Daniel Imbro","Great. Thanks so much guys, and best of luck.","Paul Donahue ","Thank you.","Carol Yancey ","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Kate McShane","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If I can just follow up on the auto part retail comment in question earlier, I was wondering if you could maybe characterize the competitive environment currently just now that we\u2019re a few months in now with the tariffs, are you seeing your competitors [past prices] as well?","Paul Donahue ","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. We are \u2013 and I'm assuming you're referencing our U.S. automotive business.","Kate McShane ","Yes, U.S.","Paul Donahue","Yes, and look, the environment is still very same. We have seen our competitors passing along tariff-related increases much like we have. So, we have not seen any serious disruption in the automotive aftermarket here in the U.S. So, you know, we\u2019re continuing to monitor very closely, but at this point, I think everybody has passed along the increases.","Kate McShane","Okay, thank you. And then, my second question unrelated, I think on the last quarterly call you hosted you were talking about working capital improvement that was starting this year for Europe because you were putting supply chain programs in place. And I just wondered if you could update us on where you are with that and what it contributed in the quarter?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So, we did have \u2013 we continue to actually perform quite well. The synergy targets we put in place. We bought Europe a year and a half ago. Those include both procurement synergies and working capital synergies that were right on track for that with working capital being delivered. Having said that, [lot of the way] these terms come in and we\u2019ve got these terms. ","While they are negotiated globally, we could see it benefit in the U.S. as it relates to the European suppliers as well. So, we know we have further benefit coming in the second half and that\u2019s contemplated in our guidance. So, Q2 you did necessarily see much of an impact, but we have implied for improvement both in global automotive, including Europe and North America as well, honestly as our industrial business for the second half and that\u2019s contemplated in our guidance.","Kate McShane","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question here is from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys, how are you?","Paul Donahue","Good morning.","Scot Ciccarelli","So, Paul, I guess, I just want to understand kind of the cadence a little bit better, and this is specifically on the U.S. auto side, if April was up just slightly, I\u2019d probably interrupt that, I don\u2019t know, 1% to 2%. I would also assume May was down a couple of points just given how wet it was and what we know it does to the business to get to a 3% comp for the quarter should we assume June was up at least in the mid-single digit range.","Paul Donahue","Absolutely Scot, you\u2019re spot on with your assumptions.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay, got it. Do you attribute that to anything, the weather cadence or is there something else that may have happened just so we can kind of understand if there is another influence on that factor?","Paul Donahue","Well, if you go back to my prepared comment Scot, what we saw in the quarter, as we saw in Q1 as well is our DIFM, our commercial business in solid. We continue the good momentum we had in Q1 in our NAPA AutoCare business. We believe we\u2019re grabbing greater share of wallet with our key AutoCare customers. So that business as mentioned in my prepared remarks we\u2019re very pleased with our major account business is positive, which is certainly an improvement over where we were last year. If you think about the impact of the weather Scot, certainly in the month of May that\u2019s probably more, we were more impact on our retail side than our commercial business.","Scot Ciccarelli","And was the gap between DIY and commercial wider this quarter than it has been in recent quarters?","Paul Donahue","Yes, it was.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay, thanks guys.","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome.","Carol Yancey","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Horvers","Thanks, good morning everybody.","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Horvers","Carol, can you break down the EPS guide change a little bit further? I get the $0.5 for the acquisitions, but you are just thinking about the core emotion business, the core NAPA business, in particularly in the U.S., first is Europe. How did you change the underlying guide in the core businesses ex the acquisitions? Is it effectively lowering for European losses, but at the same time it looks like emotions you know sales outlook is a little lighter for the year considering the acquisition? So, if you could talk us through that that would be really helpful.","Carol Yancey","Sure, I\u2019m happy to. So, starting with automotive first, implied in our Q1 comp, we did moderate probably a half a point or so in Q2. That is in part based on again the U.S. comp was strong at 3%, they were 3.5% for Q1. Europe as Paul mentioned, they are running down mid-single digits through the first half. So, we lowered a bit for Europe. We lowered small amount for U.S. and quite honestly, we have seen some weakness in Australasia. So, we looked at that business more so on their top line. We had a little bit there. So, implied in that automotive there is a slightly lower comp that went into our guidance and then you\u2019re spot on for industrial as well. ","What industrial is seeing is that maybe this happened a little sooner. The signals are definitely mixed, but where we had implied comp, you know of maybe 3 to 4 in Q1, we\u2019re looking at more 2 to 3 right now, that is taken into account, the slowing business in our electrical specialties group that we called out in Paul\u2019s comment, a lot of that is due to copper pricing and some of their customer mix, but again we felt it was appropriate to lower just a bit for industrial and then we do see a bit of moderation in some of our operating margins headwinds in the second half, so that was factored in as well. So, that\u2019s kind of walk through on the guidance.","Chris Horvers","Just a couple of questions follow here. So, for the U.S., the kick down for the sort of implied U.S. comp from here, was that solely because of 2Q or did you change your back half outlook?","Carol Yancey","Probably more, a little bit of Q2, but honestly it was very transitory as Paul mentioned. I mean this was weather in Q2 and transitory. We still feel good about our commercial business and a lot of the factors, so really more of a Q2. We are not seeing anything else right now that would give us concern in the second half.","Paul Donahue","Chris, just a tag team on that a little bit. You know, you look at our core for GPC, it\u2019s certainly North American automotive and industrial and we feel good about both of those key business and both add a good first half of the year. We expected everybody has been calling for a significant slow-down on our industrial business in the second of the year and if you follow all the metrics, whether it\u2019s PMI, which has declined significantly from January to June, but then there was a manufacturing number that came out earlier this week, which was very positive. ","So, you\u2019re getting mixed signals on the industrial side. So, we\u2019re being a bit cautious, but our motion business is hanging in there and when you look across industrial, I mean you\u2019re looking at 34 straight months of growth in that world. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about our two key and core businesses.","Carol Yancey","One final thing, I would just say the operating margin decline for Europe is probably more of a stand out than some of the slight modifications in the U.S. comp or the industrial comp.","Chris Horvers","Just to clarify that, is European auto \u2013 could you say it\u2019s operating income loss currently?","Carol Yancey","No, just to be clear, and we talked about this in Q1, the margin decline in automotive margins, we said in Q1, was primarily as a result of Europe with them comping down 1%. To their credit, they in March took action plans and set out full plan for all their countries, and they\u2019re starting to make a lot of progress on those plants, but what happened in Q2 was such \u2013 so much more pronounced that it\u2019s really hard for them to, when you are comping down at a higher, as Paul mentioned 7% or 8%, whatever plans you had in place, it\u2019s difficult to see the improvement.","We do see some of that coming in the second half or some moderation, so when you look at automotive margins in Q2, we said more than half, it was probably 50 basis points of the 70 basis point decline and again we would expect to see that moderate with the plans they have in place. The teams have done some good job, looking at some consolidation of facilities, looking at some of their head count and some of their restructuring that they\u2019re doing and they\u2019ve got close attention on all these areas. So, they are definitely positive over prior year, it\u2019s just the leverage issue with the poor sales decline.","Chris Horvers","Understood and one last one, just on a follow-up on the tariff question earlier. So, going to 25% now presumably those price increases are passing through now, so is the behavior the same they seem to be passed on very quickly by you and your peers back in September, call it of last year, is the 25 \u2013 is there any difference to like, is it being passed on more hesitantly and then how do you think about what maybe the inflation outlook will be for the industry given its move from 10% to 25% for the U.S. NAPA business?","Carol Yancey","Yes, it is a great question. As we kind of look ahead, I think as we, as you spoke to the 25% tariff, we do believe and we know and we\u2019ve already done \u2013 have passed those along in many of our businesses and product lines, those went into effect right away, not seeing any issues with passing them along, but having said that our business had been pursuing alternative sourcing as we look to move purchases outside of China, be it Malaysia, India, Vietnam, Mexico, are picking up capacity. In addition, our Chinese sources are also moving some of their capacity from China and that\u2019s going on as well. ","So, when we look at the full-year, we will have a more pronounced effect for tariffs in the second half that will be passed through. We expect second half to be approximately 2% for automotive and I think we were 1.2 in the first half. So that will get us to probably a point and a half full-year tariff\/inflation for automotive. For business products and office products, it\u2019s going to be something less; it will probably be a half a point for the full-year on tariffs, but their inflation, which includes raw materials, commodities, supplier freight, their inflation will be more like 2% on a full-year basis.","Chris Horvers","That\u2019s super helpful. Best of luck. Thank you.","Paul Donahue ","Alright, thanks Chris.","Carol Yancey ","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot, and good morning.","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Seth.","Carol Yancey","Good morning, Seth.","Seth Basham","My first question is to close the loop on the U.S. auto comp trends. You know it saw a nice strengthening in July, you spoke to material improvement in Europe in \u2013 I mean you spoke to material improvement in Europe in July, but do you also see a further acceleration or consistent mid-single digit type comp growth in the U.S. in July today?","Paul Donahue","It\u2019s early, yes, Seth. But certainly, I would tell you that the hot, hot temps that we are seeing across the U.S. right now is going to be a real boost for our business. If you think about the NAPA business, we do a significant chunk of business up in the Midwest Central, which will get [I\u2019m sure] somewhere someone will ask about regionality and our trends. Despite all the wet weather, the Midwest Central was our strongest performing business in the quarter. We do a lot of business with farmers and agriculture, and you know, many of these farmers are just now getting out in the field. So, this hot weather will help and we expect to see a boost in our topline in U.S. automotive in Q3.","Seth Basham","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Any other callouts from our regional performance standpoint for the quarter?","Paul Donahue","Yes. So, I mentioned central part of the U.S., Midwest, upper Midwest, but I\u2019m also very pleased to see some strengthening performance in the South, both in the Southwest part of the country, as well as the Southeastern part of the country, both. But we have a \u2013 we track [eight] geographical regions except those four would be at the top of the list.","Seth Basham ","Fair enough. And turning to margins for the auto business in the U.S., you saw a decline there, I guess, implied by your comments, what's driving that decline? What are you doing to control costs in the U.S. to alleviate that pressure?","Carol Yancey","Yes. And I would mention the other basic point decline in automotive margin is in part Canada and Australasia\u2019s automotive margins and I would tell it\u2019s a little bit of the slowing that we talked about in Australasia. Some of it is timing and definitely expect to see some improvement in the second half for both of those businesses. U.S. was slightly down. It was very minor, so we are really almost running flat U.S. automotive margins, and remember, we\u2019re comping at 3.2% for the six months and we\u2019re getting pretty good leverage, flattish operating margins out of that. But having said that, we\u2019re not going to sit and say that we\u2019re satisfied and we certainly want to improve our SG&A performance.","So, there's a number of things that that group is looking at. You know specifically, they are looking at it from a North American automotive standpoint. Paul mentioned facilities and as we look for facilities, its consolidation and rationalization and a number of facilities with automation. In the last six months, we\u2019ve got several facilities both in Canada and the U.S. with [goods to person] conveyor mechanism, [vertical less] modules, things like that mechanized orders that we\u2019re using.","Additionally, Paul mentioned functional areas, so think about IT technology, we\u2019re really looking at a digital transformation of our IT infrastructure. So, we can best optimize things like the number of data centers we have, leveraging the cloud, new technologies and networking, back office functions, robotics, sales organizations, leadership, so a number of things that we\u2019re working on as a group.","Paul Donahue","And Seth, I just would tag team on Carol\u2019s comments, you know, you would ask this question of us at our Invest Day as well, and I would tell you that our teams have been really hard at work to reduce our overall cost structure at GPC. We\u2019re \u2013 as Carol mentioned, we\u2019re reviewing every aspect of our business. What I would tell you is during our Q3 call and presentation, we\u2019ll be in a much better position to begin to unveil some of those more detailed plans for you.","Seth Basham","Wonderful. Thanks a lot. I look forward to it.","Paul Donahue ","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question if from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Bret Jordan","Hi, good morning.","Carol Yancey ","Good morning.","Bret Jordan ","Most of them have been asked, but a couple of cleanups, I guess. The other four regions, could you tell us how the East, Northeast, West and Northwest did?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Happy to, Bret. The \u2013 you know, the \u2013 most of those guys are in line. Where we looked at our comps, most of our \u2013 most of our regions were right in between, you know, on the low side of, you know, 1 to 2 and on the high side up to 4.5% or so. But, you know, the \u2013 where we see a bit more challenges are West, and I already mentioned the strength we\u2019re seeing in the Midwest Central Southern parts of the \u2013 Southern parts of the country as well. The Northeast despite really bad weather performed just fine and as did the Mid-Atlantic.","So, not a huge \u2013 you know, sometimes we see really huge disparity amongst the regions, but what I would tell you \u2013 that kind of that range narrowed this quarter. The other thing I would mention, Bret, that we did see across all of our divisions is strengthening in our DIFM business and that was consistent amongst all of our \u2013 all of our regions, which we are \u2013 I mean look, that\u2019s our bread-and-butter and we\u2019re really encouraged to see some of the DIFM initiatives. Our teams have been working so hard on really begin to take hold.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. And then I guess as we\u2019re looking at Europe, and you\u2019ve call out weather and the economy, I guess could you sort of weight the impact of weather versus the economy and the softness there? And obviously as we get further from winter, have we sort of \u2013 have we regionally skewed the performance where weather is less impactful, but some economies are more impactful?","Paul Donahue","You know \u2013 so, Bret, we talked about that a little bit on the last call and we had the question earlier about the U.S. weather impact. You know, Bret, it\u2019s really hard to pinpoint exactly. We do know it\u2019s a significant factor. If you back to a year ago, certainly in the UK, they had one of their coldest winters on record followed this year by one of the warmest winters on record. So, it had a significant impact. It\u2019s very difficult to pinpoint an exact number, but I would tell you that with the records heat that we've seen over the last number of weeks, we are seeing an uptick in the business and that\u2019s got us feeling better about our back half prospects in the key markets in which we compete.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome, Bret.","Operator","Your next question is from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth Suzuki ","Hi, thank you. Just a longer-term question on Europe because you just made another acquisition there, and there's \u2013 you know even though you\u2019ve seen some perhaps temporary weakness. Just curious how much of that weakness you think is going to continue to impact your overall results for more than a couple of quarters? And, you know, what the vehicle fleet dynamics are that make it an attractive market for you to be in long-term?","Paul Donahue ","Yes. Great question, Liz. We\u2019re still very bullish on the European aftermarket and hence the additional acquisitions that you\u2019ve seen and read about over the last number of weeks. You know if we look at those individually, the one that we just announced yesterday, Todd. Todd is a very strong, heavy-duty truck part supplier in France. They have the 30 plus locations. The combination of Todd along with our existing heavy-duty footprint that we have in France will position us as the Number 1 player. And we\u2019ve seen our heavy-duty business hold up well across all of Europe despite, you know, the slowdown that we\u2019re seeing in the light vehicle market. ","So, we feel good about the acquisition of Todd. We feel good about our acquisition of PartsPoint, which is, you know, based in the Netherlands and in Belgium is their stronghold. And again, they've not been as impacted as the \u2013 some of the other markets with the slowdown, and, you know, as we look at the European market and the vehicle [part of it], the vehicle part that is similar in size to the U.S., the age demographics are similar. It is incredibly fragmented aftermarket across Europe and we have not lost our excitement about that marketplace for the long term and we think we will be just fine. The issues we are faced with right now, less we believe are largely transitory and we\u2019ll get past them as we go through the second half of the year.","Carol Yancey","And Liz one other thing about the margin. The team has done a tremendous job and Europe is very impactful from a global procurement synergy. So, when you look at our gross margin results and the overall improvement in margin and where we are tracking to our synergies with Europe, again that volume is impactful for us, it\u2019s really the opportunities they have with some SG&A as they work through this core sales decline. So, longer-term we see that working its way out.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And just one more quick one. What age do vehicles typically enter your addressable market in Europe? Is it similar to the U.S. or is the sweet spot a little bit different?","Paul Donahue","No, it\u2019s similar Liz. When the vehicles are going out of warranty and those warranties are very similar in Europe as they are in the U.S. The other thing I would mention about, the European market is there is very little to almost no retail business. So, DIFM really rules the aftermarket in European. So, very similar to the U.S., I would mention, now that we\u2019re on the European market, one of the initiatives that will be launched in the second half of the year is to launch our NAPA private brand in Europe and we\u2019ve got plans in place to launch it in the UK in three key product categories, and we think that\u2019s going to give our team a real boost in the second half of the year.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Great. Thanks very much.","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Montani","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to add some extra clarity if I could around the U.S. comp trajectory, I\u2019m sorry if I had missed this, but did you provide with the overall commercial and then DIY comps were in the quarter?","Paul Donahue","We did not provide that Mike for the quarter. I would tell you that both DIFM and DIY were positive and I would also tell you that DIFM significantly outperformed our DIY business in the quarter.","Michael Montani","Okay, and then if I heard correctly, I think you said there was a 3% U.S. comp in auto, but then more like a 2.3% total growth there, was there store closures or other rationalization there that could have caused that?","Paul Donahue","Yes and that was a good catch, much likely we talked about it in the first quarter and I guess it\u2019s a little unusual to see comps outpacing total, but that was the case in Q2 and you\u2019re right, our total U.S. comp were up 3% and what we\u2019re pleased with Mike that\u2019s our fourth consecutive quarter of 3% plus comp. We did have store closures that were up against, we had I believe about 40 plus that were not in our mix in 2019, but that\u2019s an ongoing part our business, and where we have underperforming stores whether they are company owned or independent owned, we\u2019re going to move and that\u2019s the necessary part of the business. I would tell you that we see that, even though that was a factor in Q1 and Q2, we see that trend really slowing in the second half of the year.","Michael Montani","Thanks. And then if I could on traffic and ticket, I heard 1.2% from tariffs, was the ticket basically the same so that traffic was up over 1.5% to drive this through the year?","Paul Donahue","Well what I would tell you Mike is that, again we saw our average basket and average ticket was up significantly year-over-year, close to 4%, up year-over-year; unfortunately, what we saw this quarter, which was a bit of reversals over the last 2 or 3 quarters is we saw our foot traffic down just a bit, and honestly we attribute that to some of the inclement weather that we saw, you know when you have as much rain as we saw in late April and May even into early June, that\u2019s going to \u2013 unfortunately it\u2019s going to impact the foot traffic we see in our stores and so that was an impact in Q2.","Michael Montani","The last thing I had was on the U.S. EBIT margin if I heard correctly for automotive was maybe down slightly even with that 3.2 comp, and so I was just trying to reconcile the because with the total company gross is up 85 bips plus and I think automotive was one of the stronger ones, if you can just help us understand and parse that out?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So, again, we\u2019ve talked about, and you\u2019re right, the U.S. automotive team has done a terrific job on the gross margin and we are really pleased in this inflationary and tariff environment to be able to protect and maintain our gross margin percentage pass those through, and also have this quarter improvement in gross margin. ","The things we talked about in SG&A and some of it I call out is our increased level of investment, these things that we\u2019re doing with facilities and automation and technology, digital investment, pricing investments you see our elevated CapEx, we\u2019ve talked about IT spend, cyber security, those things are all weighing on their SG&A. We actually, when we look at payroll and freight, where we were a year ago with payroll and freight is, I mean, I think I remember this call a year ago, pay roll was up 6% in year-to-date and year ago freight was up low double digits.","They are sitting more like 2% to 3% in payroll and 6% to 7% for freight. So, those things have moderated and that\u2019s helped, but we still have the cost of some of these investments that is in our SG&A. So, they should be second half again if comps continue around 3%, we should see that be similar and hopefully maybe a bit better in the second half.","Michael Montani","Great. Thanks so much.","Paul Donahue","Thanks Michael.","Operator","Our next question here is from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted the part you left off on, are you assuming 3% in the back half? Wasn't sure that was a good tongue slip or something?","Carol Yancey","U.S. comps?","Chris Bottiglieri","Yes.","Carol Yancey","That\u2019s fair, yes.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I wanted to dig in on margins a little bit. In Europe, it\u2019s roughly 20% of your business that\u2019s only 50 basis point decline, and that would imply European margins were down 250 bips. If I recall the accounting and business structure in France is a little bit different from the rest of Europe. So, it sounds like a lot better than 200 basis points decline last quarter given that the weakening macro environment is on Q2. Let\u2019s try to understand if France was a disproportionate impact of that margin decline, if any way you can contextualize that would be helpful?","Carol Yancey","Yes. I mean, we're not going to get into exact specifics on that, but you heard Paul say, France was one of the toughest markets in Q2, and from a number of factors in the quarter that was a difficult market and it was a difficult comp for them. Again, that team has a number of things in place that they\u2019re looking at and we should hope to see some of those things take effect. We do think, and we\u2019ve modelled for to this, that what we saw in the first half of the year, the impact on margins does moderate in the second half and that\u2019s because of some of the things that are putting in place, but France was a disproportionate number.","Chris Bottiglieri","That's helpful. And then free cash flow, I think you kind of touched this on the prepared comments, but it looks like you cut the free cash flow guide at $100 million. The EPS cut was I know just backing into [with price or EBITDA] seems a lot less. So, trying to get a sense as CapEx going up relative to the plan, is it all working capital, are there more like cash non-GAAP items driving that, just any way you can contextualize the cut of free cash flow would be helpful?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So, I think, I mean you\u2019re right. We modified it slightly, maybe around 100 million. I would say it\u2019s more around working capital. The timing of when these terms come. So, let's say we have terms with our supplier that are 180 days and then we negotiate it to be 240 days or we negotiate to 360, we don't see that for another six months. So, the timing of some of the working capital is what went into that. So that was really \u2013 and there were some slight changes in some of the other categories, but mostly working capital. CapEx, we looked at $300 million, which is what it's been the whole time.","Chris Bottiglieri ","Got you. Okay. And then final one is like positive question. This industry is historically very dissensitive, a cyclical. I understand like initially, there's economic weakness in Europe and a lot of other factors that are transitory that you're dealing with. But is there any way to look at your data internally and tell you how did the European business perform on a same branch basis, compared to how your U.S. business performed in the last downturn? Just trying to get a sense for like does this get better or soon? Or this because it's defensive and like this cyclicality that we're seeing today maybe goes away even if European growth kind of stays where it is. Any way to contextualize, that would be helpful?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Chris, I'll take a shot at it. Look, we do believe it's going to get better. The European marketplace, as I mentioned to an earlier question is very similar in nature. The aftermarket is very similar in nature to the U.S. aftermarket. And I think what we saw, which was a bit unprecedented in Q2, as we talk to our senior management team, who you've met, Chris, they've been running that business for 30 years in Europe and what they saw in Q2, they have not seen in all the time they've been running that business. It was a confluence of events.","Certainly, the slowdown in the economy. Some of the geopolitical issues with Yellow Vests and disruptions around that coupled with an incredibly mild winter and all of those factors unfortunately hit us at once and led to a really soft quarter for the team. We don't see that as a long-term situation, and certainly, we'll \u2013 we're certainly expecting that to improve in the second half of the year and well into 2020.","Carol Yancey","And I think one final thing. We think we will see improvements from their cost initiatives and as well as the integration of their acquisitions, too, as we look ahead, which will help offset this.","Chris Bottiglieri ","Got you. Makes sense. Alright, thank you for the time.","Paul Donahue ","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session.

My name is Chris, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Genuine Parts Company 2012 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Carol Yancey, Executive Vice President, Finance and Corporate Secretary. Please go ahead.","Carol B. Yancey","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Fourth Quarter  Conference Call to discuss our earnings results and the outlook for 2013.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Carol, and I would add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning.","This is a significant call for us in many ways, but none more so than the fact that this is Jerry Nix's final call. As you know, Jerry will be retiring at the end the month after 34 years with Genuine Parts Company, the last 13 as our Chief Financial Officer. And in looking back, it's interesting to note that Jerry has been on every quarterly conference call since we began doing them in February of 2011, so today is Jerry's 49th call.","He's also been on every investor trip and involved in every analyst meeting for over 25 years, and I think it's fair to say that Jerry has been the face of GPC with the investment community. And he has earned the respect and the admiration of all that he has come in contact with, both inside and outside of our company. He will be missed, but we're grateful to him for all that he has contributed to our company over the last 34 years.","Now we are fortunate to have Carol Yancey taking over as our Chief Financial Officer when Jerry retires, and many of you know Carol because she's been a part of GPC for 22 years. And along the way, she's spent several years as Director of Investor Relations. Over the past several years, she and Jerry have worked very closely together preparing for this transition, and she is very well-qualified to be moving into the CFO role.","Jerry and Carol will split the reporting duties today; and Paul Donahue, who is also on the call, and he'll give us an update on the performance of the Automotive operations.","Early this morning, we released our fourth quarter  and year-end 2012 results. And hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may have not seen the numbers as yet, the quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3,119,000,000, which was up 3.5%. Net income was $160.2 million, which was up 19%. And earnings per share were $1.03 this year compared to $0.86 in the fourth quarter of 2011, and EPS increase was 20%.","And this enabled us to end 2012 with sales of  $13,014,000,000, which was up 4.5%. Net income was $648 million, which was up 15%. And earnings per share were $4.14 this year compared to $3.58 last year, and that's an EPS increase of 16%.","These are all records for us in sales, net income and earnings per share. But clearly, we continue to experience some top line challenges in the fourth quarter, and they were a bit more pronounced in the Industrial and Electrical segments. Although the 3.5% revenue increase in Q4 was our softest revenue quarter of the year, we were pleased that our folks operated well and still produced double-digit increases in operating profit, net income and earnings per share for the quarter and for the year.","A review of the sales results by business segment shows that our Industrial business was up 2% in the quarter and up 7% for the year. After being up 22% in 2010 and 19% in 2011, a 7% increase in 2012 shows meaningful deceleration. And then looking back over the course of the year, we saw demand moderation as the year progressed. After being up 12% in the first quarter, the Industrial operations were up 8% in Q2, 4.5% in Q3 and 2% in Q4.","These trends are consistent with what we have seen across the industry, and it's interesting to note that the fourth quarter slowdown became a bit more pronounced in the final weeks of the year.","Power transmission, hydraulics and electrical and automation products were among the best performers from the product category for the year. And automotive, iron and steel, lumber and wood products were among our top-performing customer segments. Conversely, customers in the coal, aggregate and cement, equipment and machinery and equipment rental and leasing segments lagged our overall performance for the year.","As we look at the predictive indices, like industrial production and capacity utilization, we see that they remain at historically healthy levels, which is encouraging. At the same time, however, a more cautious attitude seems to have developed among our customer base over the latter part of the year, and our expectation is that this will carry over into the early part of 2013.","With that said, however, we do feel that the manufacturing segment of the economy, which is our customer base, is generally healthy and growing, and this bodes well for our Industrial business in the year ahead.","Staying within the manufacturing sector of the economy, EIS, our Electrical\/Electronic distributor, also experienced a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter. After being up 5% in Q1 and then 9% in the second quarter, followed by a 5% increase in the third quarter, EIS was down 2% in the fourth quarter and ended the year up 5%. And as with Motion, the latter part of the fourth quarter proved to be the most challenging.","One of the external indices that we closely follow is the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers' Index. This is usually a pretty good leading indicator for our Electrical business. As a matter of information, the PMI averaged 57.3 for all of 2010, and our Electrical business was up 30%. In 2011, the PMI averaged 55.2, and we were up 24%.  For 2012, the full year PMI was 51.7 or perhaps more significant is the fact that the last 7 months of 2012, the average has been 50.4.","This is a fairly typical number, and it's indicative of the slower end-market conditions that our Electrical\/Electronic operations are experiencing right now. As with our Industrial business, we think that these conditions will persist for another quarter or 2, but we remain optimistic about our Electrical segment turning in a solid performance in 2013.","Moving on to Office Products. We actually had our best quarter of the year in Q4. After being down 1.5% in the first quarter and down 1% in quarters 2 and 3, S.P. Richards was up 3% in the final quarter, and this enabled them to end the year even with the prior year. Both the independent dealers and the Mega customers had positive results in the fourth quarter, which was good to see.","And on the product side, cleaning and break-room and furniture had the strongest results in the quarter. We were pleased to all 4 product categories, cleaning and break-room, furniture, technology and office supplies end the year with positive fourth quarter results.","Although the Office Products environment continues to be challenging, with the plans and initiatives that S.P. Richards has in place, we look for a year of moderate growth from this segment of our business in 2013.","So that's a brief overview of our Industrial, Electrical and Office Products businesses. And at this point, I will ask Paul to give you an update on the Automotive operations. Paul?","Paul D. Donahue","Thank you, Tom, and I'd like to add my welcome to each of you this morning. I'm pleased to join Jerry, Carol and Tom, and to have the opportunity to provide an update on the fourth quarter performance of our North American Automotive business.","As you know, Automotive is the company's largest business segment. And we ended the fourth quarter with sales up 5%, which has improved from the 2.5% growth that we reported for the third quarter. For the 12 months ended December 31, our Automotive business finished up 4% over 2011.","The 5% revenue growth in the fourth quarter includes relatively flat comparable store sales and a positive sales contribution from our acquisition of Quaker City Motor Parts. Sales to our commercial accounts, the dominant segment of our business, continued to outpace our retail sales.","We did not see significant changes in the external factors, which continue to impact our industry in the quarter, headwinds related to the mild winter temperatures in the northern half of the country, along with the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the economy and consumer confidence seemed to persist.","Consistent with the past 2 quarters, our results varied significantly by region of the quarter -- by the region of the country in the fourth quarter. In the traditional cold weather regions, our Central, Midwest and Eastern divisions, which comprised over 1\/3 of our overall business, they consistently underperformed the other regions across the U.S. Although the comps from these regions were consistent on a sequential basis, the regional disparity remained significant and impacted key weather-sensitive product categories in these regions.","On a positive note, we believe that a return to more normal winter weather patterns, which we are beginning to see play out, should drive a potential upswing in demand over the next several months.","We remain pleased with the positive contribution from Quaker City Motor Parts, which we acquired back on May 1 of this year -- of 2012. Their fourth quarter and year-to-date sales contributions were in line with our expectations, and we are excited with the opportunities that Quaker City will provide us in the future. Our Quaker City team and our strong group of independent owners are energized and focused on our key initiatives to drive growth in 2013.","As we mentioned earlier, our commercial business continued to outperform our retail business in the fourth quarter. Within our company-owned store group, the commercial side of our business ended the quarter up 1%, consistent with our growth in this segment in the second and third quarters. Non-fleet-related business performed reasonably well, generating a 4% increase, led by our NAPA AutoCare and our Major Account business. The increase in our average ticket value drove the gain, while our average number of invoices was flat.","Turning to our retail business. Sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter. So while we are not pleased with our retail performance, we are encouraged by the initiatives our team has put into place to positively impact our retail sales in 2013.","We have seen over the past few quarters a slight downward trend in our average number of invoices per day, while our average dollar value increased. We believe this to be consistent with retail sales trends, both in the aftermarket and retail in general.","So as we look forward to 2013, we expect a more normalized winter weather pattern to improve demand. We are pleased to note that while it's still early in the year, we are seeing improved sales trends in the northern half of the U.S. We are also seeing a pickup in sales in some of our winter-related product categories, such as our batteries and our rotating electrical categories.","The aging vehicle population continued growth in the number of older vehicles and the positive year-over-year miles driven numbers, up 0.006% through November, bodes well for the automotive aftermarket. And we feel NAPA is well positioned to capture its share of the increase in demand generated by these positive trends.","So in summary, overall demand in the automotive aftermarket in the fourth quarter proved similar to what we experienced in the second and third quarters of 2012. We remain positive about the core fundamentals impacting the automotive aftermarket and our Automotive Parts Group. These positive industry fundamentals, coupled with our internal growth initiatives, provide us ample growth opportunities for 2013 and well into the future.","So that completes our overview of the Automotive business in the fourth quarter and for 2012. And at this time, I will hand it over to Jerry to get us started with our review of the financial results. Jerry?","Jerry W. Nix","Thank you, Paul. And Tom, I want to thank you as well for those kind remarks. It's been a lot of years and a lot of calls, and we've built many great relationships, which I'll certainly miss. And most important is that Genuine Parts is in good hands with Tom and Paul and so many other excellent leaders across our businesses.","Certainly, Carol fits in, in that category, and we're very fortunate to have her assume the role of CFO. Carol and I worked together for all of her 22 years with the company, and I can tell you she is one of the best and brightest and very prepared to lead this company as CFO.","So we appreciate you joining us on the call today. And to move things along, I will first review the fourth quarter and full year income statements and segment information, and then Carol will pick up to review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, and then we'll open up the call up to your questions.","The view of the income statement show the following: Total sales of $3.1 billion for the fourth quarter and that's an increase of 3.5% from last year and is relatively consistent with the third quarter increase. For the year, total sales reached another record high of $13.0 billion, which is up 4.5% from 2011.","Although the sales environment grew more challenging for our Industrial and Electrical businesses in the fourth quarter, our Automotive sales held steady, and the Office Products Group posted their best quarterly results for the year.","We remain confident in our growth initiatives and are planning on another year of respectable sales growth again in 2013. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was 29.2% of sales, and that's down approximately 40 basis points from the fourth quarter and 2011. But for the full year, gross margin of 29.0% was up about 10 basis points from 28.9% in 2011.","So despite the decrease we experienced in the fourth quarter, which we attribute that to the competitive sales environment overall and lower levels of vendor incentives at the Industrial Parts Group, we're pleased to show at least slight progress with gross margin for the year.","Our ongoing initiatives to effectively manage the supply chain cost, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize our pricing potential offer us additional opportunities to further improve our gross margin, and our management teams across all of the businesses are committed to this effort.","For the year, our cumulative pricing, which represents prior increases to us, was a negative 0.003% in Automotive, plus 1.6% in Industrial, plus 2.7% in Office Products and a negative 0.001% in Electrical.","Now turning to SG&A. Total expenses, $659 million in the fourth quarter, is down 2% from 2011 and at 21.1% of sales versus 22.6% in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, total SG&A expenses, $2.8 billion, that's up 2% and at 21.2% of total sales compared to 21.8% for the same period in 2011.","Our management teams have done an excellent job of managing our expenses throughout the year and our ongoing cost saving initiatives have yield much of the improvement on this line. We continue to control our cost from ongoing investments in technology, which has positively impacted the operating efficiencies in our distribution centers and stores, as well as supply chain initiatives in such areas as freight and logistics among others.","Additionally, in December of 2012, the company's pension plan was amended to freeze future benefit accruals for all participants effective January 1, 2014. In connection with this amendment, the company recorded onetime noncash curtailment gain of $23.5 million, which is included on our SG&A line for the fourth quarter and the year.","So throughout the organization, we made solid progress in controlling our expenses, and we'll continue to assess and align the proper cost structure of our businesses as we move through the year and beyond.","Now let's discuss the results by segment. For the fourth quarter, Automotive had revenue of $1,531.6 million, up 5%; and operating profit of $122.5 million, up 36%. So outstanding margin expansion there from 6.2% to 8.0% of sales.","The Industrial Group for the quarter had revenue $1,054.8 million, up 2%; operating profit $78.1 million, that's down 12%. So margin degradation there from 8.6% to 7.4%.","Office Products had revenue for the quarter $402.9 million, that's up 3%; and had operating profit of $36.4 million, that's down 5%. So again, margin deterioration from 9.7% to 9.0%, which is still outstanding operating margin for that business.","Electrical Group had revenue in the quarter of $135.4 million. That was down 2%. They had operating profit of $12.5 million, and that's up 21%. So just superb operating there going from 7.5% to 9.2% operating margins in the quarter.","Now for the year, Automotive had revenue $6,320.9 million, and that represents 49% of the total and is up 4%; operating profit of $540.7 million, up 16%. So again, just super margin 8.6% from 7.7% of revenue the prior year.","The Industrial Group had revenue for the year of $4,453.6 million, and that represents 34% of the total and is up 7%. The operating profit $352.1 million is up 4%. So slight margin decrease  there from 8.1% to 7.9%.","Office Products had revenue for the full year of $1,686.7 million, represents 13% of the total and was down 0.002%. They had operating profit of $134.4 million, and that was up 0.002%. So a slight margin improvement for the year of 7.9% to 8.0% of sales.","The Electrical Group had revenue for the full year $582.8 million, representing 44% of the total, and that's up 4.5%; and operating profit of $50.9 million, up 25%. So record operating margin for the Electrical Group at 8.7% of sales.","Total operating profit was up approximately 10% in the fourth quarter, and operating profit margin improved 50 basis points to 8.0% from 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Now this follows margin improvement of 70, 40 and 20 basis points for the first, second and third quarters of 2012, respectively. Our total operating margin for the year is 8.3%, and that's up 40 basis points from 7.9% last year.","We're extremely pleased with this level of margin expansion and continue to believe that we have additional opportunities to expand the operating margins again in 2013 although more likely in the range of 10 to 20 basis points.","We had net interest expense of $4.9 million and $19.6 million for the fourth quarter and the year, respectively, which is down from 2011 due mainly to the new lower interest rate on our $250 million debt agreement that was funded in November of 2011. We'll discuss our debt position later, but we're currently expect our net interest expense to approximate $28 million again in 2013.","Beginning in this quarter, we separated our amortization from the other category as our amortization of intangibles was more significant in 2012 due to the Quaker City acquisition. Total amortization expense was approximately $4 million and $13 million for the fourth quarter and the year, respectively.","The other line now represents corporate expense and noncontrolling interest and was $11.2 million in income for the fourth quarter and is $26.6 million expense for the full year. This is much improved from 2011 and primarily reflects the pension curtailment gain discussed above. Additionally, the income associated with our 30% investment in Exego was accounted for on this line.","For 2013, we currently project the combination of the amortization and other lines to be in the $60 million and $70 million expense range, which will be relatively consistent with 2012 before the curtailment adjustment.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 36.4%, and that's up from 35.8% last year due to the nontaxable status of a favorable retirement plan adjustment that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year, 36.4% rate compares to 36.6% for the same period in 2011, and we expect our full year tax rate for 2013 to be in the range of 36.0% to 36.5%.","Net income for the quarter $160.2 million, and that's up 19%. EPS increased to $1.03 compared to $0.86 last year, and that's up 20%. For the year, net income is up 15%. EPS of $4.14 is up 16% over 2011. Excluding December 2012 pension curtailment gain discussed earlier, net income was up 8% to $145 million for the fourth quarter and was up 12% to $633 million for the year. EPS, before the adjustment, was up 8% to $0.93 for the quarter and was up 13% to $4.05 for the year.","Now this record level of earnings achieved in 2012, both before and after the pension gain, reflects the third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth for the company. We want to recognize all of our associates at Genuine Parts Company for achieving this significant milestone. We're extremely proud of their accomplishments.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Carol to touch on a few key balance sheet items.","Carol B. Yancey","Thank you, Jerry. And before I begin my remarks, I want to thank everyone for the tremendous opportunity. I'm very appreciative, and it's been nothing but a pleasure to work with Jerry for all these years. We've had a very well-planned and prepared transition, and I look forward to the opportunity.","We'll start off with a discussion of a few key balance sheet items. Cash at December 31 was strong at $403 million, which is consistent with our cash position at September 30, although down from the $525 million at December 31, 2011. Our current cash position reflects strong cash flows for 2012 resulting from our increase in earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions.","This was offset by the more than $500 million used in 2012 for several investing activities, including our January 1 investment in Exego, the leading automotive distribution company in Australia and New Zealand; the Electrical Group's Light Fab acquisition on February 1; and the Automotive Group's Quaker City acquisition that was May 1.","Accounts receivable of $1.5 billion at December 31 increased 2% from 2011 on a 3.5% sales increase for the fourth quarter. Our goal is to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth, so we are very encouraged by our progress with receivables. We will continue to remain focused on this area in 2013, and we're very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.","Inventory at December 31, 2012, was $2.6 billion, up approximately 7% compared to December 31, 2011. Primarily, this increase relates to the impact of our acquisitions in 2012. And without acquisitions, our inventory grew by just 2%. We continue to believe that our team is doing an excellent job of managing our inventory levels, and we remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move through 2013.","Now we will add here that our comparisons to the prior year's inventory reflect the revisions to our 2011 balance sheet that we previously disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q.","Our accounts payable balance at December 31 was $1.7 billion, which is up 17% from the prior year. The significant increase in trade payables reflects the impact of our extended payment terms and other payables initiatives negotiated with our vendors. We're very pleased with our progress in this area. Improving our payables position has always been an important priority for us over the last couple of years, and it's had a positive impact on our days and payables.","Working capital of $2.3 billion at December 31 is down approximately 15% from December of 2011 as reported. It's also down 6% on a comparative basis, which takes into account our current debt of $250 million. Effectively managing accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable is very important to us, and our ongoing progress with these key accounts has had a tremendous impact on improving our working capital position and cash flow.","Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at December 31, 2012.","Our total debt at year end remains unchanged at $500 million. The $250 million of total debt that's due in November of 2013 is accounted for as current debt at the end of December 31. While we have not announced any specific plans for this debt beyond the due date, we will most likely renew the debt amount later this year. There's another $250 million debt that is due in November of 2016.","Our total debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2012, was 14.3%. And although comfortable with our current capital structure, we want to remind you that in September of 2012, we entered into a multicurrency syndicated credit facility agreement for $850 million. This agreement, which carries a 5-year term and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 75 basis points, replaced the $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit that was scheduled to mature in December of 2012. This new facility provides us with expanded borrowing capacities to support our growth opportunities as may be needed from time to time. There were no amounts borrowed under this new agreement at December 31, 2012.","The company continues to generate solid cash flows. And as we mentioned earlier, 2012 was a very strong year for us. Cash from operations reached over $900 million, a new record for us. And free cash flow, after deducting capital expenditures and dividends, was approximately $500 million, also a new record. The continued strength of our cash flows is encouraging, and we remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority for the cash is the dividend, which we have paid every year since going public in 1948 and we've now raised for 57th consecutive years effective with yesterday's board approval of a $2.15 per share annual dividend for 2013. This represents a 9% increase from the $1.98 per share paid in 2012, and it's approximately 52% of our 2012 earnings per share. This is well within our goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward.","Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our core businesses. Strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment in capital expenditures was $30.4 million for the fourth quarter. And for the full year, total CapEx spending was $102 million compared to the $103.5 million for the same period in the prior year. This was at the low end of our expected range for 2012. And based on the timing of certain projects and overall plans for this year, we expect our cash use for CapEx for 2013 to be in the range of $115 million to $135 million. The vast majority of these investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology.","Our depreciation and amortization was $25.1 million in the quarter, and it's $98.4 million for the year, which is up slightly from 2011. Turning to 2013, we would anticipate another increase primarily related to amortization and also the increased capital spending. We are currently expecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $105 million to $115 million for the full year.","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of our cash for us, and they're integral to growth plans for the company. Our investment in Exego and Quaker City in the Automotive Group, as well as a small acquisition in the Electrical Group, performed as planned throughout 2012, and we're encouraged by their continued growth opportunities. We will remain active in seeking new acquisitions for our businesses in 2013, generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally, in 2012, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. We have another 12.2 million shares authorized and available for repurchase today. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we would expect to be active in the program again in 2013 as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.","In closing, we want to be sure and thank all of our GPC associates for the great job they are doing. Another year of record sales and earnings is a great accomplishment and one we are very proud of. The company entered 2013 well positioned for continued growth in our businesses. And as always, we'll support our growth with strong cash flow, a healthy balance sheet and further maximizing our return to shareholders. Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Paul, Jerry and Carol. And Jerry, once again, thank you for being such a significant contributor to the overall success of Genuine Parts Company over the years. We wish you and Cheryl the absolute very best in the years ahead.","Now summarizing our view on 2012, we feel that the GPC team has a lot to be proud of. Among the positive accomplishments this past year where sales, net profit and earnings per share records and operating margin improvement of 40 basis points to 8.3%. Cash from operations and free cash flow set new records as well. Working capital was reduced roughly 6%, and working capital efficiency improved to an all-time low. Both return on average assets and return on invested capital also showed nice improvement once again in 2012. And with the actions taken yesterday by our board, dividends have been increased for the 57th consecutive year.","So we feel good about the GPC team's achievements in each of these areas. The one area where we did not perform as well as we would have liked is on the growth side. After being up 11% in both 2010 and 2011, we went into 2012 expecting more than a 4.5% sales increase. But after a solid first quarter, we saw moderation as the year progressed, reflective of the overall industry slowdown that we saw in our respective businesses.","As we look towards 2013, we see market conditions being quite similar, at least over the first half to what we experienced in the second half of 2012, and our expectation is for modest growth in each of the 4 industries that we operate in during the first half of the year and a bit stronger growth in the second half. This seems to be consistent with the general consensus for the overall economy in the","year ahead.","With that said, our expectation is for revenue growth in Automotive for the full year of 5% to 7%; Industrial 4% to 6%; Electrical, also 4% to 6%; and Office Products 1% to 3%. And this would give us total revenue growth of 4% to 6% for the year. And with revenue growth at this level, our guidance would be for earnings per share to be in the $4.30 to $4.40, which will be up 6% to 9% over the $4.05 earned in 2012 prior to the curtailment gain.","So that will conclude our prepared remarks. And at this point, we'll turn the call back over to Chris for your questions. Chris?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Congratulations, Jerry. We'll certainly miss you out on the road and on the calls.","Jerry W. Nix","Thank you, Chris.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to start with the Automotive side. It was really encouraging to hear that the northern part of the country is starting to see some improvement and starting to see it in batteries and rotating electrical. As you think about last year, I mean, did you see a lot of pull-forward in spring demand because of the warm weather in January, February, March? And does that mean that we have to sort of wait to 2Q for some of these trends to really emerge and see some acceleration in the top line in Auto?","Paul D. Donahue","Yes, Chris, this is Paul. Just a couple of comments, and your question is a valid one. Our 3 divisions that make up the northern tier, the Central, Eastern and Midwestern division, they had a very solid first quarter last year. And absolutely looking back now, we can see that business was pulled forward because sequentially then, Q2, Q3 and Q4 were soft and mid- single-digit soft in the Q3 and Q4. But I am pleased to see -- again, it's only 1 month, but those 3 divisions have rebounded nicely in the month of January, led really by the Midwest division, which is up significantly. So we're cautiously optimistic, Chris, that we're going to see some growth out of the northern half the country this year.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And have you seen much on the brakes and rotor side?","Paul D. Donahue","Brakes and rotors was a challenging category for us last year. We put some things into place that we hope we'll see a rebound in 2013, but that was one of the categories that absolutely was impacted in 2012. And Chris, you mentioned batteries and rotating electrical on the flip side, those are very strong for us in 2012 as we're a few other categories, like tool and equipment for instance and our filter business was good last year. So we're hoping to see and we plan to see our brake business come back in 2013.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Paul, I think that -- Chris, sorry, I'd just add to that, we did not see any material improvement in the brake and rotor business in January. And our expectation is we'll start to see some improvement as we work our way through the year.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Perfect. And then on the EBIT margin side in Automotive, could you delve into that a little more closely in terms of what drove that expansion? Was that Quaker synergies? Was that vendor allowances? Certainly, there was some upside surprise there, so just wanted to get some details.","Jerry W. Nix","Chris, this is Jerry. We had favorable inventory gains in the fourth quarter, and you'll see where -- that's where most of that margin improvement. They were up 50 basis points through the 9 months. They also had significant cost reduction initiatives taken place, and they took $20 million, $25 million of cost out. So between -- and there were some year-end write-backs, we accrued bad debt expense based on a percent of sales. And our bad debt expense, when we got down to actual write-off, was less than it was the prior year. So those are the 3 major contributors to that improvement.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And how should we think about EBIT margin expansion going forward? Or how much of that is sustainable?","Jerry W. Nix","Well, look, the cost reductions that they took out are sustainable and they also have additional cost reductions in place now. I'm certain that we're not going to show that kind of improvement in our bad debt expense coming off, but we should see another 10, 20 basis points operating margin improvement. That's always what we look for.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Jerry, again, congrats and thanks for everything.","Jerry W. Nix","Thanks, Greg. I appreciate it.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Cathy (sic) [Carol], you mentioned inventory was up 2% when you adjust the balance sheet for acquisitions. Could you give us the payables and receivables as well adjusted for acquisitions?","Carol B. Yancey","The impact on the payables was not as significant. It's about $50 million on the payables line. And on receivables, it was about $30 million on the receivables line. But clearly, the bigger number was on the inventory line. Most of our receivables improvement was really as a result of some of our improved terms with our vendors that we talked about. That really drove the bulk of that increase.","Thomas C. Gallagher","On the payables.","Carol B. Yancey","On the payables.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then, Paul, a little bit on the sales trends you saw on the fourth quarter. If I remember, there were some nuances of a day shift in terms of sales. Thought we might get back in the fourth quarter, and it seems like we didn't if we look at the comp store sales. Could you help us sort of understand that sort of flattish comp versus up a little bit in the third quarter and what really drove that sequential decline?","Paul D. Donahue","Yes, Greg, good question. And you're right, there was an extra billing day in the quarter. What I think we may have underestimated a bit was how the holidays fell this year versus last year, with Christmas falling on a Tuesday versus a Sunday prior year. We may have given back a portion of or all of that extra day that we got in the quarter. So I think we underestimated that a bit. December was soft for us, there's no doubt. And when we reported last, we were coming out of the month of September, and we saw a nice increase in the month of September. And certainly, we're hopeful that, that was going to carry on into Q4. But certainly, that wasn't the case. And again, I think that the initiatives that our team has in place going into 2013, we're optimistic about -- cautiously optimistic about getting our sales back in line in 2013.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And lastly, on inflation-deflation [indiscernible] in Auto, in particular, the negative 0.3, that was the same as the third quarter. Could you give us some insight as to where you think that will play out this year? Do we go back to a little bit of inflation in Auto Parts?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Greg, this is Tom. I'll try to answer that. At this point, I would say that we may get a little bit more inflation across each of the businesses in 2013. Automotive, we are seeing some discussion about price increases as we work our way a little deeper into the year. So I would expect that we will have modest inflation in Automotive but not materially so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jerry, best of luck to you.","Jerry W. Nix","Thanks again, John.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, to start off, from the industrial customer -- from your industrial customers, do you get a sense that the uncertainty that they're talking about is really attributable to government policy and kind of uncertainty around that? Or is it really more core to the business environment?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think it's more the former than the latter. There is a heightened sense of concern with the unknown at this point. And it might be helpful to you to know that on our project work, we've not seen any cancellations to this point. But we have seen these be pushed out 1 quarter or 2, which I think, again, underscores the uncertainty. I think people are saying, until we get a little more clarity, we're just going to be very cautious in how we spend money. So the fact that we're being pushed out could eventually lead to some cancellations. But at this point, we've not been notified of any.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And then given that there could be some top line pressure in Industrial and EIS, at least in the first couple of quarters, is there anything you can do from a cost structure basis to kind of offset that?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, yes, and I think our teams have done a good job over the last couple of years in helping to reduce our cost structure. And when we see periods like this where things seem to slow up a bit, then they tighten up on the cost side a bit as well. So there are some actions already underway to try to keep cost more in line with where the revenue is going to be.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then one last one, just on the interest expense guidance, I missed that. Would you mind repeating that, please?","Carol B. Yancey","Well, we currently estimate interest expense to be around $20 million for 2013, with the two $250 million tranches we talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scot Ciccarelli. I know you said there was a sizable difference between, let's call it, traditional cold weather markets and the rest of the business for Auto. Can you get any more specific than that?","Paul D. Donahue","Scot, this is Paul. The impact in Q4 was about 300 basis points impact.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So that's a more narrow gap than what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. Correct?","Paul D. Donahue","Well, actually, it's fairly consistent. We're  running down in those 3 divisions -- I'm talking about the impact on the overall business. So those 3 divisions of our company, we're running mid- single digit down in Q4 versus a slight uptick in the balance of our business.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I see. Okay, understood.","Paul D. Donahue","But you understand the overall impact?","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, okay. That's kind of what I was trying to get to. Okay. And then also just regarding -- I know we talked about the Auto EBIT margins a little bit. We did see the EBIT margin for Industrial compress a little bit. What's the right way to think about that going forward? I mean, is that another basis point improvement like we expect in auto? Or will the current revenue trends maybe prevent that from occurring this year?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Scot, this is Tom. I would say that, first of all, our expectation is that the revenue trends will improve somewhat as the year progresses. But I think in terms of modeling, I would look for a 10 to 20 basis point improvement in the Industrial margins for the full year.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And is that because that's going to be natural leverage? Is that because you guys are trying to take cost out like you took out of Auto? Just trying to figure out what's the -- what are the various moving pieces there, Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we're counting on a little bit stronger revenue growth, not so much in the first quarter or 2, but more so in the second half of the year. There are ongoing cost containment, cost reduction initiatives that are taking place there. There's a fair amount of work that's being done on the margin side of the business, the gross margin side of the business. So hopefully, we'll see a little bit of improvement in that through the course of the year. So there are a number of levers that are being pulled on simultaneously to try to ensure that we have show margin improvement. I think if you go back and look at the Industrial performance sequentially over the course of the year. Q1 and Q2, we were running pretty strong revenue increases, 12% and 8%, respectively. And then we saw really good margin improvement through the first half of the year, and then we gave that back and then a little bit more as we got to the back half of the year. But our expectation is maybe the inverse for 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jerry, I will miss you very much. It's always a pleasure working with you over the years.","Jerry W. Nix","Thank you, Matt. You're the man.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So first of all, on Automotive. Obviously, we've picked this sector over a bit already this morning. But if you look at differences in DIY or retail and the traditional commercial business, anything related to car age and sort of the target customer -- target car, that is, within those segments that as you look at the numbers and the stagnancy in retail that you think might be kind of attributable to something structural like that?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Matt, this is Tom. I don't think there's anything that's changed significantly enough to cause any material change in the performance over a short span of time. Paul mentioned in his comments on the commercial side of the business, if we move fleet aside for a moment, and I'll come back to fleet in a moment, but if you move that to the side in the quarter, our non-fleet-related commercial business was actually up mid-single digit, which I think in the current environment is a pretty good performance. But what we've seen on that side of the business is that we see that our ticket value has increased some, but the ticket count is actually flattish. So that would indicate to us that it's somewhat driven by consumer discretionary spending habit at this point. If we go over to the fleet side of the business, the fleet side of the business actually started to show signs of moderating as we get deep into the second quarter of the year and then quarters 3 and 4, the fleet business actually had a little bit of deceleration. And that's consistent with what we see across the industry and is consistent with what we see in some of the indices. If you look at the transportation service index, you'll see that, that decelerated sequentially as the year progressed and actually went into negative territory in the latter part of the year. So I don't think at this point we've seen any material change structurally in the business. I think it may be more driven by consumer spending. And I think that may continue for another quarter or 2 as we continue to digest the effect of maybe some higher fuel prices and also the increased payroll tax that people are adjusting to.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tom, either for you or Paul, to the extent that you've seen some recovery in cold weather markets and cold weather products, is that happening evenly across both retail and commercial? Or is it biased towards one of the segments?","Paul D. Donahue","Matt, this is Paul. At this point in time, it's early. But at this point in time, it's certainly more on the commercial side than the retail side.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm curious kind of functionally, given that everyone's cars kind of do the same thing. Is it because of the kinds of transactions that are driven by cold weather, perhaps failure tend to show themselves more at commercial? Or will there be some other reason for that?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think a part of the reason, Matt. But the other thing is I think the commercial is a bit stronger in the areas that we're talking about, and retail maybe a bit stronger in the Sun Belt-related areas.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just a final cleanup question on the guidance side, the $4.30 to $4.40 of 2013 EPS. Is there buyback assumption embedded in that number, please?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No. Our buyback plan, Matt, just to further amplify, at a minimum, we want to buy back the number of shares that we issue under our long-term incentive grants. We want to avoid any dilution there. So I think you could model something along the lines of $1.2 million, $1.3 million in line with what we did this year.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But there's no embedded share count reduction above and beyond that in that number?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli & Company.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","To you, Jerry, again, congratulations and best wishes.","Jerry W. Nix","Thanks again, Brian.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Just want to talk about Exego for a couple of minutes here. Just from a point of clarification, that's now on the other line as far as when you're breaking out your operating segments, correct?","Carol B. Yancey","Yes, yes.","Thomas C. Gallagher","That's right.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","First of all, how are we trending on Exego as far as hitting your targets for profitability where you consider rolling up the business?","Thomas C. Gallagher","They're actually ahead of plan. And if we go back to our original expectation, we thought that they would get to the level sometime late 2013 or early 2014. They're actually going to get there a little bit sooner, and it will be at that point that we'll have a decision to make. And just so you understand from the point that they actually hit the threshold, we've got up to 6 months to exercise our right.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","All right. Terrific. And then -- most of my questions have been answered, but there's speculation about 2 of your major customers in the Office Products side potentially getting together. If this were to be the case, do you think you'd see some pricing pressure within the Office Products division that could potentially hurt your margins?","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Well, that's speculative at this point. I'd say, first of all, this has been something that has long been speculated, and it appears that there's some substance to it right now. Looking at the medium to long term, if there's excess capacity in the industry and it gets taken out, I think that's fundamentally healthy for the industry. In terms of 3 competitors going down to 2, that might lead to a bit more rationale competition among those 3. How it plays out and how it backs up on us, I can't answer that at this point. But our general sense is that if it's something that's fundamentally good for the overall business and the industry then, eventually, it's going to be good for us.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Gober with Morgan Stanley.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a quick one on gross margins. Just wanted to try to parse out where you saw a little bit of the gross margin compression in the quarter. I mean, obviously, Industrial and EIS were the 2 segments that saw overall margin compression. Is that where gross is under pressure as well? And if so, what was the kind of the key driver, was it fixed cost deleverage or something else in those segments?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, first of all, I wouldn't focus too much on the quarter. I'd suggest that maybe we focus on the full year, and we were able to show some gross profit improvement for the full year, 9 basis points. Not an overwhelming improvement, but after 2 years of modest decline, I think the team generally did a pretty good job of stabilizing the gross margin and then bringing it back. In Jerry's comments, he mentioned that one of the contributing factors in the quarter what that we did not have the volume incentive rebates to the degree that we had them in the Industrial segment, so we didn't have the benefit of that. And we also didn't use the balance sheet to prop up the income statement because we didn't go out and make big buys at the end of the year to try to capture some of those. Carol referenced in her comments that without the Quaker City acquisition, our inventories were up 2%. So I think as a general statement, our folks did a good job of keeping inventories under control, and we probably gave up opportunities on a little bit of gross profit enhancement. But we felt it was prudent to operate the way we did operate in the fourth quarter. And I'd say in terms of modeling, you might model in that gross profits will be at least equal to what they were this past year. And frankly, we're planning on a modest improvement again in gross profit in 2013.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And not to beat a dead horse on the Auto Parts business. But Paul, I was wondering if you could kind of walk us through maybe what you're seeing on the DIY part of the business in terms of the decline in the fourth quarter by category. Are you seeing discretionary categories that are weak? Or is it really more of the weather-related categories there maybe just different because of regional concentrations?","Paul D. Donahue","Yes, David. It is more of the discretionary. And our retail business, as I stated in my opening comments, we're certainly not pleased with our retail results. I do believe they're fairly consistent both across our industry, as well as retail in general has been under bit of pressure. But I will tell you that we have a number of initiatives in place as we go into 2013, and I would hope that some of the things that we've put in place would begin to move the needle back in a positive direction for us.","Thomas C. Gallagher","David, I would just add that -- Paul mentioned it in his earlier comments and that is that the average ticket size is actually up a little bit on the retail side, which is very encouraging to us. But we have seen a modest decline in ticket count, so I think a challenge for us is to generate a bit more foot traffic. And that in itself will help the overall retail business.","Paul D. Donahue","And just a follow-up to that, David, we are certainly optimistic. We launched a new advertising campaign post Super Bowl that we fully expect will drive some traffic, and we'll follow up with an additional ad campaign starting as NASCAR kicks off by this Sunday at Daytona.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","This one maybe for Carol a bit. As you talk about working capital management, extending payables, do you have sort of an initial target where you're  thinking you're taking the AP inventory ratio to 2013?","Carol B. Yancey","We don't really have a target. We look for continued improvement on that line, maybe not all that we had this year. But we certainly expect to have a continued improvement on that line, but no specific targets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And then sort of shifting back to the last question that was just asked on the DIY side of the business. Do you have a feeling, I guess, sort of market share wise, is your performance regionally sort of -- are you getting the feeling that's in line with peers? Or is there aggressive pricing coming out of some of the competitors in the market, either to maintain or enhance their DIY share that may be limiting some of your comp store sales regionally?","Paul D. Donahue","Bret, this is Paul. I think pricing with our peer group has been fairly rational this year. We don't see it in any particular market being any more difficult than another particular market. Again, I think retail in general and the retail consumer is under a bit of stress. Certainly, as Tom mentioned earlier, the payroll tax, that 2% is going to have an impact on some of those -- that walk-in traffic. But again, we've taken on as our responsibility in a tough environment, we've got to go out, be aggressive and take some market share. And that's our plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But just quickly, could you tell me how much acquisitions contributed in the Industrial and Electrical segments in the quarter?","Carol B. Yancey","Well, Industrial didn't have any acquisitions in the quarter. And Electrical had that small acquisition, Light Fab, that we talked about earlier but it's really immaterial. It's certainly on the balance sheet, and there was just some incremental revenue in earnings as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Hilgert with MorningStar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Jerry, let me add my congratulations and hope you're blessed with many years of happy retirement.","Jerry W. Nix","Thank you very much, Rich.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Wanted to kind of drill down a little bit more on the fleet business in Auto. You mentioned during the call that you saw that steadily decline as the year progressed. You also mentioned earlier in the call that some of the uncertainties surrounding government regulation and taxes is causing some reticence among businesses. I'm wondering if those 2 are related? And also as time progresses and as these fleets vehicles age, are we going to see them catch up with repairs first before they start replacing vehicles in those fleets?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, taking the first part, I don't think we have any statistical data that can make a direct correlation between the uncertainty surrounding what's happening in Washington and maybe some of the freight or transportation indices. But one would have to think that there is some inter-connectivity between those 2. If people are deferring or delaying certain purchases, eventually that has to result in some downward movement in the amount of product that's being shipped. The TSI index, just as a point of information, includes over-the-road trucking, it includes rail and it includes barge, it includes aviation. So it's a pretty comprehensive index, and it has been showing signs of deceleration as the year progressed. The second part in terms of the continued aging of the fleet, at some point, those vehicles are going to need some level of repair. What we have seen over more recent times is that if it affects safety or drivability, we're seeing expenditures being made. But if it's at all something that's discretionary, we see more judgment coming in terms of whether or not the repair is going to be made. So I think as long as those vehicles continue to age, it will continue to drive demand for replacement parts.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. The second area I wanted to get a little bit more color on was in the Office Products Group. An earlier question kind of hinted a little bit at it, but it seems to me that pricing pressure is going to continue going forward and that the OfficeMax and Office Depot combination, if it were, in fact, to happen, would happen because they're seeking to get obviously some efficiencies of scale and be able to better compete in the industry because you've got Walmart stores, Costco, you've got Amazon all entering into that space. So your comments earlier said that you saw I think you said it was a 2.7% increase in pricing in Office Products during the year. And I'm wondering, is that because you're focusing in areas outside of what the other players are doing? As you mentioned, you're in furniture and you're in cleaning and break-room. And I'm wondering if those other competitors might start looking at those areas?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we'll try to take them maybe in reverse order. In terms of the product categories that we're in, all of these companies are in each of these categories to one degree or another. In terms of the 2.7% inflationary impact on Office Products, that's calculated based upon manufacturer price increases to us, not necessarily our price increases out to our customer base. And then looking at the potential acquisition or combination of Office Depot and OfficeMax, obviously, they see enormous potential for synergies, and I think they run into a number of different categories. They're not just purchase price synergies. I think they're going to wind up being, perhaps even greater, in the non-procurement side of the business just because of the redundancy that exists today with the 2 freestanding companies.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. But it's still reasonable to assume that with a company like Amazon getting into this space, we're going to see more pricing competition because of online getting into it?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, it would seem so. But keep in mind that we already are a provider of product to online resellers. Many of our customers have online presence. Staples, I think, would be second only to Amazon in terms of their online business. So the fact that we have a new entrant does not mean it's new to the industry. This is something that's been around for a while, and I think it's reasonable to say that they will put some pricing pressure in the different channels. But we've already been competing, and our customer set has already been competing with very, very good e-tail companies that are out there today.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great, great. And just a last housekeeping item, the $23.5 million gain from the pension that's in the SG&A. I was wondering, is that divided up amongst the segments? Or is that primarily in the Automotive segment operating income?","Carol B. Yancey","All of the pension curtailment gain, the $23.5 million, is in the other line. So it is not in the segments.","Operator","And that's all of the allotted time that we have for questions. I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, thank you, all, very much. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We look forward to giving you more of an update as we work our way through the first quarter. And we'll close again by thanking Jerry Nix for 34 outstanding years and wishing him the very, very best in the years going forward.","Jerry W. Nix","I thank each of you as well. It's been a great ride. And you've got a great stock that you're holding here and look forward to continuing to progress.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"10254":["Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 17, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Sid Jones - SVP, IR","Paul Donahue - Chairman & CEO","Carol Yancey - EVP & CFO","Conference Call Participants","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan","Gustavo Gonzalez - RBC Capital Markets","Matt McClintock - Raymond James","Daniel Imbro - Stephens","Kate McShane - Goldman Sachs","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities","Jacob Moser - Wolfe Research","Bret Jordan - Jefferies","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Genuine Parts Company Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Genuine Parts Company. Thank you. You may begin.","Sid Jones","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company third quarter 2019 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2019. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.","Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","Now I will turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Sid. And let me add my welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our third quarter 2019 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance, and then cover the highlights across our businesses. Carol Yancey will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for the full year. After that, we will open the call to your questions.","So to recap, our third quarter performance across our global platform. We are pleased to set a quarterly sales record achieving the $5 billion quarterly sales mark for the first time in our company's history. This represents a 6.2% sales increase from Q3 of 2018 and follows a 2.3% total sales increase last quarter with the improvement driven by a 1.2% comp sales increase and a 6.7% benefit from strategic acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 1.7% headwind from foreign currency translation and the decline in sales related to the Auto Todo divestment earlier in the year.","Net income in the third quarter was $227 million and earnings per share were $1.56, excluding the impact of transaction and other cost and income related to acquisitions and divestments, adjusted net income was $219 million or $1.50 per share. This compares to $1.48 reported in the third quarter of last year. Our teams were active this quarter executing our strategy to further optimize our portfolio. This included actions to complete the Inenco industrial acquisition and Australasia, the sale of EIS and the investment in Sparesbox Australia's leading online automotive and accessories business. We made significant progress in several areas, this quarter and we are excited for the growth opportunities we see ahead.","We will cover each of these areas as we review our business segments. Our global automotive sales, which represented 56% of our total revenues were up 5.3% from last year and improved from 1.4% in Q2, comparable sales were up 1.8%, which was improved from the 1.3% in Q2 and acquisitions added another 6.5% of sales. This growth was partially offset by an approximately 2% unfavorable foreign currency translation and a 1% impact from the sale of the Auto total business in Mexico.","In our North American operations, U.S. automotive sales were up 2.5% on a comp basis and our Canadian Automotive business posted 3.8% sales comps. We remain confident in the ongoing strength of the North American automotive aftermarket and expect these markets to gain positive momentum over the balance of the year and well into 2020. For the second consecutive quarter, we had positive sales growth with both our commercial and retail customers with sales to the DIFM segment performing very well and outpacing our DIY sales.","Among our DIFM customer segments, sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center customers continue to outperform our overall commercial sales growth. This customer group represents approximately 18,000 independent repair shops in the U.S. and another 2,000 in Canada. So obviously a very key segment to us. We were also pleased to see stronger growth with our major account customers with sales increases in each of our categories including our fleet and government customers, national tire centers, regional accounts and OE dealers.","Now turning to our retail segment, while our team generated a positive revenue increase in the quarter, we have experienced a few headwinds in this segment of our business.","We believe this reflects a combination of lapping strong comps associated with our impact store rollout in 2018, a continued slowing of our transaction count, which we have seen across the industry and finally, timing related to major promotional events.","Our team has launched a series of initiatives, which we expect to improve this trend in the quarters ahead, while Carol will provide more financial details later, it's worth adding that both our U.S. and Canadian businesses delivered improved profitability and strong margins in the quarter. So a solid quarter for our North American automotive operations and we expect to continue to build on this positive momentum. In Europe, we continue to operate in a challenging sales environment although we are pleased to report an improvement in our core sales performance relative to the second quarter.","Overall, our sales comps were down mid-single digits, an improvement from the high single-digit decline in Q2. Across our geographical regions, we saw a significant improvement in our largest market, France, which posted a slight increase in the quarter. Germany was down slightly while the UK was our most challenged region as it continues to feel the effect of Brexit along with tough comps fueled by a series of one-time events in 2018.","The UK labor market remains strong despite a decline in employment in Q3 while domestic growth is showing signs of slowing and overall business sentiment is lumping. That said, the news coming out of the UK this past week is somewhat encouraging and we remain hopeful the UK, and European Union can reach an agreement sooner or rather than later. The AAG team has made progress in executing on their sales and cost savings plans and we believe we are beginning to see the impact on our business, both on the revenue and cost side of the ledger.","Specifically related to sales one key initiative to highlight would be the Q3, Q4 rollout of the NAPA brand across several product categories. We believe the introduction of a quality private label offering will further distinguish our European business from the competition and provide incremental growth opportunities for us. As it relates to cost savings, our efforts thus far are having a positive impact on our European operating profits and we expect to generate additional expense reductions in the periods ahead.","In addition, we also made progress with our European M&A strategy during the quarter. We continue to integrate the PartsPoint acquisition, which closed on June 1st with our overall European business and this group performed according to plan. Likewise, we closed on the Todd acquisition in France on October 1st. This strategic acquisition positions us as the market leader in the heavy-duty segment across the French market. As a reminder PartsPoint and Todd are expected to add $330 million and $85 million in annual revenues. So despite current market conditions, we see many good things taking shape in our European business, and we remain committed to our growth and integration plans for this important segment of our Automotive operations.","Now turning to Australia and New Zealand, our team continues to outperform the market with solid comp sales growth of 4.2% for the quarter. This represents our strongest core sales growth in 2019 despite more challenging economic conditions across the region. We were also pleased to complete our full -- our first full quarter with our 87% investment in Sparesbox which closed on July 1. As a reminder Sparesbox is Australia's leading online automotive parts and accessories business and while not material to our financial results, this partnership serves to enhance our understanding of the digital marketplace and grow our digital sales capabilities in Australasia, and potentially across all of our global operations. So that's a review of our global automotive business and now we will turn to our industrial business.","Our Global Industrial Parts Group continues to push further with our portfolio optimization initiatives with the closing of the Inenco acquisition on July 1 and the sale of EIS on September 30. We will address both transaction shortly, but overall this group had a solid quarter with sales of $1.7 billion, up 9.9%, including an approximately 1% comp sales increase and a 9% benefit from acquisitions. This group also improve their operating margin by 30 basis points for the second consecutive quarter and 50 basis points if we exclude EIS. So we are pleased with the continued progress in our Industrial business. The softness we have seen in our top line growth is not unexpected given the overall slowdown we have seen in the industrial economy.","This has translated to mixed results across our product and industry sector sales with eight of our 14 product categories and seven of 12 industries positive in the third quarter. With the slowing U.S. manufacturing trends the Motion team continues to look for strategic tuck-in acquisitions as part of its overall growth strategy and effective October 1 acquired the fluid power house headquartered in Ontario, Canada.","FPA which is a full service fluid power distributor with four locations and projected annual sales of $20 million. Our Industrial business in Canada has been growing at a high single-digit pace or better for 11 consecutive quarters and we are excited to bolster their position in the Fluid Power segment. We have also further diversified our industrial footprint with the entry into Australasia. We were pleased to close on the Inenco acquisition and Australasia on July 1 and they have hit the ground running. Inenco is a leading industrial distributor in this region with operations in Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia, and this business performed very well in the quarter, providing accretive sales and profitability. We continue to believe that Inenco was an excellent strategic fit with Motion in North America and presents tremendous opportunities for global industrial growth.","Finally, during the third quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to sell the Electrical Specialties Group of Motion Industries and this transaction ultimately closed on September 30, 2019. As background, we had determined that this was in the best interest of the company given its lower growth and lower margin profile relative to our core industrial operations. We were very pleased to complete the sale of this business and take another step forward in our strategy to optimize our portfolio and best position GPC for sustainable long-term growth. So now let's discuss S.P. Richards, our Business Products Group.","For the third quarter, comp sales for this business were down approximately 1%. This sales decreased primarily reflects the slower sales in our core office supplies and technology categories as well as slower sales with our National Accounts Group. In contrast, our facilities and safety supplies business delivered another quarter of solid results and we expect continued growth from this category in the quarters ahead.","Despite the softness in the top line, the BPG team has stabilized its operations with improved profitability and a 40 basis point year-over-year improvement in operating margin for the quarter. This is significant progress and especially impressive given a devastating fire that occurred at our Atlanta DC at head office in mid-July.","First, we want to say how pleased we are to report then no one was injured during this unfortunate event. Second, our team was well prepared with an effective business continuity plan enabling them to get back up and operational in a matter of days. We are proud of our team for their attention to safety and servicing our customers under very difficult circumstances. So that's a recap of our consolidated and business segment results in the third quarter of 2019.","But before I turning it over to Carol for her remarks. We wanted to update you on our action plans and progress in accelerating our ongoing cost savings plans and developing aggressive expense reduction initiatives. These efforts are designed to more effectively address our cost structure, drive meaningful savings and deliver incremental value. So today, we are pleased to announce that we have plans in place to generate annualized savings of $100 million by the end of 2020. And as Carol will discuss later these are meaningful cost reductions that will help drive operating margin expansion in the years to come. Our team is committed to this mission and excited to work together to achieve these savings.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol.","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then provide you with our updated outlook for 2019. With our third quarter total sales of $5 billion representing a 6.2% increase, our gross margin for the quarter was 32.4% compared to 31.4% in 2018 with the improvement in margin relating to several factors. These include more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies, favorable product mix and the benefit of higher supplier incentives.","In addition, the PartsPoint and Inenco businesses have higher gross margin profiles. These factors drove improved gross margins in all three of our business segments and we continue to expect our 2019 gross margin rate to remain relatively in line with our current run rate. The pricing environment across all three of our segments has been relatively in place scenario thus far in 2019. In automotive, the price increase is primarily related to the impact of tariffs, while Industrial and Business Products has seen increases associated with general inflation in areas such as raw material pricing, commodities and supplier freight.","Thus far we have been successful in passing on the price increases to our customers to protect our gross margins. So we continue to believe that the current levels of inflation have been a net positive to our results and we expect this to continue through the balance of 2019. Specific to tariffs their impact in the third quarter primarily reflects the 25% tariff on List 1, 2, 3 items, although business products was also impacted by the 15% tariff on the List 4A items which was effective September 1. With this in mind, the impact of tariffs on our Q3 sales was approximately 2% for U.S. automotive immaterial for industrial and approximately 1% for business products. We would add that the tariffs have had no impact on our gross margins.","Turning to our SG&A. These expenses were $1.3 billion in the third quarter, up 13.5% from last year and 25.3% of sales. Our SG&A expenses continue to be impacted by the effect of rising costs in areas such as payroll freight and delivery, IT, and cyber security, as well as ongoing investments to improve our efficiencies and productivity. The PartsPoint and Inenco businesses also have a higher SG&A profile, and this was a factor in the increase. In addition, we are seeing the deleveraging of expenses due to slower comparable sales growth in certain operations. As Paul mentioned earlier, we've been enhancing our initiatives and intensifying our efforts to reduce our costs and more effectively leverage our expenses.","While these efforts are still in the early stages of implementation. We've made significant progress and we expect to generate meaningful savings as we move forward. By the end of 2020, we expect to generate annualized savings of $100 million and we will continue to evaluate opportunities for additional cost reduction in the years beyond. As part of our commitment to drive efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs, we're focused on a variety of cost saving initiatives. We intend to reorganize and streamline several functional areas across our operations including numerous back office responsibilities. In addition, we expect to consolidate and ultimately reduce our total number of distribution facilities and to enhance the automation utilized and distribution and back office functions.","These actions will require organizational changes and we're currently working on a number of workforce initiatives to successfully drive this process, while also maintaining excellent customer service. We look forward to providing more details on these plans and initiatives as they are finalized and launched and executed in the coming quarters.","So now let's discuss the results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.8 billion, up 5% from the prior year and our operating profit of $222 million was down 2% with an operating margin of 8.0% compared to 8.6% margin in the third quarter of 2018. This quarter, the 60 basis point decline in margin directly relates to the challenges we are facing in Europe. And as mentioned, we expect to see improvement in Europe as well as all of our Automotive operations through the saving plans that we will be implementing through the next 12 months.","Our industrial sales were $1.7 billion in the quarter, a strong 10% increase from Q3 of 2018. Our operating profit of $138 million was up 15.4% and their operating margin improved to 7.9% from 7.6% last year with a 30 basis point increase due to gross margin expansion and the leveraging of expenses. The industrial business continues to operate well with a 11 consecutive quarters of solid sales and operating results.","Our business products revenues were $492 million, down 1% from the prior year. Their operating profit of $21.6 million is up 9%, and their operating margin improved to 4.4% from 4.0% last year. So it's nice to see the margin expansion and continued steady results for this business. Our total company operating profit in the third quarter was $381 million, up 4% on a 6% sales increase and our operating profit margin was 7.6% compared to 7.7% last year. We had net interest expense of $25 million in the third quarter, which is up slightly from the second quarter and up from the $22 million in the third quarter last year.","Looking ahead, we are currently expecting net interest to be in the $92 million to $93 million range for the full year, which is down from our previous estimate of $97 million to $98 million. This improvement reflects our lower projected interest rates and debt levels for the balance of the year. Our total amortization expense was $26 million for the third quarter and we continue to expect full-year amortization to be approximately $100 million.","Our depreciation expense was $42 million in the third quarter and we are narrowing the range for our full-year depreciation expense to $170 million to $175 million for the year. On a combined basis we expect depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $270 million to $275 million for 2019. Continuing with the segment information presented in our press release, the other line which primarily represents our corporate expense was $26 million in the third quarter including an approximate $12 million benefit associated with the transaction costs and other income related primarily to the Inenco acquisition and the sale of EIS.","The acquisition of the final 65% interest in Inenco resulted in a $39 million gain on the revaluation of our original 35% investment. This was partially offset by transaction costs, and the $6 million net loss related to the sale of EIS, excluding these items, our corporate expense was $38 million or a $6 million increase from last year and primarily relates to payroll pressures increased legal and professional fees, ongoing investments in IT, Cyber security, Digital and overall omnichannel initiatives. For 2019, we are narrowing our expected range for corporate expense to $130 million to $135 million. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 25.3%, an increase from the 24.5% rate in the prior year, primarily due to transaction and other associated costs. For the full year, we continue to expect our 2019 tax rate to be approximately 25%.","Now let's turn to our balance sheet, which remains strong and an excellent condition. Accounts receivable of $2.7 billion is up 3% from the prior year. This compares to our 6% total sales increase and represents a 2.5% increase excluding acquisitions, foreign currency and the impact of EIS. So we did a good job of managing this account and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at September 30 was $3.7 billion, up 5% from September of last year, excluding acquisitions, foreign currency and EIS our inventory was up less than 1% and we're very pleased with the progress our teams are making in maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels.","Our accounts payable of $4.2 billion is up 4% due mainly to the increase in purchasing volume and to a lesser degree the benefit of improved payment terms with key global partners. At September 30, our AP to inventory ratio was 113%. Our total debt of $3.4 billion at September 30 is down from the $3.9 billion at June 30th due primarily to the repayment of debt as a result of our strong cash from operations in the third quarter. At September 30, our average interest rate on our total outstanding debt stands at 2.23% which is improved from the 2.63% at September 30 last year. We remain comfortable with our current debt structure and we have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our future growth initiatives and our ongoing priorities for effective capital allocations.","As mentioned, we had strong cash flows in the third quarter and we've generated $745 million in cash from operations thus far in 2019. For the full year, we continue to expect approximately $1 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow, which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend to be in the $300 million to $350 million range. So we expect our cash flows to continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of cash which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value.","Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, the dividend and share repurchases. We have invested a $183 million in capital expenditures thus far in 2019 up $91 million from 2018. This reflects our growing global platform and the planned increase in our investments in areas such as technology and productivity in our facilities.","For the year, we're updating our capital expenditures to the range of $250 million to $300 million. Regarding the dividend 2019 represents our 63rd consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. Our 2019 annual dividend of $3.05 represents a 6% increase from 2018 and it's approximately 54% of our 2018 adjusted earnings, which is in line with our targeted payout ratio. Turning to our share repurchase program we have purchased approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock thus far in 2019 and today we have $15.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We expect to be active in the program over the long term and continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","So now let's discuss our current outlook for 2019. We are updating our full year 2019 sales and earnings guidance in consideration of several factors. These factors include our results through the nine months of the year, our current growth plans and initiatives, the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future across all of our operations, the September 30 sale of EIS and the ongoing impact of a strong U.S. dollar. With these items in mind, we expect our full year sales to increase approximately 3.5%. This updated sales outlook represents a change from our previous guidance for a plus 4.5% to plus 5.5% sales increase and it accounts for the sale of EIS as well as the incremental impact of foreign currency translation relative to our previous guidance.","As this is customary, this guidance excludes the benefit of any future acquisitions, by business we are guiding sales to be up 3.5% to 4% for the Automotive segment, which has changed from our previous guidance of plus 4% to plus 5% and primarily due to the impact of foreign currency and a challenging sales environment, which we continue to face in Europe, plus 4% to plus 4.5% for the industrial segment, which is down from the plus 7% to plus 8% previously primarily related to the sale of EIS, and down approximately 1% for the business products segment.","On the earnings side, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.44 to $5.52, which accounts for the transaction and other costs and income incurred through the nine months in 2019. And we are updating our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $5.60 to $5.68 from the previous $5.65 to $5.75, this represents a $0.05 to $0.07 change in earnings primarily due to the sale of EIS. As a reminder, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes any nine month and future transaction and other costs, that completes our financial update and our outlook for 2019 and I will now turn it back over to Paul.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Carol. We were pleased to perform in line with our expectations for the third quarter, and would highlight several accomplishments. We had record quarterly sales, surpassing $5 billion in sales for the first time in our company's history. We achieved another quarter of positive comp sales growth in our U.S., Canadian and Australasian automotive businesses as well as our Industrial business. We further improved our gross margin with a 105 basis point year-over-year gain.","Our Industrial business continue to perform well, generating a 30 basis point margin improvement. The Business Products Group further stabilized posting a 40 basis point margin improvement. We improved our working capital position and generated strong cash flows and finally, we expanded our global footprint via several diversified acquisitions, both by segment and geography, including a Inenco and Sparesbox on July 1, and the fluid powerhouse and Todd on October 1.","In addition to these accomplishments, we have made strong progress on our ongoing business transformation. We continue to take steps to optimize our portfolio of businesses as demonstrated by the sale of EIS on September 30. Finally, we strengthened our focused on sustainable, value-creating initiatives to drive meaningful enduring efficiency including the cost reduction actions we discuss today. We will also continue to execute on our aggressive initiatives to improve top line performance. We plan to achieve this by incrementally growing revenue through new business generation, executing our digital strategy and finally securing strategic bolt-on acquisitions. We are focused on creating significant long-term value for our shareholders and we will continue to update the investment community as we make progress towards this important objective.","We thank you for listening, and with that, we'll turn it back to the operator and Carol and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks, good morning everybody. So first, a cleanup question, did both NAPA and Motion have one less Sunday in the quarter and what was the approximate comp benefit to that?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So we really, while we did have arguably an extra day in the third quarter and we were sort of day in Q1, it varies depending on the business and the geography in the segment. So we would say it was more of a minimal impact.","Christopher Horvers","Minimal. And so I guess -- maybe historically said 50 basis points or something less than that.","Carol Yancey","Something less than that. That's correct.","Christopher Horvers","In Motion, did have one less?","Carol Yancey","They did, yes.","Christopher Horvers","Okay, got it. And then could you maybe first on the Motion side, can you talk about those core Motion comps ex that extra day noise. Did it turn negative in September. And how are you thinking about the outlook over the coming quarters given the fact that the PMI has been I think negative in back-to-back months.","Paul Donahue","Yes. So Chris, thanks for the question. The look our Motion business, despite the decline two months in a row in PMI. And if you go back further Chris, PMI has been declined for six consecutive months and 10 out of 13. So not a new phenomenon by any stretch. Our Motion business we're pleased with the way the guys delivered in the quarter. Much like our overall business their strongest month of the quarter was August. They had a good month in August. July and September were both slightly weaker than August. But again, we're very pleased with the way the team delivered, and what is clearly a slowing industrial environment, but as we have seen in this cyclical business in the past, Chris they've done the right things in terms of cost take out and fortunately we're deliver -- we're able to deliver nice operating margin improvement in the quarter.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. And then just having to be able to run through the numbers, but I guess you think about what's the sort of implied Motion comp for the fourth quarter.","Carol Yancey","Chris, that would be similar to what it was in Q3, so around a 1% comp. And one other just item to note we're really pleased to have our expansion in a different geography in the industrial business going into Q4 and beyond with Inenco and Australasia. They're not quite as susceptible to some of the things that we're seeing in North America. So as we look ahead, still strong reported total sales, but a similar comp for Q4.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. And then just lastly the -- similar discussion around the U.S. NAPA business. How did you see the monthly trends ex that -- the extra day noise? And then how -- what the implied in U.S. NAPA comp here for the fourth quarter?","Paul Donahue","So I'll take the first part of the question, Chris the cadence of the quarter again, very similar to what I described in Industrial. Good August, very good August for the team here in the U.S. September not a surprise. We are up against our strongest comp of the year in September. And then July, what I'd say about July, we got off to a better start in July, and I think I might have even a commented on it during the last call, we saw that slow in the second half of the month of July. But all-in-all, very similar to the cadence that we outlined for industrial. And as far as guidance looking forward I'll let Carol tackle that one.","Carol Yancey","Yes, sure, Chris. As we look as we just ended the nine months with U.S. automotive coming around 3%, we would expect to be similar in Q4 was around 2.5% to 3% comp.","Christopher Horvers","Perfect, thanks so much. Best of luck.","Paul Donahue","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gustavo Gonzalez","Hi, good morning. This is actually Gustavo Gonzalez on for Scot today. Thank you for taking our questions. Just on sort of the strategic M&A and in particular automotive and sort of industrial and acknowledging, there are a lot of sort of puts and takes market-by-market. Can you sort of update us on how the M&A environment or opportunity set out there, it looks like right now versus, say, two or three years ago and maybe even sort of directionally touch on what kind of multiples you're seeing in the market today versus prior years?","Paul Donahue","Sure, I'll touch on that, the -- from our vantage point, from an M&A standpoint we will embark upon our plastic strategy at GPC to always be on the lookout for strategic bolt-on acquisitions across our different business segments and geographies. A classic coupled for us this past quarter were the Todd acquisition in France, which bolsters are heavy duty footprint and positions us at number one in that market, the fluid power house acquisition for our motion business, which strengthens our fluid power business in Canada. So those are our classic approach to M&A and certainly we will continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions that our strategy is generally to look for 1% to 2% per year in bolt-on acquisitions.","In terms of the larger, more strategic acquisitions like AAG we're going to be more focused on integrating those more strategic acquisitions in 2020 and beyond. And then in terms of valuations the valuations that we look at in our bolt-on acquisitions that really has not changed in previous years those -- most of those type acquisitions, we know the players, they know us, we're not getting into a bidding more, and it's a very sane environment, if you would.","Gustavo Gonzalez","Got it, thank you.","Paul Donahue","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Matt McClintock","Hi. Yes, good morning everyone. I wanted to -- I wanted to know if you could focus on European automotive for a few minutes. I believe that you said that the French business returned to positive or slightly positive growth this quarter and I wanted to dig into that a little bit, what did you actually see in that business during the quarter that, that brought around that improvement that be the first question.","Paul Donahue","And thanks for the question, Matt. Look, what I would say, first and foremost is we were very pleased to see our European business rebound in Q3. As you know, Q2 was a challenge. So the team rebounded nicely, the French team, which is our single largest market in Europe had a solid quarter and delivering a positive sales increase after a significant decline in Q2. I think that the initiatives that they put into place will continue to drive here going forward. But the French team did a good job, where -- where we saw softness in the quarter was in the UK and again, we believe those issues that we face in the UK are largely transitory we were pleased to see that perhaps there may be a resolution to the Brexit issues and that will certainly help our business going forward if they are able to reach resolution.","Matt McClintock","And that has actually my follow up is the Brexit deal that apparently was reached today if that actually does go into place. Is that something that would remove an overhang immediately in your business? Or is that something that you would think would have to play out over a period of quarters before the overhang is removed. Thanks.","Paul Donahue","Yes, that's a good question, Matt, and I wish I could give you a specific answer. It's hard to say, but I will tell you that there has been is a bit of malaise in the marketplace, folks aren't sure with all the uncertainty around Brexit in the past number of quarters, I think it just weighed on business in general. So if they are to reach resolution if it makes its way through Parliament and they do reach resolution. I don't know that we'll see an immediate bounce back, but I do expect there to be a bounce back for sure. And I would also add Matt, that the initiatives that we're taking whether it happens or not. We're getting aggressive in introducing our NAPA brand into the UK, we launched a couple of product categories in Q3, and intend to accelerate that in Q4 going forward. So whether they reach resolution or not? Our team stands ready to improve that business.","Matt McClintock","I appreciate the color. Best of luck.","Paul Donahue","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Imbro","Yes, good morning and thanks for taking our questions. What is there on North America, automotive organic growth, saw a nice acceleration in the two-year stack basis. Can you just talk about how much you think your programs, like the store remodels, loyalty or NAPA AutoCare are driving that growth versus just an industry acceleration we've seen as weather improves.","Paul Donahue","Yes, Daniel. Thanks for the question, what I would tell you about our NAPA business in Q3, and it was a very similar trend as we saw in Q2 is our DIFM category, which is our largest segment by a large percentage, it performed very well in the quarter. I would point out our NAPA AutoCare business as a very bright spot in the quarter. Our team, the NAPA AutoCare team continues to do a terrific job, and we also saw a better lift in our major account business. So both did quite well. We've got opportunities on the retail side, we saw our retail business soften in Q2 that carried into Q3, we've anniversaried some of the new retail initiatives that we have been driving in the last few years, but we're confident our team will get that business back on track but DIFM is the real highlight for us in Q3 as it was in Q2.","Daniel Imbro","Thanks a lot, that's helpful. And then maybe, following up on the last question, I think you mentioned you're rolling up the NAPA brand across some product categories in Europe. Can you help us think about how much of your business in Europe today is private label. I mean, how does that compare to existing players, and then how has the consumer responded so far to the new brand?","Paul Donahue","Yes, it's probably a bit early Daniel to give you an update on how they've responded to the NAPA brand. I will tell you that our team was excited, we launched it at a major show in Q3, a lot of excitement, a lot of buzz. They know the NAPA brand in the U.K. What I would say overall about private brands in Europe, it varies by market. So, very little private label in Germany, a bit more in France and the U.K. would be the strongest market for private label, which is why we chose the UK to launch first, but make no mistake our intent will be to move into France, Germany and the Netherlands with the NAPA private brand.","Daniel Imbro","Got it, thanks so much. Best of luck.","Paul Donahue","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Kate McShane","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back and ask about the savings. Just in terms of timing, is there aren't going to be any impact to 2019, and then of the $100 million, you've identified, are you able to identify, how much could flow through versus how much needs to be reinvested given the rework changes you mentioned?","Carol Yancey","Yes, so I appreciate the question, and as we kind of look ahead at the $100 million and your comment specifically about 2019, what we're planning for is that we would have annualized $100 million by the end of 2020 and that would be a net number that would flow in, but it would be over a number of several quarters as it comes in and in doing the things that we're talking about and we're obviously still working on our plans and still looking at a number of initiatives in areas, we could have some costs in Q4 that come out of either head count related or facility related as we look ahead, those would be one-time type non-recurring that we could have in Q4, but again we're going into 2020 with the expectation that it's $100 million annualized by the end of the year. And then we obviously would be continuing to look for other opportunities as we move ahead, we're certainly not going to stop with just this initial look at the first $100 million.","Kate McShane","Okay, thank you. And then if we could just go back to the automotive industry and what you've seen now that tariffs, have been in place. Can you talk us through the impact on sales from inflation versus units and just what you think the impact was in the third quarter from tariffs specifically?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So as we, and again we commented that primarily we're talking about for Automotive and is the list one through three of the 25% tariff that went up on July 1, that was in Q3 about 1.9% on our sales for U.S. automotive. It was about 1% first half, so we would expect a similar amount for Q4. So we have kind of a blended 1.5% full-year basis for U.S. automotive. For the industrial business, it's really immaterial and for business products it was about 1% in Q3 and we would have a similar amount for Q4 they do have List 4b that comes in, as of now 12\/15, but there could be around 1% for them also in Q4.","And again, I guess I would just leave you with, our teams have done a tremendous job navigating through all the puts and takes as it relates to tariffs. And we have successfully become much more agile and nimble in moving prices and being able to pass those through and have seen no impact on our gross margins.","Kate McShane","Okay, thank you. And then my final question on automotive. You mentioned the timing of promotional events. Were certain promotional events brought forward or were they pushed into Q4?","Paul Donahue","They were pulled forward Kate and honestly, we think that we'll balance those out as we roll into Q4, we'd begin to hit some colder weather. And we think we're going to be fine going forward, I would also just comment Kate, you ask about the U.S. automotive business. So I think one thing that we would absolutely stress is the health of the overall aftermarket, when you look at miles driven, which we saw a nice jump in July, gas price is down considerably, year-over-year the average age, all the fundamentals continue to be really solid for automotive aftermarket and when I look at our performance in the quarter, it plays to our strength, which is DIFM and I think that plays very well for us going into Q4 in 2020.","Kate McShane","Okay, thank you.","Paul Donahue","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. I want to follow up a little bit on the tariffs and inflation. Carol in the past you guys have talked about general inflation in your COGS. Could you give us those numbers? Or highlight how much of the inflation that's occurring is related to tariffs as opposed to just some other inflation that might be out there.","Carol Yancey","Yes, happy to do that, Greg. What we saw the tariffs and inflation for U.S. automotive are virtually the same. So the inflation that they've had, be it on the COGS side or passing through on the sales side, more like a 1.5% to 2% is generally been inflation. Our industrial business is running around 2% for inflation and there is more indirect to tariffs you would talk about raw materials and supplier freight and things like that, and that's a normal level for them and then business products, they would probably running about 3% in total for inflation with about 1% tariff related.","Greg Melich","Got it. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, why is this quarter through the peak benefit to sales in terms of pass through? Is that just the timing of when the tariffs hit and when you flow it through. Is there something else we should be watching is to look at ebb and flow that -- is that number going forward.","Carol Yancey","No, I guess, if you recall, the original 10% tariff that we were under, that's how we operated through the first half of the year, so the pass-through on pricing was about 1% and again we didn't take that full 10% tariff, but what we did take about half of that we passed through and that led to about a 1% impact first half the tariffs went up July 1% to 25% and again we didn't take that full amount but we knew our second half would be more pronounced. So that's why we've said all along, second half would be around 2% first half was 1%.","Greg Melich","Got it. And then this is maybe a bigger picture question. The do-it-for-me was stronger, and you guys clearly went in there early and leaned into that, but DIY a little softer. Do you think there is -- is there any evidence that the consumer is having trouble with any of this inflation or may be deferring any decisions?","Paul Donahue","It's a great question, Greg and one that certainly we've contemplated as well because we have seen a bit of softening on the retail front. I think it's -- may be a bit early yet to make a call there. But what I will tell you is we are watching it very, very closely. One of the key stats that we obviously always monitor closely are the number of tickets flowing through our stores and then obviously the average basket size. ","Basket size, both retail and wholesale was very healthy this quarter. Our retail ticket were down more so than our wholesale ticket. But, so I would tell you we're monitoring it closely. We're monitoring our competitive stand in the marketplace, and we'll react if and when necessary. But I think it's maybe just a bit early yet to make that call.","Greg Melich","That's super helpful, thanks a lot. Good luck.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot, and good morning.","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Seth.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Seth Basham","Good to hear that you have some plans for further cost savings. As we think about the outlook for 2020 from those savings, would it be appropriate to think that you'll be able to drive SG&A leverage, assuming a normalized sales environment in line with your long-term guidance?","Carol Yancey","Yes. Look the $100 million is about a 50 basis point in operating margin improvement and we would expect to drive -- again, as you mentioned normal comparable sales growth, we would expect to drive SG&A improvement operating margin improvement.","Seth Basham","Great. And then, as it relates to gross margin in the quarter, you talked about supplier incentives providing some benefit. Can you give a little bit more color as to what segment that was in and the sustainability of those types of incentives.","Carol Yancey","Yes, so actually in all three of our segments we had gross margin improvement. The larger share of the gross margin improvement is coming from what I call, just the core gross margin and that is from favorable product mix to all the initiatives we've done in the area of pricing, so significant buy side and sell side initiatives that we're doing in all of our businesses has improved our gross margin. We have had -- because we have better growth, we have had positive supplier incentives and those are primarily been an automotive and office products. And then as we mentioned, we do have a little bit of an uplift in gross margin from PPG, PartsPoint and Inenco that carry a higher gross margin, but really the core is what's driving this which is just us delivering on our buy side and sell side initiatives and again doing it with a good bit of tariff impact and inflation.","Seth Basham","Got it. Can you just provide a little more color on the gross margin benefit and SG&A headwind associated with the PPG and Inenco?","Carol Yancey","Yes, happy to. So when you look at our gross margin as Paul mentioned, it was up 105 basis points if you exclude the purchase accounting adjustments we had, about a third of that was related to the two new acquisitions, so two-thirds of that was from our core business being up. And then on the SG&A side, when you look at our SG&A and if you take out again the one-time costs our SG&A was up around 120 basis points. We would tell you, it's similar 30 to 40 basis point impact for PPG and Inenco. So, our core business again should be improving a bit when you take out some of these things and it's important to kind of look at the operating margin side as well.","Seth Basham","Understood. Thank you very much.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Seth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jacob Moser","Hey guys, this is actually Jacob Moser on for Chris. Thanks for taking the question.","Paul Donahue","Okay.","Jacob Moser","So I'm just wondering of the $100 million of cost reductions. I think you guys said you still had some remaining from the $25 million synergy target from the AAG acquisition. So is this all incremental to that $25 million?","Carol Yancey","Yes, it is that $25 million, as it relates to AAG, which we are on track and that was all related to gross margin and global procurement, those $100 million is in the area of SG&A. So it is more payroll and facility and freight-related.","Jacob Moser","Okay, got you. And is it possible to quantify how much of that $25 million of synergies has come through at this point?","Carol Yancey","No, we have -- we said we would achieve that by the end of three years and we are on track to receive that. So -- I mean look, it's -- we would argue that we're on track, it's in our gross margin number, but it's the bulk of our improvement is coming from all the other stuff that we're doing.","Jacob Moser","Got you, okay. And then just, you said you paid down some debt in the quarter. So I think, now you're around three times debt-to-EBITDA versus maybe 1.5 historically like, have you changed how you're thinking about leverage and where do you see that shaking out?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So what we had in the quarter is we had some really nice improvement in our working capital and we were able to take that improvement in our working capital and use that to pay down some of our debt. The proceeds from the sale of EIS had in effect been redeployed on the two other acquisitions that we made earlier in the quarter. So when we look at where our debt was and it had ticked up a bit at the end of Q2 and obviously we're pleased with where it is now and expected to come down maybe just a little bit more by the end of the year. We're comfortable with where it was before and we're comfortable with where it is now, what we really look at is having flexibility and looking at what the right opportunities are. So again we're still comfortable with the amount of leverage we have today and we will certainly take it up for the right opportunity.","Jacob Moser","All right, great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Paul Donahue","Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Bret Jordan","Good morning guys. Carol, I -- if we think about the forecast on inflation, is it fair to think the '20 might have first half inflation similar to second half of '19 and the negligible in the second half, just as we lap those second list of tariffs?","Carol Yancey","I mean like again assuming tariffs kind of stay where they are and I think the year-over-year what you've laid out makes sense. We don't really see any other -- other inflationary things that would come in, but I would think that would be reasonable first half versus second half 2020.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then a question on private label in Europe, when you think about the margin profile of private label, what is the delta over there. And I guess to sell private label you need to price it more aggressively against the market that's used to branded. I mean how do you think you can pick up margin over there with a bigger private label program.","Paul Donahue","Well, maybe I would start, Bret, by just mentioning again the initial launches in the U.K., we've launched private label batteries, as well as some suspension products, they will be priced a bit more aggressively then where our core product categories are today, what we've seen in the U.K., Bret, and you've probably seen, I know you follow it pretty closely over there, is a little bit of a flight to value, given the challenges, they are having in their economy and that's why, certainly we think we've got a big opportunity with the NAPA private brand.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. And then one cleanup. Regional performance in the U.S. NAPA, any particular strengths or weakness?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Very similar Bret to Q2, which was our northern tier division. So that would include our Group in the Northeast which led the way again for us in Q3, the central part of the U.S., the Mountain Midwest all really performed well, Southwest did just fine. Where we saw a bit of softness was out west, which we also saw in Q2, and a little bit in the Atlantic. We think the Atlantic may have benefited a year ago from some one-time sales via the hurricanes coming through, so we are up against some bigger comps. So I wouldn't read too much into that. But the Northern part of the U.S. really, really performed well for us.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Paul Donahue","You're welcome. Thank you, Brett.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for any final comments.","Carol Yancey","We'd like to thank you for participating in our call today and we look forward to reporting out our year-end numbers. So thank you for your support of Genuine Parts Company.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference, you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"10112":["Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 19, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Carol B.

My name is Jodie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Carol Yancey, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.","Carol B. Yancey","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts First Quarter Conference Call, where we'll discuss our earnings results and the outlook for the remainder of 2012.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Carol, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time be with us this morning. As we customarily do, Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and I will each handle a portion of the call. And we're especially pleased to have Paul Donahue, our recently elected Genuine Parts Company President, with us as well. And once Paul, Jerry and I have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have. ","Now earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2012 results, and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,181,000,000, which was up 7%. Net income was $146.3 million, which was up 16%. And earnings per share were $0.93 this year, compared to $0.80 in the first quarter of 2011, and the EPS increase was also 16%. ","So we are pleased that the sales and earnings momentum that we saw throughout 2010 and 2011 continued on into the first quarter of this year. ","As a result, we feel that we're off to a good start to the year, and we look forward to another solid performance from the Genuine Parts team in 2012. ","A review of the results by business segment shows that our industrial operations continue to produce the largest increases. Motion Industries, our industrial distribution business, was up 12% in the quarter. This is on top of their 24% increase in the first quarter of last year, so it was a tough comparison. But they handled it well, and we continue to feel good about the progress being made by our Industrial operations. ","As we look at their numbers in a bit more detail, it shows that 11 of their top 12 product categories are running double-digit increases year-to-date. And as a group, these 12 categories are up 15% through the first 3 months. And Motion had strong results from their top 10 industry segments, as well. As a group, these top 10 segments are up 12% through March, and this is on top of a combined 30% increase in the first quarter of last year. ","The top 20 individual customers have a collective year-to-date increase of 14%, and additionally, the solid results are consistent across all geographic areas as well. ","So from a number of different viewpoints, the Industrial business remains strong currently, and with the industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to remain at healthy levels and with good execution of their internal growth initiatives, we're optimistic about our prospects in the Industrial segment over the next several quarters.","Moving onto the electrical\/electronic segment. EIS was up 5% in the quarter. This is down from the 10% increase that we reported in the fourth quarter and well off of the full-year 2011 increase of 24%, but it's important to note that our first quarter 2011 increase of 39% was our strongest quarter of the year by far. So it was a tough comparison. ","But with that said, there has been a moderation in demand for our Electrical\/Electronic business over the past 2 quarters. On the electrical side, this is primarily attributable to a slowdown in the Renewable Energy segment. And on the electronic side, it is largely due to a slowdown in the Contract Manufacturing segment. ","Our expectation is that these 2 segments of our business will lag the overall business through the first half of the year, but they will then start to show a gradual recovery over the remainder of the year. ","Importantly, the core segments of our Rlectrical business, such as Motor Repair and OEM manufacturing are, performing well as is the Wire and Cable business. ","Additionally, our top 25 customers combined for an 11% increase in the quarter, which is a solid performance in our opinion, and we're also pleased to see that our average daily sales showed good sequential improvement as the quarter progressed, which is encouraging, as is the fact that the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index continues to be well above 50 through March, which should indicate favorable overall end market conditions in the quarters ahead. And as a result, we continue to feel good about our prospects for reasonable growth in this business over the remainder of the year. ","Moving on to Office Products. It was another challenging quarter for S.P. Richards, and they ended the first 3 months of the year down 1.5%.   After generating positive results over the first 3 quarters of 2011, we saw a slowdown in demand across the industry during the fourth quarter of 2011, which is now carried over to the first quarter of this year. And looking at the results by customer segment, the Mega Channel actually turned in the strongest performance in the quarter of plus 1%, which was good to see, but this was offset by a 2% decrease with the independent office products resellers. ","On the Products side, cleaning and break-room supplies continue to grow at double-digit rates, while office supplies and furniture were down slightly, and technology products were down mid-single-digit. So clearly, conditions in the office products industry remain challenging, and the first quarter results fell a bit short of our expectations. However, while we don't anticipate any significant near-term improvement in the end market conditions, we do continue to feel that our Office Products team will end the year with a slight sales increase, with the second half performance being a bit stronger than the first half. ","So that's a quick recap of the non-automotive segments. And at this point, we'll ask Paul to comment on the automotive operations. Paul?","Paul D. Donahue","Thank you, Tom, and I would add my welcome to each of you and say that I'm pleased to join Tom and Jerry this morning to review the first quarter performance of our Automotive business. ","As you may know, this is our largest segment. We ended the first quarter up 6%. This follows a 6% increase in the fourth quarter and an 8% increase for the full year in 2011. So our Automotive operations continue to perform well. We'd like to point out that these results are essentially same-store sales increases, and this demonstrates the solid progress being made by our Automotive management team. ","Let's begin with the result of company-owned store group. We can tell you that our commercial business continues to outperform our retail business, although we did see a marked improvement in retail this quarter relative to the trend experienced in 2011. ","Turning to our retail business first. The quarter ended up 6%. This compares to a 1% increase in 2011, and we are encouraged by the strength we saw in our retail business in the first quarter.","On the commercial side, the quarter ended up 7%, which is fairly consistent with the 8% growth we reported in 2011. And we're encouraged by the strong and consistent growth in our commercial business. ","Our NAPA AutoCare and our major account business showed another quarter of double-digit sales growth, and this follows back-to-back years of double-digit increases in these 2 very important commercial initiatives. The steady progress in each of these businesses continues to drive our overall commercial sales growth. ","Our fleet business was up mid-single digits again, in the first quarter, which is consistent with the growth we saw in this channel all of last year. The underlying factors for the Automotive aftermarket remain positive. A bit of an unknown is the impact of fuel cost, and while fuel prices were up in the first quarter, we've seen the average cost of a gallon of gasoline nationwide has fallen the past 2 weeks. We've yet to see a significant impact either way, but it's a factor that we'll continue to monitor. ","So we continue to feel very positive about the progress being made by our Automotive management team, and we begin the second quarter of the year optimistic for continued growth. ","Lastly, we'd like to discuss our acquisition of Quaker City Motor Parts, which was announced back on February 28. Quaker City is a long-standing NAPA distributor and the last non-GPC NAPA member. They're headquartered in Middletown, Delaware, and service approximately 270 NAPA parts stores across the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. We expect to close on the acquisition May 1, 2012, and we're excited about the opportunity this acquisition will produce for the Automotive Parts group. Quaker City is an important strategic fit, and it offers an excellent growth opportunity in the mid-Atlantic area. They bring with them an experienced and talented management team, and we are pleased to bring onboard such a high-quality organization. ","So that completes our overview of the Automotive business in the first quarter. And at this time, I'll hand it over to Jerry for a review of the financial results. Jerry?","Jerry W. Nix","Thank you, Paul. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the income statement and segment information then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, and then we'll open the call up to your questions. ","A review of the income statement showed the following: Total sales in the first quarter were up 7% to $3.2 billion, and this follows a 7% sales increase in the fourth quarter of 2011. And this is the kind of steady and consistent growth we look for in our businesses, and we're excited about the opportunity to improve on this record again at 2012 and beyond. ","Gross profit improved by 8% in the first quarter and was 28.9% of sales, up from 28.5% in the first quarter of 2011. We've made good progress on improving our gross margin over the last few quarters, including the most recent quarter. ","We expect our ongoing initiatives to effectively manage supply chain costs, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize our pricing potential to continue -- to generate continued gross margin expansion over a year -- on a year-over-year basis for the next several quarters. Our management teams are committed to this effort. We currently project a 10- to 20-basis-point increase in gross margin for the full year. ","For the year, our cumulative pricing, which represents supply increases to us, was a negative 0.2% in Automotive, plus 0.3% in Industrial, plus 2.1% in Office Products and a negative 1.0% in Electrical. ","Turning to SG&A. Total expenses were $691 million in the first quarter and improved to 21.7% of sales versus 22.1% in 2011. We're pleased to show the continued improvement in controlling our expenses again this quarter as we made solid progress on this line in 2010 and 2011. We attribute the improvement to the combined benefits of greater leverage associated with our sales growth and ongoing measures to control costs. ","For the last few years, we've benefited from cost-saving initiatives in several areas, including warehouse and infrastructure, freight and utilities, among others. In addition, after a 12% workforce reduction in '08, '09 timeframe, we've only added back another 2% to 3% to our labor force, including acquisitions, over the last 2 years. Without the acquisitions, our headcount is actually down about 1% over the same time period, which we believe is a pretty good indication of the excellent job by our entire organization to effectively control costs. ","This also reflects the positive impact of our investments in technology over the last several years. These efforts have been meaningful to our overall results, and for the first quarter of 2012, the cost savings across all our expense categories was approximately $10 million. Effective cost management is an ongoing priority for us, and we will remain focused on these efforts throughout the year. ","Now let's discuss the results by segment. Automotive had revenue in the quarter of $1,493,500,000. That represents 47% of the total and is up 6%. They had operating profit of $114.6 million, that's up 17%, so a strong operating margin expansion from 7.0% to 7.7%. ","The Industrial group had revenue in the quarter of $1,121,200,000, representing 35% of the total and was up 12%. They had operating profit of $84.3 million, up 28%, so very nice margin expansion from 6.6% to 7.5%. ","Office Products had revenue in the quarter $426.2 million, representing 13% of the total, down 1.5%. Operating profit, $37.5 million; up 0.3%, so solid margin expansion considering the sales decreased from 8.6% to 8.8% of sales. ","The Electrical group had revenue in the quarter $147.1 million, represents 5% of the total and is up 5%. Operating profit of $12.0 million, up 19%, and so excellent margin expansion from 7.2% to 8.1%. ","Total operating profit increased by 17% in the first quarter, and operating profit margin improved 70 basis points to 7.8% from 7.1% in the first quarter of 2011. ","This is tremendous progress for us and we are especially encouraged that all 4 business segments contributed to the gain. We're optimistic that we can show continued year-over-year operating margin expansion in the quarters ahead and currently expect our overall improvement -- an overall improvement of approximately 20 to 30 basis points for the full year. ","We had net interest expense of $4.7 million in the first quarter, and this is down from 2011 due to lower interest rate on our new $250 million debt agreement that was signed in November 2011. We'll discuss our debt position later, but we currently expect our net interest expense to be approximately $20 million to $22 million for 2012. ","Other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and non-controlling interest, was $15.5 million expense in the first quarter, and that's up from $12.9 million in the first quarter last year. Increase primarily reflects higher expenses for benefits, legal and professional costs, as well as the increase in amortization relative to last year. We continue to project the total of the category to be in the $60 million to $70 million range for the full year, which is consistent with 2011. ","For the quarter, tax rate approximately 35.9%, compared to 34.1% for the first quarter of 2011. Primarily the increase in rate is related to a favorable adjustment recorded in the first quarter of last year associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations related to international taxes. Currently, we expect our full-year tax rate for 2012 to be approximately 36.5% to 37%. ","Net income for the quarter, $146.3 million, up 16%. EPS improved to $0.93, compared to $0.80 last year, and that's also up 16%. ","We're very proud of the hard work by all of our associates at Genuine Parts Company. They certainly deserve the credit for helping us achieve another quarter of strong earnings growth. ","Now let's touch on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at March 31 of $424 million remains strong, although it's down 9% from $466 million in March last year and down 19% from $525 million at December 31. Decrease in cash reflects a net impact of the increase in earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions but is offset by cash used for the 10% increase in the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases over the last 12 months. ","In the first quarter, we used more than $200 million in investing activities, primarily for the Exego investment in early January and the Light Fab  acquisition by EIS on February 1. ","Accounts receivable, $1.61 billion at March 31 increased 8% from March 31 last year, and that's slightly higher than our 7% sales increase for the first quarter. Our focus is on growing receivables at a rate less than revenue growth, and we'll continue to emphasize the improvement in this area over the balance of the year. I would point at that we remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables. ","Inventory at 3\/31, $2.26 billion, and that's flat with inventory December 31 last year and up just 1% from $2.24 billion at March 31, 2011. Our team is doing a very good job managing our inventory levels, and we remain focused on further improving our position as we move through 2012. ","Accounts payable balance at March 31, $1.56 billion. That's up 8% from December 31 and is up 14% from March 31 last year. Increase in trade payables reflects the impact of extended payment terms and other payables initiatives negotiated with our vendors. ","Improving our payables has been a priority for us over the last couple of years, and as a result, our date in payable has improved over this period. We remain pleased with the positive direction of this important account. ","Working capital, $2.67 billion at March 31, is up 7% from March 31 last year as reported but is down 3% after adding back the $250 million current portion of debt presented last year, which was converted and reclassified to long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2011. So we're encouraged with our ongoing progress in managing working capital, and our balance sheet is in excellent condition. ","Total debt at March 31, 2012 remains unchanged at $500 million. The first $250 million of debt is due in November 2013, and the debt for the new agreement signed in November of last year is due in November 2016. Total debt to total capitalization March 31 was 14.7%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. ","We generated solid cash flows again in 2011 and expect to improve on that in 2012. We currently expect to generate cash from operations of approximately $700 million to $750 million for the year and free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures and dividends should be approximately $300 million to $350 million. ","We're encouraged by the continuing strength of our cash flows, and we remain committed to our ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. ","Our first priority is the dividend, which we've paid every year since going public in 1948 and have raised 56 consecutive years. As you may recall, in our February board meeting, our directors approved a 10% increase in the company's annual dividend for 2012 to $1.98 per share from $1.80 per share paid in 2011. New dividend represents approximately 55% of our 2011 earnings per share and is our second consecutive year to raise the dividend by 10%. ","Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment in capital expenditures, $16.9 million for the first quarter, up from $14.5 million invested in the first quarter last year. We continue to expect our CapEx spending for the full year to outpace 2011 and be in the range of approximately $110 million to $125 million. The vast majority of these investments will continue to be weighted toward productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology. ","Appreciation, amortization, $23.0 million in the quarter, compared to $22.5 million last year, with the increase due to the growth in capital spending. We expect D&A to be approximately $90 million to $100 million in 2012. ","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of our cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. In addition to Automotive's investment in Exego and the Quaker City acquisition covered by Paul, we made a small acquisition in the Electrical business in the quarter and anticipate additional opportunities for acquisition over the balance of 2012. We remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy and continue to target those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in a $25 million to $125 million range. ","We repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock in 2011 under the company's stock repurchase program, with only minimal purchases thus far in 2012, and have approximately 13.5 million shares authorized and available for repurchase at the current time. We have no set pattern for these repurchases but expect to remain active in the program over the balance of 2012 as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders. ","In closing, we want to again thank all of our dedicated GPC associates for their hard work. They truly are the best. We're pleased with our first quarter performance and optimistic for continued progress in our results over the balance of 2012. We're encouraged by the many good things happening throughout our organization that will support our growth, and with a strong and healthy balance sheet and solid cash flows, we are well positioned to further maximize our return to shareholders. ","And that concludes our financial review, so I'll return it back to Tom.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Jerry and Paul. So that's a recap of our first quarter results, and we're pleased to start the year with a solid performance, and we feel that we are positioned to produce another good year in 2012. ","As far as the remainder of the year is concerned, we remain comfortable with the full-year revenue guidance that was provided on our February call. At that time, we said that we expected Automotive to be up 5% to 7%, Industrial and the Electrical\/Electronic to each be up 8% to 10%, and Office Products to be up 1% to 3%. ","Through the first quarter, Automotive is right in, line, Industrial is a bit above, and Office Products and Electrical are each a little bit below. However, we continue to feel that these are generally appropriate expectations at this time, and this would give us a full-year revenue increase of 6% to 8% for the entire company. ","On the earnings side, our prior guidance was for earnings per share to be $3.85 to $4. And at this point, we feel that it would be appropriate to raise this to a new range of $3.93 to $4.05, which would be up 10% to 13%. ","Additionally, assuming that we close on the Quaker City Motor Parts transaction on May 1 as planned, this would add approximately 1% to the full-year revenue and $0.04 to $0.05 to the earnings numbers. ","So that will conclude our planned comments this morning, and we would like to now address any questions that you may have. And we'll turn the call back over to Jodie.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Elizabeth Lane on for John. My first question is regarding the recent production disruption of CDT and Nylon 12. And I'm just wondering if a potential global shortage of fuel lines and brake lines and other auto parts that use Nylon 12 is likely to have any kind of material impact on your NAPA business?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, it will not impact our business in a material way. At this point, we don't see any supply disruption. That's not to say we won't experience some as we move through the next few months. But those 2 product categories are not large categories for us.","Elizabeth Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. And second, it looks like the Aftermarket Auto Parts business is doing pretty well, but we keep seeing continued weakness in the tire replacement market in the U.S. So what do you think is the disconnect there? And why are people buying certain replacement auto parts but not tires?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think it may have something to do with the financial situation of the consumer, and if they can defer any maintenance type items, they'll defer it. And on the things that we see, the outbound flow, it's largely nondiscretionary and we see the strength there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.","Patrick Palfrey - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Patrick Palfrey sitting in for Scott today. I guess, first off, could you talk a little bit about why gross margins were so strong, especially on the NAPA side of business. Industrial, I understand because it has more leverage, but NAPA hasn't proven to work that way, at least in recent times.","Jerry W. Nix","Patrick, this is Jerry. I'll take that. Actually, gross margins in the Automotive were not up for the quarter. The other 3 segments' gross margins were all up, and some of that -- the strong operating margin in the Automotive is strictly from the controlling of their SG&A-type expenses. Some of the contribution in the gross margin improvement in our Office Products -- they had a nice increase in gross margin, and they did some year-end buys. And you heard our numbers, they had some inflation in the first quarter, so that improved their gross margin. And we have specific initiatives in all the businesses and they just started to pay off in the first quarter. So we did see the 40-basis-point improvement in gross margin, but that was not a contributing factor to the strong operating margins in Automotive.","Patrick Palfrey - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, just another question, if I may. Within the Automotive business, could you talk about the cadence of the quarter and maybe how the mild weather and gas would have affected sales trends?","Thomas C. Gallagher","The quarter was relatively consistent. The weaker of the 3 months was February. The other 2 months were pretty consistent. And then as far as weather impact, we did see some impact on products like rotating electrical and some under-hood product, but the offset might have been the fact that we really had quite a nice quarter on the retail side. So the mild weather might have actually helped the retail business, in our opinion, anyway.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, if you think about the DIY and the commercial business, just to try to understand the relative size of DIY. To the extent that DIY picked up 5 percentage points or so from Q4 to Q1 and the aggregate sales increase was roughly unchanged, is it that small a piece of the business that it can't really move the needle or is it a rounding factor? Or is there a third issue that would have kept the number flat even though DIY got down as good as it did?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No. The DIY business, I think you probably will recall, is 20% to 25% of the total business and the remainder of the business is on the commercial side. Our commercial business performed well in the quarter. Additionally, we feel good about the progress that was made, especially as Paul said in our 2 key commercial businesses: Auto Care and major accounts, double-digit increases. So it's just the way the numbers came together.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then within the Automotive business, I'm interested what you saw. If you think about failure, and you think about maintenance and you think about discretionary, obviously discretionary numbers aren't going to be that big of a business for you in general. How did the trend look in the quarter and how did it concur to what might have seen in 2011?","Thomas C. Gallagher","The trend on what, Matt? I'm not sure I got the question.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess the mix among failure-related products, maintenance-related products, and then any discretionary that you might sell, where you saw the relative strength within the Automotive business.","Thomas C. Gallagher","I'll try to take it from the latter part back. The product categories that performed well for us in the quarter, quite well, were things like brake products, undercar products, showed good strength as the quarter progressed. And then as I mentioned, things like rotating electrical and some of the underhood categories were softer. But the things that performed pretty well for us were, in our opinion, non-discretionary-type items that are things that needed to be replaced for vehicle safety or performance.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then the final question. Your read on the Office product sector over the past several quarters has been spot on. That being said, it was very interesting that the Megas really showed that first signs of life for quite a while and the independents maybe more of a problem this quarter. If you think about what drove the Megas to the extent that you can discern, whether it's full forward on the manner of restocking, or whether there might be a more sustained recovery evident in your businesses?","Thomas C. Gallagher","We actually don't have a read on that, Matt. We're anxious to see the reports as they come out from the Megas and see how their contract segments all perform in the North American delivery segments. But you know they strengthened a bit, comparatively speaking, in the fourth quarter. They range from being down 1 flat to up 2, which was a stronger performance than what any other individual companies had experienced prior. So we think that maybe they're doing a pretty good job right now. They're comparing -- in our case, they're comparing against some subdued results in the prior quarter. So we don't know enough about it to know whether this is a trend or whether it's just the way it came together in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani from ISI Group.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was going to ask on the Automotive side just following up on weather, if I could for a moment. Historically, when you guys have seen perhaps bit more moderate temperatures in the winter, would you say that, that potentially could have a slowing effect as we get into the spring because there may not be as much breakage, or is that sort of premature to speculate on?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think it's a bit premature to try to draw any conclusions like that. The best thing that can happen for the Aftermarket is that when we get into this summer, we get some extreme heat, and that will create some additional demand in the Aftermarket.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess if I could follow up for a minute. On AP to inventory ratio, I mean, you guys continue to make progress there, now 66%, I guess, in total. Can you give us a feel for maybe where the Automotive side of the business might be and how you would compared to some of your competitors there, like Autozone. Is it 110%?","Jerry W. Nix","Mike, this is Jerry. We don't have that information to give you, but you're comparing apples and oranges there. We're a wholesaler with local distribution centers, and we continue to push up vendors for extended terms and we'll continue to do so, and some initiative we have there. But we are just going to continue to push it out, and we don't have a specific target. We don't know where it will take us. But every quarter, we try to do better. And I don't think it's reasonable for us to expect to take our terms out as far as some of the retailers have.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just the last question I had was on Quaker City. Is there anything you can share at this point in time as it relates to potential purchase price or multiples on that?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, not at this time. Maybe as we get further along, but not currently.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer from Gabelli and Company.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Just a question on Office Products here. You really had an outstanding performance from an operating profit perspective in the quarter. What levers are you pulling there to help keep that margin above that 8.5% level? And how sustainable do you think that, that is going forward in maybe a 1% to 2% GDP growth-type environment?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I'll try to take that one, Brian. I'll preface my comments by saying that from an operating point of view, we think the Office Products team has done a terrific job and not just in this quarter but in the past year or so. If we get any kind of top line growth in that business, they're going to do a heck of a job for us. Among the things that they've done a good job on would be managing their margins. They're showing good progress in that initiative. They've done a very good job on expense control in a number of different areas, and we think that, that will continue. And if we can get revenue growth even in the low single-digits with all the good work that's been done over there on all these other categories, I think that the margin will continue to show some improvement for us.","Jerry W. Nix","Brian, I'd also point out that the cyclicality of their business, the first quarter and the fourth quarter are strongest operating margin quarters. So if we get to the second quarter and they drift under 8%, that doesn't mean that they're not as good a job.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","No, I certainly -- we've got a long history of seasonality here. I understand. And just talking about share repurchases, very light in the first quarter. Anything driving that? Was it giving working capital build out, it just wasn't a priority?","Jerry W. Nix","Couple of things there, Brian. Certainly, we've been conservative with our balance sheet and our cash, knowing that we have the acquisition of Quaker City that we expect to close on May 1. And then we have another acquisition, a smaller one that we're looking at. We will continue to buy shares and our intent for the year is to buy at least enough shares to cover any options that we grant. And the board granted about 1.1 million, 1.2 million shares in options at their last meeting. And so we will still say it is fully our intent to buy at least that many shares in the year. And we do try to buy on pullback, and if we see that we'll be more active than we are at the current time.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Great. And just one number that I missed. The pricing for Auto within the quarter, was that up 1%? Did I hear that correctly?","Thomas C. Gallagher","That was down 20 basis point.","Jerry W. Nix","Negative. Negative.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] ","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Judy Merrick","This is Judy in for Keith. I just want to clarify on the Quaker City acquisition that you're going to close in May. You said that it's about 1% for the full-year revenue and 4% to 5% for earnings. Was that for the full year?","Jerry W. Nix","No, that's not 4% to 5%, that's $0.04 to $0.05.","Judy Merrick","For the full-year of earnings?","Jerry W. Nix","For the impact of the -- from May 1 to the end of the year.","Judy Merrick","Okay. That's from May 1, fine. Okay. And just to touch back on the Exego acquisition now that that's closed. Are you seeing similar trends there with your core North American market or is there any difference between their commercial and retail, or any areas you can improve there on that acquisition?","Thomas C. Gallagher","If we look at it from a revenue standpoint, of the Aftermarket in North America is a bit healthier heavier than the Aftermarket in that part of the world, but the folks there are doing a good job in view of what the circumstances look like. From an operating standpoint, they continue to do a nice job there as well, so they're performing in line with what our expectations were going into the transaction.","Judy Merrick","Okay. So you're still looking for maybe about $0.04 to $0.05 contribution from that for this year?","Thomas C. Gallagher","For this year, that's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mario Gabelli from Gabelli.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Unfortunately, I've been grazing on other calls. How much did you indicate you're paying for Quaker?","Jerry W. Nix","We have not given that information out, Mario, and because it hadn't been determined. There's still due diligence going on. We expect to close at May 1. And we'll have some numbers. They will be in the 10-Q that we file in the Subsequent Events section.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","All right. And the number that was given in terms of increased earnings, was that largely the range increase in part because of the initial inclusion of this acquisition or was it -- or does that exclude the increased number?","Jerry W. Nix","That excludes the Quaker City.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Okay. So that would be -- that Quaker stated incremental to the range that was given earlier?","Thomas C. Gallagher","That's right.","Jerry W. Nix","That's right.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","All right. And then just to hitchhike on the question of Auto Parts prices, and I'll talk to you, Paul, maybe off the line about the changes in discount structure that may or may not be going on, but what do you think the price increase for the basket of what you're selling would be like in the second quarter and for the full year?","Thomas C. Gallagher","We would think that for the full year, it's going to be positive, not negative, would be our expectation for the full year. And at this point because...","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","So, Tom, I'm a little confused. In other words, it was negative 0.2% in the first quarter. That will incrementally change and accelerate as you sell the constant mix, constant number of units, it's going to increase revenues?","Thomas C. Gallagher","As the year progresses, and I'd say at this point, Mario, well, we think it would be something between 1% and 2% for the full year.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","This is for Jerry. I mean, Jerry, you look at the tale of 2 cities. You read O'Reilly, you read Autozone, they're at 2.3x EBITDA in terms of leverage. Any comments?","Jerry W. Nix","We're not looking to match them in leverage. We're pleased with our balance sheet. But I would tell you we may have to incur some leverage with the acquisition of Quaker City.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Yes, I understand. That's for about 2 days. I got it. You're going to be at a billion-dollar run rate in EBITDA this year then?","Jerry W. Nix","I hope that's correct.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Well, come on. You've got Quaker State (sic) [Quaker City] coming in. How many stores? How many jobbing stores and how big is the D.C.?","Thomas C. Gallagher","They've got 271 stores that they service, and they've got 6 distribution centers in that mid-Atlantic corridor.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Tom, what percentage of the NAPA system brand do they -- stores -- that are still open other than Quaker? Or is that the last -- that's obviously the last big one?","Thomas C. Gallagher","That is it. This will complete the initiative, that's right.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Okay. So you started this, what, 30 years ago?","Thomas C. Gallagher","There abouts, if not longer.","Jerry W. Nix","We deliver and we're persistent.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","We've got the drill, Jerry, I just now want to figure out what you're going to do going from Australia to New Zealand to China.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Montani from ISI Group.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a quick follow-up for you. Was going to ask on the Automotive gross margins, Tom or Paul, if you can just elaborate a bit on why those gross margins were down in the quarter. That seems to be a little bit of change from what last year's then.","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, that's -- I don't believe that statement is accurate. Our Automotive margins, you may recall in prior calls, we said were under pressure. What we've seen is a steady progression, but still not back to the point of stability. And we would expect that we'll see some of that as the year progresses and they're just lagging the other 3 businesses in terms of the progression through this process.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just if I could, on Office Products, I mean, obviously the outlook seems more positive, or constructive, for the back half. Is that primarily due to product line extensions or is there certain initiatives, Tom, that you can share with us?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, it's a combination of things. There will be some product line extensions that we think will be beneficial. There's some specific sales initiatives that we prefer not to get into on the call, but some pretty impactful, we think, potentially impactful initiatives that will help us as the year progresses. And we are hoping for some stability in the marketplace. The data that we have would suggest that the Office Products industry still is experiencing modest contraction. So we're hoping to see that turn here in the next quarter or 2 but we're not counting on it necessarily. We're trying to do the things that we have direct control over, but we're not in a position to give out specific sales initiatives.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Jerry W. Nix","Jodie, thank you very much. We appreciate your joining us on the call today and we appreciate your continued interest and support of Genuine Parts Company. We look forward to talking to you in our second quarter conference call, if not sooner. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Sid Jones, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Sid Jones","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts' first quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses. The Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the Company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We\u2019ll begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Sid. And I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer are both on the call as well, and each of us has a few prepared remarks and once completed, we\u2019ll look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have.","Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2015 results and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3.736 billion, which was up 3%, net income was $161 million, which was up 2%, and earnings per share were $1.05 this year compared to $1.02 in the first quarter last year, and the EPS increase was 3%. And although these sales and earnings growth rates have moderated from the results in recent quarters, they are pretty much in line with what we anticipated for the quarter and as such we feel that we came through the quarter in pretty good shape.","We knew at the beginning of the quarter that we were facing tough comparisons with first quarter 2014 revenues up 13% and earnings per share up 10%. Additionally, we felt that the strength of the U.S. dollar would be a significant headwind for us and as it turned out, this cost us 2% on the revenue line in the quarter and $0.02 in earnings per share. And then weather had a bit of a negative impact as that did a deceleration in the oil and gas segment of the economy. So all in, we feel that our teams did a pretty good job in navigating their way through the quarter and we remain optimistic about the remainder of the year.","Turning to the sales results by segment, I\u2019ll make few comments on each of the three non-automotive businesses and then Paul will give you an update on the automotive operations. Starting with Office Products, S.P. Richards turned in another strong quarter at plus 17%. Acquisitions completed in 2014 certainly helped as did the enhanced first call relationship with one of the mega companies.","But importantly, the underlying business performed well also with solid growth in both the mega and independent reseller channels. The e-commerce an alternate channel customers performed well in the quarter as well. From a product category perspective, all four categories, technology, facility and breakroom, furniture and core office products each showed nice growth in the quarter and we are pleased with the balance and the composition of our office products growth, both from a customer and a product category perspective. And we feel that the office products team has positioned to turn in the solid performance over the remainder of the year.","Moving on the Industrial segment, Motion industries ended the quarter up 3%. 11 of our top 12 product categories generated positive results in the quarter and nine of our top 12 customer groups grew nicely in the quarter. Our strongest results came from customers in automotive, coal aggregate and cements, lumber and wood products and rubber and plastic products. And this follows a relative strength of each of these segments in the overall economy.","We had weaker results in oil and gas, pulp and paper, and steel again mirroring, what we see happening in the overall economy. As we look ahead, we\u2019re mindful of the deceleration that we have seen in the industrial production; capacity utilization and Purchasing Managers Index over the course of the first quarter and each of these have been reliable leading demand indicators for our industrial business, so we\u2019re watching them closely, but despite the modest deceleration, it\u2019s important to note that each remain at historically healthy levels. And at this point, our industrial team remains optimistic about the reminder of the year. Perhaps partly driven by the fact that our pending project work is up substantially over the same period last year, which is encouraging.","Moving on to the third of our non-automotive businesses, EIS was up 1% in the quarter. Some of the same factors that impacted our industrial business were headwinds for the electrical segment as well. Things like the deceleration in the oil and gas customer segment, the strength of the dollar impact on export related customers, lower defense spending this year versus last, and the lower copper pricing again this year.","To one degree or another each of these will continue to be factors in the quarters ahead. However, we were encouraged to close out the first quarter with a solid performance in March. And then our team feels that they\u2019re starting to build a bit of momentum as we enter Q2. Additionally, they completed the acquisition of Connect-Air into the wire and cable segment as of April 1st and this will add about $28 million to their annual revenue.","So that\u2019s a quick overview of the non-automotive business. I\u2019ll now ask Paul to comment on the automotive segments. Paul?","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone and let me add my welcome to our first quarter conference call. I\u2019m pleased to join here today and have an opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our automotive business. For the quarter ending March 31st, our global automotive business sales were flat year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 3% core automotive growth. The benefit of just less than 1% from recent acquisitions, which are offsets by approximately 4% of currency adjustments.","The currency adjustment was in line with our expectations for the quarter. When reviewing our quarterly performance, we knew going into the quarter, we were up again strong comps from one year ago and part driven by the extreme cold winter weather. Unfortunately, Mother Nature did not cooperate this past winter. We saw a little benefit as a result of the winter temps and in fact a heavy snow and ice experienced in places like Boston and a good portion of the Northeast create challenges for our operations and our customers.","In addition, like many businesses, we felt the impact of the West Coast port slowdown and the effect that had on our overall supply chain. During the first quarter, we saw our U.S. team posted 3% sales increase, while our international businesses including Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand grew mid single-digits in their local currencies.","Overall, we\u2019re pleased to see steady growth in all of our markets and expect to see steady growth for the balance of 2015. In the U.S., all regions within country are positive contributing to our revenue growth with the exception for the \u2013 few of the more energy dependent areas of the country. As we saw in the fourth quarter, we experienced continued strength in the Atlantic division, Midwest, and western divisions. In addition, our southern division had a solid first quarter.","So now let\u2019s turn to our same-store sales numbers. Our U.S. company owned store group grew comp same store sales in the first quarter by 3%. This 3% is on top of an 8% increase generated in the strong first quarter of 2014, which gives up a two year stack of 11%. This performance was not unexpected due to the tough comps we were up against, but we would also like to point out that we expect this number to improve as the year progresses.","A 3% sales increase in first quarter was driven by a combination of solid sales on both our commercial wholesale side of the business and on our retail side of the business. So let\u2019s start with our retail business. As mentioned in previous calls, we have put a renewed focus on this segment of our business. We\u2019re pleased to report, these initiatives are continuing to pay dividends. Our team did a good job in the quarter driving a 6% increase on our retail business, which was on top of a 9% increase one year ago.","Retail basic such as extended store hours, proper staffing, dedicated retail associates, planogram compliance and increased training have all had a hand on our recent improved performance. We continue to push for increases with both the size of our average ticket and the number of tickets flowing through our stores. In the first quarter, we experienced an increase in our average retail ticket and an increase in the number of retail tickets.","This performance was consistent with our fourth quarter metrics, so it\u2019s encouraging to see our average ticket in whole. We would like to complement both our retail team at headquarters as well as all of our associates on our stores for stepping up and embracing our retail initiatives. We still have a great deal of heavy lifting yet to do, but it\u2019s clear, we\u2019re on the right track and the opportunity for growth is there.","So now, let\u2019s turn to our commercial wholesale business or our Do It For Me segment. This segment turned in a 3% increase in the first quarter. Highlights for the quarter include solid performances by our two major wholesale initiatives, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts. Starting with our Major Account business this strategic segment delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of low double-digit growth, a terrific accomplishment by our entire Major Accounts team. And our NAPA AutoCare centers, now totaling over 15,500 nationwide, posted strong single-digit sales increases in the quarter.","We\u2019d also like to report on our fleet business, after reporting a solid increase in this important segment in 2014, we posted a mid single-digit increase in the first quarter of 2015. So we\u2019re pleased to see the continued growth in this important segment of our business. We can also report solid trends in our average wholesale ticket value, which registered positive growth in the month with no inflation support. We also saw positive year-over-year growth in the average number of tickets flowing through our stores.","Now let\u2019s take a look at few of our key product categories and review some of the trends we experienced in the first quarter. We are pleased to report continued growth in both our Bright business, as well as our tool and equipment business. In addition, our NAPA Import Parts business was up low double-digits once again this quarter. One additional product category worth noting is our all important Electrical business, including our rotating and electrical product lines and our battery business.","Despite double-digit growth in the month of March, we were up just over 1% for the quarter. It\u2019s a clear illustration of the strong prior year comps that we faced in the January and February timeframe. It is worth noting that we experienced supply chain interruptions with one of our key under car lines in the first quarter that has now carried over into the second quarter. This interruption had an impact on our operations in our customers\u2019 business in the quarter. We are diligently working toward a solution anticipate improvement in the weeks ahead.","Despite the slower start to the year, we continued to be encouraged by the automotive aftermarket fundamentals. The average age of the fleet remains at excess of 11 years, the size of the fleet continues to grow and not surprising, the all-important miles driven metric recorded its largest growth in the past five years. As we reported last quarter miles driven up 1.4% through 11 months in 2014. Then in the month of December, miles driven increased by 5%, and most recent figures were January show 4.9% gain. This growth is a direct result of the lowest fuel prices in almost a decade and both well for future demand.","So in summary, our first quarter was pretty much in line with where we felt we would end up. Foreign currency as expected was the significant headwind and we expect this to continue for several more quarters. That said, our business in our international markets continues to perform well in their respective local currencies. And as expected, we experience some softness in areas of the U.S. that are more energy dependent.","And lastly, we knew going into the new year that we would be up against strong comps in the first quarter and we would need to weather the storm. We feel we did just that. We are encouraged with our same store sales and we remain optimistic with the outlook for the balance of the year.","So in closing, we want to thank our management teams in North America, as well as our team on the ground in Australasia for a solid first quarter for the GPC automotive business.","So that completes our overview of the GPC automotive business and at this time I\u2019ll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you Paul and good morning. We\u2019ll begin this morning with a review of our income statement and the segment information and then we\u2019ll review some balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back up to wrap it up and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","As Tom mentioned our total revenues at $3.7 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 3.1% consisted of our underlying sales growth of 3.8% and a 1.5% increase from acquisitions. These items were offset by a strong currency headwind at 2.2%. Our gross profit for the first quarter was 29.8% and this compares to 29.9% growth margin last year. This was in line with our expectations for a relatively constant gross margin in 2015, as the margin initiatives across all of our businesses are intended to offset the ongoing customer and product mix shifts that continue to pressure our gross margins.","With that said, there\u2019s slight decline in our first quarter gross margin directly related to the customer mix shift that we are facing in our Office Product segments. Looking ahead, we continue to expect a relatively constant gross margin in 2015 that this area has our full attention and we\u2019re committed to making progress towards an enhanced gross margin for the long-term. Our gross margin initiatives are also critical in offsetting the low inflationary environment that has persisted across all of our businesses for several years now especially in automotive. Our supplier pricing thus far in 2015 indicates that we should expect more of the same lack of deflation again this year. Our cumulative supplier price increases through March were down four tenths of 1% in Automotive, up four tenths of 1% in Industrial, up six tenths of 1% in Office Products and up two tenths of 1% in Electrical.","Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses were $861 million in the first quarter, which is up 2.5% from 2014. This represents 23.1% of sales which has slightly improved from the 23.2% last year and encouraging giving the underlying sales growth of approximately 4% for the quarter. We attribute this progress to the benefits of our ongoing emphasis on effective cost management and we expect this is our continued progress on our SG&A line in the periods ahead.","Now we\u2019ll review our results by segments. Our Automotive revenue for the first quarter was $1.9 billion, which was flat with the prior year and 51% of total sales. Our operating profit of $151 million is up four tenths of 1%, so their margin held constant with 2014 at 7.9%. This is in line that what we would expect on a 3% compared to sales increase. Our Industrial sales were $1.18 billion in the first quarter, which is up 3.4% for 2014 and 31% of our total revenues.","Our operating profit of $88 million is up 6% and our operating margin increased 10 basis point to 7.4%. We\u2019re pleased to, excuse me, to see the expanded margin given at 3% sales increase and we would add that this was driven by slightly improved gross margin for the quarter, as well as an improvement in their SG&A.","Our Office Products revenues were $490.3 million in the quarter, up a strong 17%, and represents 13% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $36.5 million is up 8%, so their margin was down 70 basis points to 7.4% as the customer mix shift pressuring our gross margins continues to impact the net margin for this business. Electrical\/Electronic Group have sales in the first quarter of a $182 million 1% increase and 5% of our total revenue. Our operating profit at $15.5 million is down four tenths of 1%, so the margin was down 10 basis points that remain strong at 8.5%.","So in total, our operating profit increased 3% in the first quarter, which is in line with our sales growth. Our operating profit margin held constant with last year at 7.8% and this follows the 30 basis point expansion in our operating margin for the full year in 2014, and we remain focused on our initiatives to show further expansion in the periods ahead.","We had net interest expense of $5.3 million in the first quarter, which is down from $6.2 million last year. We continue to expect net interest expense of approximately $22 million to $24 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense was $8.6 million for the first quarter, which is fairly consistent with last year. We currently estimate $40 million to $42 million in total amortization expense for the full year. The other line which reflects our corporate expense was $25 million expense for the first quarter, which is up slightly from the $23.6 million in the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect corporate expense to be in the $85 million to $95 million range for the full year.","Our tax rate was approximately 36% for the first quarter, which is up slightly from the 35.5% last year. For the full year we now expect our tax rates trend in the 36.7% to 37.0% range. Our net income for the quarter of $161 million compared to the $157.5 million or 2% improvement and as Tom mentioned our EPS was $1.05 compared to last year\u2019s $1.02.","Now we\u2019ll discuss a few key balance sheet items. Our cash at March 31 was $166 million, an increase from approximate $103 million at March of last year. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives in each of our businesses and we remain comfortable with our cash position.","Our accounts receivable of $2.0 billion at March 31 increased 8% from the prior year on a 4% core sales increase for the first quarter. We remain focused on our goal of growing receivables at a rate less than revenue growth and we\u2019ll be working hard to achieve this objective in the periods ahead. We continue to be satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.","Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.0 billion which is up approximately 1% from March of 2014 and actually down 1% from year end. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we\u2019ll remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels in the periods ahead.","Our accounts payable balance at March 31 is $2.6 billion, up 12% from the prior year, due to the positive impact of improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We shall continue the improvement in this area for several periods now and we are encouraged by positive impact on our working capital and our days and payables.","Our working capital of $1.9 billion is down 3% from last year and effectively managing our working capital and in particular our accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company. Our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in solid improvement in our working capital position and cash flow for the last several years and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at March 31 of 2015.","Our total debt of $894 million at March 31 is basically unchanged from the prior year and this represents approximately 22% of our total capitalization. Our total debt includes two $250 million term notes, as well as another $394 million in borrowings under our multi-currency syndicated credit facility agreement. We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time.","We continue to generate solid cash flows and we\u2019re well positioned for the balance of 2015. For the full year we expect cash from operations to be in the $800 million to $850 million range and free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $350 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority for cash is the dividend which we paid every year since going public in 1948, and have now raised for 59 consecutive years, a record that continues to distinguish genuine parts from other companies. The 2015 annual dividend of $2.46 per share represents a 7% increase from the $2.30 per share paid in 2014 and it\u2019s approximately 53% of our 2014 earnings per share, which is well within our goal of a payout of 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our core businesses, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.","Our investment in capital expenditures was $16 million for the first quarter, which is down slightly from $18 million in the first quarter of 2014. We expect our expenditures to increase as the year progress and we continue to look for CapEx spending to be in the range of $125 million to $145 million for the full year. As usual, the vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology.","Our depreciation and amortization was $36 million in the first quarter and looking ahead, we are projecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $155 million to $165 million for the full year in 2015.","Our strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and an important use of our cash for us and they\u2019re integral to the growth plans for our company. As reported on our year end call in February, we made a few small acquisitions in the Industrial and Office business early in the first quarter and these are performing well for us.","Effective April 1, we close on two additional acquisitions, one for Automotive and one for Electrical, and we expect these two operations to contribute annual revenues of $35 million or approximately $25 million in 2015. We will continue to seek new acquisitions across our business segments to further enhance our prospect for future growth generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally, during the quarter we used our cash to repurchase approximately 870,000 shares of our common stock under the Company\u2019s share repurchase program. Today, we have 8.7 million shares authorized and available for purchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","So that concludes our financial update on the first quarter of 2015, overall solid results and in line with our expectations that we\u2019re pleased with the first three months of the year and encouraged by the opportunities before us. We look forward to updating you on our future progress when we report again in July. And in closing I\u2019d like to thank all of our GPC associates for the outstanding job that they do each day.","That concludes our financial review and now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Tom.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Carol, and thanks to you and Paul for your comprehensive updates.","So that will conclude our prepared comments on the quarter, and as mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter pretty much inline with what we thought we would be. With that in mind we would like to reaffirm our full year guidance that we provided back in February and just as a reminder at that time we guided for Automotive revenues to be up 2% to 3%, which includes an estimated 4% negative impact from currency exchange.","We guided Office Products to up 6% to 7%, Industrial and Electrical to each be up 5% to 6%. And based up on the current trends and the external indices, as well as softness in the energy and export sectors, our current bias will be towards the bottom end of the range for both Industrial and Electrical.","Putting all of this together would give us an overall GPC sales increase of 3% to 4%, which includes 2.5% to 3% negative currency impact. On the earning side our guidance remains for EPS to come in between $4.77 and $4.80. And as a reminder this includes approximately $0.15 per share impact from unfavorable exchange rates and the related increase in our overall tax rate.","So that would conclude our remarks at this point and we\u2019ll turn the call back to Jackie to take your questions. Jackie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Good morning.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning, Seth.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Seth Basham","My question is on the Auto business, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of your view of the slowdown in the comp sequentially from the last quarter given the miles driven strength. Do you think its industry wide phenomena or do you think it\u2019s only a supply chains issues are the primary factor hurting you this quarter?","Tom Gallagher","So, Seth, I\u2019ve taken and may be in a couple of buckets. Certainly we are up against some really tough comps, we knew that going in. First quarter was our strongest of the year, last year. So I\u2019d certainly say that had an impact. Two, I\u2019d say, some of the key product line disruptions that we experienced along with the West Coast port issues cost us in the first quarter. And I don\u2019t think that will be strictly relegated to GPC and NAPA, I think, that will be felt by others, as well.","The energy sector had an impact for sure, Seth. Some of the \u2013 certainly Texas which is what everybody thinks about when they think about the energy sector, but parts of the Mountain Division for us, as well as some parts of Canada, certainly Alberta, Canada were impacted, as well.","And then last but not least, the one that we always chat about and that\u2019s the weather, the weather was of no help at all to us, we don\u2019t think in the first quarter.","Seth Basham","That\u2019s helpful. So do you quantify those three buckets in a Asia perform [ph]?","Tom Gallagher","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to do that at this point of time, Seth.","Seth Basham","All right, no problem. Thank you very much.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","Hi thanks. I want a follow-up a little bit about the Auto trends and tie it through to margins and working capital. Given that retail is driving a lot of growth, I would sort of expect gross margin that maybe be better given that there\u2019s basically the deflation in the buy. Could you help us understand why margins are not expanding in Auto? And then the tide in the working capital, there were this increase in payables. Should we assume that this is a good run rate is there a steady point of an AP ratio that you target Carol? ","Carol Yancey","Yeah, I guess I\u2019ll start with the margin first. So we mentioned that decline in gross margin on a consolidated basis was solely related to the Office Products decline that you saw in the operating margin. So that would lead you to assume and while we don\u2019t disclose it separately is that the non-office businesses were either flat to up slightly. So we actually were pleased with the automotive gross margins this quarter and the progress we\u2019ve made. So, I would say that a lot of our initiatives and some of the impact that we talked about earlier with transactional FX headwinds that we had in Q4.","Our teams did a lot of hard work in that area. We continue to have the usual customer product mix, but I think a lot of our initiatives are helping us to show that improvement. But honestly, where we \u2013 when we only have a 3% sales increase, it\u2019s hard for us to get that operating margin up 10 or 20 basis points. So, we would still look for that on balance for the rest of the year. But I think we were pleased to keep the margins flat in automotive in light of what the comp sales increase was.","And then the second question on the working capital, we were pleased with the progress that we made. And I think when we\u2019re looking at the rest of the year; we would say that there would be improvement. We\u2019ve reiterated our guidance on the working capital and the cash flow, but I think we saw some better results coming through on the first quarter. So, if we can continue to do the job with payables and inventory, I think you\u2019ll see a continued improvement.","Greg Melich","And then on the receivables, is there any particular thing driving the growth with a certain category or new terms of certain customers?","Carol Yancey","Really, that\u2019s been specific. I think again as we look towards what we\u2019re seeing in receivables, we just try to make sure that again if its customers are certain programs that we\u2019re getting the corresponding offset on the payable side with our vendors.","Tom Gallagher","And Greg I would\u2026","Greg Melich","And then last one if I could and then I\u2019ll let someone else. Yes\u2026","Tom Gallagher","Greg, I would just add to that. I think we would expect that the receivables will improve sequentially and be more in line with the overall revenue growth as we get towards the second half of the year.","Greg Melich","And then, Tom, you mentioned if there\u2019s one area where you think it\u2019s on the lower end and it\u2019s Industrial and Electrical. Could you point us to why specifically that is other than just may be energy a little bit, is there industrial production or other things that you think look a little softer? Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","Yes in fact we do think oil and gas will continue to be a headwind. And that\u2019s got a fairly long tail, it\u2019s not just the number of rigs that are running. When you think about that it also extends into steel, for instance, I\u2019ll referenced steel in my comments earlier, none of those pipes are being purchased to go down in the wells and extends into some of the other customer segments additionally. So that would be one thing.","And then with industrial production and capacity utilization and the Purchasing Managers Index, we did see some moderation. As the quarter progressed, we were pleased to see a slight uptick in the March industrial production from the revised February industrial production, but we just want to be a bit cautious. And as I mentioned in my comments, we do track to the best of our ability what we would refer to as project work. And we are a bit encouraged by the fact that both the number of projects in-house and the dollar amount are showing nice increases and hopefully they worked their way through the income statement in the months ahead.","Greg Melich","Great, thanks a lot.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, this is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram Rubinson.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning.","Carol Yancey","Hi, Chris.","Q \u2013 Chris Bottiglieri","Good morning. I just had a quick question on the Automotive business, can you give us a update on the independence if you\u2019re seeing any kind of pick up in [indiscernible] switching on the NAPA brand, or if you\u2019re just seeing any increased number of conversations being held?","Paul Donahue","Yes, Chris, this is Paul. For sure the \u2013 what we\u2019ve got a good deal of activity that\u2019s continuing on that our team has involved in and the field that. And honestly, we\u2019re quite pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve seen both really in the second half of last year as well as in the first quarter of this year. And I would tell you that we don\u2019t see that activity slowing down at all. As a matter of fact, we\u2019re optimistic with what we see ahead of us in 2015.","Q \u2013 Chris Bottiglieri","Got it, thanks. And one longer term question I have. You see this is like an overall sense on your kind of long-term view of the independent business as some of these businesses owners are getting retired. Are you seeing them kind of pass down their businesses within the family to selling to other independent? Or do you think like [indiscernible] this could become a pipeline for GPC Company on service down the road?","Tom Gallagher","I will try to answer that, Chris this is Tom. I think it\u2019s a combination of all of the things you referenced. The way we work with our independent owners is that we try to stay very close to them not just operationally, but also with their succession planning. And if they don\u2019t have someone in mind to pass the business down to another family member perhaps or good long-term employee then, we\u2019ll work with them to identify another independent that might have an interest in buying their business and we\u2019d have several different programs available to help facilitate that.","And then if in fact we don\u2019t come up with someone that should have opt to buy the business, we\u2019ll certainly step in and buy it, and in many cases we\u2019ll run it for a period of time, until we find a good locally based independent to run the business from that point on.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay, very helpful. Thanks for your time.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Okay, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Becks with JP Morgan.","Mark Becks","Hi, can you talk about the cadence in Automotive over the quarter and perhaps in the April if you\u2019re willing to address, I know March was \u2013 last year was strong. But just interested in the trend, trying to get a better understanding of why you\u2019re expecting that business to accelerate from here?","Paul Donahue","All right, yes, Mark, this is Paul. I would tell you that throughout the first quarter it was pretty consistent, from January, to February to March, but we did see a little bit of a lift in the final two weeks of March for sure, which really that along with the extra selling day that we had in the month of March, gave us a record sales month. So I'm not prepared to talk about April, but we would hope to see that performance move into Q2.","Mark Becks","And then as a quick follow-up to that, can you talk about the trend in North East business, and did that experience a similar rebound to the overall business, or is that still tracking pretty softly?","Tom Gallagher","I think most of our regions showed some pick up in the second half of March as Paul referenced. And also as he referenced, we continue to see headwinds in the energy related areas. But much of what we experienced in the first quarter was transitory. If you think about the comps, the comps get a little bit easier, they were strong all year along, but they get little bit easier as we work our way through the year.","Certainly the impact of the weather will moderate as we work our way through the year and the impact, just for clarification, the impact issue is that we did not have the extreme temperatures over the period of time that we had in the early part of Q1 last year. What we did have is there is a lot of ice and a lot of snow that had a negative impact on all of our businesses frankly because we had a number of closures, both our own facilities, as well as customers\u2019 facilities.","So we\u2019re through that at this point and some of the supply chain disruption that Paul referenced will moderate as we work our way over the next couple of months. So you know, we gave you the number for the quarter we also gave you the guidance for the year, and the guidance for the year suggest that we expect our Automotive business to pick up in the remaining three quarters of the year.","Mark Becks","Yes, so just to be clear it seems like the port shutdown and the supplier issues, while still not completely gone there at the margin improving?","Tom Gallagher","They are improving somewhat, that\u2019s right.","Mark Becks","Okay, and then just last housekeeping, can you remind us what the Texas exposure in NAPA, and then the overall any MI exposure to oil and gases?","Tom Gallagher","Yes, we don\u2019t give that out, but we have said in the past that the direct exposure for Motion industries is low single-digit, but the hard number to really get to is the indirect exposure. And what I mean by that, I referenced earlier that certainly the rig operators, our business with them is down, but then if you went to the steel side of things, all of the demand for new piping to go down hole that\u2019s gone.","Some of the pumps and motor demand that would be the anomaly that\u2019s diminished and then what we don\u2019t and can\u2019t quantify is that when you have the massive number of layoffs specific to that segment, you have all of those workers that are for the most part moving in other areas, but that takes the demand out of the areas that they were in and it doesn\u2019t get replaced one-for-one into the areas that they move to, so you see the ripple effect of that. And we see that back up on other manufacturing customers. So it\u2019s hard to get a true number, but the direct absolute impact we know is in the low single-digit. And then it ripples beyond that.","Mark Becks","Okay, thanks for those comments and good luck.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you very much.","Carol Yancey","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.","Chandni Luthra","Hi, this is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Very quickly guys, could you contextualize if there was any impact from shift of Easter?","Paul Donahue","Well certainly, we\u2019ll see that impact in April, but not really much in Q1.","Chandni Luthra","Got it. And the 3% growth that you talked about on comps that\u2019s inclusive of the extra selling day in the month of March, right?","Paul Donahue","Yes, it is.","Chandni Luthra","Perfect. And then lastly, could you throw some color on you DIY initiatives that kind of helped your margins to hold their own? Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","I think Paul might reiterate the comments he made earlier about some of the things we\u2019re doing.","Paul Donahue","Yes, thanks for the question. Basically, some of the things that we\u2019re doing on the retail side, really it\u2019s not right at the time we\u2019re focused on the basics and the basics as I mentioned in my opening comments, simply are to ensure our stores are well stocked, ensure our planograms are up to-date, ensure our people are well trained on the floor and ensure our stores are open when customers want to shop them. And so it\u2019s many of those basics that we have reinforced with our team and our company-owned stores and we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re seeing, we saw it throughout last year and we continue to see in the first quarter of 2015.","Tom Gallagher","And also I want to go back on the question about did the comps include the extra day in March, yes they did, but in the quarter, we had the same number of dates for the quarter, we were short one day earlier in the quarter and we picked it up in the month of March. So the comps are comparable.","Chandni Luthra","Got it, thank you.","Paul Donahue","Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we have one more caller on the line, your final question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Market.","Bret Jordan","Hi, good morning.","Carol Yancey","Good morning, Bret.","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan","Hi, Carol if we looked that accounts payable to inventory for the Auto segment alone, where would that number be?","Carol Yancey","Good question Bret. I would \u2013 we don\u2019t give it out by segment I would tell you that as you know it\u2019s more prevalent in automotive industry with the extended terms programs with the supplier. So a lot of our improvement is coming by way the Automotive Segment, but I would tell you also that all of the segments have programs going on and we visited with our teams and each one is them be it Office, be it Industrial, all have programs going on with their suppliers. So we looked at our AP to inventory and it\u2019s 87% at the end of the quarter, it was 84% at the end of the year and 79% a year-ago, and I would tell you again that we don\u2019t give it out by Automotive, but they\u2019ll certainly be higher than that.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then the question for Paul, I guess as you look at the quarter and it didn\u2019t have as much temperature-driven product sales as last year in Auto. I guess, if you look at the extreme weather and what we did to things like road condition, do you think that the net impact of the first quarter\u2019s weather would be positive and that under-car and ride control and some of the categories that might benefit in the second quarter. We\u2019ll pull through or do you think is just a net negative and weather for 2015?","Paul Donahue","Well, Bret great question, honestly we\u2019re banking on some of that improvement coming in the second quarter. I think I mentioned to you we saw our battery business really take off in the month of March which we did not have in January and February. And we would hope for the same in some of the other key more weather related products as well.","Bret Jordan","Okay, getting a little more granule, I guess, if you look at things that might be seasonally positive, how we are looking nationally on things like temperature control right now are we setting up I guess we\u2019ve had some normal weather on the West Coast for a favorable year-over-year comparison in some of those summer categories or just to where they are now?","Paul Donahue","Too early to tell Bret, I would tell you that that category was down slightly in the first quarter. And again we all keep an eye on the weather charge and we\u2019re hoping for some warmer weather this summer. And if we get it, we think our owners and our stores will be well stocked with heating and air conditioning type products and we\u2019ll take advantage of it.","Bret Jordan","Okay, and then one last question for Tom, I guess, you mentioned that pending projects were up substantially, I think for motion. Could you give us a little color and may be what\u2019s driving that.","Tom Gallagher","Well, I think, our customer base, let me back up first Bret. What we call project work is a lot of times our customers will have plans to do some major refurbishment on a piece of equipment or take a line down to refurbish the line. And they let us know in advance of what their plans are, so that they can be sure that we\u2019ve got all of the product that they may need, when they get into the actual work.","So we tried to track as best we can the number of those that we\u2019ve been notified of and also the estimated value of the work. So, we see a nice increase both in terms of numbers, as well as in terms of the dollar value. Now not all of them come to fruition we have seen some overtime we\u2019ve seen some that we\u2019re plan get differed. But with the increase that we see right now we would lead us to believe that over the next quarter or two, we\u2019re going to see some nice project work flow through the revenue line. And what\u2019s driving that as you know we\u2019ve got an aging base of the equipment that\u2019s out there, you\u2019ve got all customers are looking to be more efficient in what they do. So I think it\u2019s been driven by the business demands that they see with their end markets and wanting to be sure that they are in a position to avoid any downtime going forward. Unplanned downtime.","Bret Jordan","Okay, thank you.","Paul Donahue","Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead Sir.","Sid Jones","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company third quarter 2017 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses. The Company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","We'll begin today with comments from our President and CEO, Paul Donahue. Paul?","Paul Donahue","Thank you Sid, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. As always we appreciate you taking the time to be with it. Earlier today we released our third quarter results. I\u2019ll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2017. After that we will open the call to your question. To get us started, let's recap our third quarter sales and earnings performance across our global automotive, industrial, office and electrical operations. ","Total GPC sales were up 4% to $4.1 billion with net income at 158 million and earnings per share at $1.08. These results include approximately $18.5 million in pretax transaction cost primarily related to the previously announced acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group in Europe or AAG which we look to close in November. The $0.48 per share impact of these cost, adjusted earnings per share were $1.16 compared to $1.24 in the third quarter last year.","As a diversified global distributor we continue to benefit from the balance of serving a broad range of geographies and end markets. While our US automotive, office and electrical businesses are operating in challenging end markets today, our industrial and international automotive businesses are operating in a more favorable market conditions and generating stronger growth. To that end, our investment in AAG, a leading European based automotive parts distributor, which we'll discuss later in our remarks underscores the growth opportunities we see internationally. ","In total, the diversity in our operations combined with an ongoing strategy to drive both organic and acquisitive growth enabled us to deliver a 4% total sales increase despite the challenging operating environment, one less billing day in the third quarter relative to last year and the disruption caused by three hurricanes and an earthquake in Mexico.","Total comparable sales were up 1% in the third quarter and we stand at plus 1% for the nine months through September. While positive this was below our expectation for 2% organic growth in the second half, which we were targeting to our share of wallet and digital initiatives as well as the ongoing expansion of our products and service offering. As a result, our net margins continue to be pressured in the third quarter. As we will discuss, in addition to organic growth we are looking at opportunities to capture cost saving and enhance productivity which will enable us to increase margins despite pressures on the topline. ","Turning to our acquisition strategy, we believe the ongoing headwinds in key markets and geographies continue to provide opportunities for accretive transactions. The acquisitions we have made to-date knows we may execute going forward are intended to grow our businesses and further enhance our footprint so that we may capitalize on the upturn in our markets and create additional shareholder value. ","Through the third quarter we have acquired businesses with approximately $215 million in annual revenues and made a minority investment in Inenco, a market leading industrial distributor in Australia. Acquisitions added 2% to sales in the third quarter and we anticipate that each of these new businesses will positively contribute to our further results. For the fourth quarter we have announced plans to add three additional businesses AGG and Monroe Motor Products in the automotive group and Apache Hose & Belting Company in the industrial segment with total estimated annual revenues of $2 billion. ","We are excited to expand our global platform with these new businesses and look forward to their future contributions in both the quarters and years ahead. Turning to our global automotive operations, automotive was 52% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2017. For the quarter, our total automotive sales were up 3.6% from last year consistent with the second quarter and with comparable sales on a global basis up approximately 1%.","In our US operations total sales were up 2% in the third quarter, with flat comparable sales. Across our customer segments, comparable sales to retail\/DIY customers continue to outperform our sales to commercial accounts. On the commercial side of the business, sales remain pressured by slow demand across our customer base with sales to NAPA AutoCare centers and major accounts down just slightly. Our major account business fluctuated by customer and we see a number of major accounts where we performed quite well but we also have a number of other accounts where we are off year-over-year. ","We're pleased to report a slight uptick in our fleet business in September especially in the energy and ag markets. This is the segment of our commercial business that has been challenged most of the year. We look at our product groups, batteries, rotating electrical, tools and equipment, and heavy duty sales all posted positive gains while categories such as ride control, exhaust, and heating and cooling remained soft consistent with the second quarter. These sales trends correlate to the warmer than average winter weather and milder summer temps both of which extended the pressure on demand.","By geographical region, the mountain region which experienced the harshest 2016 weather conditions in the country continue to outperform. And the northeast and the western division also had solid results in the quarter. Likewise despite the impact of Hurricane Harvey, the southwest division generated a slight Q3 sales increase. The southeast division had a more difficult quarter as it dealt with Hurricane Irma, but we would expect our business in both of these regions to snap back in the fourth quarter. The Atlantic, Central and Midwest regions all underperformed. ","Turning to retail, we continue to produce solid mid-single digit sales comps via several initiatives. Our growing NAPA rewards program is available in-store and online and now has more than 5.5 million members. This program has helped drive consistent retail growth and we continue to experience higher retail tickers and more frequent visits from our NAPA rewards members underscoring the program success. We continue to look at ways to further expand and enhance NAPA rewards in 2018. ","We're also making progress with our retail impact initiative, the 350 stores updated for this initiative through September which is up from 275 in June continue to outperform our overall retail growth with high-single digit retail sales comps. We are very pleased with these results which exceeded our expectations and we remain on track to have approximately 500 of these retail impact stores completed by the end of 2017. The retail end customer has more choices today than ever before, so it is encouraging to see our initiatives driving sustained growth in the NAPA retail segment.","We also expect our ongoing acquisitions to positively contribute to both our commercial and retail sales. In addition to the three automotive store group acquisitions and Stone Truck Parts added to our US network earlier this year. We announced this morning the addition of Monroe Motor Products through our automotive parts business effective November 1 of this year. Monroe a 100-year old auto parts chain is based in Rochester, New York. This leading regional player with $25 million in revenues, 17 stores and a large hub, filled the significant void for our US automotive parts business in the Rochester trading area. We are pleased to welcome Michael Gordon and Monroe team to GPC family and look forward to working with them to expand our market share in the Rochester market.","Across our US automotive aftermarket, the long-term fundamental drivers for our business remains sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow, the average age of the fleet is up 11.7 years. Field prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post steady gains. Total miles driven increased 0.8% in July and are up 1.5% year-to-date. The national average price of gasoline was $2.76 in September, up $0.30 from June and more than $0.40 from last year. We can expect to see further increases in miles driven albeit at a slower rate. ","Despite these sound fundamentals and the benefit of our US automotive acquisitions, which are meeting our expectations and driving sales growth, our organic growth has been below expectations. Cyclical factors such as two consecutive mild winters and vehicle age demographics has created a challenging environment. While we expect these industry conditions to improve in the quarters and year ahead, we are also focused on pulling the levers we do have control over to ensure we are well positioned as market conditions improve.","To that end we're taking a close look at cost and productivity measures across this business and will be implementing initiatives to enable us to more quickly respond to market changes and ensure we are achieving an improved productivity and efficiency wherever possible. So now let's turn to our international automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada and Mexico. These operations account for nearly one-third of our global automotive revenues and as a group delivered a 5% total sales increase including a 3% comparable sales increase in local currency. In Australia and New Zealand, third quarter sales were up low-to-mid single digits driven by a slight increase in comparable sales and the ongoing benefit of acquisitions. The Asia Pac business operated with 559 total stores across Australasia in the third quarter and has plans for further store expansion in the future.","We were pleased to bulk on strategically important tool and equipment distributor to our New Zealand operation in Q3. The combination of so called tool and equipment and Repco positions our team as the number one player in the equipment market as well as giving us access to a new range of customers. Further, the underlying fundamentals for the Australasian aftermarket remains solid with a growing car part driven by record car sales, relatively low gas prices, and upward trends in miles driven. ","Turning to NAPA Canada, both total sales and comparable sales strengthened further in the third quarter increasing in the mid to high single digit range from last year. We achieved this growth was strong execution of our strategy along with the favorable Canadian aftermarket sales climate. Areas of outsized growth continue to be our heavy duty truck parts business, our paint business, and our overall business in Western Canada. Finally in Mexico, our sales remains strong growing by high-single digits and reflecting our continued expansion of the NAPA Mexico footprint. Today, we have 39 total stores with plans to open additional stores in the quarters ahead.","Before concluding our review of the automotive segment, we want to spend a few minutes on our pending acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group. This acquisition is valued at $2 billion and is expected to generate an estimated annual revenues of US$1.7 billion while also delivering accretive margins and positive net cash flows. As a reminder, we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings in the first year after closing. For 2018, incremental diluted earnings per share is estimated at $0.45 to $0.50 and adjusted earnings per share which excludes the amortization of acquisition-related intangible is estimated at $0.65 to $0.70. ","With this acquisition we\u2019ll enter the European markets with critical scale in a leading market position and we are looking forward to working with the very talented AAG team to build on this strength and drive continued outperformance. AAG is poised to contribute significant sales growth and earnings accretion to GPC and also tariffs to enhance the GPC platform for long-term sustainable expansion across the global automotive parts industry. We have received all applicable regulatory approvals to proceed with this acquisition and expect to close in November.","We can also report that just last week AAG received final regulatory approval and closed down their acquisition of Group Auto Poland. So we entered the fourth quarter with a continued focus on accelerating our comp sales growth, while also focusing - while also looking forward to the opportunities presented by our pending acquisitions and longer term acquisition strategy. Turning now to our industrial business, motion industries represented 30% of our third quarter total GPC revenues and was up 7.1% in the quarter. This is consistent with the strong growth we saw in the first and second quarters and includes a 4% comparable sales increase which is also consistent with the first half of 2017. ","We remain encouraged by the continued strength in our industrial sales thus far in 2017 which reflects both improving organic growth and acquisitions. In addition, the industry has benefited from favorable market conditions as broad-based industrial indicators such as industrial production and the PMI index as well as rig counts and the level of exported goods have all trended positive. These factors drive greater customer demand across the diverse markets we serve and we expect to see this continue in the quarters ahead.","A review of our motion business by industry sector, product category and top customers shows that we are performing well across all operations. Of our top 12 industries, ten sectors showed solid sales including top performing areas such as iron and steel, lumber and wood, equipment rental and leasing, oil and gas equipment, equipment and machinery, and aggregate and cement. So industrial solid third quarter and nine month performance was broad based. Finally, as announced this morning we expect motion to close on the caution of Apache Hose & Belting Company on November 1. ","Apache is based Cedar Rapids, Iowa and is the premier distributor specializing in the value added fabrication of belts, hoses, and cut and molded products used in a wide array of industries and applications. Apache servers both the industrial and ag markets, and combined with motion creates a market leading value added offering in the belting and hose business. We expect Apache to generate estimated annual revenues of $100 million and we look forward to working with Tom Pientok the Apache team to further build on this business. In summary, we are encouraged by the solid results in our industrial business thus in 2017 and see no slowdown in sight for the quarters ahead.","Turning now to EIS, electrical distribution segment which was 5% of the company\u2019s total third quarter revenue. Sales for this group were up 11.6% in the third quarter due primarily to the Empire Wire and Supply acquisition on April 1. The addition of Empire further expanded EIS\u2019 wire and cable business and in particular it strengthens our overall capabilities to serve the industrial robotics and automation market. This new business continues to perform well as does the overall wire and cable segment. Our core electrical business including fabrication operations have softened slightly from the first half of the year. ","We expect these trends to stabilize and overall we continue to look for solid total sales growth at EIS in the quarters ahead. And now a few comments on our office products business, which was 12% of the company's Q3 revenue. The office products group reported a 4.7% decrease in both total sales and comparable sales as the ongoing decline in demand for traditional office supplies continue to pressure sales across all our channels. The exception to our decline in comp sales trend would be other facilities, break room and safety supplies category which is growing significantly and now stands at approximately 35% of total sales for the office group.","Unfortunately the sales increase for this important product group was not enough to offset the decrease in sales of traditional office supplies, furniture and tech products. Our third quarter results are consistent with recent sales trends and highlights significance of our efforts to expand SVR\u2019s products and services offering in the large and growing FBS market. While our team has done a solid job of executing our strategy to diversify the segment with deteriorating trends and the changing landscape of the industry including the strategic shift inside our customer base we are reviewing whether the current plan is adequate for sustained growth and profitability in accordance with our long-term objectives. ","So that recaps our consolidated and business segment sales results for the third quarter. Overall total sales of plus 4% were relatively consistent with the first six months of 2017. Given our margin profile however our challenge is to overcome the industry wide headwinds in the US automotive, office and electrical segments of our business and produce stronger organic growth. This is essential as we look to build on the opportunities presented by our acquisition strategy and improve our profitability.","So with that I'll hand it over to Carol who will provide you a financial update and our updated outlook for the year. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you Paul, we\u2019ll begin with the review of our key financial information and then we will provide our updated outlook for 2017. Our total sales in the third quarter were at 3.9% including 1% increase in comparable revenues. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.95% compared to 30.4% last year. The decrease is due primarily to lower supplier incentives recorded in the quarter associated with lower than expected purchasing volume. In addition, we experienced product mix shift in several of our businesses, US automotive, office and electric which also pressured our margins. ","For the nine months gross margin of 29.9% remains fairly steady with the prior year as the more favorable gross margin trends in the first six months mostly offset this quarter's decline. With that said we remain focused on enhancing our gross margin through several key initiatives including continued supplier negotiations, the ongoing investment in a more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies as well as improved analytic capabilities around SKU profitability.","We continue to see a somewhat inflationary pricing environment across our businesses in the third quarter with each of our businesses showing at least slight inflation through the nine months of the year. Our cumulative supplier price changes through September stand at 0.3% increase for automotive, 1.8% increase for industrial, 0.6% increase for our office and increase of 1.3% for electrical. ","Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses for the third quarter were 981 million or 962 million before the 18.5 million in transaction costs, primarily related to our pending European acquisition. On an adjusted basis, our total expenses were up 6% from last year and at 23.5% of sales and we continue to experience the de-leveraging of expenses associated with the slower organic sales environment in several of our businesses. In addition rising labor, freight and delivery, IT and digital investments as well as continued acquisition costs are also driving our increase in operating expenses.","These items are offsetting our previously planned cost savings initiatives as Paul mentioned before, but we have another round of plans and initiatives underway to further capture additional cost savings and enhance our productivity. Streamlining our cost structure is essential to improve our profitability and we have several action plans underway to accomplish this goal. Some specific examples include further consolidation or closing of select facilities including distribution centers, branches and underperforming stores. ","Our past efforts in this area are positively impacting our operations and they serve to maintain our total headcount at relatively flat, despite the addition of several acquisitions during the year. With that said, we recognized the need as well as the opportunities for even greater operational efficiencies as well as more significant cost savings. Additionally, we're piloting a variety of cost savings programs to improve our exposure to the increasing freight and delivery costs. ","While some of these initiatives will take some time to produce meaningful benefits, the expected savings will position us for improved profitability in the quarter and years ahead. So although we have much work ahead of us, we\u2019re excited for the opportunity to achieve a lower cost highly effective distribution infrastructure for our businesses.","Now we\u2019ll discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the third quarter at 2.2 billion was up 3.6% from the prior year and our operating profit at 178 million is down 10%, with an operating margin of 8.2% compared to 9.4% margin in the third quarter of last year. We're very disappointed with the margin decline in automotive, which we attribute to several factors including lower supplier incentives and a product mix shift to lower margin products including more commodities, which impacted our gross margins as well as the deleveraging of expenses and a rise in expenses such as freight and delivery, legal and professional, insurance and ongoing wage pressures. ","These headwinds were especially extreme in the quarter given our expectations for somewhat stronger comparable sales growth especially in the US automotive group. Our industrial sales of 1.2 billion in the quarter were 7% increase from the prior year. Operating profit of 95 million is up a strong 10.5% and our operating margin has improved to 7.6% compared to 7.4% last year as this segment continues to benefit from both organic and acquisitive sales growth as well as improved gross margins and SG&A leverage.","Office products revenues of 510 million were down 5% from last year and their operating profit of 24 million is down 21% with an operating margin of 4.7%. The margin for office remains under pressure due to the accelerated decline in organic sales and deleveraging of expenses. In addition this segment had a fairly significant decrease in supplier incentives in the quarter. As Paul commented earlier we're currently reviewing our plans to address those trends in this business. ","The electrical electronic group sales were 199 million in the quarter, up 12% from 2016. Operating profit of 13.5 million is down 5% and the margin for this group is 6.8%. so despite strong total sales growth, organic sales remains challenged for EIS and it continues to pressure our margins. We\u2019re also impacted by going customer and product mix shifts which are offsetting the positive impact of their cost savings initiatives in this business. So our total operating profit in the third quarter was down 5% and our operating profit margin of 7.6% compared to 8.3% last year. So a challenging quarter which we expect to correct in the quarters ahead through gross margin and operating expense initiatives that we discussed earlier.","We had net interest at 8.2 million in the quarter, up 3 million from the prior year due to an increase in our debt levels and certain variable interest rates. With these factors in mind, we\u2019re updating our net interest expense to be in the range of 26 to 27 million for the year excluding any financing costs for the pending AAG acquisition. Our total amortization expense was 11.8 million for the third quarter as compared to 10.3 million last year. We currently expect our full-year amortization to be approximately 46 million, which excludes the amortization associated with the pending AAG acquisition. ","Our depreciation expense of 28.4 million for the quarter is up slightly from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect total depreciation to be in the range of 110 to 120 million and on a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately 155 to 165 million. The other line which primarily reflects corporate expense was 43.9 million for the quarter. This includes 18.5 million in transaction costs primarily related to the pending AAG acquisition.","Excluding these costs, this line is up 4 million from the 21 million last year essentially due to the $7 million gain recorded in the prior year for a sale of real estate last year. So overall our corporate expenses are trending down slightly from 2016 despite higher costs associated with personnel, legal and professional, IT, security and digital which we\u2019re managing very carefully. For 2017, we continue to expect corporate expense to be in the range of 105 to 115 million range. This excludes the transaction cost as noted above. ","Our tax rate for the third quarter was 35.7 compared to 36.4 last year. The decrease in the quarterly and year-to-date rates primarily relates to a higher mix of foreign earnings which are taxed at lower rates. And in addition the recently adopted change in accounting for stock-based compensation has also positively impacted our 2017 rates. For the full year we expect our tax rate to be approximately 35.5%.","So now let's turn to a discussion of the balance sheet which remains strong and in excellent condition. Account receivable of 2.2 billion is up 6% from the prior year. This is in line with our average daily sales growth for September. We also remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at quarter end was 3.4 billion, up 7% from last year and this has improved from the 9% year-over-year increase reported in June. In addition, excluding acquisitions and FX, our inventory is up 4% year-over-year and up just less than 1% from the year end. ","We're very focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable of 3.3 billion at September 30 is up 6% despite slower purchasing activity across several of our businesses, most notably in the US automotive group. Offsetting these lower purchases is the ongoing benefit of improved payment terms with our suppliers as well as acquisitions.","At September 30 of 2017, AP to inventory ratio was 98%. Our working capital of 1.5 billion at September 30 is consistent with the prior year and down from year end. Overall we continue to maintain a relatively steady level of working capital from quarter to quarter but we're certainly not satisfied at our current levels. We're currently looking for opportunities to further improve on our working capital management. ","Our total debt of 1.1 billion at September 30 has remained fairly steady over the last several quarters although it's up from September a year ago from 775 million. Our average cost of the debt is a low 2.49% and in today's low rate environment we're comfortably using our strong balance sheet and financial capacity to finance our pending European acquisition, which will add approximately 2 billion in debt to our balance sheet. AAG represents an excellent growth opportunity for GPC and we're comfortable with our anticipated capital structure with debt at approximately two times EBITDA.","So in summary, our balance sheet will remain a key strength of the company. Thus far, in 2017, we\u2019ve generated cash from operations of 542 million and we're updating our full year cash from operations to approximately 750 million to 800 million and free cash flow, which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend, in the $200 million to $250 million range. While lower than previously estimated, our cash flow remains solid and it supports our ongoing priorities for the use of cash, which we believe starts to maximize shareholder value. ","Our priorities remain the dividend, reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. Our 2017 annual dividend of $2.70 per share marks our 61st consecutive year of increased dividend paid to our shareholders. This represents approximately 57% of our prior year earnings and a 3% dividend yield. We look forward to recommending our 62nd consecutive dividend increase in 2018. Our investment in capital expenditures was 43 million in the third quarter and stands at 97 million for the nine months. ","For the year, we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of 140 million to 150 million. Over the first nine months of the year, we purchased approximately 1.9 million shares of our stock and today, we have 17.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. This includes the 15 million share authorization that was approved by our board of directors at their August board meeting. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with a dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.","So that concludes our financial update for the third quarter of 2017. And in summary, we are not satisfied with our current results and we're taking further action to enhance our gross margins and streamline our cost structure across all of our businesses. We're absolutely focused in these areas and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress.","So now, let's turn to our guidance for 2017. Based on our current performance, our growth plans and initiatives and the current market conditions, we\u2019re updating our full-year 2017 guidance as follows. We're increasing our total sales guidance to the plus 4% to plus 4.5% range from our previous guidance of plus 3% to plus 4%. This outlook includes the benefit of our acquisitions closed through September 30 as well as the Apache and Monroe acquisitions announced today, which will close on November 1, but no other future acquisitions. ","We currently expect the slight benefit from currency translation for the full year. By business, we're updating our sales outlook for the automotive side to approximately 3.5% from the previous plus 3% to plus 4%. We're updating sales for industrial to plus 5.5% to plus 6% from our previous plus 4% to plus 5%. We're updating sales for the office segment to approximately 2% from the previous plus 2% to plus 3%. ","And finally, we\u2019re updating sales for the Electrical segment to plus 8% to plus 9% from our prior guidance of plus 7% to plus 8%. On the earnings side, we\u2019re updating our guidance for the full year earnings per share to $4.47 to $4.52 per share. We're also guiding to an adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.55 to $4.60, which compares to our prior outlook of $4.70 to $4.75. ","Our adjusted earnings per share excludes any fourth quarter 2017 revenue, earnings or expenses, including transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of AAG as well as the transaction costs reported in the third quarter of 2017 as noted in our press release and today's call. We would add that our outlook for adjusted earnings per share reflects our expectation for a slight increase in fourth quarter earnings relative to fourth quarter of 2016. So while we underperformed in the third quarter, we're taking the corrective action necessary to improve our profitability in the quarter and years ahead.","With that said, we close by saying thank you to all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work day in and day out. At this point, I'll turn it back over to Paul.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Carol. We enter the fourth quarter focused on generating stronger organic sales growth as well as maximizing the benefits of our acquisitions. Next month, we expect to close on the Alliance Automotive Group in Europe as well as the Apache and Monroe Motor Parts acquisitions announced earlier today. We believe in the long term benefits of our acquisition strategy and are excited to add these businesses to our operations. ","As mentioned before, we also move forward intensely focused on the plans and initiatives underway to reduce costs and improve our profitability, with the objective of enhancing gross margins and building a highly productive, cost effective infrastructure. While this has always been our focus, we understand we need to take steps now to be more nimble in challenging environments and ensuring we are positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the market begins to recover. ","We have consistently stated that our business is fit best under the GPC umbrella, we also continually assess the contribution of each business to our long term financial objectives for sustained revenue growth, cash flow generation and profitability. Although we are not satisfied with this quarter\u2019s results, we are optimistic with the opportunities that lie ahead and we move forward with a heightened sense of urgency as we focus on maximizing shareholder value and positioning the company for long term success.","So with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator and Carol and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go first to Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Could you talk a little about the cadence in auto as the quarter went, were there any particularly weak or strong months in the period?","Paul Donahue","Yeah. The good news, Bret, is that the month of September was, for the US group, was our best month of the quarter. August was a little softer, but as I said, September, we rebounded nicely on an average daily sales basis. If we look across our total automotive business, similar pattern. September was the strongest of the three months for global automotive business.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And how do you think you did relative to the underlying market, as you sort of look across the board and I guess it's hard to see everybody is POS, but do you think you\u2019re relatively keeping pace or were there any supply issues?","Paul Donahue","No. Look, I would -- being the first one now, Bret, we haven't had the advantage of seeing our competitors\u2019 numbers, but with flat comp numbers in the US, I'm guessing we're within range of most. I don't believe we're giving up market share as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We saw nice growth in our DIY business. Again, I think that\u2019s directly related to the things that we're doing and the initiatives we have in play. We saw a little bit of softness in the DIFM business, but again, we've got, I think, initiatives to get that turned as we head into the homestretch here.","Bret Jordan","Okay. On the margins in auto, you talked about the supplier incentive being down as well as the negative mix. Could you kind of bucket those and I guess from a supplier standpoint, I'm hearing a lot across the board, people trying to get their inventory levels down, have you taken within your total inventories, the auto content down and maybe if you could just sort of, within the margin, talk about how much is lower incentive versus lower margin mix?","Carol Yancey","Yeah. Bret, I\u2019ll answer that in two ways. One is specifically to automotive margins, which were down 120 basis points in the quarter. I would say three predominant factors that have equal weight. One would be the lower rebates. The other would be the lower organic sales that we had planned for better organic sales. And then the other would be the SG&A, which is not only the leverage issue, but it\u2019s some of the costs we pointed out, be it IT, digital, wage pressures. ","I mean, look, automotive headcount is flat, but when you layer in the wage pressures, the cost of insurance benefits, that\u2019s weighing on there and the other thing in SG&A that we\u2019ve called out is the delivery, the freight, the diesel feel. That really wasn't anticipated. There was definitely some spikes up related to some supply issues and the hurricanes and for us, the cost of delivery was a factor and so that\u2019s the automotive margins. And then just when you look at the total gross profit in the quarter, we were down 46 basis points. 20 of that was related to the volume incentive in rebates and that's a combination of automotive and office.","Bret Jordan","Was there any AAG expense in the auto and the SG&A in the quarter?","Carol Yancey","No, the cost that we called out, the 18.5 million is all in the corporate expense, other line and none of it flowed through the operating margins.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And since you said the word hurricane, what do you think you lost to the hurricanes in the quarter?","Carol Yancey","Well, from a sales standpoint, it\u2019s half a point. And that\u2019s pretty representative across all four of our segments. It was a little bit higher in industrial and there is an impact on the profit side as well. So, we believe that was probably a penny or two in the quarter as it relates to that, but definitely a half a point on the sales.","Paul Donahue","But, Bret, we haven't been through these before our expectations and especially in the Southwest and our guys in the Southwest were obviously overwhelmed with Hurricane Harvey, the guys in the Southeast were -- we think we lost a couple of points in the Southeast with Irma. We do expect we'll see a snapback. Now, how quickly that comes, exactly when that comes, we think it will be in the fourth quarter, but we do expect there will be a little bit of a snapback. We sold a lot of generators, supplies, mops, brooms, buckets, bottled water, et cetera, but we would hope to see some hard parts bouncing back in Q4 as folks recover.","Carol Yancey","And Bret, I don\u2019t think I answered your inventory question for automotive. Primarily, our industrial business has made the improvement in inventory, but I would tell you sequentially from Q2 to Q3, automotive did take some inventory out of the system. So, there is more work to be done there, but we are keeping a mindful eye on the level of inventory and as it relates to these volume incentives.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Another couple of auto margin questions actually. You guys just talked about roughly equal impacts from rebates and spending and deleverage, would you expect all those pressures to kind of continue on a go forward basis or why wouldn\u2019t they continue, number one. Number two, are you guys starting to see a more competitive environment on the pricing front. Historically, this industry hasn\u2019t experienced that, but just given the magnitude of margin swing, which is bigger than what we've seen in the last decade pretty much, just trying to figure out if there's something else that we need to be aware of. Thanks.","Carol Yancey","Yeah. I'll start with this and then I\u2019ll let Paul comment on the pricing side. As it relates specifically to some of the things we\u2019ve called out, factored into our guidance, the $0.15 lowering guidance, we have contemplated some similar numbers as it relates to the volume incentives for the rest of the year as well as some of this SG&A pressure, because I don't think that's going to alleviate too quickly. ","Having said that, and Paul mentioned this, we're now moving to some further steps that need to be taken. So, while we had made changes related on having a level of comparable sales, since we're not there, we're going to kind of the next set of changes. So it takes us a couple of quarters to come out, but I think the volume incentives, certainly that would be assumed to recur and that's what factored into our guidance adjustments.","Paul Donahue","Scot, relative to market pricing pressures, I can tell you that, as it has been in recent years, the pricing atmosphere across the automotive aftermarket is pretty stable and pretty famed fortunately. As we look at our primary competitors, there has not been folks out there trying to lead with price. With that said, I will tell you that internally, we are reviewing our pricing approach, our approach to pricing in the market. One of the things that we've -- our team has begun to implement is looking at zone pricing, which is not new for most retailers, but it is new perhaps for NAPA. So that is something that we are in the process of implementing and we believe will have a positive impact on our overall margins.","Scot Ciccarelli","I appreciate that. I guess what I was just trying to think through is, one of the concerns industry, you guys are aware of this, is pricing transparency, given kind of the online competition. I know you guys effectively sell a private label product. Are there any concerns that pricing transparency where you do see stuff, margins maybe 15% to 20% less at an online competitor as opposed to an automotive specialist could wind up creating that price pressure, just broadly for the environment?","Paul Donahue","Yeah. Listen, I've Scot, am I -- are we concerned? Sure, we're concerned and it's something that we pay very, very close attention to. I will tell you I had the privilege of sitting through a session last week, we had eight of our largest and best NAPA auto care centers here in the building and so our folks coming in and talking to these folks about online pricing and what they see in the marketplace, sure, they are. Is it driving their decision making in terms of how they're pricing their job? They're not. And so, is it a concern? It is. But, do we believe that the pricing transparency is having a negative impact on our margins? We don't think so at this point.","Carol Yancey","And Scot, one other thing I\u2019d mention that we didn\u2019t really talk about, the product mix in the quarter for automotive, Paul mentioned the categories that performed well, be it tools and equipment, batteries, rotating electrical, those are typically at lower gross margin. The ones that didn't perform as well under car heating and cooling that relates to weather the mild winters or the mild summers, those are more the higher gross margins. So we did have some mix shift in our gross margin for automotive in the quarter. Hard to say what that\u2019s going to be in Q4, but that's not necessarily indicative of online issues.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","Just wanted to talk about the difference between DIFM and DIY, can you maybe just provide a little commentary on, because I know obviously a lot of it\u2019s a self help, you\u2019re kind of just low base, but you\u2019re also kind of resetting the stores, so can you maybe talk about the DIY performance of the stores you aren\u2019t resetting and kind of where you think industry trends are in DIY? And then I have a related follow-up.","Paul Donahue","Yeah. So you hit on it exactly, Chris. We certainly think that we are outpacing the rest of the industry and that's largely due to the initiatives that we've spoken to over the last number of quarters on these calls. Our team has improved the look in 350 stores. We have another 150 slated for the balance of the year. The stores that we have reset, we are seeing high single digit increases in our retail business. Those stores, we have not reset, we are seeing mid-single digit to lower single digit increases. But the good news in our DIY business, our ticket count is up, our traffic count, so the number of tickets is up and again, I give credit to our team and the good job that they're doing in the field. We\u2019re getting folks into our stores today that perhaps were not our shoppers in previous years.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. Okay. And then kind of like more of an industry question. I would think DIFM is selling a younger car, the DIY, so wondering just like air pockets and lapping troughs are, is there, I guess, what is there a chance, like we\u2019re seeing this first in DIFM, maybe that\u2019s one reason why DIFM is slowing down a little bit harder quicker and then two, is it just something about DIY that\u2019s in general where some of the product sales are less tied to vehicle age, just any thoughts there would be appreciated.","Paul Donahue","Well, I think your point is accurate. Chris. I think that trough that we've seen is absolutely impacting the DIFM. So, going back through the recession, \u201908, \u201909 and even believe into a little bit of \u201910, whereas we would normally be seeing 17 million, 18 million vehicle counts coming into our sweet spot. They're coming in at a much reduced rate. So I absolutely believe that is impacting the DIFM side. And then when you look at, as it relates to DIY, when you have an average vehicle now on the road at 11.7 years, we're seeing and a lot of cars coming in, 13, 14, 15 year old vehicles that to your point they\u2019re ending up coming into our stores and taking the DIY route more so than the DIFM route. So I think your point is valid.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay. And so I\u2019m being highly greedy here, but just one critical question. For the Poland [ph] acquisition, was that included in your original estimate or is that going to be left technically now that you\u2019ve pulled with it?","Carol Yancey","You\u2019re talking about the earnings per share number that we gave you for 2018?","Chris Bottiglieri","Yeah.","Carol Yancey","That assumed the Poland acquisition.","Chris Bottiglieri","The Poland acquisition is in that [indiscernible].","Carol Yancey","It was.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","A couple of follow-up questions. First on automotive margins. One relates to whether you're seeing any trend between private label, which I think is the bulk of your volume at NAPA relative to brands, so whether that\u2019s having any impact on margin and mix? And then also we\u2019ve heard a lot about vendor incentives in industrial over the years, we\u2019ve heard less about it in auto. If you could just kind of talk to us, is this a new innovation or is it just frankly that delta in your sales versus expectations that's leading us to hear a bit more about it here in 2017?","Paul Donahue","Yeah. Matt, I'll take the first part of that. I\u2019ll let Carol touch on vendor incentives. As it relates to private label versus brand and the impact on margin, 90% of what we sell in the US stores, Matt, is NAPA branded products. We do sell OE parts through our acquisition we did a number of years ago through our all term business, but 90% of what we sell is private brand and we haven't seen a significant shift away from private label, from our NAPA brand into the OE brand. ","And as it relates to the vendor incentives, I\u2019ll let Carol touch on that.","Carol Yancey","Yeah. Look, I would say in general, it\u2019s a -- you're right, we talk more about it on the industrial side because it is a little bigger component of their margins. It\u2019s not as large of a component on the automotive margins, but having said that, it's something that we factor in to our profitability each year and we do it based on achieving certain volume levels and purchasing levels. And as we again contemplated through the first six months, we expected stronger comparable growth for the second half and as we got into third quarter, our purchases were actually down something like 6%. ","So -- and again, we could have made a decision to go out and buy that inventory regardless of needing it to get those volume levels, but we're working hard on keeping that inventory down. So we just felt it was appropriate to adjust our rebate assumptions. Having said that, that's not anything new. It's more of a function of the lower organic sales. ","Now, I\u2019d point out on the motion side, look, having a core growth of 3% to 4% on the industrial side and we\u2019ve talked about their incentives over the years, all the improvements they\u2019ve done, and you see what it does with leverage and you\u2019re saying the 20 basis point improvement and that's not all just incentives and volume rebates. That's just the core business.","Matt Fassler","Understood. If I could ask a quick follow-up, actually in the office business. It sounds like that business is somehow on a bit of a shorter leash at this point, are you \u2013 is this business still part of your long term plans, at what point do you think you'll decide on that question?","Paul Donahue","Yeah. So Matt, as we've talked before in these calls and one on one meeting, look, we review every one of our businesses and we have four different businesses we go to market auto and industrial and of course office and electrical. And we review them all and we review all of our geographical regions as well and all need to meet the expectations that we have, both on the volume -- top line and bottom line. And in the past, we have -- as I think we've talked, we have moved away from businesses that failed to meet those expectations. All that said Matt, there is no intention at this point to move away from our office products business. ","We're in the midst of a multi-year diversification strategy and honestly, the growth that we're seeing in facilities, breakroom and safety, which is now, gosh, it's 35 plus percent of our overall business, we're seeing good -- we're seeing good movement and we're seeing good trends. The challenge that we have, it\u2019s that core -- the core office supply business. And unfortunately, the growth we\u2019re seeing in FPS is not, right now, is not able to make up for the decline we're seeing in the core. But I will tell you, just like all of our businesses that we watch and monitor very closely and we certainly expect our office group to step up just like all of our businesses. ","The last thing I would say Matt on office is, there has been a bit of a change in customer dynamics. So, one of the big, well, there is only two. So, one of the big players that went private is making certain procurement decisions, which has had an impact on the wholesalers as well. So yeah, we've got a number of challenges, but our team I believe is addressing them and I still am positive about the outlook going forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Seth Basham, Wedbush.","Seth Basham","Sorry to return to the question around auto margins, but just a little bit more clarity. In terms of the 120 basis point decline in EBIT margins, can you give us a little bit more sense of how much of it was gross versus SG&A de-leverage.","Carol Yancey","It was slightly more on the gross margin side than the SG&A side, because again what I mentioned was the rebates for them and then the lower organic growth and then we had some product mix shift. So a little bit more so on gross margin than SG&A.","Seth Basham","Got it. That's helpful. And in terms of the performance of independent versus company-owned stores in the US, was there much difference?","Paul Donahue","No, not really, Seth. Our flat comp that we saw across the business in the quarter was pretty consistent, both with our independence and our company-owned stores as well. So not a big variance there.","Seth Basham","Got it. And then lastly, as it relates to your thought process around store and facility closures, how are you thinking about that if at all differently now in the auto segment based on the sluggishness that you've seen over a number of quarters?","Paul Donahue","So, Seth, let me take that in two parts. From a distribution center standpoint, we've got a vast distribution network, 47 DCs here in the US. We've got, I\u2019m sorry, 57 DCs here in the US, sorry. I\u2019m thinking about one of the other businesses. We've got a number in our other markets as well. So one of the things that we're evaluating is our distribution center infrastructure. We've added a third-party that we're working with to really help us evaluate whether our go to market strategy today is the absolute most efficient for our business. So that's under review. ","As it relates to our stores, Seth, there's nothing new there. We are, I mean, through our history, we are constantly opening and closing stores, underperforming stores in markets throughout the US and that hasn't changed any and I don't see that changing going forward, but we close, gosh, we\u2019ll close 100 stores a year and we'll open 100 stores. Actually, this year, we\u2019ll surpass that number. So that\u2019s nothing new for us.","Seth Basham","Got it. If I could sneak one last one in, just regarding service levels. So margins in auto were soft. You said, there wasn't any change in the pricing environment, but is there a change in the service level environment, in other words, are you adding more services, whether it be quicker deliveries, et cetera to try to drive sales in the past just leading to some SG&A pressure.","Paul Donahue","No. There's been no major shift in our service proposition that we provide our customers, Seth. We think that going back to our vast distribution center network with our 6000 stores, we deliver to our stores every night and we'll hotshot to our stores and our independent owners during the course of the day. So we have not -- we certainly have not pared back on any of our services that we provide our customers and we don't see that in the cards going forward either.","Operator","And with no additional questions, I'd like to turn the call back to management for additional comments or closing remarks.","Carol Yancey","We like to thank you for your participation in today's call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Carol Yancey, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Secretary, you may begin your conference.","Carol B. Yancey","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call to discuss our results as well as the outlook for the remainder of the year.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filing.","The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Carol, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning.","Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Paul Donahue, our President; and I will each handle a portion of today's call and once we have concluded our remarks, we'll look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.","Earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2012 results, and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them, but for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter was $3,376 million, which was up 3%. Net income was $172.9 million, which was up 14%, and earnings per share were $1.11 this year, compared to $0.97 last year, and the EPS increase was also 14%.","After being up 7% in revenue in the first quarter and 5% in Q2, the 3% increase in the third quarter does show deceleration over the past 2 quarters.","We were short 1 sales day in the quarter this year, so on a per day basis, our third quarter revenues were up just over 4%.","However, with that said, the third quarter results are a bit better on a per day basis, but we did experience a continued decelerating trend in demand in 3 of our 4 businesses, which we'll discuss in a bit more detail in a moment.","Despite the softer sales results, we do feel that our team did a good job on the operating side of the business by leveraging a 3% sales increase to a 14% increase in both net income and earnings per share. A review of the results by business segments shows that our Industrial and Electrical\/Electronic segments continue to generate the strongest results. Industrial was up 4.5% in the quarter and Electrical was up 5%. Both had challenging comparisons to go against, with Industrial being up 18% in the third quarter of last year and Electrical\/Electronic was up 22%.","With that said, however, the results in each case were a little lighter than we had anticipated going into the quarter. And looking a bit deeper into the Industrial performance, we see that their top 10 industry segments were up 2% in the quarter. These segments represent a little over 50% of the total Industrial revenues, so they're important to our overall performance. And the 2% increase in the quarter follows a 12% increase in these same segments in the first quarter, an 8% increase in Q2, indicating demand moderation across these key customer categories.","Interestingly, the moderation is not consistent across all segments. Industries like automotive, iron and steel and chemicals have remained pretty steady over the first 3 quarters of the year. But then we have seen decelerating growth rates in Equipment and Machinery, Equipment Leasing and Coal segments reflectively feel of the overall economic slowdown over the past several months, as well as a slowdown in global demand for a number of these customers.","And we see some of the same inconsistency in the EIS results as well, with Wire and Cable continuing to perform quite well, but then we're more challenged in the Electrical and Electronics segments, primarily in the solar and contract Manufacturing industries.","So the current environment is a bit more challenging and choppy for our Industrial and Electrical\/Electronic businesses, but the key external demand indicators, industrial production, manufacturing capacity utilization and the Purchasing Managers' Index all remain generally favorable, and our expectation is for each of these businesses to grow 6% to 8% over the final quarter of the year.","Moving on to Office Products, we were down 1% in the quarter, which is pretty much in line with the 1.5% decrease in Q1 and the 1% decline in Q2. So no significant movement up or down, although on a per day basis the quarterly Office Products results were positive for the first time this year, which is a bit encouraging.","As has been the case all year long, the Mega customers outpaced the independent customers in the quarter, with the Megas growing mid-single digits and the independents declining low single digit.","On the product side, the Cleaning and breakroom category grew at mid-single digits, Tech Products were flat, Office Products down just slightly and Furniture was off low single digit.","At this point, we don't see any material changes in the overall Office Products environment, with conditions remaining challenging for several more quarters at a minimum, and our expectation is for fourth quarter sales to be in a range of down 1% to up 1%, which would put S.P. Richards down 1% for the year.","So that's a quick overview of the nonautomotive segments and at this point, we'll ask Paul to give you an update on our Automotive business. Paul?","Paul D. Donahue","Thank you, Tom. I'd like to add my welcome to each of you this morning. I'm pleased to join both Jerry and Tom and to have the opportunity to provide with you all an update on the third quarter performance of our North American Automotive business.","Automotive is our company's largest business segment and we ended the third quarter with sales up 2.5%. For the 9 months ended September 30, our Automotive business is up 4% over the same period in 2011.","Our sales pattern in the third quarter was very similar to our second quarter results. In fact, when we account for the 1 less selling day in the third quarter this year versus 2011, total automotive sales were up 4%, in line with the 4% we delivered in the second quarter.","I will say our overall sales were softer than what we expected at the beginning of the quarter. We believe there are a number of factors impacting our industry, including the mild winter temperatures experienced in the northern half of the country, along with the ongoing uncertainty in the economy.","Fortunately, we'll begin to annualize the impact of the weather late in the fourth quarter and a more normalized winter weather pattern should serve to improve demand.","In addition, we continue to believe that the underlying long-term fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket remain strong, and the industry will continue to benefit from the solid growth opportunities this offers us well into the future.","The aging vehicle population now reported to be close to 11 years, the continued growth in the number of older vehicles and the positive year-over-year miles driven numbers bodes well for all of us in the industry. And we feel NAPA is well positioned to capture its share of the increase in demand generated by these positive trends.","When we further analyze our third quarter results, the sales momentum we began to see in late June and early July softened in the middle of the quarter before bouncing back in September. Our average daily sales in the month of September were our strongest since back in March.","As a result, our total automotive revenues, adjusted for 1 less selling day, improved 4% for the second consecutive quarter. The components of this revenue growth include a 1% same-store sales increase, the positive sales contribution from our acquisition of Quaker City Motor Parts, offset by a slight loss due to currency exchange.","Regarding the increase in our core growth, it is important to point out that our results varied significantly by region of the country. The traditional cold weather regions, our Central, Midwest and Eastern divisions, which comprise about 1\/3 of our overall business, consistently underperformed the other regions across the U.S.","This likely is a direct reflection of the impact of the mild winter in these colder climate areas. The mild winter temperatures also impacted key weather-sensitive product categories in these regions, products like wipers, brakes and ignition products. We believe this type of regional disparity and product category impact is consistent across most of the industry.  It also serves to reason that a return to a more normal winter weather pattern should drive a potential upswing in demand in the upcoming winter months.","Moving along, we're very pleased with the positive contribution from our Quaker City Motor Parts acquisition. Their third quarter and year-to-date sales contribution was in line with our expectations. We have a strong team in place, our transition plans are on track and we are excited with the opportunities that Quaker City will provide to us in the future.","Turning to the results for our company-owned store group. In the quarter, our Commercial business continued to outperform our Retail business. Taking a look at the Retail business first, the quarter trended down 1%, which follows a 2% decline in the second quarter. Our average number of invoices per day was down slightly, while our average dollar value increased.","On the commercial side, in our company-owned stores, the quarter ended up 1%, consistent with our growth in this segment in the second quarter.","Our average number of invoices was flat, while our average dollar value per invoice increased. So we're somewhat encouraged to see that while our overall store traffic is down slightly, our average order size is increasing. It's also encouraging to see both our retail and our commercial businesses showing steady results on a sequential basis.","Likewise, this is reflected in both our NAPA AutoCare and Major Account business results as well. Sales for these 2 important customer groups were up low to mid-single digits in the third quarter. We're pleased to report we reached a record number of NAPA AutoCare centers in the third quarter, which bodes well for future revenue growth.","So in summary, demand in the automotive aftermarket in the third quarter proved very similar to what we experienced in the April to June quarter. We do remain bullish about the core fundamentals impacting the automotive aftermarket and our Automotive Parts Group. These core fundamentals, combined with our own internal growth initiatives, provide us ample growth opportunities for the fourth quarter and well into the future.","In light of that, our expectations for our North American Automotive Parts business is to generate a fourth quarter sales increase in the range of 6% to 8%.","So that completes our overview on the Automotive business in the third quarter, and at this time, I'll hand it over to Jerry for a review of the financial results. Jerry?","Jerry W. Nix","Thank you, Paul. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the third quarter and 9-month income statements and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, then we'll open the call up to your questions.","View of the income statement shows the following: Total sales at a record high of $3.4 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 3% from last year and this reflects a 4% increase on a daily sales basis. For the 9 months, total sales of $9.9 billion, up 5% from 2011.","And you've heard from Tom and Paul, the sales environment remained challenging in the quarter, but we're proud of our team for working through these difficult conditions and reaching another record sales level for the company.","We remain focused on achieving continuous, steady growth in the fourth quarter for 2012 -- of 2012 and beyond.","Gross profit for the third quarter, 28.9% of sales is even with the gross margin achieved in the third quarter of last year.  For the 9 months, gross margin of 29.0% was up 30 basis points from the 28.7% from the same period in 2011. So we made nice progress on improving our gross margin for the year, although the third quarter's a little bit more challenging, due to the competitive sales environment and slightly lower levels of vendor incentives earned for the quarter.","We'll continue to look opportunities to expand our gross margin through ongoing initiatives to effectively manage supply chain cost, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize our pricing potential. Our management teams across all of our businesses are committed to this effort.","For the year, cumulative pricing, which represents supplier increases to us, was a negative 0.3% in automotive, plus 1.2% in industrial, plus 2.7% in Office Products and a negative 0.7% in electrical.","Turning to SG&A. Total expenses, $705 million in the third quarter and that's up 2% from 2011 and at 20.9% of sales, is down from 21.3% in the third quarter of last year. For the 9 months, total SG&A expenses, $2.1 billion, that's up 3% and at 21.2% of total sales compared to 21.5% for the same 9 months in 2011. We attribute our steady improvement in this area to the combined benefits of greater leverage associated with our sales growth and our intense focus on managing our expenses.","Throughout the organization, we've made solid progress in controlling our expenses and we'll continue to assess and align the proper cost structure of our businesses as we move through the year and beyond. We continue to benefit from ongoing cost saving initiatives, including investments in technology, which have positively impacted the operating efficiency in our distribution centers and stores, as well as supply chain costs in areas such as freight and logistics, among others. For the third quarter, we also experienced savings in our corporate expenses, which we'll discuss further in a few moments.","Now let's discuss the results by segment. Automotive had revenue in the quarter of $1,650.9 million. That represents 49% of the total, and is up 2.5%.  And operating profit of $150.6 million, up 7%, so very nice margin expansion from 8.8% to 9.1% of revenue.","The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter, $1,138.9 million. That represents 34% of the total, and it's up 4.5% and they had operating profit of $94.6 million, down 3%. So poor leverage and little less incentives in the quarter caused our operating margin to slip from 8.9% to 8.3% in the quarter.","Office Products, $444.3 million in sales for the quarter, represents 13% of the total. That's down 1%, and they had operating profit of $29.9 million and that's up 10%. So very strong margin expansion there going from 6.1% to 6.7% of revenue.","Electrical Group's sales in the quarter, $150.9 million, represent 4% of the total, that's up 5%, and operating profit $13.6 million, up 22%. So outstanding margin expansion there due to the leverage off the sales and lower copper pricing, but that's a record half at 9.0% in the quarter.","And moving to the 9 months. Automotive had revenue of $4,789.3 million, up 4%. Operating profit of $418.2 million, up 11%. Again, very strong margin expansion for that group, going from 8.2% to 8.7%.","The Industrial Group had revenue for the 9 months of $3,398.8 million, up 8%. Operating profit $274.0 million, up 10%. So again, even though with a slight decline in the quarter, they were up solid for the year, for the 9 months 7.9%, prior year, 8.1% for the current year.","Office Products had revenue for the 9 months, $1,283.7 million, down 1%. Operating profit of $98.1 million, that's up 2%. So again, excellent margin expansion from 7.4% to 7.6%, considering a negative sales increase, they've done a good job of taking infrastructure costs out and managing their expenses downward.","Electrical Group had revenue at -- for the 9 months, $447.4 million, up 7%. Operating profit $38.5 million, up 27%. So again, very strong margin expansion from 7.2% to 8.6% at a record high, and I would not expected for them to continue to show that kind of improvement in their operating margin, but we're extremely pleased with the level that they are at this time.","Total operating profit was up approximately 4% in the third quarter, and operating profit margin improved 20 basis points to 8.6% from 8.4% in the third quarter 2011. This follows margin improvement of 70 and 40 basis points for the first and second quarters of 2012, respectively, and total operating margin for the 9 months is 8.4%, and that's up 40 basis points from 8.0% last year. We're pleased with this level of margin expansion and expect to show continued year-over-year operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter as well.","We had net interest expense of $5.0 million and $14.7 million for the third quarter and 9 months, respectively, which is down from 2011 due mainly to the lower interest rate on our $250 million debt agreement that was funded in November of last year. We'll discuss our debt position later, but we currently expect our net interest expense to be approximately $20 million to $22 million for the full year.","Other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and noncontrolling interest was $12.3 million expense in the third quarter, and is $47.0 million for the 9 months of September. This last [indiscernible] improvement in the third quarter due primarily to the company's favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment and the income recorded for our 30% investment in Exego.  These 2 factors, as well as the positive impact of our ongoing cost savings served to improve this expense line, and we currently project the total other category to be in the $60 million to $65 million range for the full year, which is relatively consistent with 2011.","For the quarter, tax rate approximately 36.3% was down from 38.6% last year, due to the nontaxable status of the favorable retirement plan I just -- we just discussed. And for the 9 months, the 36.4% rate compares to 36.8% for the same period last year, and we'd expect our full year tax rate for 2012 to be approximately 36.5%.","Net income for the quarter, $172.9 million is up 14%. EPS increased to $1.11, compared to $0.97 last year, also up 14%. For the year, through September, net income is up 13%, EPS of $3.11 is up 14% over the prior year. The third quarter was another record level of earnings for us, and we want to recognize all of our associates at Genuine Parts Company for achieving this milestone. This requires a great deal of hard work and dedication on their part, and we're proud of their accomplishment.","Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at September 30 was strong, at $398 million, up from approximately $172 million at June 30, although down from over $500 million at September last year and at December 31 of 2011.","Our current cash position reflects the more than $500 million used for several investing activities earlier this year, including the January 1 investment in Exego, the leading automotive distribution company in Australia and New Zealand, the Electrical Group's Light Fab acquisition on February 1 and Automotive's Quaker City acquisition closed on May 1. These significant uses of cash were partially offset by the increase in earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions.","Accounts receivable, $1.6 billion September 30 increased 5% from September 30 last year, on a 3% sales increase for the third quarter. As we said before, our goal is to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth, so we have work to do in this area and we expect to see progress toward this goal in the fourth quarter. Overall, though, we're satisfied with the quality of our receivables.","Inventory. 9\/30 of 2012, $2.4 billion, that's an increase of approximately 4% compared to September 30 and December 31 of 2011. The increase is attributable to impact of our acquisitions thus far in 2012 and inventories are actually down slightly from both September and December, when you break the acquisitions out. Our team is doing an excellent job of managing our inventory levels and we remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move through the final quarter of 2012.","Accounts payable balance at September 30, $1.8 billion, that's up 11% from September 30 last year and up 22% from December 31. Significant increase in trade payables reflects the impact of extended payment terms and other payable initiatives that we've negotiated with our vendors. Improving our payables position has been a priority for us over the last couple of years and had a -- has a positive impact on our days and payables, with DPO up 2 days from 62 -- to 62 from 60 last year.","Working capital of $2.6 billion at September 30 is up approximately 17% -- 7% from September 30 last year as reported, but is down 3% after adding back the $250 million in current debt at September 30 of 2011, which was converted and reclassified to long-term debt in the fourth quarter of that year. Effectively managing accounts receivable and inventory payables is very important to us, and our ongoing progress with these accounts has had a tremendous impact on improving our working capital position and cash flow.","Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition. Total debt September 30, 2012, remains unchanged at $500 million. First $250 million in debt is due in November of 2013, and the debt with agreement signed in November of last year is due in November of 2016.","Total debt, total capitalization at September 30 was 14.0 and although comfortable with our capital structure, we want to remind you that back on September 11, we entered into a multicurrency syndicated credit facility agreement of $850 million. And this agreement, which carried a 5-year term and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 75 basis points, replaces a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit that was scheduled to mature this December. New facility provides us with expanding borrowing capacities to support our growth opportunities as may be needed from time to time. No amounts are borrowed under this agreement at September 30 of this year.","The company continued to generate solid cash flows and 2012 is shaping up to be another very strong year for us. We currently estimate cash from operations, $775 million to $825 million for the full year and at this level, free cash flow, after deducting CapEx and dividends, should be approximate $350 million to $400 million. Continuous strength of our cash flows is encouraging. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of this cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value.","First priority's the dividend, which we've paid every year since going public in 1948, and have increased for 56 consecutive years. The company's 2012 annual dividend of $1.98, represents a 10% increase from $1.80 paid in 2011 and represents a payout ratio of approximately 55% of our 2011 earnings per share. Our goal would be maintain this level of payout ratio going forward.","Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment capital expenditures were $20.0 million for the third quarter and that's down from $22.2 million invested in the third quarter last year. For the 9 months, CapEx totaled $71.6 million, compared to $63.9 million for the same period the prior year. We planned for this level of increase and expect our CapEx spending for the full year to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million. Vast majority of these investments will continue to be weighted toward productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology.","Appreciation and amortization, $25.6 million in the quarter, is $73.3 million for the 9 months. Both the quarter and the 9-month number's up slightly and we continue to expect D&A to be approximately $100 million to $110 million for the full year.","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. We're pleased that our investment in Exego and the Quaker City acquisition in the Automotive Group, as well as a small acquisition in the Electrical business, continue to perform as planned and are contributing nicely to our results. We remain active in seeking new acquisitions for our businesses, generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally, thus far in 2012, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 980,000 shares of our common stock under the company's share repurchase program and have another 12.6 million shares authorized and available for repurchase today. We've no set pattern for these repurchases, but expect to be active in the program over the balance of 2012, and we continue to believe our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.","In closing, we want to once again thank all of our GPC associates for their great job they're doing. They are to be commended for achieving another quarter of record sales and earnings. We're well-positioned for continued growth in our businesses. We remain optimistic in our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2012, due primarily to the many positive initiatives in place throughout our organization. As always, we'll support our growth with a strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet, further maximizing our return to shareholders.","That concludes our financial review, so I'll turn it back to Tom. Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Jerry and Paul, for the fine updates. So that's a quick overview of our third quarter results, and in looking back over the quarter, we would say that we were a bit disappointed in the sales results in each of our 4 businesses, but at the same time, they seem to be in line with the respective trends in each of the businesses. We do think that our team operated pretty well and made some good progress on the operating side of the business despite the revenue challenges, and we continue to keep the balance sheet in good shape.","Now as far as the fourth quarter is concerned, the individual sales guidance that was provided during our comments was for Automotive, Industrial and Electrical\/Electronic to each be up 6% to 8% in the quarter, and for Office Products to be in a range of down 1% to plus 1%. This would give the total company an increase of 6% to 7% for the quarter, and would put us up 5% to 6% for the year.","On the earnings side, we remain comfortable with our prior full year guidance of $4 to $4.10, with a bias toward the middle part of the range, and this would give us an EPS increase of 12% to 14% for the year. And with full year sales being up 5% to 6%, and earnings per share up 12% to 14%, we feel that 2012 will turn out to be another respectable year for the GPC team.","So that will conclude our planned comments, and we'll now turn back over to Dawn to take your questions. Dawn?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I really just want to get into the Automotive sales acceleration that you expect from the fourth quarter. If I'm doing this right, you were up around 4% on a real basis in the third quarter. And you think you'll up 6% to 8% in the fourth. What gives you the confidence there? Is there a shift in how sales are running quarter-to-date, is it acquisition, did FX -- give us a roadmap there?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Greg, this is Tom, and I think the primary difference is the fact that we were short 1 day in the third quarter, but we get that day back in the fourth quarter, so our expectation is that on a per day basis, we'll see a little bit of an uptick from what we saw in the third quarter, and then the benefit of that extra day. We're actually expecting just a bit of improvement on a day-to-day basis.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So if that day was 150 bps in the third quarter, it would be 150 bps help in the fourth quarter?","Thomas C. Gallagher","That's right.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then secondly, you mentioned on Auto, the deflation. It's been a while since we've seen deflation in that category, if I remember correctly. How should we expect that to flow through to the top line and gross margin?","Jerry W. Nix","Greg, just quickly, the last time we saw deflation in Automotive was 2009.","Thomas C. Gallagher","And in terms of the effect on top line, the levels that we're at, we're down 30 basis points year-to-date. That will be a pretty modest impact on that. If we see further deflation, obviously, it'll be a little bit of a headwind, but right now, our expectation is a very modest impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the auto sales question as well. I mean, as we think about the industry, it's -- we're getting sort of conflicting signals of, some weakness, some relative stability. Just curious what you're seeing in general, you think in the end market there. And also, really just curious if you've seen anything change in inventory in the channel. Is the inventory heavy or light and then hopefully at some point as we see a pickup, would there be sort of an inventory pull-through for your auto sales numbers?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, John, I'll take a first stab at that. One thing to keep in mind is what Paul referenced in his comments, and that's the geographic differences that we've experienced thus far this year with our cold weather operations being much more challenged than the remainder of the operations and it's a fairly significant delta in performance when we look at that. And our expectation is that delta will start to reduce some as we work our way through the fourth quarter and on into next year. In terms of what we're seeing in the end markets, what we're hearing from some of our good installer customers pretty much mirrors what we've reported in our own results, and they're talking about big [ph] counts, the traffic actually holding relatively steady, but the work orders, the value of the work orders is under a little bit of pressure, which we think is indicative of the consumer being a bit more discretionary with how they're spending their dollars currently. On the inventory side of it, we don't see any material difference in the inventory, and keep in mind, the main inventory that we would have would be at the store level, and that has, I think held pretty constant so we don't see any reduction nor do we see any opportunity for a great run-up in inventory. At the installer level, the commercial side of it, there's very little inventory that's really held and we don't think that, that's going to change one way or the other going forward. Won't have any impact.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then, Jerry, just on the new bank facility that's put in -- been put in place, you said you've -- that has now been changed to a multicurrency facility. So obviously, that would help you out with Exego or any other international acquisitions in the future. I'm just curious, is the upsizing and changing that to a multicurrency facility really just in preparation of what may happen with Exego? Are there other international acquisitions that you guys see that could be real attractive to you in the future?","Jerry W. Nix","Well, we haven't seen any of any significant size. We'd still be open to making it, if made sense, but this is primarily in preparation for the Exego transaction.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the 14% debt to cap that you're at right now obviously is \u2013 it's real solid and fairly low. I mean, would you be willing to take that up materially in the course of the Exego transaction or any other transaction?","Jerry W. Nix","Yes, we would if it made sense to maximize the shareholder value. But yes, we would -- if we do the Exego transaction, we'll definitely have to have some debt.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So are you thinking about an absolute ceiling there in the 30% to 40% range, or is it something much lower than that?","Jerry W. Nix","It's lower than 30% to 40%, but we've done a little work and it could -- if we had -- depending on our cash flow and how well we do in managing working capital, it could be in the high -- in the mid-20%, not high-20% range, so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess one of the questions I had is, l this is really another follow-up on the auto commentary. I guess, Tom, you've mentioned consumers seem to be a bit more discerning on their spending. And I know this is an opinion, but would you attribute that to weaker consumer spending trends? Maybe higher gas prices? Or do you think it's possible that consumers are potentially just doing less work, maintenance and repair work on their vehicles because they're interested in new car sales at this point?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think and again, it's just an opinion, as you said, my thought is that the consumer has a finite amount of discretionary spending, and I think part of that may have been geared more toward electronics with the new iPhone or the new iPad, or other electronic items. I think part of it might have gone to back-to-school, because it was a regionally good back-to-school season this year. I think when it comes to the Automotive, what we're seeing and what we're being told is that the repair that's absolutely critical, or anything that affects drivability, they're in fact getting done, but then their bias is to try to do it for the least amount of money possible, so if we look at our good, better, best product outflow, we see strong performance in the good and better categories and less strong performance in the best product category. And then we also see if there are multiple things that need to be worked on, or should be worked on, on the vehicle, if it's not critical, we're seeing deferral on some of that. And we've some of this at times in the past, and at least in the past, what we've seen happen is there is a point in time when some of this maintenance that's been deferred winds up coming back into the aftermarket, and we all have an opportunity to benefit from that.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But have you seen that kind of reaction or behavior on the part of consumers, let's call it any in the last 4 years?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, what we've seen going back to 2008 and '09 is we saw very significant evidence of deferral of the some of the items that needed to be purchased, and we came back with strong overall industry results and good positive results for GPC in '10 and '11. There is a question out there, and you alluded to it and that is, what's the impact of the increased vehicle sales this year, and depending upon whose number, I guess, it'll be something, let's call it $14.5 million. If you look back to 2004 through 2007, we had anywhere from $16.1 million to, I think it was $16.9 million in new car sales. And all of those years were really good years for the aftermarket. So we had a higher rate of new car sales on a base that's about the same as what it is today, and the new car dealers benefited and the aftermarket performed well in that period of time. Then we went into the recession and we saw new car sales go down, aftermarket went down and the aftermarket has come back well in '10 and '11. We see some of the geographic diversity that we see right now in 2012 and some of the consumer spending patterns that we think we're living through, but the fundamentals, as Paul pointed out, the fundamentals are still generally positive and favorable and we'll see this thing come back to a more normal state, I think, as the quarters progress.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. And then just a quickie. Jerry, what was the size of the retirement plan adjustment?","Jerry W. Nix","About $4.5 million, $5 million. The one positive about it was a negative adjustment in the third quarter of last year, and it was a positive adjustment and the pickup this quarter was $3 million, but we had a swing compared to the third quarter of last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'll stick with the auto thread here. You talked about September being better on a per day basis. Was that true versus July, as well as August? And is there anything that you saw on the regional side or the category side that could either support or refute the weather thesis?","Paul D. Donahue","Chris, this is Paul. I would just tell you that our September same-store business was low to mid-single-digit year-over-year. So we did see a nice lift in September. And that was across most of our divisions. So even those divisions that -- those cold weather divisions that we mentioned, the Central part of the country, Midwest and Northeast saw a bit of a lift in September as well. So we're encouraged, and I would tell you that back to a question that Scot asked, when you look at some of the things happening in the economy, consumer confidence does seem to be growing somewhat, at least that's what was reported in September and housing starts are moving in the right direction. So there is -- there does seem to be a bit of optimism out here that we haven't seen in a while.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that low to mid-single-digit per day compares to the 4% adjusted for the quarter -- for the third quarter?","Paul D. Donahue","Correct.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so a little bit. So maybe if that was 4%, so maybe a little bit better than 4%, is what you're trying to say, right?","Paul D. Donahue","We'll stick with the low to mid-single digit there, Chris.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And I was just curious, on the brakes side of the business, I think, as a consumer I can understand batteries not failing because the cold and wipers, perhaps as well. I mean, what's your view on the brake business, whether that -- is that a macro thing? Or is that a weather thing, because our understanding is, brakes are pretty tough, so will the weather actually result in improved sales in that category?","Paul D. Donahue","The brake business, as we understand it, Chris, it's been a challenge for us. We've down low single digits for the year, and it is geographical. Certainly, in those northern territories, we have seen more of a decline in our brake business and we do believe that's weather-related. And we do believe it's across the industry as well.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally on the Industrial side, you talk about some haves and have-nots in terms of the category. Is there anything changing in terms of some of the weaker categories, some of that trend throughout the quarter?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, the 3 that I highlighted, we saw a decelerating trend sequentially from Q1 through Q3. I can't give you the specifics about the month sequence. In terms of any changes, we are seeing evidence that some of the housing-related industries have picked up just a little bit, as Paul mentioned, housing starts have gone up. Some of the plywood mills are opening back up or increasing production, so hopefully, that's something that will sustain in the quarters ahead. Where we see some weakness is where some of these companies are larger exporters and some of what's happening in the global economy is starting to have an impact on their North American production.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then one final one, just have you seen anything in terms of a drought impact in terms of some of your Ag customers?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Absolutely, absolutely. So if you go into the farm communities, you see some real impact there. So that's had an impact both in Automotive, as well as in our Industrial business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Follow-up question on your comments about September being the best since March. Within that, and I think it was partially addressed earlier, do you see an improvement in the maintenance category in that trend as well? It seems that Maintenance has underperformed, failure industry-wide, but are you seeing some improving demand in what had been lagging categories?","Paul D. Donahue","Some modest improvement there, yes.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, regionally, and it's tough to look at it, you said about 1\/3 of your business was in the geographically more challenged markets. And could you sort of break out the relative delta on that performance? Or maybe a way to look at it without doing that would be to give us some idea of the comp, maybe for Quaker City year-over-year? I mean you didn't own it last year, but if you could -- was it a positive comp or do we actually slide negative in some of these Eastern and East -- North Central markets?","Paul D. Donahue","Well, I'll take the first part of that, Bret. The northern divisions that we mentioned, their comps are running low to mid-single-digit down, year-over-year. The balance of our business, which is 6 divisions comprising the West, Southwest, Southern, is up mid-single -- low to mid-single digits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Vigneau with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Matt Fassler, along with Matt Vigneau. A couple questions here. First of all, as you think about the underlying run rate, adjusted for days, I want to confirm that the acquisition probably contributed a bit more this quarter than it did at the last quarter, when you only had it in place for a partial period. Is that the right way to think about it?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Yes, that's right. We had 2 months in the prior quarter, 3 months this quarter.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So it's only 1 month difference, so a fairly small difference. And when you talk about the -- September being the best year-on-year performance that you had since March, is that including or excluding the impact of the acquisition?","Thomas C. Gallagher","In both cases. On a per day basis, if we look at average daily sales volume for the month of September, the ongoing operations had a record as did the -- with the Quaker City, but in Quaker City, we had a very strong performance in September.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then secondly, the Industrial -- there's been a lot of focus on the fourth quarter guidance for Automotive. I want to look for a moment in Industrial, with I guess 2 questions, interrelated. The first is that, there seems to have been some disconnect between the macro factors that you used to project your business and the revenue growth that you reported. And then, if you could correct me if I'm wrong, whether the extra day kind of hits Industrial similarly to the way it does Automotive, such that x the day hit, you would have been close to 6%, and the acceleration you expect is not that substantial?","Paul D. Donahue","The -- we were, on a per day basis, we were up 6.1% in the quarter, on a per day basis.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in terms of the micro versus macro, your numbers and your experience sequentially, versus some of the macro indicators still looking good, and your expectation that the third quarter represents kind of the lower bounds of performance. Any insights that you have either, trends through the quarter, quarter to date, that give you the confidence for that pick up?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we're too early in this quarter to try to comment on any trends, but some of the industries that we service, the industry segments are very strong right now. I mentioned Automotive as a for instance, we're benefiting from the strength in the new car sales, the improvement that we're seeing there. The thing we don't know is, what the impact is going to be for some of the companies or segments that are a little bit more export-dependent because we have seen deceleration there, coal would be an example, and primarily the Eastern coal has been really hard hit over the last couple of quarters, and we don't know that it's going to come back this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli & Company.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Just want to spend a little bit more time on the operating profit in motion, with sales up $50 million, but operating profit off by $2.5 million. I know you called out some puts and takes there, but maybe just spend another minute going through how you can see -- how you see that operating profit moving through the fourth quarter, maybe early into next year?","Jerry W. Nix","Brian, this is Jerry. If you look, and Industrial business was 8% -- up 8% in sales in the second quarter and ending up 4.5% here in the third quarter, and so we're not going to build inventory to get incentive. And so we took in less incentives in the third quarter as we had through the 6 months and last time we did, last year we're basically down slightly in incentives this third quarter compared to 2011. So both of those contribute to that slowing in that growth and the operating margin in the quarter. But if you look for the 9 months, they're still doing a good job with their operating margin, they're still up 20 basis points, and we would expect to see that kind of improvement for the year.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And just going to the multicurrency facility again. You've talked about Exego as a good opportunity on a kind of a go-forward basis, and owning the 30% is kind of putting the balloon out there to see if you like the business or not. With the multicurrency facility happening this early, would it be appropriate to say that you're more than pleased with how Exego had gone this far?","Jerry W. Nix","Yes, we're more than pleased with how it's gone thus far, but just because we did this facility at -- we had a facility of $350 million, facility expiring in December. We went ahead and got this out of the way and we can -- it's a 5-year facility. So we can do it at this quarter, we can do it in 5 quarters, at whatever period. We just took -- put that in there to be in a position to do whatever we needed to do.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And just along those lines with the idea that Exego may not happen for a while, given where the stock is, given where the cash balance is and given some decent visibility on some improvement that you expect for Auto on a seasonal basis next year, why wouldn't you become more aggressive on a -- to repurchase shares at this time?","Jerry W. Nix","There's no reason. And you may see that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Gober with Morgan Stanley.","Shaun Kolnick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Shaun Kolnick on for Dave. Are you seeing anything different in the competitive environment when it comes to auto parts from 3Q, maybe to 2Q?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I don't think we could say that we've seen it in that short a period. What we're experiencing right now is what we go through periodically, and that is when business slows up somewhat, the competitive environment increases somewhat. So it's a fairly normal pattern that we experience at times like these, and this particular pattern is very consistent with what we've seen in past times.","Shaun Kolnick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one more on the AP to inventory side. You had a pretty nice quarter, up about 400 basis points. Do you have any idea of how much further progress you might be able to make there?","Jerry W. Nix","We can continue to make progress. It's a difficult thing to tell you how much progress we can make. We're going to continue work with our vendors in negotiating terms, prices and everything. That's just an ongoing priority for us. Really don't have a number that I can give you that we're going we try for or try to reach, but you'll see continued improvement there, I think.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to jump back to Industrial. As you talk to your customers, and I know you guys have staff [ph] in the top 10 industries and what they're in [ph] the quarter, what are they looking at in terms of their pace of business over the next 3 to 6 months? Is it accelerating, decelerating or are they just uncertain?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think uncertainty would be more the answer and it's more because of the external uncertainty. So there are people out there that are sitting, waiting to make some capital expenditure decisions dependent upon how things develop over the next quarter or so. So right now, it's a little hard to answer that specifically, Keith, but that's what we're hearing from customer set.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Is that due to Europe, or things more domestic?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think it's a combination of both, honestly. Obviously, the domestic thing is more immediate, with the election and then the fiscal cliff that may loom out there, but then there's also a number of these companies that are dependent upon some demand in Europe that are bit uncertain as to what's going to happen there. But that plays out more over a medium to longer term, we think.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Efraim Levy with S&P Capital IQ.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","In the release you mentioned gains in certain industries, which ones were the gainers and what were the drivers of those gains?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I'm sorry, can you repeat that? You broke up on us.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","Sure. You mentioned that there were -- in the press release, that there were certain gains in certain industries you gained market share. Which ones were the ones where you gained market share, and what were the drivers of those gains?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, I would say that if we look across the 4 businesses, we've performed, at a minimum in line with the performance of the overall industries and perhaps we gained a little bit in each of the industries. And if you look at Automotive as a for instance, I think that if we look at the publicly traded companies in the aggregate, the performance of each of the companies would suggest that we might be gaining, as a group, a bit at the expense of the non-publicly traded companies as a general statement. Then in terms of the other businesses, we just have to look at our performance directly with our publicly traded competitors and see how they stack up. But I think overall, our teams are doing a pretty good job of holding their own at a minimum and maybe improving their position in a few cases.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","You'd say it's largely execution driven, nothing\u2026","Thomas C. Gallagher","That's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Rakers with Wunderlich Securities.","Anjali R. Voria - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","This is Anjali Voria in for Brent Rakers. I know you talked a little bit about the Office op margin lift that you saw in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit further, maybe give a little bit more clarity on that side of the equation, especially when you're seeing growth from independents flowing? I'm trying to assess where that list is coming from. And then also, as a follow-up, do you think you'll see that typical lift in Q4 on both the Office and Motion side, please?","Jerry W. Nix","I don't think you're going to see a continued lift in the margins at the Office Parts side. Where that's coming from is not in the gross margin side of things, it's coming in the expense reduction and infrastructure costs adjustments that they're making there. They've been in a depressed sales environment for some time, and the management team there is doing a good job of taking their cost out and they're going to continue to focus on taking further cost out until they see revenue recovery. But I don't -- you're not going to continue to see movement up in it, but I think it -- we would be pleased, really if the Office Products side would just continue to hold their margin. They were 7.6% for the 9 months, and we would expect them to maintain that for the full year. In the Industrial side, we were up 20 basis points for the 9 months, and there's no reason to think that they can't maintain that for the full year, but that's going to be dependent upon what kind of revenue growth they get, and I'm sure that they'll do a good job leveraging their expenses off of that revenue growth.","Operator","Your final question is a follow-up question from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On these sales again, in Auto, I just want to make sure that the up low to mid-single digits, that compares to the 1% same-store sales in the quarter or to the overall sales?","Jerry W. Nix","Greg, we're going to have to dance around that question. We -- what we'll have to do is research that and get you an answer, if you don't mind, Sid or I will work back with you on that one.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then, I guess, another one, sort of a straightforward about the quarter is, how much did FX hurt and how much did Quaker City help?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we haven't given those out specifically, but if we net the impact of Quaker City against the 1 less day and the negative in FX, net-net, it had a 1% positive for us in the quarter.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back over to the presenters for any closing remarks.","Jerry W. Nix","Dawn, thank you. We appreciate each of you joining us on the call today, and we appreciate your continued interest in and support of Genuine Parts Company. We look forward with talking with you in future, if not before then certainly, when we report our fourth quarter and year-end results in February.

[Operator Instructions]","Ms. Carol Yancey, Senior Vice President of Finance, you may begin your conference.","Carol B. Yancey","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call, where we will discuss our results and the outlook for the remainder of 2012.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Carol, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Paul Donahue, our President; and I will each handle a portion of today's call. And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.","Earlier this morning, we released our second quarter 2012 results, and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3,338,000,000, which was up 5%. Net income was $168.6 million, which was up 11%. And earnings per share were $1.08 this year compared to $0.96 last year, and the EPS increase was 12.5%.","So although we did see some moderation in the rate of revenue growth from the first to second quarters, which we will discuss more in a few minutes, we think that our team did a good job on the operating side of the business in leveraging the 5% sales increase to an 11% increase in net income, and we're pleased to report another solid quarter.","A review of the results by business segment shows that our strongest sales results continue to come from our Industrial and Electrical\/Electronic segments. Motion Industries is our industrial distribution company, and they were up 8% in the quarter. This follows a 12% increase in Q1, so we did see some deceleration in the growth rate. But as a point of information, the 8% increase this quarter is on top of a 19% increase in the second quarter of last year, making for a challenging comparison. But in our opinion, they handled it well, and they came through the quarter in good shape.","A review of the Industrial results in a bit more detail shows that the top 12 product categories were up 11% in the quarter and then the top 10 industry segments were up 8%, and the top 20 customers had a combined 15% increase. So from a product category, industry segment and customer perspective, the results continue to show good balance in the quarter with solid contributions from each of these 3 areas.","Through the first 6 months of the year, our Industrial sales are running 10% ahead, and we feel good about their prospects for the second half. While we did see some moderation in the May industrial production and capacity utilization indices, the June figures released earlier this week showed some improvement and the individual indices remain at historically healthy levels. This, combined with some strong internal growth initiatives, caused us to remain optimistic about our Industrial business for the remainder of the year.","Moving on to the Electrical\/Electronic segment, EIS was up 9% in the quarter. This follows a 5% increase in the first quarter, so we did see some nice sequential improvement in this business, which is encouraging. Our wire and cable segment is enjoying the strongest growth, while the Electrical and Electronics segments are more challenged. Our biggest revenue issues in the Electrical and Electronic businesses are with sales into the solar and electronic contract manufacturing customer segments. Both of these industries have experienced significant slowdowns over the past several quarters. But even with that said, our top 25 Electrical and Electronic customers were up 9% in the quarter. This would indicate healthy conditions in other customer segments, which was a big help to our overall results.","Through midyear, our Electrical\/Electronic business is running 7% ahead, and we feel good about the progress that they're making. With that said, however, the June Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers' Index fell below 50 for the first time in 3 years, signaling a slowdown in the overall activity in the industry, and we will be watching this closely in the coming months while at the same time working hard toward gaining additional market share going into the second half of the year.","Our Office Products business was down 1% in the quarter. This follows a 2% decrease in the first quarter, so it's been a challenging first half for our Office Products team. And looking at the results in a bit more detail, we were pleased to see that our business with the Mega Channel was up 3% in the quarter, following a 1% increase in the first quarter. But then this was offset by a 2% decrease in the quarter with the independent office products resellers group.","On the product side, the cleaning and break room supplies category grew at high-single digits, and we continue to make good progress in this area. Furniture was flat, and then the office supplies and technology categories reached down low-single digits in the quarter.","So clearly, conditions in the office products industry remain challenging, and were down just over 1% through the first 6 months of the year. And then looking ahead, we don't expect any material change in the overall industry conditions in the second half of the year, but we do feel that our office products team is in a position to show modest improvements in their results over the final 2 quarters.","So that's a quick overview of the non-automotive segments. And at this point, we'll ask Paul to comment on the automotive operations. Paul?","Paul D. Donahue","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and I'd like to add my welcome to each of you. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to review the second quarter performance of our Automotive business.","As most of you know, this is our largest segment, and we ended the second quarter with sales up 4%. Our recent acquisition, Quaker City Motor Parts, contributed approximately 3% growth while our same-store sales added approximately 2%, while currency exchange cost us 1%. This follows a 6% sales increase in the first quarter of this year.","For the 6 months ended June 30, our Automotive business is up 5% over the same period in 2011. So we remain encouraged by the underlying long-term fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket, and we feel we'll continue to benefit from the solid growth opportunities well into the future.","The aging vehicle population now reported to be on average 11 years old and specifically, the growth in the number of older vehicles bodes well for all of us in the industry. We believe we are well positioned to capture our share of the increase in demand generated by this positive trend.","So as we take a look and further analyze our second quarter results, we clearly experienced a deceleration in business over the last few months. As several of our competitors have already reported, April sales appeared to slow due to the mild winter temperatures and the possible pull forward of demand into March. In hindsight, this may help explain the strong 6% retail sales increase we reported in the first quarter.","The slowdown in sales continued into the month of May before it's showing some improvement in June. So we experienced a challenging couple of months, and we were very pleased to see a more positive sales trend in June.","Turning to Quaker City, we are very excited about our acquisition of Quaker City Motor Parts and its accretive impact to our overall automotive results. Just as a reminder, Quaker City Motor Parts is a long-standing NAPA distributor and was the last non-GPC NAPA member prior to the acquisition. They're headquartered in Middletown, Delaware and service approximately 270 NAPA auto parts stores, primarily in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. Their second quarter sales contribution was in line with our expectations, and we remain very encouraged by the opportunities that Quaker City will continue to provide to us in the future.","Turning to the results for our company-owned store group. In the quarter, our commercial business outperformed our retail business although both businesses experienced softer sales in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.","Turning to our retail business first, the quarter ended down 2%, and this follows a 6% increase in the first quarter. Our average dollar value per invoice was up for the quarter, but the total number of retail tickets was actually down. As I mentioned earlier, the overall sales decline likely reflects the pull forward of revenues into the first quarter. However, we would also say that we are not immune to the overall slowdown in U.S. retail sales as reported earlier this week. We had experienced 1% retail growth in 2011. And at this point, it would appear we should expect to see similar growth throughout the balance of this year.","Now let's take a look at our commercial business. Sales in our company-owned store group ended up the quarter at plus 3%. Our wholesale dollars per invoice were up, but our overall ticket count was flat.","So the slowing in April and May impacted both our retail and commercial business, and this is reflected in both our NAPA AutoCare and major account business. We had consistently reported double-digit sales growth for the past several years in these 2 important commercial initiatives, and sales for these 2 customer groups were up mid-single digits in the second quarter, still solid growth but slower than what we have seen in recent periods.","Turning to our fleet business. We were up 1% in the second quarter, which is down from mid-single digit growth in the first quarter and the trends we saw throughout 2011.","So in summary, demand in the automotive aftermarket slowed in April and May but then began to show some improvement in June. We expect the June trend combined with our ongoing initiatives and the underlying positive factors for the automotive aftermarket to support continued growth for our Automotive business over the balance of 2012.","So that completes our overview of the Automotive business in the second quarter. And at this time, I'll hand it over to Jerry for a review of the financial results. Jerry?","Jerry W. Nix","Thank you, Paul. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the second quarter and 6-month income statements and segment information then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, and then we'll open the call up to your questions.","Review of the income statement shows the following: Total sales had a record half $3.3 billion for the second quarter, an increase of 5% from last year. For the 6 months, total sales $6.5 billion, up 6% from 2011. We're proud of our team for reaching this new sales level, especially in a tough sales environment we experienced in the quarter. And we remain focused on achieving continued steady and consistent sales growth over the balance of this year and beyond.","Gross profit for the second quarter 29.1% of sales, that's up from 28.8% in the second quarter of 2011. And for the 6 months, gross margin 29.0% is up from 28.7% for the same period last year. We've made solid progress on improving our gross margin over the last few quarters and attribute this improvement to our ongoing initiatives to effectively manage supply chain cost, increase distribution efficiencies and maximizing our pricing potential.","Our gross margins have also benefited from incremental sales at incremental levels of vendor incentives over the last several periods, and we expect to generate continued gross margin expansion on a year-over-year basis for the remaining 2 quarters of this year. Our management teams across all of our businesses are committed to this effort.","For the year, our cumulative pricing, which represents supplier changes to us, as Automotive is flat through 6 months, Industrial is up 0.7%, Office Products up 2.6%, and the Electrical Group is a negative 0.2%.","Turning to SG&A. Total expenses $705 million in the second quarter, that's up 4.5% from 2011 and at 21.1% of sales versus 21.2% in the second quarter last year. And for the 6 months, total SG&A expenses are $1.4 billion, and that's up 4.8% at 21.4% of total sales compared to 21.6% for the same 6 months in 2011.","Throughout our organization, we're very focused on controlling our expenses and attribute our steady improvement in this area to the combined benefits of greater leverage associated with our sales growth and ongoing measures to control cost. For the last few years, we've benefited from cost-saving initiatives in several areas, including warehouse and infrastructure, freight and utilities among others, and our cost savings also reflect the positive impact of our investments in technology over the last several years.","Our management teams understand that tightly controlling our expenses is an ongoing priority for us and we'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as we move through the year.","Now let's discuss the results by segment. Automotive had revenue in the quarter of $1,644,900,000, representing 49% of the total, up 4%. They had operating profit of $153.0 million, up 10%, so a very strong margin expansion there from 8.8% to 9.3%.","The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter of $1,138,700,000, representing 34% of the total and up 8%. They had operating profit of $95.1 million, up 11%, so a nice margin improvement from 8.1% to 8.3%.","The Office Products Group had revenue in the quarter of $413.3 million. That represents 12% of the total and is down 1%. They had operating profit of $30.6 million and down 2%, so a good job there on the negative 1% sales to hold margins at 7.4%.","The Electrical group had revenue in the quarter of $149.4 million, 5% of the total and up 9%. They had operating profit of $12.9 million, up 41%, so outstanding margin expansion there going from 6.7% to 8.7%.","For the 6 months, Automotive had revenue 3.138 -- $3,138,400,000, up 5%; operating profit $267.5 million, up 13%. So as mentioned earlier, March is very strong at 8.5%.","Industrial Group had revenue for the 6 months $2,259,900,000. That's up 10%. Operating profit $179.4 million and that's up 19%, so a nice 50-basis point improvement there to 7.9% operating margin.","Office Products had revenue for the 6 months $839.5 million, down 1%. Operating profit of $68.1 million, also down 1%, so a good job of maintaining their margins at 8.1%.","The Electrical Group had revenue for the 6 months $296.6 million, and that's up 7%. Operating profit $24.9 million, up 29%, so again, for the 6 months adjusted for the quarter, outstanding margin improvement to 8.4%.","Total operating profit increased by 10% in the second quarter, and operating profit margin improved 40 basis points to 8.7% from 8.3% in the second quarter of last year. This brought us a 70-basis point improvement in total operating margin in the first quarter this year. And for the 6 months, total operating margin of 8.3% is up 60 basis points from 7.7% last year. We're very pleased with this level of margin expansion and expect to show continued year-over-year operating margin expansion over the following 2 quarters of the year. That growth in our operating earnings was driven by the sales growth, higher gross margins and positive expense leverage.","We had net interest expense of $5.0 million and $9.7 million for the second quarter and 6 months, respectively. This expense is down from 2011 due mainly to the low interest rate on our $250 million debt facility that we refunded that was renegotiated in November of last year. We'll discuss our debt position later, but we currently expect that net interest expense to be approximately $20 million to $22 million for the year.","Other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and non-controlling interest, was $19.3 million expense in the quarter and is $34.7 million for the 6 months through June. This was up from last year for both the quarter and year due primarily to the increase in amortization expense and increased cost for legal and professional services. We continue to project the total other category to be in the $60 million to $70 million range, which will be consistent with the prior year.","For the quarter, tax rate approximately 36.9%, which is slightly favorable to the second quarter in 2011. Now for the 6 months, the 36.5% rate compares to 35.8% for the same period last year. Primarily the increase in the 6 months rate is related to a favorable adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2011 that was associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations related to international taxes. We continue to expect our full year tax rate for 2012 to be approximately 36.5% to 37.0%.","Net income for the quarter $168.6 million, up 11%; EPS $1.08 compared to $0.96 last year, up 12.5%. For the year through June, net income $314.9 million, up 13%, and EPS of $2.01 compared to $1.76 last year, up 14%.","Second quarter was a record level of earnings for us, and we want to recognize all of our associates at Genuine Parts Company for working hard every day to achieve this milestone. We're proud of their accomplishment.","Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at June 30, $172 million and it remains strong although it's down from over $500 million in June last year and December 31, 2011. Decrease in cash primarily reflects the more than $500 million used for several investing activities this year, including the January 1 investment in Exego, a leading automotive distribution company in Australia and New Zealand; the Electrical Group's Light Fab acquisition on February 1; and Automotive's Quaker City acquisition that closed on May 1.","In addition, cash was used in the first half of the year to pay for the 10% increase in dividend, capital expenditures and share repurchases. These significant uses of cash were partially offset by the increase in earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions. And we're comfortable with our cash position at June 30.","Accounts receivable $1.61 billion at June 30 increased 2.5% from June 30 last year on a 5% sales increase for the second quarter, which is in line with our goal of growing receivables at a rate less than revenue growth. We also remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables and will continue to emphasize this level of performance over the balance of the year.","Inventory at 6\/30 was $2.33 billion, an increase of approximately 4% compared to June 30 last year and up 3% from December 31. This increase is attributable to the impact of our acquisitions thus far in 2012, and inventory is actually down slightly from both June and December when you break out the acquisitions. We continue to believe that our team is doing an excellent job of managing our inventory levels. We'll remain focused on this key investment as we move through 2012.","Accounts payable balance June 30 was $1.60 billion, and that's up 7% from June 30 last year and up 11% from December 31. Increase in trade payables reflects the impact of extended payment terms and other payable initiatives negotiated with our vendors. Improving our payables position has been a priority for us over the last few years and has had a positive impact on our DPO. We remain pleased with our progress in managing this important working capital account.","Working capital $2.45 billion at June 30 is down 3% from June 30 last year as reported and is down 12% after adding back the $250 million in current debt at June 30, 2011, which was converted and reclassified to long-term data in the fourth quarter of last year. Effectively managing our accounts receivable and inventory and payables is very important to us and our ongoing progress with these accounts has had a tremendous impact on improving our working capital position, and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition.","Total debt at June 30, 2012, remains unchanged at $500 million. First $250 million in debt is due in November of 2013, and the debt for the agreement that was signed in November last year is due in November of 2016. Total debt to total capitalization at June 30 is 14.6%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time.","We continue to generate solid cash flow and expect another a very strong year in 2012. We currently estimate cash from operations of approximately $750 million to $800 million for the year. And at this level, free cash flow after you deduct capital expenditures and dividends should be approximately $350 million to $400 million. We're very pleased by the continuous strength of our cash flows and remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority is the dividend, which we've paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 56 consecutive years. The company's 2012 annual dividend of $1.98 per share represents a 10% increase from $1.80 paid in 2011 and represents a payout ratio of approximately 55% of our 2011 EPS. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward.","Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment in capital expenditures, $34.5 million for the second quarter, is up from $27.2 million invested in the second quarter last year.","And for the 6 months, CapEx totaled $51.4 million compared to $41.7 million for the same period in 2011. We had planned for this level of increase and continue to expect that CapEx spending for the full year to be in a range of $110 million to $125 million. The vast majority of these investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects, primarily in technology.","Depreciation and amortization, $24.7 million in the quarter and $47.7 million for the 6 months. Both the quarter and the 6-month numbers are up slightly, and we expect D&A to be approximately $100 million to $110 million for the full year.","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. Thus far, in 2012, Automotive's investment in Exego and the Quaker City acquisition, as well as the small acquisition in the Electrical business as previously mentioned, are performing as planned and contributing nicely to our results.","Looking forward, we anticipate additional opportunities for acquisitions over the balance of 2012, and we remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy. Generally, we target those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally, in the second quarter, we used our cash to purchase just over 900,000 shares of our common stock under the company share repurchase program and have another 12.6 million shares authorized and available for repurchase today. I have no set pattern for these repurchases but expect to be active in the program over the balance 2012 as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.","In closing, we want to once again thank all of our GPC associates for their hard work and dedication. We're extremely proud of the company's record-setting sales and earnings achieved in the second quarter, and we look forward to reporting more growth in the quarters ahead. Despite some uncertainty in the economy, which we expect to persist for most of this year, we remain encouraged by the many positive initiatives in place throughout our organization that will help support our ongoing growth.","And that concludes our financial review, so I'll turn it back to Tom.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Jerry and Paul. So that's a recap of our second quarter results. And as said at the outset, although we did see some deceleration in our overall revenue growth, we feel that our team operated well with sales up 5%, net income up 11%, operating profit up 10% and operating margin improvement of 40 basis points. And as Jerry just covered, good work was done on the balance sheet side as well in the areas of inventory, accounts receivable, payables and working capital.","So from an overall perspective, we feel that we had a reasonably good performance in the second quarter. And with revenue up 6% for the first half and earnings per share up 14%, we're positioned to have another good year in 2012.","Now as far as the full year outlook is concerned, our expectation at this time for the full year is that Automotive will end the year with 5% to 7% revenue increase, Industrial will be up 8% to 10%, Office Products will be between down 1% and up 1% and the Electrical\/Electronic will be up 6% to 8%. And in total, this would give GPC a combined revenue increase of 6% to 8% for the year.","On the earnings side, our prior guidance was for earnings per share to be in the $3.93 to $4.05 range. At this point, we feel that an expectation of $4 to $4.10 is appropriate. This includes the recently completed Quaker City acquisition, and it would give us an EPS increase of 12% to 15% for the year.","So that will conclude our prepared remarks. And at this point, we'd like to address your questions, and we'll turn the call back over to Amy.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just want to dig in on the Auto business a little bit more. Is it fair to say that the -- and the x Quaker sales were up in the 2% to 3% range in June, and there's been a lot of discussion around the heat here in July. Have you seen any further acceleration due potentially to parts failure due to the heatwave?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Chris, I'll try to answer that. The June results were the strongest in the quarter, as Paul mentioned, and I think your range is close. As far as any impact from the heat, we did see a little bit in the very end of the month of June, and then we think we see some further impact in the early reports in July. I might also tell you anecdotally that in talking with a number of our really good commercial accounts, they saw the same pattern in the quarter that we saw in the early part of July. The indication we're getting from them is that the big account is stronger, and they're seeing a little bit of a pickup in their business, which I think is probably reflected in our business as well.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I don't know if there is a good way for you to answer this but any thoughts you have would be appreciated. O'Reilly talked about weakness in June, and that's different from how you describe the pattern to your quarter. Is there something about maybe the quarter end or geographic that would account for that?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I don't think we can really answer that. I think we'll just -- we'll all have to look at what happens over the next 90 days or so.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of guidance, Quaker for the back half will add about, what, maybe 400 basis points to revenue growth in the Auto division?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, that's high. That's high. It will be closer to 250 to 300 basis points.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wasn't it about 3% for this quarter. I mean, you only had 2 months of the quarter.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Yes, it will be closer to 300 basis point for the second half, we think.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then final question. In terms of Industrial, the deceleration from 1Q to 2Q, can you speak to any inter-quarter trends or maybe July trends that you see there?","Thomas C. Gallagher","In terms of the quarterly trends, the numbers were pretty consistent on a per day basis as we worked our way through the quarter, so we didn't see much fluctuation at all. Yes, we did have deceleration but we also -- as I mentioned in the comments, we were going up against a very strong quarter last year, when we were up 19%. So at this point, we guided to 8% to 10% for the full year. And I think we're pretty comfortable with that guidance, which would indicate that our revenues will hold pretty steady over the remainder of the year. And keep in mind, we were up 19% in revenue in this business last year as well, so the comps continue to be challenging.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mario Gabelli with Gabelli & Company.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Those previous questions were right on the Quaker state so I understand this. What are the revenues from the day you acquired for the first 12 months, so make my life easier, Jerry?","Jerry W. Nix","Well, they've gone -- they average about $300 million on an annual basis.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","And secondly, what date did it close again?","Jerry W. Nix","May 1.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","And how much cash was out for that because I don't have the Q?","Jerry W. Nix","No, Mario, we haven't given that out.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","All right, that's fine. I'll figure it out, Jerry...","Jerry W. Nix","I know you will but...","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","No, the analyst, Colin [ph], is on vacation so -- actually, Brian is. How many actual shares are outstanding when I get the Q on the cover?","Thomas C. Gallagher","156...","Jerry W. Nix","156.8 million.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","So that's higher than the average? No, I got you. 156.8 million was the weighted average for the 6 months. I'm just looking at actual...","Jerry W. Nix","We will get back later with that when we find that.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","No, no problem. When you say legal and professionals fees were stepped up during the quarter, is that aborted deal fees or is that just looking at other acquisitions that didn't get capitalized or how does that ...","Jerry W. Nix","It's a combination of those -- our legal fees in some of the claims are there, but if there's a lot of these legal fees that are associated with these acquisitions and some other acquisitions we may have looked at and not done. And so there's nothing to set up.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Yes, okay. Got you. Now ...","Thomas C. Gallagher","Mario, going back -- excuse me, Mario, but going back to your prior question, there are 155.1 million shares outstanding currently.","Jerry W. Nix","Actual.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Tom, you and I are getting to have to report back to individuals, so I have to do that. One minor philosophical question. Both Romney, that's running for President, and what's the guy's name -- Obama are both talking about a decline in the corporate tax rate. Jerry, you gave a tax rate. Is that the same as your cash tax rate, the 36.5%, 37%?","Jerry W. Nix","Yes. In our case, it's pretty close.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","So if they were talking about a decline in the corporate cash tax rate down to 25%, 28%, at some point, I got to look at what the givebacks are in the proposal. So that would have an incremental increase. Are there any other elements in your deferred tax account or anything else that we're doing that I should be sensitive about and looking at what if, in fact, they implement this program?","Jerry W. Nix","Not that I'm aware of. Now keep in mind, one of the proposals at one point was that they do away with LIFO.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Yes, that would be nice. That would help your earnings.","Jerry W. Nix","Yes, but it will also cost us some cash.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Such is life. And they also did MAP-21. And I don't want to get into MAP-21 on this call, so I'll do it off-line on that in terms of the implications for your pension expense in cash, okay, defined benefits and whatever.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Liz Lane on for John Murphy. You guys had a very strong operating margin in the Automotive segment, and it looks like it was the highest it's been since about 2002. Can you go through what some of the factors at work were and should we expect that kind of strength to continue?","Jerry W. Nix","Yes. I don't know that we can expect that strength to continue, but there are a number of things that happened there. And we've taken a lot of costs out of our Automotive operations back during the recession. Those costs have not been added back in as revenue has grown. And we also -- a part of that is we picked up some profit from the Quaker City sales that were not in the prior year numbers. I would tell you though that the Exego acquisition that we have is not included in our Automotive numbers. It's included in corporate, that minority interest, the 30% that we pick up there. So it's not in the Automotive number, but just basically a good job of operating to get those back up to 9.3% in the second quarter. But I think more realistic number would be the 8.5% that we have achieved for the 6 months.","Elizabeth Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And actually you touched on something I was going to ask about too, which was on Exego. Can you give an update on how it's been performing relative to your benchmarks and does that income from -- so it doesn't -- does that income from Exego get baked into your $60 million to $70 million estimates on the other net line in 2012 or does that estimate exclude the minority interest?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I'll take them in reverse order. It is baked into the $60 million to $70 million. And then in terms of their performance, they're performing pretty much as they said they would and in line with our expectations, so we're pleased with what's happening there right now.","Elizabeth Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And I just have one more, which is on Office Products. I mean, it looks that segment is still struggling from both a volume and margin perspective. Are there any initiatives that you can discuss that, that company is taking internally to try to boost that business or is it just at the mercy of the economic environment and high unemployment rate for the near term?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we would not discuss specific initiatives on the call, but we can tell you that there are certain actions that are being taken to try to capture additional share in what is really a very challenging marketplace. We are dependent upon job creation, reduction in office vacancies and just the general overall improvement in the economy. But we have some very specific revenue initiatives that we hope will give us a little tiny bit of lift as we work our way through the remainder of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'd like to start off by just asking about the guidance and any changes from Q1 to Q2. Just to clarify when you guided both overall EPS and revenue at the end of Q1, did that include the Quaker acquisition?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think what we said, Matt, is we gave you 2 sets of numbers, one without and one with. I believe that's right. And what we're trying to do is clear up any confusion. So what guidance we've given you this time of $4 to $4.10 would include Quaker and going forward, we'll only give you one set of numbers.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And the 5% to 7% Automotive, was that inclusive of Quaker prior to today?","Thomas C. Gallagher","It's inclusive of Quaker as of today. I'm not -- I don't recall what we said the last quarter.","Jerry W. Nix","No, it was not in the 5% to 7%. So we're trying to accommodate the slowing that everyone is seeing in the automotive aftermarket by including this in the new 5% to 7%.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So sort of the underlying, if Quaker is going to add 3-ish percent on the year, the underlying is sort of 2% to 4% more or less, if that's about the right call. And I guess year-to-date on an organic basis, you're 6% and then you were 2% so you're running roughly 4%. Is that the way of looking at your organic number? Because we try to model organic plus Quaker, and I want to make sure we're thinking about it the right way.","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think you're right. The only thing I'd like to have Sid get back to you on is the year-to-date because Quaker started to flow through May 1. So I think we'd like to double check and balance with you subsequent to the call.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That would be helpful. And then also on Automotive, you said currency was about a 1 percentage point impact here in Q2 for Automotive. Do you remember what that number was for Q1?","Jerry W. Nix","Basically, it was a neutral number in Q1. I'll tell you that overall, the impact on Automotive sales were a little more than 1% in the quarter due to currency. And in our whole company, it was just under 1% impact due to currency. So currency was a factor. We don't bring that up normally, and we didn't bring it up. That play was helping us last year and the year before and we just prefer not to bring it up this time, but we have to explain the slowness that we saw there.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, I agree that it's material. And on pricing being flat at Automotive, what would you say -- and I frankly don't recall the number that you stated at the end of Q1. What would you say the trends are as they relate to inflation impact on petrol-driven goods and also, I guess, the metal component and any other factors? I'm not sure if it's all commodity prices or if there's any competitive dynamic at play.","Jerry W. Nix","Matt, I'm not sure that I can get into particular product categories with you. But in total, at the end of the first quarter, we had a negative 0.2% in automotive, and then so we had a positive 0.2% in the second quarter to be flat for the 6 months.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, so price is moving in the right direction. And then finally, on office supply, it's interesting that your business is improving with the Megas. And I guess my question relates to the break room business. Obviously, they're all very focused on that business. Do you over index with the Megas in break room? It's a new business for them. Maybe their vendor relationships aren't as developed and they're depending more on you to fund that business or back them up in that business, if you will, than they would in their traditional businesses. I'm wondering if that might be part of the -- that might be part of what's helping to improve the business there.","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think there may be a little bit of that, Matt, but the folks are largely buying that product category direct ...","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So you're just riding their growth in that space?","Thomas C. Gallagher","To some degree, but I think our growth with the independent resellers is very healthy right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is Mike Montani on for Greg. I just had a few questions. The first one was on the Office side actually. I apologize if I had missed this, but did you break out this quarter how the core business did versus the businesses that are paper and related categories?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, we didn't break that out. But I can tell you that if we look at the core office supplies and we break out the impact of the decline in paper, our core office supplies would have been modestly positive.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then was wondering just given the MAP-21 change and the pension accounting, is there anything you can do to update the full year outlook for potential cash contributions to pension? I had been thinking of like a $40 million to $60 million range. Is that roughly about right or is there any update you can share?","Jerry W. Nix","Mike, I don't think that's right. We'll have clear guidance on that in our third quarter conference call. But at this point, we're not looking to make any contribution in the remainder of this year to the pension plan, and we're trying to evaluate what the contribution for the first part of 2013 would be.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just quickly a follow-up on Exego and the accretion there. I guess our thought had been that, that could add somewhere around $10 million to $12 million for the year, so maybe a run rate of $3 million to $4 million a quarter. Is that reasonable or have I taken the margin assumptions too far?","Jerry W. Nix","No.","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think you're a little bit high there. I think in a prior call, we had guided of $0.03 to $0.05 accretive for the year. I think that was either in our year-end call in February or in our April call.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay, and just the last question I had was on outlook for pricing. You were good enough to share obviously where we were this quarter. But if you look at Automotive sort of flattish to slightly up and Office up 2.6%, should we anticipate during the year that Auto may strengthen to up 1 to 2 and maybe Office moderates a bit towards 1? Or how do you see that playing out for Industrial, Auto and Office?","Thomas C. Gallagher","At this point, I think we'd just say that we think we'll see some modest increase in the pricing as the year progresses, but we're not in a position to really give you a more precise number. I don't -- Paul, if you have a better feel for it.","Paul D. Donahue","Mike, I would just say that at this point, we saw a couple of increases come through in the first half on some significant product categories. But right now, there's really nothing pending and nothing that we're expecting in terms of additional price increases coming our way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","I wanted to talk -- you got a major automotive aftermarket supplier in JCI this morning saying that battery shipments were sluggish in the quarter and there's still some inventory overhang. Presumably given a more seasonal element with battery, there are others within the space, where there potentially is some inventory overhang that could lead to some pricing deterioration in the back half of the year? Are you guys seeing this at all or am I getting too far with the extrapolation?","Thomas C. Gallagher","We've not seen it, Brian. Our battery business is actually good. We don't see any evidence of any inventory build. We think that with our system, it's basically flow-through. So at this point, we feel pretty good about the progress to date and what the outlook is. And as long as the heat continues, it ought to continue to pull batteries all the way.","Paul D. Donahue","Brian, this is Paul. I would also just add on the battery business, our battery business is pretty good right now. And we have a major promotion going right now benefiting the Intrepid Wounded Warrior Fund that's out there in the marketplace, and we've gotten great playoff. And our battery business is pretty good right now.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Going to Quaker City, $300 million puts it at more or less the higher end of some of the businesses that you've been interested in. How many other Quaker states are out there that could potentially be kind of in your wheelhouse down the road?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, this -- what interested us in Quaker City primarily is the fact that they were the last of the non-GPC owned NAPA member. So we've now completed the circuit, and there aren't any other NAPA distributors that would be out there for sale. There might be some other businesses that we could have an interest in prospectively, but they won't be in that range. They'll be smaller businesses if we find any that we think make sense for us.","Jerry W. Nix","Brian, I might clarify, I just want to go to a couple of questions come up in the past. We did not sell into Quaker City, and we did not compete against Quaker City. They had territory that we didn't sell into, and so that's just pure geographic expansion for us.","Thomas C. Gallagher","That's a good point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just had one follow-up, which is on the gross margin. You mentioned that the vendor rebates were supportive this quarter and, I think, will be for the rest of the year. Could you give us a little more on the magnitude of that or perhaps, Jerry, is that why the Auto margin ran as strong as it did despite the weak volume in the second quarter?","Jerry W. Nix","No, I don't think it -- it doesn't have that major of an impact on the Automotive side. It looked like in total company, our volume incentive rebates were up about 2% for the 6 months. And I would say that, that's probably going to be what it's going to be for the full year. I mean that basically is how we do it. We're projecting for the full year, and we have to take a portion of those each quarter. So we had a 2% increase for the first 6 months.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then as a follow-up on the top line, when you said that DIY was down 2 versus up 6 in the first quarter, it looks like the deceleration there a lot more than in the Do It For Me side. But the ticket was up. Is it fair to say that -- and ticket was down on the Do It For Me Side given that inflation was flat or was there something else going on with mix?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, the ticket value was actually up a bit. The ticket count was basically flat for the DIFM side. So we had to -- we actually had increased ticket values on both the retail and the commercial side. We were basically flat in number of tickets on the commercial. We were down in number of tickets on retail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scot Ciccarelli, RBC. Because of all your businesses, you guys touch a lot of different parts of the economy. I guess I'm just kind of wondering kind of when you look at your business, where are the areas that you may be most optimistic? And on the flip side, where do you see the most risk at this stage?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I'll take a stab at it. We're very, very pleased with the performance of our industrial-related businesses. And with the industrial production capacity utilization numbers that came out a couple of days ago, we think that, that bodes well for the back half of the year. And we like the specific initiatives that each of the businesses has so we feel good about our ability to maintain share and perhaps even grow a little bit of share in those businesses. Our Automotive business was going along quite well through the first quarter, and then we did hit the industry-wide slowdown in the second quarter. We are hopeful based upon some of the anecdotal information we're getting from our commercial accounts that they're seeing a pickup in activity in July and that will be sustainable in the months ahead, so we continue to be optimistic about our Automotive business. And the underlying fundamentals, as Paul pointed out, are all favorable right now. So that one, we think, offers some reasonable growth for us in the second half of the year. The one business that's the most challenged is Office Products, and it's primarily related to the overall economic slowdown and then also related to some of the change in product demand. So anything that's basically paper-based is going to continue to go through some deceleration due to the tablets and the iPads and the things like that, that are causing contraction in demand. But other product categories are offering some attractive growth rates. We just have to continue to accelerate the growth of the categories that we think offer the best opportunities going forward. So does that answer your question?","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I think it does. And then I guess as a follow-up would be, obviously, the Auto segment did slow quite a bit in the second quarter. I mean outside of weather, is there anything else you would attribute it to?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, you look at consumer sentiment and its decline for the past 4 months. If you look at overall retail sales, they've been softening for the past couple of months, and I think there's just a general uneasiness or malaise among the consumer right now that I think perhaps had an impact. We are somewhat encouraged by the reports coming out that say that they expect back-to-school to be reasonably good this year. And hopefully, that's going to translate into some increased purchasing of some of the things we sell as well as consumers start to move beyond the period we're in right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. A lot of them have been hit, but talking about June and what seemed to be an improving trend as the quarter ended, which is -- hearing mixed signals from various participants. Do you see anything strategically in the market? Did you guys gain share? Was anything happening with major competitors in the space in that period that might have you a relative outperformer during that time period?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, I don't think we can answer that specifically.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess the comment earlier during the prepared remarks, you talked about expectations. I think you said retail was up 1% last year. You expected this year second half to be in line. Was that accurate that retail aftermarket might be up around 1%?","Jerry W. Nix","That is correct, Bret. That's what we're projecting.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess one little follow-up on the July commentary. I think you said a little bit of pickup commentary from your service customers, and I think you also said a little bit in the very end of June you'd gotten on the weather. A sort of order of magnitude, was this acceleration from an improved June looking more like the volumes were doing in the first quarter or I'm just sort of trying to get a feeling for the magnitude and timing of that heat impact in the quarter?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, there was very little impact from the heat in June. We did get some benefit in the very last days. But any impact from the heat, I think, will be more evident in the July numbers. And then in terms of the comparative between June and the first quarter, June was still not as strong as the overall first quarter but it was the best month of the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Rakers with Wunderlich.","Brent D. Rakers - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Wanted to follow up, if I could, a bit on Industrial. It sounds like from the direction of performance, you're really not seeing some of the same kind of deterioration in some of these sequential trends in May, June, July that some of your peers are. Would that be a correct observation?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we didn't see any sequential change through the quarter. Our numbers were pretty consistent as we progressed through the quarter. But we did see the sequential change at quarter end, with first quarter being up 12% and second quarter being up 8%.","Brent D. Rakers - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as you move into July, you've talked a little bit about indications for the Auto side. What sort of kind of organic changes are you seeing on the Industrial side of things?","Thomas C. Gallagher","We think July should turn out to be fairly consistent with what we saw in the first quarter.","Brent D. Rakers - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then could you just remind me within that business when you talked about industrial production and the MCU earlier, can you talk about how you see that relationship to your business kind of working on a coincident basis or more of a lead indicator of your business there?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I want to go back and correct one thing. I misspoke when I said in line with what we saw in the first quarter. July is in line with what we saw in the second quarter. So I just want to clear that up. As far as the industrial production capacity utilization, that's usually a 6- to 9-month indicator for us -- leading indicator. And with what we saw earlier this week, historically, that would tend to indicate that the next 2 quarters should be pretty decent for us.","Brent D. Rakers - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last question regarding EIS, it seemed like you put up pretty good margins in that segment in the business. Just wanted to get a sense for how that might work in terms of is that a project-by-project basis and maybe that's pushing the margins up a little bit there or is that something we can extrapolate going forward?","Jerry W. Nix","You can't expect those kind of margins going forward. That's highest margins in their history. I think some place between -- and our target has been to get them up to 8%, and that probably is in your modeling going forward. But it's just blocking and tackling. There's not any silver bullet that's going to get out of -- get their operating margins up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of things I wanted to follow up on in the automotive space, where you're saying that you're experiencing some softer dynamics going on there. The Snap-on call just prior to yours, I was curious to know what their experience was in that group. They're saying that they're not seeing anything where consumers are trying to put off repairs or have worked on, on their vehicles. They're seeing that those aftermarket dynamics are still in place and sales in the tool business there were still real good. Now you're -- but you're saying that -- was the softness coming from the do-it-yourself side or was this coming from the garages? Where was it coming from?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, I think Paul covered in his comments that on the retail sales, we were down 2% in the quarter. On the commercial side, we were up 3% in the quarter. Both of which were softer than what we experienced in the first quarter. I think it's hard to try to compare Snap-on's results with our results in the sense that they're heavily concentrated on handheld diagnostic equipment, heavily concentrated with hand tools. And that's just a small part of our business. I will tell you that our tool and equipment business was good in the quarter. So we feel that the team made good progress there. But I don't think you can try to compare directly what happens with Snap-on and what happens with us. And by the way, we've got a very high regard for the job that they do. They're a good company, and they perform well.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. No, that makes sense. So you would say then that the underlying fundamentals of the aftermarket might be eroding some but you expect it to be in line with your expectations for the rest of the year?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, I don't think we'd go quite that far. I think what we would say is that we came through the first quarter and the prior 8 quarters with pretty good results. We saw deceleration in demand in the second quarter. It appears that, that's indicative of what happened in the overall industry. We think the underlying fundamentals are quite positive now frankly. We think perhaps some of the softness in the second quarter could be attributed to a milder winter, maybe we pulled some sales into the first quarter. And then also we think some of the softness might be attributed to what we've seen generally in retail sales moderating in the quarter and consumer sentiment moderating in the quarter. Our expectation is that the second half of the year should be relatively good for us, and we don't see any deterioration in the underlying fundamentals in the industry. We feel good about it.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then also year-over-year, fuel costs, I would imagine, are a positive for you right now in terms of margin?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, our fuel costs would be down. So from an operating margin standpoint, that would be helpful. It's a recent phenomenon but it is, in fact, helping at this point.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And how do you record the fuel costs. I mean you've got a lot of delivery vehicles out there running milk routes every day. Do you -- is that in cost of goods sold or is that part of your selling?","Thomas C. Gallagher","It's in our operating expenses.","Paul D. Donahue","And Richard, let me -- this is Paul -- just a further comment on that. I just want to make sure that -- we haven't seen the kind of drops in diesel as we are in basic unleaded fuel at the consumer gas pump. So we're -- there's really 2 different measurements there.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Judy Merrick","This is Judy in for Keith. Just to clarify on the Electrical for the monthly trends, with June, you did not see a pickup, kind of like the industry index that you referenced. And was there anything else that impacted your outlook for that segment?","Jerry W. Nix","For the Electrical side?","Judy Merrick","That's right.","Jerry W. Nix","Now the Electrical side are pretty steady throughout the entire month, the 3 months in the second quarter, running basically at 10%, 9%, 10% and so forth. So there wasn't any pickup in Electrical towards the end of the quarter.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Jerry W. Nix","Well, Amy, thank you. And we thank each of you for joining us on the call today.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts fourth quarter conference call to discuss our earnings results and the outlook for 2012.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings.","The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Thomas Gallagher","Thank you, Carol, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. As we normally do, Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and I will share the duties today. And once we've concluded our planned comments, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have. And we're pleased to tell you that we look forward to having Paul Donahue, GPC's recently-elected President, joining us on our April conference call. ","Now earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and year-end 2011 results, and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3,014,000,000, which was up 7%. Net income was $135 million, which was up 14%, and earnings per share were $0.86 this year compared to $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2010, and the EPS increase was 15%. And this enabled us to end 2011 with sales of $12,459,000,000, which was up 11%. Net income was $565.1 million, which was up 19%, and earnings per share were $3.58 this year compared to $3 last year, and that's an EPS increase of 19%. ","Now we did see some moderation on our fourth quarter revenue growth and our 7% increase in the quarter was our lowest of the year. However, it is in line with the guidance that we provided at the end of Q3, and it is also on top of a 14% increase in the fourth quarter of 2010, which was our strongest quarterly performance of 2010. It's important to say that we continue to feel good about the progress that we're making on the revenue side. ","And then we were pleased to be up 15% in earnings per share in the quarter, especially on top of a 21% EPS increase in the fourth quarter of 2010. These are solid results in our opinion and as the full year -- as are the full year increases, and our 2011 results follow a very similar performance in 2010 when sales were up 11%, net income was up 19% and earnings per share were up 20%. So back-to-back good years from our perspective, and we entered 2012 with some positive momentum. ","A review of the revenue results by business segment shows that our industrial-related businesses continue to produce the strongest performances. Motion Industries, our industrial distribution group; and EIS, our Electrical\/Electronic business, were up 13% and 10%, respectively, in the quarter, and they were up 19% and 24%, respectively, for the year. In Motion's case, the 19% increase for the year follows a 22% increase in 2010. ","Acquisitions added 2% to the quarterly increase and 3% to the year-to-date results, so you can see that the underlying industrial business remains solid. And as has been the case for some time now, these strong results are widespread across the business as evidenced by the fact that every geographic area was up double digits for the year. ","Additionally, our top 10 product categories had double-digit increases. Our top 10 industry segments were up strong double digits as a group, and our top 20 customers were up over 20% on a combined basis. So the good results were broad-based, and they were quite consistent from a product, customer, industry segment and geographic perspective, and we're pleased with the overall sales strength and the balance that we see in our industrial business. ","Moving onto the Electrical\/Electronic segment, at plus 24% for the year, they obviously turned in another strong sales performance. Acquisitions added 7% to the quarterly increase and 11% for the year. And similar to the industrial operations, EIS enjoyed strong results in a number of different areas as evidenced by the fact that their top 25 customers were up over 20% for the year, and they were up 19% with their top 20 vendors. Additionally, every geographic area posted a double-digit increase. ","So both Motion and EIS turned in strong results this past year, and at the current levels of industrial production and manufacturing capacity utilization indices, as well as the ISM Purchasing Managers Index, we are entering 2012 under generally favorable conditions for each of these businesses. ","Moving on to Office Products. This is the one part of our business that continues to face the most challenging situation. Office Products revenues were down 1% in the fourth quarter. This follows 4 consecutive quarters of increases, but in looking back over the year, we did experience a decelerating sales pattern as the year progressed. After being up 5% in the first quarter, we were up 4% in the second, 3% in the third and then down 1% in the fourth. Now we were pleased to end the year up 3%. But in looking at industry-wide results, it's clear that overall demand has softened pretty significantly over the latter part of the year. ","And looking a bit deeper into the numbers, our business with the independent office products resellers was flat in the fourth quarter, but we were pleased to see this group end the year with a bit single-digit increase. Our Mega Channel business was down again in Q4, and it was down low-double digits for the full year. ","On the product side, office supplies, technology products and furniture had modest declines in the fourth quarter. But for the year, technology products and office supplies had low-single digit increases, while furniture was flat. Cleaning and break room supplies enjoyed low-double digit increases, both in the quarter and for the year, so good progress continues to be made in this category. But from an overall perspective, conditions in the office products industry remain challenging, and we expect demand to remain subdued for the foreseeable future. ","And finally, a few comments on Automotive. This is our largest segment, and they ended the fourth quarter up 6%. This follows 4 consecutive quarters of 9% increases, so our Automotive operations have been performing well for us for a period of time now, and they were up 8% for the full year. It's interesting to note that these quarterly and full year results are essentially same-store sales increases, which we feel demonstrates the solid progress being made by our Automotive management team. ","And looking a little deeper into the results of our company-owned store group, we see that our commercial business continues to outperform our retail business, and this has been the case all year long. In looking at our retail business first, we find that our average ticket value is actually up over the prior year, but the number of retail tickets is down, and we ended the quarter and the year with retail being up 1%. On the commercial side, both ticket counts and ticket values were up, and we ended the quarter up 6% and up 8% for the year, with both NAPA AutoCare and major accounts each finishing the year up low-double digits. This is back-to-back double digit increases in these 2 important commercial initiatives, which shows the good steady progress being made in each of these areas.","Our fleet business was up 4% in the quarter and up 5% for the year. So when we put it all together, we feel good about the progress being made by our Automotive management team. We recognize that we have some work to do yet on the retail side of the business, but the commercial results remain solid. And following the Automotive segment's 7% increase in 2010, we feel that the 8% increase in 2011 demonstrates the good job being done by the Automotive managers, and we enter 2012 with a degree of optimism about their prospects in the year ahead. ","And then one final comment on the Automotive segment is that we did complete our investment in Exego on January 1. You will recall that Exego was the leading automotive distribution company in Australia and New Zealand, with revenues of just over $1 billion. We paid approximately $150 million for a 30% ownership position, with the option to purchase the remaining 70% at one point in the next 2 to 3 years. We feel that this is a significant strategic move for us, and we will account for the 30% ownership position as minority interest on our income statement. ","So that's a quick overview of the revenue performance by business segment. And at this time, we'll ask Jerry to cover the financial results. Jerry?","Jerry W. Nix","Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, and then we'll open the call up for your questions. ","A review of the income statement shows the following: our sales results were strong throughout 2011, and total sales for the fourth quarter were up 7% to $3.0 billion. For the full year, we produced record revenues of $12.5 billion, which represents an 11% increase from 2010. We're proud of this accomplishment and especially pleased that all 4 of our business segments contributed to our growth for the year. Additionally, 2011 marked our 60th year of sales increases over the last 62 years. This is the kind of steady and consistent growth we look for in our businesses, and we're excited about the opportunity to improve on this record again in 2012 and beyond. ","Gross profit in the fourth quarter is 29.6% of sales. That's up sequentially from 28.9% in the third quarter and up 50 basis points from 29.1% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year, gross margin was also flat at 28.9% compared to 29.0% in 2010. Achieving this level of gross margin for the year reflects pretty solid progress over the last few quarters. ","As we turn to 2012, we'll continue to execute our ongoing buy- and sell-side initiatives to effectively manage supply chain costs, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize our pricing potential. This will be necessary to offset the impact of continued competitive pricing pressures and changes in product and customer sales mix across our businesses. Regardless, further progress in this area remains a high priority for us again for 2012, and our management team is very aware of and focused on this goal. ","For the year, our cumulative price, which represents vendor supplier increases to us, we were plus 2.6% in Automotive, plus 4.1% in Industrial, plus 1.6% in Office Products and plus 5.3% in Electrical. ","Turning to SG&A. Total expenses of $682 million were up 8.2% in the fourth quarter and were relatively flat at 22.6% of sales versus 22.5% in 2010 due to our solid operating performance in the quarter. We're facing a very tough comp on this line in the fourth quarter, and in addition, our cost of incentive-based compensation and related benefits were higher than originally forecasted due to our better-than-expected results. ","For the full year, SG&A of $2.7 billion was 21.8% of sales. That's a 40 basis point improvement from 22.2% in the prior year. We're pleased to show continued improvement in controlling our expenses as a percentage of sales again in 2011, as we had made tremendous improvement in this area in 2010. We attribute this progress to the combined benefits of greater leverage associated with our sales growth and ongoing measures to control costs. ","For the last few years, we benefited from cost-saving initiatives in areas such as freight, utilities, and warehouse and infrastructure costs, among others. We estimate that savings in these areas added to slightly more than $30 million in 2011. In addition, after reducing our headcount by approximately 12% in '08 and '09, we've added back just 2% of our labor force, including acquisitions, over the last 2 years. This is a pretty good testament to the hard work of our entire organization to effectively control costs, as well as the positive impact of our investments in technology over the last several years. These efforts have been meaningful to our overall results, and we understand that we must remain focused in these areas as we move forward in 2012. ","Now let's discuss the results by segment. Automotive had revenue in the fourth quarter of $1,460,200,000, that's up 6%, and had operating profit of $89.9 million, up 9%, so nice margin expansion from 6.0% to 6.2% of revenue. The Industrial Group had sales in the quarter of $1,032,700,000, that's up 13%, and had operating profit of $89.1 million, up 21%, so very strong margin expansion from 8.1% to 8.6%. ","Office Products had revenue in the quarter of $391.4 million. That's down 1%. Operating profit of $38.1 million was flat, so they had slight margin enhancement to 9.7% from 9.6%. Electrical Group had revenue in the quarter of $137.6 million, and that's up 10%. Operating profit of $10.3 million, up 17.5%, so nice expansion there from 7.0% to 7.5%. ","Looking at the full year. Automotive had revenue of $6.1 billion, and that represents 49% of the total and an increase of 8%, had operating profit for the year, $467.8 million, up 11%, so again, nice margin improvement of 7.5% to 7.7%. ","Industrial Group had revenue for the full year of $4.2 billion, representing 33% of the total. That was up 18.5%. It had operating profit of $337.6 million, up 32%, so very strong margin expansion from 7.3% to 8.1% of revenue. ","Office Products had revenue for the full year of $1.7 billion, representing 14% of the total, up 3%. Operating profit of $134.1 million, up 2%. So we had slight decline in margin, but still very strong at 7.9%. ","Electrical Group for the year had revenue of $557.5 million, represents 4% of the total, and that's up 24%. Operating profit of $40.7 million, up 32%, so very strong margin expansion of 6.9% to 7.3%. ","Total operating profit increased by 12% in the fourth quarter, and operating profit margin improved 30 basis points to 7.5% from 7.2% in the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase was driven primarily by the improvement in our gross margin for the quarter. For the year, total operating profit increased 17%. Operating margin was up 40 basis points to 7.9%. ","The solid progress we made in 2011 is due to improved expense leverage associated with our sales growth, as well as our measures to control costs noted earlier. We're encouraged by this level of progress and optimistic for further improvement in 2012. ","We had net interest expense, $5.6 million in the fourth quarter, $24.6 million for the year, and both are down slightly from 2010 due to our new debt agreement, which was signed in November and carried a lower interest rate. We'll discuss our debt position later, but we expect our net interest expense to decrease to approximately $20 million to $22 million for 2012. ","Other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and noncontrolling interest, was an $11.6-million expense in the fourth quarter and $64.8 million for the year. The $1.9-million increase in the fourth quarter reflects the higher expenses for incentive-based compensation and related benefits that were discussed earlier, as well as certain other items such as insurance, legal and professional costs. ","As we look ahead to 2012, we currently project the total other category to remain in the $60-million to $70-million range. This assumes consistent levels of incentive-based compensation, which we would expect to incur with normalized levels of growth. ","For the fourth quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.8% compared to 36.3% in the fourth quarter in 2010. For the year, tax rate is 36.6% compared to 37.6% for the prior year. Decrease in the rate for the year is primarily related to favorable adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2011 that were associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations related to international taxes. Currently, we expect a tax rate for 2012 of approximately 36.5% to 37.0%. ","Net income for the quarter, $135.0 million. That's up 14%, and EPS grew 15% to $0.86 compared to $0.75 last year. For the year, net income, $565 million, up 19%; EPS of $3.58 compared to $3 in 2010, and that's also an increase of 19%. We're very proud of our associates at Genuine Parts Company for helping us achieve record earnings in 2011. ","Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at December 31 of $525 million is relatively consistent with cash at December 31, 2010. Our strong cash position was supported by the increase in earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions. We continue to use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as the increase in the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we'll discuss in more detail later. We also used $58 million in 2011 to fund our pension plans as required from time to time. ","Accounts receivable, $1.46 billion at December 31, increased 7% from 2010, which is relatively in line with our sales increase for the fourth quarter. Our goal at GPC remains to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth, and we feel we made good progress toward this goal over the last half of 2011. We'll continue to emphasize improvement in this area, and we remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables. ","Inventory at 12\/31\/2011 was $2.26 billion, and that's up less than 2% or approximately $37 million from December 31, 2010. In consideration of our 11% sales growth for the year, as well as inventory from acquisitions, we believe our management team managed this key investment very well again in 2011. We remain focused on further improving our inventory levels in 2012. ","Accounts payable balance at December 31, $1.44 billion, which is up 5% from December 31 in the prior year. Primarily, the increase in trade payables in 2011 reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume. In addition, you may recall we have successfully negotiated extended payment terms and implemented other payable initiatives with our vendors to improve our payables position over the last couple of years. As a result, our DPO improved in each of the last few years, and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital category. ","As reported, working capital of $2.8 billion at December 31 is up 13% from 2010. But after adding back the $250-million current portion of the debt at December 31, 2010, the comparable increase is only 3%. So working capital is relatively consistent with the prior year, and we are encouraged with our ongoing progress in managing our working capital in 2011. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition as we move forward into the new year. ","Total debt at December 31, 2011, remains unchanged at $500 million, although it's certainly worth noting that we signed a new agreement in 2011 extending the $250-million credit facility, which matured in November of 2011. The new 5-year debt agreement carried a 3.35% interest rate and is now classified as long-term on the December 31 balance sheet. The second $250 million in debt is due in November of 2013. ","Total debt to total capitalization at December 31, 15.2%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at the current time. We generated solid cash flows again in 2011, with cash from operations totaling approximately $625 million and free cash flow after deducting CapEx and dividends of approximately $245 million. Although slightly below the level we had projected for the year, we are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. ","These priorities are: first, the dividend, which we'd paid every year since going public in 1948, we've raised now for 56 consecutive years. Effectively, yesterday's board approval of a 10% increase in the company's annual dividend for 2012 to $1.98 per share from $1.80 per share paid in 2011. The new dividend represents approximately 55% of our 2011 earnings per share and currently yields about 3%. This is our second consecutive year to raise the dividend by 10%, and over the last 5 years, we've grown the dividend by a compounded annual growth rate of 6.3%. ","Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment in capital expenditures were $39 million for the fourth quarter, up from $26 million invested in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year, CapEx was $103 million compared to $85 million in 2010. Increase in our CapEx spending was in line with our investment plans for 2011, and we currently expect our CapEx spending to increase further in 2012 to approximately $110 million to $125 million for the full year. The vast majority of these investments will continue to be weighted toward productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology. ","Depreciation, amortization, $22 million in the quarter and $89 million for the year, is consistent with this expense in 2010. We expect D&A to be approximately $90 million to $100 million in 2012. ","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of our cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. In 2011, we completed 3 acquisitions at Motion Industries, including Dayton Tool & Supply (sic) [Dayton Supply & Tool] and D.P. Brown in January, Terin [ph] Hydraulics in July. At EIS, we acquired Cobra Wire & Cable in September. Combined annual revenues for these acquired companies totaled approximately $125 million. These new businesses had a positive impact on the Industrial and Electrical segments in 2011, and we believe they will contribute nicely to our results in 2012 as well. ","You can see that between these strategic bolt-on type acquisitions and the investment in Australia's Exego, as Tom mentioned earlier, which was effective January 1 of 2012, we continue to find opportunities for acquisitions. We anticipate additional opportunities for acquisitions in 2012, and we'll remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy, generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25-million to $125-million range, although we've proven there are certainly exceptions to this rule. ","In the fourth quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 175,000 shares of our company's stock on the company share repurchase program. For the year, we purchased approximately 2.4 million shares, and today, we have approximately 13.5 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. ","In closing, I want to thank all of the dedicated GPC associates for their hard work and dedication to the success of the company. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance. 2011 was highlighted by double-digit sales and earnings growth, which were also record sales and earnings. We enter the new year committed to growing sales and earnings, generating solid cash flows and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're very proud of the many good things going on throughout our organization and also optimistic that we can carry our positive momentum into 2012 and beyond. ","And that concludes the financial review, so I'll turn it back to Tom.","Thomas Gallagher","Thank you, Jerry. Well, that's an overview of our fourth quarter and 2011 results, and we're proud of the job that was done by the GPC team this past year, and we thank them for their efforts. ","As we turn our attention to 2012, we're cautiously optimistic. We are pleased to be coming off 2 good years in 2010 and 2011, and we feel that we have a bit of positive momentum. And the underlying fundamentals continue to be encouraging in 3 of our 4 businesses. ","At the same time, however, we see that gasoline prices remain at near historical highs, with the threat of going higher in the months ahead. This could have a direct effect on our Automotive business. Additionally, the higher fuel costs could impact consumer spending, which will indirectly affect end market demand in our Industrial and Electrical businesses. And as mentioned earlier, our expectation is for sluggish demand in Office Products for several quarters yet.","So with all of that said, our preliminary expectations are for 2012 revenue growth in the 6% to 8% range, with Automotive being up 5% to 7%, Industrial up 8% to 10%, Electrical\/Electronic up 8% to 10% and Office Products up 1% to 3%. And with top line growth at these levels, we would anticipate earnings growth of 8% to 12%, which would give us an earnings per share range of $3.85 to $4, and we look forward to refining these numbers further as we progress through the year. ","So that will conclude our planned comments this morning. And at this point, we'll turn the call back to Jodie and then take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you -- first on the Auto side, there has been talk of some weather impact in December, and it sounds like some of your peers saw some acceleration to start the year, as perhaps they lapped some tough weather trends from January of a year ago. Is that something that you are seeing in your business as well?","Thomas Gallagher","Well, we were affected to a degree by the weather in the fourth quarter. And as we've said many times before, we don't like to use that as any excuse for performance. We're proud of the job that was done by our team in the fourth quarter even with the weather consideration. We would expect our first quarter revenues to be up at least in line with fourth quarter revenue or maybe just a little bit better.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And then, also on the top line side, in the Industrial business, is there a change in the complexion of the types of products that are being bought? It sounded like, previously, perhaps it was more a maintenance product that people are buying for production purposes. Are you seeing more of a capital-type investment from your customers? Or is it the same?","Thomas Gallagher","I think the project work, which is driven by the CapEx through our customer segment -- the project work is pretty consistent and has been for the last few quarters, so we're pleased with that. We use that as a little bit of an internal leading indicator. So at this point, we think the project work will stay relatively steady through the first half of the year, and we're optimistic about what the Industrial Group can do over the first half of this year.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then finally on the gross margin side, did vendor or catalog allowances come into play in the fourth quarter? I know last year you had, actually, had a tough compare on the allowance side. So I was just curious how that set up and if that ended up helping your gross margin overall.","Jerry W. Nix","Chris, we did see a slight improvement in the incentives that we got versus the prior year. We didn't get as much in the LIFO as we had gotten in the prior year, so it was a number of factors that go into the improvement in the gross margin in the fourth quarter. I would be misleading you if I were to attribute all of that to higher volume incentives. They're just a number -- we've got some pricing software we're using as well as parsing better, I think, so -- but yes, we saw some slight improvement in the vendor incentives. We've gotten those incentives back up to about where they were prior to the recession.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question. As we think about the mix within each of your 4 business lines, Industrial, Office, EIS and Auto, and as the economy theoretically recovers over the next year to 3 years here and your business sort of naturally has some lifting, I'm just curious. Traditionally, have you seen sort of a richening of mix, meaning the products that you're selling into that kind of economic recovery might carry higher margins? Or is it something that's pretty consistent and you just get good operating leverage off the higher sales base? I'm just trying to understand mix versus operating leverage as the economy hopefully recovers here.","Thomas Gallagher","John, I think that we might see some incremental benefit from product mix going forward. One of the things that we've seen for the past few years has been the downward pressure on pricing, and it's caused people to move down the value chain in terms of the products they're selecting. And it's also had an impact on related sales, and we're not selling as many of the related items in some of the businesses that we might sell in an improving economy. So I think we potentially could benefit from that if the economy stays healthy going forward.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I'm sorry, Tom, that would be most acute in the Auto business? Or would that be across all businesses?","Thomas Gallagher","It's more -- I think it'd be more pronounced in Automotive and in Office Products, and to a lesser degree in the other 2 industrial-related businesses.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a second question. You alluded to pricing a number of times here. I'm just curious what you're seeing from a competitive set there versus what you're seeing on the cost side, because it sounds like you're getting some cost increases from your vendors, but it doesn't sound like the pass-through has been that great. I'm just curious what the competitive environment is for pricing that you're seeing in the 4 segments, if it's continuing to get tougher. It sounds like it.","Thomas Gallagher","No, I wouldn't suggest it's getting tougher, but I would say it's been pretty consistent for a period of time now. It's competitive in all 4 of the businesses. I don't think it's any more pronounced today than it has been, and we don't expect it to get any better, at least in the near term. We are having some benefit on the purchase side of it, the buy side of it, and the margin improvement we're getting is somewhat attributable to buy-side improvement, but also attributable to just doing a little better job ourselves in how we're setting resale prices.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, as we look at the op margin improvement, it's been pretty good in the last 2 years, but it's still light versus where you guys have been historically, at sort of 9% to 10% on op margin. I mean, is there anything structurally that, as we step forward over the next couple of years, that you think would limit your ability to get back to that 9% to 10% range? Or is this really a function of where we are in the business cycle?","Jerry W. Nix","John, I think it's more of a function of where we are in the business cycle, but I would also tell you that our target is continue to get 10 to 20 basis points improvement in our operating margin each year, but that's going to be driven a lot by this gross margin issue that we talked about earlier, and we seem to have turned the corner there in the last couple of quarters, so we'll have to continue to show a gross margin expansion. If we do that, then we'll continue to show some improvement. But the marketplace, as Tom mentioned, remains very competitive, and for us to get back to those operating margins 10 years or so ago is probably not in the works.","Thomas Gallagher","But, John, I'd add to that, our near-term goals and objectives have been to get the operating margins back to 8% to 8.5%. We were up 50 basis points in 2010, 40 basis points in 2011 and operating margin of 7.9%. So we're approaching the bottom end of that target range. Our expectation is that we'll cross into the 8% to 8.5% in 2012, and then as Jerry said, we'll be looking for 10- to 20-basis-point improvement on a consistent basis going forward.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just one just last question on the working capital, Jerry. You guys did a great job of growing working capital just 3%, I mean, less than half of what sales grew. I mean, is that something we should expect, is something on the working capital side that is a lot slower than what you're seeing on the sales line, which is a good thing, obviously?","Jerry W. Nix","Yes, I think so. That's a major initiative we have, and we've done a great job in a couple of categories in the last few years of payables and inventory. We haven't done as good a job in receivables as we should have, but we've got a number of initiatives going forward. So yes, I think you'll continue to see it growing at a rate less than sales certainly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On the Office Products, the deceleration, Tom, that you mentioned through the course of the year, is that just a demand end-through or pull-through that you're seeing? Or are you seeing that some of the Mega guys in particular maybe bring some SKUs back to help run their warehouses a bit better? Or is that sort of a like-for-like?","Thomas Gallagher","No, I think it'd be more the former than the latter. And it seems, at this point, we're waiting, and over the next 2 weeks, we're going to get some additional insight as some of the other publicly traded companies report. But at this point, it does seem that demand decelerated really over the second half of the year more so than the first half. And it also seems that the public sector is where we saw more deceleration than in the private sector, quite honestly. So that -- and we're getting that anecdotally from our customer base, but that's where they're seeing more contraction in demand than in the rest of their customer set.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's great, helpful. And then second, Jerry, the SG&A obviously had some nice control, and you went through some of the measures you've done the last 3 years to really get there. But in the fourth quarter, it did tick up quite a bit. Was there anything unusual about the fourth quarter? Or you think you've just sort of reached the point that sales end up growing at this sort of 7% rate, that it's just going to be impossible or near impossible to leverage SG&A?","Jerry W. Nix","Greg, you're starting to sound like one of our operators now. Certainly, that's not the case at 7% growth that we can't make SG&A improvement. It was really we had underestimated accrual for the compensation and the good year that we had overall, and there were a couple of benefit items that we had to catch up on in there as well. But no, we can continue to make improvement in the SG&A side.","Thomas Gallagher","And, Greg, I'd just add that I think the guidance we provided earlier would indicate that when we said that we thought the revenues will be up 6% to 8% but the earnings will be up 8% to 12%.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So SG&A is part of that. It's not just gross margin, bending gross margins, you would say.","Thomas Gallagher","Yes.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then lastly, in your guidance, you gave the price that you saw this year. And I guess as you go forward and think about 2012, what sort of inflation do you expect to see? Do you expect to see better, worse? And maybe by categories if you can.","Thomas Gallagher","We're a little bit early in the year to be making categorical statements. But at this point, our expectation is that price increases in each of the 4 businesses will be roughly in line with what we saw in 2011. We need a few more months to be able to tighten that up some. But Jerry gave those impacts earlier, and we're planning for about the same. There may be some variance from one to the other, but in total, they'll be pretty close.","Jerry W. Nix","Greg, just clarification, about the same increase, not the same level for pricing. But it's about the same percentage increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I know you've kind of given us an outline of expectations by segment, but when you kind of look at the business and kind of the structural drivers in each one, if you had to kind of pick a business that had the biggest upside and which one had the biggest risk, how should we think about that at this stage?","Thomas Gallagher","Well, I'd say the industrial-related businesses have some upside. At the same time, if we see something happen that is negatively impactful on the economy, there's some downside risk there, obviously. But I think there is some upside in the industrial-related businesses. And if we had to force rank them, we'd say that there's probably a little bit of downside risk in Office Products only because our expectation is that the first half of the year is going to be a little bit more challenging than the back half of the year. And we're hoping that our planning for the back half of the year comes to fruition and proves accurate.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then it sounds like Motion is experiencing basically strength across the board as you indicated. Are there any verticals at all not humming along for those guys? Or is it really just every single major vertical that they're servicing that yet you're seeing very strong sales growth?","Thomas Gallagher","We still see sluggishness in anything that's related to construction. But all of the others remain very, very positive.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question regarding NAPA, and this is just kind of an industry question for your peers as well. But if we were to start to get a meaningful rebound in the SAAR like we've started to see in terms of new car sales, how do you think that impacts your NAPA business given your longevity in that industry and obviously, all the data you've collected over time?","Thomas Gallagher","Well first, we'd like to say that we hope we do see some rebound in the SAARs. We think that's long-term positive for the industry. We don't think there's any material near-term impact if we do, in fact, experience that. We've still got a long way to go, as you know, to get back to the 16 million, 17 million vehicles that were sold back a few years ago. It's an interesting thing right now. We're at a point in time where approaching 3\/4 of the vehicles that are on the road today are out of warranty. And while we will see, let's say, 14 2, 14 5 in new vehicle sales this year, that's still going to leave a huge number of vehicles that are out of warranty and need to come into the aftermarket for repair, and they continue to age. The average age is 10.6 years today, and it's going to continue to go up from all projections we see for the foreseeable future. So we'd like to see new car sales rebound and continue to improve. But at the same time, we think the impact will be minimal, if anything at all. And the next couple of years -- if the economy holds, the next couple of years should be pretty good ones for the aftermarket.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Brinkman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the Office Products side, you talked a little bit about some of the top line trends in that division, I think, public versus private customers. I was curious what perhaps you are seeing in terms of megas versus independents. And then also on Office, I noticed that the margins were the strongest in 4Q that they've been in several years despite the softer top line trend. Perhaps you could comment on that as well.","Thomas Gallagher","In terms of the difference between the megas and the independents, we ended the year up mid-single digits with the independent office products reseller, and they had a pretty good year over the course of the year. But if we look at it sequentially, they too experienced some moderation in growth as the year progressed, primarily in the last 2 quarters. If we look at the Mega Channel, we were down low-double digits for the full year. So these are fairly consistent with what we saw in 2010, and we haven't seen any material change over the last 2 years. As far as the margin, I think we did a good job on the SG&A. We did, in fact, have a little improvement in our gross profit there. And regrettably, they did not hit their objectives from an incentive-based pay standpoint, so the impact of them was not as favorable as it was on the rest of the business.","Jerry W. Nix","I'd also point out, Ryan, that Office Products' operating margins were over 9% leading up to the recession. And in '08 and '09, they started to decline, and it's a matter of getting their expenses under control with the top line growth that they have, but they had a nice fourth quarter from that perspective.","Ryan Brinkman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. Can I just ask 2 real quick about how you think about the operating margin performance of your different divisions as we head into 2012? For example, how do you think about incremental EBIT margins at your respective divisions? In 2011, the incremental margins at Industrial and at Electrical were significantly higher than the EBIT margin overall for those different divisions. I assume that's because of a lot of vendor rebate recapture. As we go into 2012 and you've guided to a little bit slower top line growth for those 2 different divisions, should we continue -- should we expect to see continued very strong EBIT incremental? Or do you think that those could moderate a little bit next year?","Thomas Gallagher","I'll try to answer that question in a couple of different ways. First of all, the margin improvement that we saw in Industrial was partly attributable to some incentives, but largely and primarily attributable to good top line growth; some gross profit management; and also, some really good SG&A work. So if we think about the 4 businesses going forward, we're actually planning on incremental margin improvement at all 4 of the businesses. The degree that we'll get in any one business is going to be somewhat driven by the level of revenue growth that we get. If, in fact, we had another strong double-digit increase in Industrial, then we'll get significantly more margin improvement there than if we have a low single-digit increase at Office Products. But for internal planning purposes, we're looking for all 4 of the businesses to give us some margin improvement in 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mario Gabelli from GAMCO Investors.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Just a question, Tom. As you're looking out 3 years from now and as we think about your acquisition in Australia, how big do you want the Automotive part of your business to be? Or how big could it be outside North America?","Thomas Gallagher","Well, assuming we go through with the option that we have for the remaining 70%, that's a business of just over $1 billion. And that company, we hope, will grow at high-single to low-double digit growth going forward. So that'll be our primary international initiative using Exego or Repco as our platform company in Southeast Asia. So we'd like to see it grow or outgrow or outperform the growth of our North American business, but we're also planning for some healthy growth in North America as well.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","But it's more likely to have that business be a platform for use of the balance sheet than a fourth or fifth leg in the U.S.","Thomas Gallagher","I think that's right. I think that's a fair statement. We'd like to stay in the 4 businesses we're in, look for additional opportunities in North America, but also explore what we consider to be good opportunities internationally.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Jerry, this is just a tax question. Some of us are modeling in a lower tax rate because the President is going to propose it, not that, that means that the guys that own the dividends will be helped. But are you a full cash taxpayer U.S.?","Jerry W. Nix","Yes, we are.","Mario Joseph Gabelli - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","So book and cash are almost equal.","Jerry W. Nix","That'd be correct.","Operator",".","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Cristello from BB&T Capital Markets.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","First question is when we look at sort of the Automotive side of the business, and I know over, let's say, the last 5-plus years, there's always sort of in that target of wanting to get some incremental growth on the company-owned store side, but maybe that never transpired to the extent that you wanted. Can you sort of update us on sort of your growth trajectory, where you ended the year on company-owned and how we might think about that business as we move forward?","Thomas Gallagher","Well, we don't break out company-owned and independently-owned specifically, Tony. But I would say that as we go forward, our expectation is that the company-owned may grow at a slightly faster rate than the independently-owned, and more so because of some expansion initiatives that we have underway. The last couple of years, we have done more consolidating of some stores and to really strengthen the performance of the individual stores. And I think our same-store sales growth would indicate that we've been reasonably successful in that venture. But I think, at this point, we're looking forward to more aggressive company store expansion, primarily in the markets we're already in, and filling in those existing markets and leveraging off of those management teams. And over the next couple of years, I think that's what we'll see.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","On the strategy of trying to capture a bit more of the retail sales side, where do you think you are in that? And I know your business model is much more heavy on the sort of -- the \"do it for me\" or the commercial side.","Thomas Gallagher","Well, I'd say that, as you know, we're 70% to 75% commercial and 25% to 30% retail. At 20% to 25% of our total volume, we do a fair amount of retail business, but we think there's some upside there, and we've got a couple of initiatives underway that are very early but are somewhat encouraging. And we'd like to continue to grow the retail business, at a minimum, in line with what the overall retail segment is growing, but preferably at a rate slightly in excess of that in the years ahead.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And just one sort of housekeeping issue. And maybe, Jerry, when you look at sort of the retirement and other retirement benefit liabilities, that numbers appeared to sort of jump a bit. Is there anything in that number that -- again, if I missed your commentary in your prepared remarks, I apologize.","Jerry W. Nix","No, we didn't address it specifically, but we do have a concern about where we're going with our pension liability and the pension expense. That's driven by some assumptions that we really don't have any control over. We did make a contribution of $57 million to our pension plan last year. Right now, we're looking at a smaller contribution in 2012. But the pension expense, we're projecting an increase on that. So there is a lot going on in the pension liability, pension expense side, Tony. And yes, it is a concern, and we're going to review every option that we have available to us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Richard Hilgert from Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of minor things first. The depreciation and amortization is going up in 2012, which -- that seems logical given your additional investments in the business. But I would've expected it to rise a bit more in 2011 versus 2010 instead of declining. Was there something in there that I didn't catch in the call that -- when you were going through the numbers?","Jerry W. Nix","No. We would have probably had some projects that we were amortizing off that disappeared on us, and we also would have had some intangibles that would have been included in that number that were fully amortized. But it should increase, you're right, as we invest more. We did squeeze down our CapEx numbers back during the recessionary period, and we're building that back up to what we would consider normal maintenance CapEx of around $120 million a year. And if that's the case, then you're going to see our D&A be around $90 million to $100 million.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","All right, okay. On the working capital, you have been doing a great job of keeping that to a minimum, especially relative to sales. The year-over-year change in working capital though, there again, I would've expected a bit more of a negative number given the receivables change and the investment in inventory. And when I add up the numbers on the balance sheet, I'm coming up with a much larger negative number than what's showing up there, just a negative of $25 million. Can you give us a little bit of detail about what's going on in that line?","Jerry W. Nix","I'm not sure, Richard, that I understand exactly where you're going with that, but our inventory was only up 2% on an 11% sales increase. So we did show progress there, and our receivables up 7% on a 7% fourth quarter. Our payables, we had an issue with payables. We were up 5% in payables, but we were up 26% in payables at 12\/31\/2010 because we had a number of vendors that we gave -- got extended terms from in 2010, and that's a onetime boost. It's a permanent boost, but it's onetime, and then we've got some others that we're looking to put on our vendor payable program here in 2012. So I'm not sure if that addresses what your specific question is, but we certainly can address that offline.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, that'd be fine. I'm just -- I'm referring to the negative $26 million in the cash flow statement in 2011. When I look at the balance sheet items and sum them all together, I'm coming up with a much larger negative number, that's all.","Jerry W. Nix","Well, that negative in that changes in operating assets and liabilities, that's inventory payable and receivables, and the big swing, we had about a $200-million swing in our payables.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Right, yes, exactly. That's why I'm saying I was thinking it should have been a larger negative than what it turned out...","Jerry W. Nix","Well, we had improvement in the inventory, but we'll take it offline with you.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Very good. The last question I wanted to touch on was the long-term view in the Office Products business. As you mentioned earlier, prior to the great recession, you were running high 9% operating margins there. And we've seen the operating margins erode down into the 7%, 6% sometimes range on a quarterly basis. With the secular change that's going on in that business, I'm wondering, is pricing such that the cost structure of the business won't align with an operating margin to get to where you had been before? Or is this business, long term, one that we could see the margins get back into that 9% range?","Thomas Gallagher","I think it will be a while, if at all, that we get back in that 9% to 10% range. But in prior conversations or calls, we've said that we did feel that with reasonable top line growth, that we could get the operating margins back to the 8.5% range. So that's our near-term objective, is to get them back up to close to 8.5%.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to the presenters for their closing remarks.","Jerry W. Nix","Thank you, Jodie. We appreciate each of you joining us on the call today, and we appreciate your continued interest in and support of Genuine Parts Company. We look forward to talking to you in the future.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sidney Jones","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company third quarter 2016 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full-year. Before we begin this morning please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses.","The Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the Company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We\u2019ll begin this morning with comments from our President and CEO, Paul Donahue. Paul?","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Sid, and let me add my welcome to all of you on the call this morning. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us. Before we begin our commentary on the quarter, we want to update you on Hurricane Matthew, a powerful and deadly storm which recently hit the coast of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas as well as the Caribbean.","This storm inflicted damages in excess of $5 billion and impacted the lives and businesses of countless GPC personnel and our good customer partners. There are many GPC associates, too many to call out today, who were mobilized around the clock before, during and after the storm, providing aid and assistance for those affected. We want to take this opportunity to publicly thank them for their selfless efforts.","From an operations perspective, we\u2019ve had a number of facilities and stores closed and\/or without power for long periods of time. While most operations are now back up and running, we still have stores in the Carolinas struggling with power outages and floodwaters. So now the real work begins, and our team will continue to support the cleanup efforts and provide assistance wherever and whenever needed.","Now earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2016 results. I\u2019ll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full-year. After that, we will open up the call to your questions.","So a quick recap of our third quarter results shows; sales for the quarter were $3.94 billion, which was up 0.5%. Net income was $185.3 million compared to $188 million last year, and earnings per share were $1.24 which is unchanged from last year\u2019s third quarter.","Our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations. Despite the challenging sales environment, we had planned for improved results for the second half of the year, and we came up short in the third quarter. As we will discuss throughout this call, we are intensely focused on our action plans to drive sales and reduce costs in the quarters ahead.","Total sales in the quarter included a 3.5% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you will hear more on our successful acquisition strategy as we review our business results. Currency exchange was neutral to our overall results for the first time in a number of quarters with the slightly favorable Canadian and Australian currencies offsetting the ongoing weakness in the Mexican peso.","Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ending September 30, our global Automotive sales were up 1.5%, which has improved from the 0.7% decrease in the second quarter. This quarter\u2019s increase includes an approximate 2.5% benefit from acquisitions and a currency tailwind of 0.5%.","Our total U.S. results were off 1% in the quarter and this follows a 2% decrease in the second quarter. This sequential improvement follows a fairly steep deceleration from a solid start to the year when U.S. sales were up 4%. And we would add that September was the strongest month in an otherwise challenging quarter. With that said, we continue to operate in a generally sluggish sales environment, which we believe relates to the ongoing softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring seasons.","As we noted on our last call, we had a similar weather pattern back in 2012 and experienced the same type of sluggish demand we are seeing today. What is different is that we had a hot summer across much of the U.S. this year, and we could see that having a positive impact on demand in the quarters ahead.","And one final comment here would be that our Eastern, Central and Midwest regions, which benefit the most from the normal winter weather patterns, represent more than 40% of our U.S. revenues and continue to significantly underperform the balance of the country.","We continue to analyze multitudes of data and scenarios including the impact of online competition, general competitive and pricing dynamics, trends and transportation, the number of vehicles entering our sweet spot and OE dealer warranties and services, among others. We do not believe that any one of these factors is having a material impact on our business.","We have concluded that while it is important to consider each of these factors as we plan for the future. The challenges we are facing today are in fact, transitory. As we anniversary last winter\u2019s mild weather and execute on our growth initiatives in the quarters ahead, we expect to further improve our sales results and ultimately return to our historical mid single-digit growth rates.","Turning now to a look at our U.S. company-owned store group. Same-store sales were down 2% in the third quarter, which is in line with our total U.S. sales before the positive impact of acquisitions. This follows flat year-over-year comps in the second quarter and plus 3% to begin the year.","DIY and retail sales at our company stores were down mid-single digits, driven by a decrease in transaction counts, while the average basket size was flat for the quarter. While disappointing overall, sales at the stores updated for our retail impact initiative are bucking this trend with double-digit retail sales increases.","And while not in enough stores yet to make a mark on our total retail comps, we are confident in the long-term positive benefits of these initiatives. We are on plan to rollout this new retail concept in 150 company-owned stores this year and will accelerate the project to add an additional 300 stores in 2017.","The commercial wholesale business at our company stores was down low single digits in the third quarter, driven by low to mid single-digit declines at our Major Accounts and fleet business. Sales to our AutoCare Centers were down slightly, although on a more positive note, we added nearly 500 new AutoCare memberships thus far in 2016 and stand at over 16,000 members today.","This is a testament to the overall value of this program to our independent installer base, and we look to this program to be a significant growth driver for us in the periods ahead. Our average wholesale transaction counts as well as ticket value were both down for the quarter.","Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers for all our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.5 years, lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains.","Miles driven increased 3.4% in August, the most recent data available and is up 3.1% year-to-date. August now marks 30 consecutive months of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.32 in the third quarter, well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases.","We want to also update you on our international businesses which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand and Australia, our core Automotive business is performing well with sales consistently up mid to high single digits. In addition, we continue to see solid contributions from our recent acquisitions and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs and AMX businesses acquired earlier this year.","Likewise, we are pleased to report that on September 1, we closed on the acquisition of ASL, a New Zealand-based automotive aftermarket distributor to the commercial side of the industry. ASL operates 15 branches with approximate annual revenues of US$15 million.","With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has grown now to 546 locations. This represents an increase of more than 100 net new stores over the past three years. Our leadership team in Asia Pacific continues to operate at a high level, and we see continued expansion opportunities in the quarters ahead.","At NAPA Canada, we continue to produce low single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada. The July 1 acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of OEM parts in Canada with annual revenues of approximately US$50 million, has been a great addition to our Canadian business.","Finally, in Mexico, our sales continue to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We now have 28 stores in Mexico today, up from 21 on June 30, and we have plans for additional store growth in the periods ahead. We continue to be encouraged by the long-term growth prospects for NAPA in Mexico.","We have built a solid foundation of international operations, which currently account for approximately 30% of our total Automotive revenues. As we look to the future, we are well positioned for future growth opportunities across these markets.","In summary, we faced a challenging sales environment in the U.S. during the third quarter, with these headwinds somewhat offset by the ongoing strength of our international operations as well as the positive impact of acquisitions and new distribution expansion.","We look to improve on this quarter\u2019s performance in the periods ahead by expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new-store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions.","Turning now to our Industrial business, Motion Industries ended the quarter down 0.7%, which has slightly improved from the 2% decrease we experienced in the second quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 2.5% and again, a slight improvement on a sequential basis.","As a reminder, this quarter\u2019s results include the August 1 acquisition of OBBCO, a regional industrial safety products distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. As we have said in recent quarters, our Industrial business has seemed to stabilize, although any signs of a meaningful recovery will most likely occur in 2017.","The industrial indices we track, such as industrial production, capacity utilization and the PMI, simply remain too choppy to indicate otherwise. What we do know, however, is that we have seen these cycles before, and we are confident in our sales strategies and ability to generate strong growth in this business when the market begins to strengthen. The question right now is one of timing.","A review of our business by industry segment, top customers and top product categories further supports the choppy markets. Among our top 12 Industry segments, our results were consistent with the second quarter, with three sectors up, seven down and two unchanged from last year. And among our top 12 product categories, six were up and six were down, also consistent with last quarter. And finally, among our top 20 customers, 13 were up and seven were down, which compares to 15 up and five down in the second quarter.","So the takeaway again this quarter is that our results were relatively consistent with the most recent quarters and remain mixed among our customers and products. With that said, we would add that September was our strongest daily sales month of the year and we are seeing growth across all regions of the U.S. other than in the oil and gas region of the Southwest.","The encouraging news out of the Southwest is, while still running negative numbers, they are closing the gap. Additional positive news for the Southwest is the move of oil prices back to the $50 range. We are also encouraged to see the level of exported goods improving from the 6% to 7% declines we experienced in the first half of the year. These trends bode well for the industrial markets.","Likewise, we recently announced the October 3 acquisition of Braas Company, a multiregional distributor of products and distribution services for industrial automation and control with estimated annual revenues of $90 million. The growth prospects for this segment of the industry including robotics, motion control and industrial networking are compelling, and the addition of such a well-positioned business will substantially enhance our automation capabilities.","So despite our cautionary stance on a near-term recovery, we continue to position this business for strong sales and earnings growth upon a recovery. You can also look for us to execute on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to EIS, our Electrical distribution segment. Sales for this group were down 9% due to several factors, some of which are also impacting our Industrial business. A few of the more impactful challenges this quarter include further weakness in our electrical markets, driven primarily by our business with the energy sector including oil, gas as well as coal.","We\u2019re also seeing lower copper pricing and the overall effects on demand. It appears these headwinds will persist into the fourth quarter. So as we work through this cycle, we\u2019ll be intensely focused on making the proper cost reductions and improving our efficiencies while also executing on our initiatives to drive meaningful sales growth over the long-term.","To that end, on the 1st of this month, we acquired Communications Products and Services, a leading distributor of plant product solutions for both aerial and underground broadband cable and wireless network infrastructure. CPS further strengthens our cable operations in the Western U.S. and should generate approximately $12 million in annual revenues.","And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business, which reported a 5% increase in sales for the third quarter. This is improved from a 1% increase in the second quarter, driven by an 11% contribution from recent acquisitions. Our acquisitions including Safety Zone are performing well and contributing nicely to our growth strategy for the facilities and breakroom supplies category.","Core sales for the Office business were down 6% in the third quarter, a decrease from the 4% core sales decrease in the second quarter. Primarily, this was driven by weaker sales through the mega channel, which was down low single-digits following mid single-digit growth through the first half of the year. Sales through the independent reseller channel were down mid-single digits, consistent with the declines we have seen all year.","From the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category, or FBS, posted strong growth in the quarter, while traditional office supplies, furniture and technology products each posted sales declines. This quarter was difficult for us and as you can see in the numbers, but we are confident in our abilities to show more progress in the quarters ahead.","Moving forward, we are focused on the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. Our growth strategy involves strategic bolt-on acquisitions to further enhance our capabilities in this category as well as the execution of our ongoing share-of-wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry.","So that is an overview of our performance by business. We continue to operate in a tough sales environment, but our teams are working hard in all aspects of our business to overcome these challenges and generate growth in the quarters ahead.","Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and full-year guidance. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We\u2019ll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information and then we\u2019ll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 billion for the third quarter was an increase of 0.5%.","Gross profit for the third quarter was 30.4% of sales, which is an increase from the 29.8% in the prior year quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by a favorable supplier incentive, product mix shift into higher-margin categories and the benefit of our more recent higher margin acquisitions.","Looking forward, we remain focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long-term. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively unchanged from where we\u2019ve been for some time with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through nine months in 2016 were down 0.7% in Automotive, up 0.4% in Industrial, up 0.2% in Office and down 1.3% in Electrical.","Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses for the third quarter were $907 million, up 4% from last year and 23% of sales. Our increase in expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the weak sales environment across all of our businesses.","In addition, as we initially integrate our acquisitions into our existing operations, we can experience an uptick in costs. Ultimately, we\u2019re able to eliminate these excess costs and actually reduce our overall cost as we build on the synergies that we create with the combined businesses.","We would also add that, with certain acquisitions, their models show higher gross margins, as mentioned earlier, but also a higher operating cost as well, so that\u2019s a factor in the current quarter.","In the current sales environment, it\u2019s imperative that we review in detail any expense that we have to ensure we are operating with the lowest possible cost structure. Managing our expenses with tight cost control measures is ongoing at GPC but especially critical today, and we recognize that there\u2019s always need for improvement.","Probably the most impactful initiative for us over the long-term is that our businesses are rationalizing their facilities to streamline their cost structure wherever appropriate. This serves to reduce our distribution cost as well as our headcount and payroll-related costs, which are significant expenses for us.","Thus far, in 2016, we have closed or consolidated a number of distribution centers and branches, and we reduced our headcount by approximately 1%. Although these steps are meaningful, not all of the savings are in our numbers yet, and importantly, you\u2019ll see many more opportunities for further consolidations.","Our ongoing investments in technology, which we\u2019ve talked about for a long time now, are allowing us to do more and more of this type of rationalization while also maintaining our excellent customer service standards. So going forward, you can look for us to continue building a lower cost but highly effective distribution infrastructure across our businesses.","Now we\u2019ll discuss the results by segment. Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.1 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Operating profit of $198 million is down 2%, with the operating margin for this group at 9.4% compared to 9.8% in the third quarter last year. This primarily reflects the pressure on our operating expenses due to the decline in our core Automotive sales.","Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, 0.7% decrease from the prior year and 29% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $86 million is down 5%, and our operating margin is 7.4% compared to the 7.7% last year.","Similar to our Automotive margins, the pressure on the margin for this business relates to the lack of sales growth and its impact on our operating expenses despite good progress with our ongoing cost reductions and facility rationalizations.","Office Products revenues were $535 million and 14% of our total sales, up 5% overall but down 6% excluding acquisitions. Our operating profit of $30 million is down 17%, and our operating margin is 5.7%. This group experienced significant pressure on their operating expenses this quarter due to three primary factors, the decrease in their organic sales; the rising cost associated with serving a growing number of sales channels; and incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. The Office team is taking immediate measures to address these areas and drive cost savings in the quarters ahead.","The Electrical Group sales were $178 million in the quarter, down 9% from 2015 and 4% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $14 million is down 29%, and the operating margin for this group is 8.0% compared to a 10.2% margin last year. The decline in revenues was difficult to overcome this quarter, but this team is also working fast to reduce their cost and to show improvement in the quarters ahead.","So our total operating profit margin for the third quarter was 8.3% compared to 8.9% last year, disappointing but essentially a function of the weak sales environment, which we have discussed, and we\u2019re intensely focused on reducing our cost to drive margin expansion. We had net interest expense of $5.2 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of approximately $20 million.","Our total amortization expense was $10.3 million for the third quarter, and we would estimate total amortization expense of approximately $39 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense is $27.3 million for the quarter and we would expect the full-year to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. So the combined depreciation and amortization number would be approximately $145 million to $160 million for the full-year.","The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $21.1 million in the quarter compared to $34.3 million last year. The decrease in corporate expense primarily reflects the benefit of gains on the sale of certain real estate as well as the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments. For the full-year, we currently expect corporate expense to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million.","Our tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 36.4% compared to 37.4% last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, and the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment we just discussed, which is nontaxable. For the full year, we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.5%. Net income for the quarter of $185.3 million and EPS of $1.24, which was equal to the third quarter last year.","Now we\u2019ll turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which we further strengthened in the third quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at September 30 was $225 million, a $26 million increase from last year, even as we\u2019ve increased our spending for acquisitions. So our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across each of our distribution businesses.","Accounts receivable of $2 billion at September 30, is up 3.5% from the prior year, and adjusted for the impact of currency translation is up 2%. We continue to closely manage our receivables, and we remain satisfied with our quality at this time.","Our inventory at quarter end was $3.1 billion, which is up 6% from the prior year, although it\u2019s actually down slightly when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions as well as currency. Our teams are doing a very good job of effectively managing our inventory levels, and we\u2019ll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward.","Accounts payable at September 30 was $3.1 billion, up 9% from last year, including a slight benefit of currency. Our ongoing progress in growing our accounts payable reflects improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. This has had a positive impact on our working capital and days in payables, and we would add that our AP-to-inventory ratio stands at 98.5% at September 30.","Our working capital of $1.5 billion at September 30 is down from last year and showing steady improvement over multiple periods. Effectively managing our working capital remains a high priority for the Company and we continue to expect further improvement in the quarters ahead.","Our total debt of $775 million is unchanged from June 30 and it compares to a $625 million in total debt last year. Our debt includes two $250 million term notes and a new five-year 2.39% $50 million term note that closed in July. We have another $225 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. One of our two $250 million term notes is due this November and we\u2019ve recently entered into an agreement for a new 10-year note with a favorable interest rate of 2.99%, down from the current rate of 3.35%.","Our total debt capitalization is approximately 19% and we are comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We continue to believe that our current structure provides the Company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may have.","In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We have consistently generated strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we are well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect our cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full-year and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and are integral to the growth plans for our Company. Thus far in 2016, we have added a number of new businesses across each of the four business segments. These are excellent strategic fits for us and collectively, we expect them to generate over $600 million in annual revenues going forward.","As we move forward, we\u2019ll continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We\u2019ll continue to target those bolt-on types of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, but we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment.","Turning to share repurchases. We\u2019ve purchased 249,000 shares in the third quarter and 1.6 million shares for the nine months. Today, we have 4.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","Our investment in capital expenditures was $37 million for the third quarter and $87 million through September. For the year, we are continuing to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $120 million to $140 million for the full-year.","Turning to our dividend. The 2016 dividend is $2.63 a share, which is a 7% increase from the $2.46 per share paid in 2015. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.","Now this concludes our financial update for the third quarter of 2016. In summary, our businesses are operating in a difficult sales environment, but our teams are hard at work to overcome these challenges and to generate growth. From top to bottom, we are evaluating the cost structures to drive greater efficiencies and cost savings. We believe these efforts will position the company well for future sales and earnings growth.","Now we\u2019ll turn to our guidance for the full-year. Based on our current performance and the outlook for the balance of the year, we\u2019re updating our full-year guidance for total sales to flat to up 1% from the previous up 1% to up 2%. Among our business segments, we\u2019re lowering Automotive sales guidance to up 1% to up 2% from the previous up 2% to up 3%.","We\u2019re reducing our Industrial sales guidance to flat to down 1% from a previous flat to up 1%. We\u2019re reducing our Electrical sales to down 5% to down 6% from a previous down 2% to down 3%. We are maintaining our Office sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3%.","This sales outlook includes those acquisitions included in our nine-month results as well as the Braas and CPS acquisitions that closed this month. On the earnings side, we\u2019re lowering our earnings per share guidance to $4.55 to $4.60 from the previous $4.70 to $4.75 for the full-year.","So this completes our prepared remarks, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Paul at this time.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Carol. Before we go to questions, I just wanted to add a few additional remarks we feel are important. First, we want to remind you of the action steps we outlined in our last call which are the four building blocks of our growth strategy. These are: one, executing our key initiatives to capture greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; two, an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both geographical as well as product line expansions; three, building out our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses; and four, further expanding our U.S. and international store footprint.","We are confident that over time, our intense focus in these four key areas will positively impact our sales performance and drive the ongoing steady and consistent growth we look to achieve and our stakeholders expect. Second, we want to assure you that our current performance was not up to our expectations.","As we speak, we continue to evaluate our cost structure in all areas of the business to drive immediate savings and longer-term efficiencies. Our goal is to show improved results in the quarters ahead and better position the company for sustainable growth well into the future. As Carol shared earlier, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows to support our efforts.","So in closing as we look ahead, we\u2019re excited with the many opportunities we have at GPC and can point to many positive factors fueling our optimism. We operate in four large and fragmented industries with less than 10% market share in each. The outlook for the automotive aftermarket continues to be positive. The industrial sector is showing early signs of a recovery.","Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, supporting effective capital allocation strategy, our steady track record of increased dividends for 60 consecutive years and, last, but certainly not least, our team of 40,000 dedicated GPC Associates around the globe committed to delivering exceptional customer service.","So despite our current challenges, we feel very good about the long-term prospects for growth at GPC. We\u2019ve been operating now for 88-plus years and we\u2019ve been through challenging times before. And as we move forward, we\u2019ll make the necessary adjustments and we will emerge as a stronger company. We look forward to reporting to you on our progress.","So with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now take our first question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good morning everybody.","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Horvers","So wanted to follow-up, start with the September commentary around the U.S. NAPA business and also on the Motion Industries side. Can you put some brackets around that? Is it back to flat? Is it - turn positive? Or was it just simply less negative?","Paul Donahue","The Automotive, well, I\u2019ll give you, Chris, the kind of the cadence for the quarter, as I\u2019m sure that will come up. What we saw in our overall Automotive business was predominantly flat in July and August, and then we saw a low to mid single - low single-digit increase in the month of September.","So we did see some improvement in September. And while it\u2019s early yet in October, that\u2019s holding a bit. So it gives us a bit of renewed optimism as we head into the all-important fourth quarter. And hopefully, if we get a little winter weather headed our way in November, December that can only further help things.","And in Industrial, we\u2019re seeing some green shoots as well. If you look at the indices that we follow, the ISM September numbers were positive, which rebounded from a negative number in August. So we\u2019re starting to see a bit of an uptick in our Industrial business as well.","Christopher Horvers","So just to clarify that, that flat in July and August and up low single digits in the month of September, that\u2019s the U.S. business or I thought the U.S. is actually down during the quarter.","Paul Donahue","That\u2019s our global Automotive business, Chris.","Christopher Horvers","Okay, any particulars around the U.S. business? Did it follow that similar trend?","Paul Donahue","Our overall trend in Automotive was if you go - because you had a lot of calendar movement in the quarter with a couple less days in July, a couple of extra days in August. So it was kind of all over the board, but the positive is we did see a more positive trend in September than what we saw in July and August in our U.S. business, so similar trend to our global business.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then as you think about NAPA, I think I was curious at the product category level, was the improvement sort of a lag hot weather repair and maintenance on hot weather-sensitive products? Or did you see more broad-based improvement in some of the more core less weather-sensitive categories?","Paul Donahue","No. You hit it right on the head, Chris. The growth that we saw in the quarter was temp-related products. So our Electrical business obviously led by batteries was up mid-single digits. We saw a nice increase in our AC type products. We also saw decent business in our tool and equipment side. Where we\u2019re still seeing a bit of a struggle is some of our under car lines, some of our ride control, heavy duty.","And we don\u2019t often talk about it on this call, but our capital equipment business, so things like tire changers, wheel balancers, lifts, that business has been off as well. So to your point, we did see some of the benefits of the hot temps coming out of the summer, and it drove business in our Electrical and AC business.","Christopher Horvers","And then last question, as you think about just - as you look into the fourth quarter, do you have concern that the business could actually ebb from here given the improvement? It sounds like it was the hot weather side. Or is it just simply in the comparisons dropped off so much in the fourth quarter that would neutralize that? Thank you.","Paul Donahue","Well, you heard the guidance, Chris, and we did take the guidance down a little bit in Q4. We\u2019re comfortable in the range that we told you folks, which is Automotive being up one to up two. Certainly, we\u2019re taking a cautious outlook, and we would hope to outperform. But again, a bit of that is out of our control, so we\u2019ll hope for a little bit of a stronger core business.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. Thanks very much. Good luck.","Paul Donahue","You are welcome. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question.","Paul Donahue","Hey. Good morning, Seth.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Seth Basham","My first question is just making sure I understand some of the trends in the auto business in the U.S. for the quarter. As I heard you correctly, I think you spoke to 0% comps for company-owned stores, but the total U.S. business that was in the second quarter a negative 2% in 3Q, and total U.S. business was down 2% in the second quarter and up 1% in the third quarter, is that correct?","Paul Donahue","Let me see if I\u2019m correct with you, Seth. The 2% same-store sales decline in Q3 in U.S. was accurate. Our overall - let me just pull the numbers, our overall business in the U.S., was down 1% and plus - and then, when you add in acquisitions, acquisitions actually added in a point for us.","Seth Basham","Got it. Okay. So if you look at the U.S. business, then you saw company-owned stores doing all that work in the independently owned stores on a sort of daily sales basis.","Paul Donahue","No. I think the actual - our store sales in our company-owned stores and our independent owners were actually right on cue with one another. On the same-store sales were both down about 2%, and then you add back in the strength of acquisitions, gets us to your down 1.","Seth Basham","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, if you think about the dynamic between ticket and traffic, particularly on the DIFM side of the business, it\u2019s the second quarter in a row that we\u2019re seeing a decline in ticket on the DIFM side. Is that simply due to deflation? Or is there something else going on from a mix standpoint that\u2019s driving that?","Paul Donahue","No. I think that - I mean it could be a bit, Seth, but we\u2019re not seeing anything dramatic. Look, we\u2019re in constant touch with our key customers, whether they be the Major Accounts of which we have a real focus on our top five Major Accounts. We\u2019re very close to our - obviously to our NAPA AutoCare centers. Their business is soft, and I think our business is trending with theirs, and the bay counts, as we do our survey throughout the marketplace, bay counts are down a bit on both sides, Major Accounts and AutoCare. So it\u2019s just kind of a soft environment out there right now.","Seth Basham","Okay. Now last question for me is just on gross margins. If you could tease out the drivers of benefit a little bit more, which were the biggest drivers of improvement between supplier incentives and the product mix shifts and the acquisitions that would be helpful. We\u2019re just trying to understand the sustainability of that improvement.","Paul Donahue","Yes, okay. I\u2019ll let Carol take that.","Carol Yancey","Yes. I would point you more, if you think about where we are through the nine months, so we\u2019re up 17 basis points through the nine months. And that\u2019s probably a more normalized where we would expect to be. But in the quarter, what we had is a combination of the factors mentioned.","So there was some - definitely, the customer and product mix would be probably a part of it and that\u2019s coming from areas, if you think about what Paul mentioned on the product side and Automotive on the product side, some of the application parts and you\u2019ve got higher margins there, even when you move over to the Office side and the categories you talked about, you have a definite product mix shift there that was positive.","And then on the acquisitions, we mentioned that they come with a higher gross margin but they also have higher SG&A and then the increased rebates. I think if you look at the quarter, you would probably say that they\u2019re pretty evenly safe of how they contributed, but I would also point you to more than nine months number to say that, that\u2019s you know hopefully, where we can continue to hold.","Seth Basham","Very good. Thanks a lot and good luck.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Paul Donahue","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys.","Paul Donahue","Hey, good morning, Scot.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hi, just one more sales cadence question and I\u2019m sure the horse is grow at this point, but in the U.S., same-store sales, was September positive?","Carol Yancey","Yes, it was.","Scot Ciccarelli","Gotcha. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And another housekeeping item. How big were the real estate gain that you booked in the quarter?","Carol Yancey","So the fluctuation between the corporate experience - or the other expense, half of the increases related to the real estate gains on several pieces of property and half was related to the retirement plan valuation adjustment.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it, so 50\/50. Okay, and then the third question, I guess this is really an opinion at this point, but Paul, you\u2019ve been involved with the NAPA for many years at this point, would you expect better performance from NAPA just given how warm this year\u2019s summer weather was?","Paul Donahue","As I said in my prepared comments, Scot, we\u2019re not pleased with where we find ourselves. If there was anything that was a bit of a surprise for me personally this quarter was our core business and you could almost go to all of our business. But certainly, Automotive and Office, the softness that we saw in our core business certainly is concerning and we always expect more out of our teams. So yes, I think that\u2019s a safe comment. We did expect better.","Scot Ciccarelli","So do you think there\u2019s any kind of share shift occurring?","Paul Donahue","I expected that question, Scot, and I have to tell you that again, as we talk to our key customers, as I was mentioned in an earlier question, we see what their business and how their business is trending, whether it would be with a big national account or with our almost 17,000 AutoCares, and the business climate and the bay count is soft. If we were looking out and seeing a robust business environment with those key customers and key AutoCare centers, I would be more concerned than I am.","I do believe what we\u2019re seeing right now in Automotive is transitory. I think we saw it a bit when we came out of 2012 in similar weather patterns. So our expectation, Scot, is that when we get back to - if we get back to a normal winter weather patterns that we will see the rebound in our Automotive business. But no, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re losing share.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. All right. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.","Paul Donahue","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Hi, good morning, guys.","Paul Donahue","Hi, good morning, Bret.","Carol Yancey","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan","Hi, can we talk a little bit more about the U.S. trends in the quarter? Really sort of regional dispersion and maybe how we started that out the quarter I guess northern performance versus South and West. And I think you commented that the North was still the weakest, but did the back half close as the quarter progressed?","Paul Donahue","It did close, Bret, but I would tell you the trend that we saw in Q3 was much the same as we saw in Q2, which is those big northern divisions which, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, is a large portion of our overall business, so the Northeast, the Central, and I compare those two divisions that are performing well and I have to separate out the West.","The West for us is an outlier and it\u2019s an outlier in a good way. Our Western Division business is performing quite well and outperforming all of our other divisions. But if I take the Florida, Southern Atlantic, there\u2019s still - we\u2019re still seeing that 400 basis point to 500 basis point gap between the guys up north and the guys in the warmer climates and - but we did see that begin to close a bit in September, which is encouraging.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. And then one question on the DIY comp. I think you said it was down mid single-digits, and you said you were sort of examining some - the emerging online competition. Obviously, it\u2019s pretty early for Amazon to be having any real impact given their recent entry in the space. But are you analyzing anything like conversion rates? Or is there any feeling that there\u2019s a competitive shift going on in the DIY market that\u2019s explaining mid single-digit decline?","Paul Donahue","Again, Bret, we\u2019re looking at everything, as we always do, in our business, whether it\u2019d be ticket counts and basket size, and we are not pleased with where we find our core retail business. I would tell you that I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re losing share to the online players. That is - I mean clearly, they\u2019re growing their business, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at the expense of our retail business.","But I would mention that where we\u2019re encouraged is where we see growth with our impact stores, the stores that we have relayed and retrofitted to the new look. We\u2019ll have a 150 of those by year-end. We\u2019re seeing double-digit growth there. So it tells me that the retail business is there to be had.","We\u2019ve got another 300 stores queued up for 2017 to go to that new look. So we\u2019ll have, hopefully, north of 450 stores in the new format of our - which would be almost half of our company-owned stores by the end of 2017. And our plan then would be we will be able to move the overall needle.","Right now with just 150 stores with the new format, it\u2019s tough for us to move the overall retail needle. And I would also mention, Bret, I think that - look, I think the consumer is under a little bit of stress which could be impacting retail across the board.","Bret Jordan","Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Paul Donahue","You are welcome Bret.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","Thanks for taking my question. Quick follow-up. Why was California so good? Is that your retail initiative? Or is there something else driving that?","Paul Donahue","Our California business I should\u2026","Chris Bottiglieri","West Coast.","Paul Donahue","Yes. West Coast, it\u2019s really West Coast. Obviously California is a big, big part of our West Coast business. We\u2019ve been aggressive. Our team has been aggressive out there in conversions, bringing some competitive stores over to the NAPA banner. We\u2019ve done a few bolt-on - small bolt-on acquisitions, but our core business is healthier out there as well, which goes back to - and kind of reinforces the comments that you have to be led to believe that the impact that we\u2019re seeing on the Automotive business is being largely driven by weather patterns because in those warm climates, certainly out west is reflective - the business is okay.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay. And then unrelated follow-up. Let me get a sense for as much as you can give us, you kind of answered this on gross margins, what is the inverse of that on the SG&A rate. Can you maybe bifurcate a little bit, tell us how much is kind of integration, one-time costs, that you kind of lap, what are some of the other drivers? I imagine its mix shifting again? And then if you could give us any direction overall, like how much of your - by segment, what your fixed cost structure looks like, trying to get a sense of incremental margins as your sales kind of fluctuates?","Carol Yancey","Yes, so I would tell you, the gross margin improvement that we had were across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses. And then at the same time, the SG&A deterioration was in all four of our segments. And when you look at the core sales, the majority of what you\u2019re seeing there is related to the core sales. And where we modeled, where we thought we would be second half of the year, we weren\u2019t quite there. We thought we would be. So we\u2019ve got just - it takes us longer to get those cost out and we\u2019re really adjusting to a lower level of core sales growth.","And then I think the other big part of this is the acquisitions that certainly - I mean we\u2019ve made 16 or so acquisitions this year, and all those acquisitions come in, many of them come in with a different cost structure, but certainly accretive on the margin side, but they\u2019re coming in with higher SG&A. And in some, you have some incremental costs when you first have these acquisitions, and it takes up a couple of quarters to get those costs out.","So I think all-in-all, the weak sales factor is the biggest thing that\u2019s impacting the SG&A, but I can tell you, our teams are working very, very hard right now to address all of our costs and we\u2019ve done a lot of work on our headcount. We\u2019ve done a lot of work on our facilities. And then you will see the improvements we\u2019ve done, it just hasn\u2019t been enough to offset the decline in the core sales.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay. Then I promise one small last one, I hope it\u2019s a small one. The other revenue count seemed to kind of get a little worse this quarter. What\u2019s driving that? Looks like the implication I think to the story.","Carol Yancey","Yes. So the other revenue line, that is where we have the impact of our additional sales discounts and incentives. And so when we have the acquisitions that have flowed into the segment sales, with those acquisitions come their additional sales, customer discounts, and so a lot of that increase is related to the acquisitions coming in. So it\u2019s really the growth number is up above in the segments and that\u2019s the net adjustment. Yes, we\u2019ll have a more normalized. If you use the Q3 number, that\u2019s probably going to be our more normal go-forward amount.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay. Great. Thanks again for all the questions.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Paul Donahue","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. I had a couple of questions. Paul, I\u2019d like to start on some of the breakdowns of what\u2019s been strong or weak. I think you mentioned that fleet in Major Accounts were negative. Were they more negative than the Company? And just remind us what percentage of your sales are in that bucket.","Paul Donahue","Well, yes. Thanks, Greg. Those were two challenged businesses for us this past quarter, both down low single-digits. Our Major Accounts business is approaching $2 billion in sales, so it\u2019s a significant part of our overall wholesale business. Our AutoCare center business, which was down slightly year-over-year and I mean very slightly, represents well over $1 billion as well. And fleet, a comment on the fleet. It was down more than the overall business. And again, not surprised, not a total surprise because we have a significant business in the heavy-duty class 6, 7, 8 truck business and we\u2019re seeing softness across that element of our business as well.","Greg Melich","Could you speak on that in particular because I think you mentioned ride control and heavy-duty. Are there any shared shifts going on there that could explain that? Or do you think this is just overall demand and I have another question.","Paul Donahue","No. I honestly don\u2019t think so. We just spent a day with our heavy-duty team earlier this week, Greg, and we did an acquisition in that space earlier this year. So we\u2019re getting more and more broader in our scope and in our footprint, in our heavy-duty business. And honestly, we think that business is under pressure across the entire heavy-duty industry.","Greg Melich","Okay, great. And Carol, I think in your prepared comments, I heard in SG&A there was a real estate sale and a pension valuation adjustment. Could you quantify those?","Carol Yancey","Yes, I did earlier. That\u2019s in the other line of corporate expense line. So the delta between last year Q3 and this year Q3, the delta is half related to real estate gains and half related to the pension retirement valuation adjustment, and that is not in the segment margin. That\u2019s in other.","Greg Melich","Got it. And the real estate is any of that - is that all just one-off? Or is there any of that, that might occur on, say the pension side if it\u2019s an accrual?","Carol Yancey","It\u2019s largely one-off. I mean we have transactions all the time, but there are some more significant ones this quarter, so that\u2019s largely one-off. Therefore, when we gave our guidance for corporate expense for the full-year, you\u2019re going to be back to a more normal run rate.","Greg Melich","Got it. And then I guess this is sort of one last question whoever wants to take it. If you think about the change in your guidance for the year, what was the main driver of that? Was it just the business being weaker than expected in the third quarter or what you\u2019re expecting for the fourth quarter?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So Greg, it\u2019s a combination of what you said, but the Q3, the weaker sales is the primary driver, which we had that in Q3 and we\u2019re expecting that in Q4, but we certainly factored in what occurred in Q3, but the primary driver is the weak sales, but we took into account the incremental one-time things that we had in Q3 as well.","Greg Melich","So you factored in also something lower in the fourth quarter, obviously, but the bulk of it is in the third quarter miss basically.","Carol Yancey","Correct.","Greg Melich","Got it. Okay. Thanks good luck.","Paul Donahue","Thanks Greg.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot and good afternoon.","Paul Donahue","Hi, good afternoon, Matt.","Matthew Fassler","Hi, how are you? I want to slice and dice the Automotive discussion, I guess, one other way. We\u2019ve talked about competition, we\u2019ve talked about weather, we\u2019ve talked about regions. If we think about the Northeast and that part of the country that we thought about as being particularly weather-sensitive, it seems to have been challenged for almost everyone who plays in that part of the country for more than the past year. So for a longer period of time, do you think there\u2019s anything from a demand perspective transpiring in that part of the country that\u2019s impacting the aftermarket relative to the rest of the U.S?","Paul Donahue","From a demand perspective, Matt, certainly, it\u2019s interesting to listen to our peer groups and the other players in our industry. And if there is one consistent theme, it is that softness up in that part of the country. I would also - in addition to potentially softer overall demand, I would tell you that in terms of the competitive nature of that part of the country, it\u2019s as tough as any market that we compete in. There\u2019s a lot of players. There\u2019s a lot of strong players, a lot of strong regional players. It\u2019s a competitive market and again we don\u2019t believe we\u2019re losing market share, but it is a challenging market no doubt.","Matthew Fassler","If I can ask a second question. If you could recap your disclosure of the pieces of your same-store sales numbers, I want to make sure I heard some of the numbers right. Because I think you talked about a negative two decline overall for company-owned stores in the U.S. and I just want to make sure I understand the components of that to reconcile those to the total.","Paul Donahue","Well, Matt, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to want to get into all of that detail, but I would suffice to say that our overall same-store sales, as mentioned, was down two. We had a point that - a positive point through acquisitions which led to our overall U.S. business decline of 1%.","Matthew Fassler","I guess I was thinking about the comments you made on DIY and commercial. I think you said commercial down low singles and DIY down a bit more. And I was trying to solve that with a minus two that you discussed. And those might not be apples-to-apples numbers. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get my arms around.","Paul Donahue","No, the - and obviously, you know our DIFM business is our bread and butter, and our DIFM business is really what drives our overall same-store sales number. Retail is still an overall smaller percentage, but our DIFM business was down in that very low single-digit number.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. And then one final question, very brief one, Carol, you spoke about the international mix of business and the impact on the of tax rate. It sounds like that was only one part of what drove the tax rate lower this quarter. But as we think out to subsequent years given the deals that you\u2019ve done outside the U.S., should that tax rate now be below 37% on a secular basis? Do you see that in your future?","Carol Yancey","We probably - to your point, we probably are more in a steady state of probably assuming that there is nothing beyond this point and no tax law changes, we probably are in a 36% to 36.5% rate and that would just assume the same mix that we have today, but it would be dependent on future acquisitions or any tax law changes, but I think you\u2019re right.","Matthew Fassler","Great. Thank you so much guys.","Paul Donahue","Thanks, Matt.","Carol Yancey","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli.","Brian Sponheimer","Good afternoon.","Paul Donahue","Hey, good afternoon, Brian.","Brian Sponheimer","Just one question and may lead to a follow-up about the balance sheet. You had almost a $200 million increase in inventories on a year-over-year basis and $80 million quarter-to-quarter. Some of that\u2019s obviously coming from your acquisitions, but is any - just a lag from a sluggish sales environment? And how do you see that trending throughout the balance of the year?","Carol Yancey","Yes. Actually our inventories are flat when you take out the acquisitions and currency. So we don\u2019t think - I mean the acquisition was a pretty significant number in inventory, so we don\u2019t think there is anything there. But having said that, and certainly if you say we\u2019re pleased with flat, but we also know we have further opportunities with some of this facility rationalizations and some of our productivity improvements to further tighten down the inventory. So that maybe a further source of working capital for us going forward.","Brian Sponheimer","Okay. So if I\u2019m just thinking about this, if your total sales were flat and acquisitions contributed 350 basis points there, in an ideal world, your flat year-over-year for inventory, is that 3% number a potential working capital source target as we kind of move forward? Or are these inventory initiatives going to require at least some safety stock as you\u2019d handle them?","Carol Yancey","I don\u2019t think they will. And I think, like I said, there\u2019s a lot of initiatives going across all of our businesses, but I don\u2019t think we really have that going forward.","Brian Sponheimer","Okay. Thank you very much.","Paul Donahue","Thanks, Brian.","Carol Yancey","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Hey, guys.","Paul Donahue","Hey, Elizabeth.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Hi. I just wanted to start with one question about acquisition opportunities, and you mentioned that you\u2019re open to some larger acquisitions in that typical $25 million to $150 million annualized revenue target. How many such larger businesses are there out there that might actually make sense to incorporate into your business? In other words, how fragmented is this industry?","Paul Donahue","Well, if you think about our global footprint now, Elizabeth, and you think about four different industries that we conduct business in, there are multiple acquisition opportunities. So when you take into account Asia Pacific, you take into account Canada, Mexico, U.S., and then our Office business, our Industrial business, our Automotive, we look at - as well as Electrical, we look at all of our businesses. And we\u2019ve actually now - we\u2019ve completed 16, 17 acquisitions already this year, and they\u2019ve impacted all four businesses and have been in most every geographical region that we conduct business in. So there is no shortage of opportunities out there.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Great, that\u2019s really helpful. And sort of on the reverse side, have you entertained at all the idea of divesting any of the four business segments? Or do you view them all as core and yielding synergies for the total business?","Paul Donahue","Yes. So we get asked that question often, Elizabeth. As of today, we\u2019re quite pleased to be in the four businesses that we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve got strategies in the works in all four. We do believe the four; you mentioned the synergies that they bring to Genuine Parts Company. So as of today, we are committed to all four. That\u2019s not to say at any point in time in the future, if we get to a point where we don\u2019t believe either we\u2019re the best owner of the business or that we can grow a business, we would consider divesting that business. We\u2019ve done it in the past. But at this point, we have no plans to do that.","Elizabeth Suzuki","All right. Thanks very much.","Paul Donahue","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Carol Yancey","We\u2019d like to thank you for your support and your interest in Genuine Parts Company. Thank you for your participation today, and we look forward to reporting back out with our year-end earnings in February. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference will be recorded. Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Jones, you may begin your conference.","Sidney G. Jones","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts first quarter conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2013.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Sid, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning.","Now earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2013 results. And hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. For those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter of $3,199,000,000, which was up 0.6%. Net income was $144.4 million, which was down 1%, and earnings per share were $0.93 this year, which is even with the $0.93 reported for the first quarter last year.","As we covered in our year-end conference call, we felt that the first quarter of this year would be our most challenging, largely due to the fact that Q1 of 2012 was our strongest of the year, when sales were up 7% and earnings per share were up 16%, and then partly due to the slowing revenue trend that we saw develop over the second half of last year.","Additionally, we have 1 less sales day in Q1 of this year, which equates to about 1.6% of revenue growth. And it's interesting to look at our average daily sales performance over the quarter. We got off to a decent start, with January and February average daily sales being up mid single digit, but then the March average daily sales was relatively flat, consistent with the moderation in overall retail sales, and we ended the quarter with an average daily sales increase of just over 2%.","And looking at the sales results by segment, our strongest performance came from Automotive at plus 3.4%. And Paul will cover this in more detail in a moment.","Industrial, Electrical and Office Products each had modest sales decreases in the quarter, with Industrial ending the quarter down 2%, Office Products down 1% and Electrical down 5%. And we'll make a few comments about the non-Automotive businesses, starting with Industrial.","The first quarter of 2012 was Motion Industries' strongest quarter of the year by far, when they were up 12%, so they were going up against a challenging comparison. However, the 2% decrease in the quarter this year continues a deceleration in our Industrial growth rates that we saw develop over the second half of last year.","Among our top 10 customer segments, 6 had increases in the quarter, with automotive, pulp and paper and lumber and wood products showing the strongest results. But then, 4 of our top 10 customer segments were down in the quarter, with equipment and machinery showing the biggest decline, followed by coal, aggregate and cement. Among our top 10 product categories, 4 are showing year-to-date increases, 1 is even and 5 are running behind through the first quarter.","So from both a customer and a product standpoint, we're seeing some inconsistency and choppiness in our results, somewhat indicative of the uncertainty and cautiousness that we see among a number of our customers. With that said, however, we remain encouraged by the current levels of both industrial production and capacity utilization indices.","Despite the modest drop in March, these have remained relatively constant over the past several months, and they have proven to be a fairly reliable 6 to 9 month leading demand indicator for us. And our expectation is for a gradual improvement in demand for our Industrial business over the remainder of the year.","Moving on to EIS, our Electrical\/Electronic company, they had a challenging quarter with sales down 5%. The electronic side of the business actually had a very good first quarter, with sales up low double digits. Unfortunately, this is the smallest segment of EIS' business, and their solid results were pulled down by a mid single-digit decrease in electrical and a double-digit decrease in the wire and cable segment.","The biggest factor in the electrical segment was a drop-off in demand in the alternative energy sector. And the biggest factor contributing to the wire and cable decrease was a slowdown in the defense contractor business, which we attribute to the near-term impact of sequestration.","However, we do see some early signs of improvement in this side of the business. And this, combined with our internal growth initiatives, still give us an expectation of positive growth for the full year from the Electrical\/Electronic segment.","And finally, a few comments about Office Products. After the 3% sales increase in the fourth quarter of 2012, we were a bit encouraged. And we saw low single-digit average daily sales increases in January and February. However, we experienced a drop-off in March, and we ended the quarter down 1%.","Our independent resellers business was down modestly, and our Mega or national account business was flat. From a product perspective, technology and core office supplies had small decreases in the quarter. Furniture was flat, and cleaning and breakroom grew nicely.","So from an overall perspective, the office products industry remains quite challenging, and we don't anticipate any material change in the near term. However, at this point, we continue to expect that our Office Products team will deliver a modest sales increase for the full year.","So that's a brief overview of our Industrial, Electrical and Office Products businesses. And at this point, I will ask Paul to give you an update on the Automotive operations. Paul?","Paul D. Donahue","Thank you, Tom. I'd like to add my welcome to each of you this morning. I'm pleased to join Carol and Tom and have the opportunity to provide an update on the first quarter performance of our North American Automotive business.","Automotive continues to be the company's largest business segment, and we ended the first quarter with a 3% increase with 1 less day in the month.","On a per day basis, it puts us up approximately 5%. Given that the first quarter of 2012 was our strongest sales quarter of the year, then you add in the fact that the Easter holiday fell in the month of March this year, we were not surprised by our results.","The 3% revenue growth in the first quarter includes flat comp store sales and continued positive sales contribution from our acquisition of Quaker City Motor Parts. Sales to our commercial accounts, the dominant segment of our business, continued to outpace our retail sales. Once again, in the first quarter, our results varied by region of the country, with the traditional cold-weather regions lagging the other regions in the U.S. These cold-weather regions did narrow the gap in the first quarter, and they continue to gain positive momentum as we move through the second quarter.","We are approaching our 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of Quaker City Motor Parts. Their first quarter sales contributions were in line with our expectations. And we continue to be excited with the growth opportunities the Quaker City team will provide to us in the future.","As we mentioned earlier, our commercial business continued to outperform our retail business in the first quarter. Within our company-owned store group, the commercial side of our business ended the quarter up 1%, consistent with our growth in this segment in the previous 3 quarters.","Non-fleet-related business performed reasonably well, generating a 3% increase. It was led by solid growth from our 14,000-plus NAPA AutoCare centers and our major account business. The fleet business was off slightly, continuing a trend we have seen in recent quarters. Both our average ticket value and our average number of tickets were relatively flat in this segment of our business for the quarter.","Turning to our retail business. The sales environment continues to be challenging. We were down mid single digit in the quarter, which was comparable to our fourth quarter numbers. Our average retail dollar invoice was up slightly for the quarter, while our average number of invoices was down, which again is consistent with prior quarters.","And while we're certainly not pleased with these results, we believe they are consistent with retail sales trends, both in the aftermarket and retail in general. Our team has a number of initiatives in the works to address our retail sales and reverse the downward trend we've seen in recent quarters.","So as we look ahead to the balance of 2013, we expect to see increased demand in the aftermarket. We are pleased to note that the consistent -- that consistent with the positive momentum in the northern half of the U.S., we are also seeing a pickup in sales with some of our winter-related product categories, such as batteries, rotating electrical and our wiper business. And while our brake business continues to be under pressure, we are encouraged with the improved trends we are seeing -- we're beginning to see in this product category as well. We have said throughout this recent trend of sluggish sales, which dates back to the second quarter of last year, that the lack of winter weather in 2012 would remain a headwind throughout the first quarter. This proved to be the case. We also said that we continue to believe the fundamentals of the aftermarket to be positive, and this has not changed.","But first, let's take a look at fuel prices, a key driver for our business. While prices reached a record, record average highs in February, prices came down considerably in the month of March. In the quarter, the average price for a gallon of gasoline came in slightly below first quarter of 2012.","Next, the aging vehicle population, now reported to be 11.1 years old, continued growth in the number of older vehicles. And the outlook for miles driven, which saw a 0.5% increase in January after a very challenging December, bodes well for all of us in the aftermarket. And we continue to feel that NAPA is very well positioned to capture its share of this increase in demand generated by these positive trends.","So in summary, we believe the North American automotive aftermarket provides us ample growth opportunities for 2013. We remain positive about the core fundamentals of our industry, and our NAPA team remains focused on driving positive growth in the final 3 quarters of the year.","So that completes our overview of the Automotive business in the first quarter. And at this time, I'll hand it over to Carol to get us started with our review of the financial results. Carol?","Carol B. Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We'll start this morning with a review of the first quarter income statement and the segment information, and then we'll review some balance sheet items and other financial items. Tom will come back up to wrap it up, and then we'll open the call up to your questions.","As we review the income statement, as Tom mentioned, total sales were $3.2 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 0.6% from last year. The sales environment remained challenging for us throughout the quarter. And that said, we remain confident in our growth initiatives and expect to see improving market conditions as the year progresses, which will support stronger sales for us over the balance of the year.","Gross profit for the first quarter was 28.8% of sales, down slightly from the first quarter last year, and primarily attributable to the competitive sales environment across all of our businesses.","In addition, we're not seeing much of an impact from inflation. Cumulative pricing for the first quarter of 2013 was down 0.4% for Automotive, up 0.5% for Industrial, up 0.4% for Office Products and up 1.2% for Electrical.","We recognize the need to improve our gross margins over the balance of the year, and we're committed to this effort. Our ongoing initiatives to effectively manage supply chain costs, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize our pricing potential offer us opportunities to make the progress that we need to see here. This is a high priority for our management team across all of our businesses.","Turning to SG&A. Total expenses were $700 million in the first quarter, up 1% from 2002 (sic) [2012], and 21.9% of sales. Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales are up about 15 basis points from the first quarter last year, as we lost some leverage on our expenses for the quarter.","However, we continue to control our costs through several measures, including ongoing investments in technology, which has positively impacted the operating efficiencies in our distribution centers and stores, as well as supply chain initiative in areas such as freight and logistics.","Overall, our businesses are managing their expenses very well, and we're in a position to show improvement in this area over the balance of the year. Now we will review the results by segment.","Automotive revenue was $1.54 billion and represents 48% of sales. It's up 3.4%, as Paul mentioned. Operating profit of $121 million is up 5.7%. So their margin grew 10 basis points to 7.7% from 7.6%. We feel good about this increase on a 3% sales growth.","The Industrial Group had revenue of $1.1 billion, and this is 35% of our total sales and a decrease of 1.7%. Operating profit of $78.9 million is down 6.4%. So we saw this group's margin decrease to 7.2% from 7.5% for the quarter. This is primarily related to the decrease in sales.","Office Products had revenues of $420.1 million, which is 13% of our total sales and down 1.4%. Operating profit of $33.2 million is down 11.5%, and their margin deteriorated to 7.9% from 8.8%.","The Electrical Group had revenue of $139.2 million, and that's 4% of our total sales and down 5.4%. Operating profit of $10.5 million is down 12.7%, so some margin degradation to 7.5% from 8.1% for the Electrical Group, primarily due to the sales decrease.","So our total operating profit was down 2% in the first quarter, and our operating profit margin declined by 20 basis points to 7.6%. This follows solid margin improvement in each of the last 3 years. And again, the decrease in the quarter directly correlates to the slower rate of sales growth. The stronger sales that we expect to see over the balance of the year will support the expansion of our operating margins.","We had net interest expense of $3.4 million in the first quarter, which is down from 2002 (sic) [2012], due mainly to the interest income earned on the increase in cash for the period. Much of this cash was used for the Exego acquisition that we completed earlier this month. And after combining our debt with Exego, we expect net interest expense of approximately $30 million for 2013.","Total amortization expense was approximately $3.8 million for the first quarter, which is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2012, but up from last year due to the Quaker City acquisition. Likewise, our amortization costs will also increase beginning in the second quarter due to the Exego acquisition. The other line, which represents corporate expense, was $14.3 million expense for the quarter, and that's up from the $13.4 million in the first quarter of last year.","We currently project our corporate expense to remain relatively in line with 2012 over the balance of 2013. For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35%, which has improved from the 35.9% last year. We expect our full year tax rate for 2013 to remain at approximately 35% due to the favorable impact of the lower Australian tax rate.","Net income for the quarter was $144.4 million, down 1%. And EPS of $0.93 was flat with the first quarter of 2012.","Now I'll discuss a few key balance sheet items. Our cash at March 31 was strong at $842 million, which is up significantly from last year. About half of our March 31 cash balance relates to the incremental borrowings necessary to cover the April 1 acquisition of Exego.","Without these funds, our cash on hand was relatively consistent with both March and December of last year, and we would expect to return to these more normal levels of cash in the quarters ahead.","Accounts receivable of $1.6 billion at March 31 increased 1% from the same period in 2012 on a 0.6% sales increase for the quarter. Our goal is to grow receivables at a rate less than the revenue growth, so we're relatively pleased with this level of receivables. We will remain focused on this area throughout the year, and we're very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.","Our inventory at March 31 was $2.6 billion. That's down approximately $42 million or 2% from 12\/31, and it's up approximately 5% compared to March 31. The increase from last March relates to the impact of our acquisitions in 2012, and our inventory was basically flat when you break that out.","Our team is doing a very good job of managing our inventory levels, and we remained focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we moved into 2013.","Our accounts payable balance at March 31 was $1.8 billion. That's up 15% from March 31 of last year. The significant increase in trade payables again this year reflects the ongoing and positive impact of our extended payment terms and other payable initiatives negotiated with our vendors. We're very encouraged with the improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital and days payable.","Working capital of $2.3 billion at March 31 is down approximately 12% from March 2012 as reported, and is down 3% on a comparative basis after adding back the current debt.","Effectively managing accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company. And our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in tremendous improvement in our working capital position and cash flow.","Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at March 31. Our debt at March 31, 2013, includes the $500 million in term debt which we've carried for some time now, as well as another $415 million in borrowings under our new multicurrency syndicated credit facility.","As stated earlier, the new borrowings relate to the cash transfer this month for the closing of Exego, and that brings our total debt to approximately $915 million at the end of the quarter. This translates in total debt to total capitalization of 23% at the end of the quarter, which is up from 15% at March 31 last year.","Looking ahead, we expect our debt to increase by approximately $200 million in the second quarter upon the consolidation with Exego. This will bring our total debt to approximately $1.1 billion and our total debt to capitalization to around 25%. We would add that although we're comfortable with this level of debt in the near term, we will likely use our strong cash flows to reduce our incremental borrowings over time, although we have no exact timetable to do this.","In the first quarter of 2013, our cash from operations reached over $116 million. And for the full year, we currently project cash from operations to reach approximately $800 million to $850 million. We expect free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to the $425 million range. The continued strength of our cash flows is encouraging, and we remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority is the dividend, which we have paid every year since going public in 1948 and we've now raised for 57 consecutive years, a record that continues to distinguish Genuine Parts from other companies.","Our annual dividend of $2.15 per share for 2013 represents a 9% increase from the $1.98 per share paid in 2012. And it's approximately 52% of our 2002 -- 2012 earnings per share, which is well within our goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward.","Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment in CapEx was $13 million for the first quarter, down from $17 million in 2012. For the full year, we expect our CapEx to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million, which is an increase from the prior year amount of $102 million. Much of this increase relates to the planned expenditures for Exego over the balance of the year, although we did have an increase in our ongoing operations as well.","We would add that the vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology. Depreciation and amortization was $26 million for the quarter, which is consistent with the fourth quarter but up from the first quarter last year, primarily due to the amortization cost.","We anticipate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $145 million to $155 million for the full year, which also includes the addition of Exego.","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of our cash and are integral to the growth plans for the company. We're excited about the growth opportunities we see at Exego, and we will remain active in seeking new acquisitions for our businesses over the remainder of 2013. Generally, we would expect to target those bolt-on types of strategic acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally, we have been active in the company's share repurchase program since 1994. And although we bought minimal shares in the first quarter, we did purchase 1.4 million shares in 2012, and we have another 12 million shares authorized and available for repurchase today. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but would expect to be active in the program over the balance of 2013. We continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.","In closing, we want to thank all of our GPC associates for their hard work and dedication to their jobs and the success of Genuine Parts Company. The first quarter presented its challenges, but the GPC team worked harder than ever. We're confident the hard work will pay off.","The company is well positioned to generate stronger sales and earnings growth over the balance of the year. And as always, we will support our growth with strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet, further maximizing our return to shareholders.","That concludes our financial review today, and I'll now turn it over to Tom.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Thank you, Carol and Paul, for your updates. So that's a recap of our first quarter performance. As mentioned earlier, going back to the beginning of the year, we felt that the first quarter was going to be a challenge for us, and that certainly proved to be the case.","However, with that said, we continue to feel good about our prospects over the remainder of the year. And in fact, would like to reaffirm the guidance that was provided in our March 11 call. And our expectation for the full year is revenue increase in the 10% to 12% range and earnings per share to be in the $4.45 to $4.60 range. As a reminder, these figures include the recent completion of our Exego acquisition. And achieving these results would be a solid performance from the GPC team, in our opinion, and we look forward to updating these figures as the year progresses.","At this point, I would like to address your questions and will turn the call back over to Brooke.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was just curious, can we look at the CapEx for the first quarter? It was relatively low versus the run rate you were looking at for the full -- your full year. And $140 million to $160 million might be a little bit higher than we were modeling. And I'm just curious, is that a step up that could step down in the coming years? I'm just trying to understand where that might be in out years.","Carol B. Yancey","Well, we do. With our business, we do look at stepping that number down if we need to. And we were going to have an increase even without Exego this year because we do have several technology projects that are helping our distribution centers and our stores be more productive. So originally, we had stepped that number up from about $100 million to $115 million to $130 million. And then with Exego, we stepped it up just a little bit more. So that's probably a pretty good run rate. But again, we can adjust that number as need be. But we will continue to reinvest in our businesses with technologies.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then a second question. I mean, it looks like auto is doing -- is performing pretty well. But if we look at the other 3 segments -- I know we're looking at some tough comps. But as we progress through the year, you clearly have some sort of comfort and confidence that things are going to improve. I'm just curious if there's anything you're seeing in the market right now or what you saw in January and February that made March an aberration, makes you comfortable sticking with your current guidance of some small improvement through the course of the year?","Thomas C. Gallagher","John, we do in fact see some improvement. It's early in April yet, but the mid-month figures are more in line on a per day basis with what we saw in January and February. And as I said, it is early, but we're hoping that what we saw in March truly was an aberration. And with that said, also, each of our management teams has got some very specific and focused initiatives to try to continue to drive revenue improvements.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, as we look at pricing and your ability to pass through price increases and pricing sort of in the end market. I'm just wondering if you could comment on that in the first quarter, and what you're expecting through the remainder of the year?","Thomas C. Gallagher","We saw, as Carol mentioned, we saw some deflation in the Automotive side of the business in the first quarter. We saw a very modest inflation in both Office Products and in Industrial. And we saw just over 1% in the Electrical side. As far as our ability to pass them on, you may recall that in Automotive, when we get a price increase, we implement a price increase. In the case of Industrial, we do have some contractual arrangements, so where we have a pricing window is where we can implement those price increases. But I think, as a general statement, it would be fair to say that we're comfortable with the fact that we can pass any price increase along as long as we adhere to those pricing windows that are contractually negotiated. As far as the remainder of the year, our outlook right now would be for very modest price increases over the remainder of the year. We don't see any indication at this point that there's going to be a significant push for price increases from our vendor community across each of the businesses. And certainly, we're not going to take one if we don't feel we can maintain our competitive positioning in the marketplace.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then truly, just the last question. Carol, I mean, as we look at the balance sheet, I mean, 25% debt to cap, as you indicated you'd be once Exego is fully closed and consolidated, really does not appear that aggressive at all and still fairly conservative. But it sounds like you still kind of want to step back on that debt to cap number over time. I mean, is your philosophy going to be, as the CFO, and Tom, obviously, as the CEO, you're weighing in on this too, is of course -- but that you could potentially run with a little bit more debt than you have historically? Or do you want to get back to sort of that mid-teens debt to cap number? Is that sort of your target? I'm just trying to understand sort of your thought process on the debt that you're taking on here.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, John, I'll take the first stab at that, and then Carol can help me out. And I would say that -- keep in mind that at one point, we were in the low-to-mid 30s with debt to total cap. And while we are not uncomfortable at that level, we found that it made more sense for us to pay that down and to use the cash to remove that debt. As we go forward, we'll pay the debt down unless we find a higher and better use of the money for shareholder value creation. So we're not adverse to carrying more debt than we have the last few years. But at the same time, we think it has to make good long-term sense for the shareholders of Genuine Parts Company.","Carol B. Yancey","And I guess we're going to continue -- as we continue to support our priorities for cash, as we talked about, our cash flows have been just really strong lately, and we still see some improvement there. So if we can continue to support our dividends, share repurchases, strategic bolt-on acquisitions and our CapEx and then still be able to work on paying down that debt, then that's what we plan to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Focus on the auto side of the house. Can you just clarify how you think about, x the day shift, what the trend looked in January, February and March? You mentioned that April is better. Do you think, with the northern regions and some of the cold-weather categories, I mean, do think that could simply be an anniversary of easier compares? Or do you think that some of the fundamentals are improving as well?","Paul D. Donahue","Chris, I'll take a shot at it. This is Paul. The -- and I'll start with your last question first. When you talk about the -- our northern divisions, which for us is comprised pretty much of the Eastern, the Central and the Midwestern, we have seen improvement in the first quarter of about 300 basis points from where they were tracking in Q3 and Q4. So we are pleased to see some progress with those groups. And we're seeing it even hold as we go into April, as well. So we're feeling better about that group. And then you asked, Chris, about the average daily sales, or 1 less day. Certainly, that had an impact in the first quarter, as did how the Easter holiday fell coming into March this year versus April of a year ago. And as we look forward, Chris, we -- certainly, it's early yet in April, but we are seeing a bit of a lift. We're hoping for a bit of normalization of weather at some point, which we all talk a good bit about. But certainly, hoping for a bit of normalization on the weather side. And the comps do get easier, no doubt. But there's an awful lot of -- still an awful lot of deferred maintenance that's sitting out there that at some point has to come into the market.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so when you say it's better in April, that's average daily sales, right? Because you would have had an Easter shift being, I guess, a positive in April?","Paul D. Donahue","That's correct.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And so if the northern areas or the cold-weather regions improve 300 basis points sequentially in the quarter, given that the comps stayed flat, does that suggest that the other areas of the country actually slowed down?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No.","Paul D. Donahue","No.","Thomas C. Gallagher","It doesn't. I think what Paul is talking about is the delta between the northern operations and the rest of the operations. So the northern operations are still trailing the performance of the remaining operations. But the degree of change has narrowed in the first quarter. if that helps explain that.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think it did. I guess if -- sort if the north improves sequentially on a relative basis, but the comp -- but if the comps remain flat, doesn't -- I guess, doesn't that mean that the -- the total remained flat, doesn't it mean that the other areas had to actually slow down?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, they haven't. But what's happened is, if we go back to the third and fourth quarters of last year, the relative difference between the northern operations and the southern operations and the remaining operations, the difference in performance would have been 500 to 600 basis points. In the first quarter, the difference in performance was closer to 300 basis points. I guess the point we're trying to make is that we see the northern operations narrowing the gap with the remaining operations. And if that continues, we would think that, that will continue to enhance the overall performance of the Automotive operations.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And so is there any way to think about how much maybe the spring pull forward? I mean, I would assume on the DIY side of the business that the pull forward last year because of the weather, how much that impacted comps maybe to the positive in 1Q last year and to the detriment in the second quarter?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, that's a hard number to get to, and we wouldn't hazard a guess on that. We do know it was a positive influence in the first quarter results last year. And we saw evidence of that as we get into the second quarter. And perhaps that's a possible contributor to the fact that we're seeing the comps improve in April back to more what they were in January and February.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then last one, just on that sort of sequential improvement. Is that on the DIY side of the business as well?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Improving, but the DIY is still the weakest part of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question, and I just want to understand, I guess, the sales growth in Automotive slowed, for my belief, 4.9% to 3.4%. That's in the context of a same-store sales growth that were at the same level, and presumably the acquisition contribution from Q4 to Q1 was pretty consistent. Is that 1.4 percentage point slowdown related to the calendar? Or are there any other moving pieces to understand?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Matt, I'd think it would be more related to the fact that we were short the day in the...","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So the 1 day loss?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Yes.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then I do want to address the question that Chris asked again because I'm having a hard time understanding it. Presumably, if the gap between 2 segments of your business starts to narrow and the aggregate trend is unchanged, then presumably one got better and the other softened up a bit. So is there another way to get to that outcome?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, I'll tell you, rather than get hung up on it here, we could -- I'm going to have Sid do some work on it. And he can follow up directly with you or you can follow up -- and anybody on the call can follow up with Sid, and we'll try to give you a clearer understanding of it.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then one other question, please. So you indicated that -- it sounds like there was this soft patch in March. And I think you were talking about the Industrial business, in particular, but perhaps you saw it elsewhere as well. And I'm wondering, if you think about -- and you gave us great segment information for the quarter overall. What are the parts of the economy or the kinds of customers that you saw participate in that slowdown towards the end of the quarter and to the extent that April looks a lot more like January and February. Is it those same segments that recovered? Just interested in some of the moving pieces that are driving that movement.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Matt, I can't parse it in such a way that I can tell you specifically which customer segments in the month of March. I can tell you for the quarter that we saw comparative weakness in what we call equipment and machinery, which is a big category for us. And they would be largely OEM-type manufacturers. And then we continued to see some softness in the mining and aggregate and coal segments. And that was offset some by strength in automotive, and we were encouraged by the fact that lumber and wood products continued to show some improving trends, I guess following what we're all reading about the housing sector. And then pulp and paper held up well for us in the quarter. So -- but I can't address March specifically.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","My question is on Automotive in the commercial space. Your more retail-focused competitors continue to talk about moving in that space, now we've seen this for some time. Can you give us kind of a strategic landscape where you think you are right now in terms of share versus the others and what it's going to look like several years from now?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I'll take the first stab at that, Keith, and maybe Paul can help out. I would suggest that based upon the results we've seen with our 2 primary commercial initiatives, which would be NAPA AutoCare and major account, and the fact that we continue to grow those businesses and those businesses experienced, I think, pretty good growth for us in the quarter. And I think based upon what we can gather anecdotally, our growth in the commercial side of the business might have exceeded the growth of the overall commercial market through the quarter. I think it would suggest to us that, at a minimum, we've held our own share and perhaps we even gained some. And that's a continuation of a trend that we've seen for several years now. Sometimes, we get asked who's the share gainer, who's the share donor? And we can't answer that categorically. We can only base our comment on what we see that's publicly disclosed. And I think it would suggest that the publicly-traded companies, perhaps, are gaining share. And maybe it's coming from some non-publicly-traded companies. As far as what happens going forward, it's going to continue to be a very, very competitive marketplace. So there's no doubt in our minds about that, and it's going to be a matter of who executes most consistently and most crisply going forward. And I think trends in the industry would favor some of the larger players just because of the demands that are out there in terms of the overall investments in inventory, the service levels, the training you give people, the technology, all of the things that are important to a commercial account. So I think they play to the favor of those who have the balance sheet and the logistical capabilities to meet those demands.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And looking out in the future, is consolidation, in your opinion, going to play a big role here, given that we probably have too many retail auto parts stores in the United States right now?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, I think the industry overall will probably experience some consolidation. And I think the market dynamics and circumstances will force some of that over time. It's not a new phenomenon. We've seen quite a bit of that going on over the past several years. So our sense is that, that will continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes, a quick question, I guess sort of following-up on the last question. And you commented that non-fleet commercial was up, while fleet commercial was down somewhat. Is there anything going on in the competitive landscape on fleet commercial?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, I don't think there's anything necessarily competitive. I think it more directly ties to what we see happening with freight movement. If you look at the TSI, the Transportation Services Index, it actually was down. I think it was down 1.2% or 1.8% in Q4. We don't have Q1 numbers as yet, but my guess is it was probably somewhere in that range. So I think there's just been some modest slowdown in the amount of freight that's being moved.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up question on DIY. You commented it's being the weakest category. Are you seeing any correlation to improving weather to improving DIY? Does that seem to be a catalyst, or is DIY just generally soft across the board?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we are seeing some evidence of it in those parts of the country where we are having more normal weather. If you go up into the Midwest, we've got the issue with flooding that's going on there. We just had another snowstorm that moved through there. So that's an impediment to the DIY business there. But if we come into the warmer climate states, we do see DIY business a little bit better than what it has been. But I would also say that we think the DIY business, overall, is probably off a bit from where we'd all like to see it, just general economic circumstances.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Gober with Morgan Stanley.","Shaun Kolnick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Shaun Kolnick on for Dave. Sorry to stick to the Automotive side again, but some of your peers have called out the impact of the delay in tax refunds and the increase in payroll taxes on the DIY business. Are you seeing those factors impacting the business in Q1? And if so, has that started normalizing in April so far?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I don't think we can pinpoint it that precisely. But logic would suggest that the delay in payroll tax refunds could have an impact. And certainly, the higher payroll tax could have an impact. If you think of a household that has a $75,000 household income, let's say, and they have to get by on $1,500 less in take-home pay, they're going to have to adjust disposable income and spending patterns. And I think, yes, that would be a contributor for sure. The payroll tax refunds will normalize here. But the impact of the increased payroll tax is something we're going to have to work our way through over an extended period.","Shaun Kolnick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just one follow-up on a kind of bigger picture view on the auto business. The store base has been fluctuating over the last few years, but 2012 did see a pickup there. Can we expect store growth over the next couple of years to continue? And what markets do you really see the most opportunity?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, we would suggest that you will see store growth, at least from the NAPA side of the business. And we've got some specific plans. I don't think we'd want to necessarily disclose where we think the best opportunities are, but I think you can look for us going forward to expand our store footprint something between 1% and 2% per year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I had 2 questions. First, I just want to make sure on the guidance that I got it right. You said that it's unchanged and that -- I thought I heard you say that the sales was unchanged as well as part of that. So could you just update us to whether those ranges by category that you gave earlier in the year, I think it was 5% to 7% in auto and one of the biggest...","Thomas C. Gallagher","Yes, what we had when we gave segment guidance, I think what we said, Greg, was Automotive 5% to 7%, Industrial and the Electrical 4% to 6% and Office Products 1% to 3%. And then, when we came out on March 11, we included contribution that we anticipated from Exego. And that's when we raised it to the 10% to 12% overall. I would say that the guidance we gave by segment, the Industrial and the Electrical, we would have a bias toward the low end of the ranges that we gave only because of what we saw through the first quarter. We still think that Office Products can get into their range. And again, a bias toward the low end of it. And I think we're comfortable with our Automotive guidance that we gave. Does that answer your question?","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That does. That's perfect. And then a second on the inflation\/deflation front. I guess it ties into gross margin a bit. Auto deflation, if I remember, last year was down a little bit, maybe 0.3%, something like that.","Carol B. Yancey","That's correct.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","What's driving the continued deflation in auto either by category? And then does that mean that in your gross margin, which actually looked decent in the quarter, all things considered, is it fair to say that auto gross margins would have been up and the others may have been down some, or how should we think about that?","Thomas C. Gallagher","We don't breakout gross margin by segment. The -- what's driving deflation right now, I think, in Automotive are competitive circumstances. And I think manufacturers are having to meet the competitive situations, and it's resulting in deflation, modest deflation but deflation all the same, in our Automotive business.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So that could influence your top line negatively, but does it -- is it fair to say that, that means you can get continued sourcing cost savings to help gross margin in the auto business? I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out. Not give us the numbers, but just directionally speaking.","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think directionally, you could say that -- let me back up. Our expectation right now is that we will see gross margin improvement for Genuine Parts Company as we work our way through the year. And in order to get that, we're going to have to get contribution from each of our businesses. But we do, in fact, think that we will show some gross profit improvement as the year progresses. We went through -- just as a reminder, we went through a several-year period where we actually had some gross margin degradation. And we were able to offset it with some good SG&A work. Last year, we had modest gross margin improvement. And our expectation is that we will, in fact, see some gross profit improvement again in 2013.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that auto deflation seems to -- can you confirm that's a trend now? It's been around for at least 5 quarters.","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, it's been around for a while. I don't know how many quarters, but it's not a new phenomenon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli & Company.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","So I just want to talk about Exego for a couple of minutes here. As far as the strategy going forward, any plans to bring the NAPA brand to the region and perhaps use it as a premium branded product within the region?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Brian, I'll take the first stab at that. At this point, no, there is not a plan to do that. And the reason why is that the business operates under the name of Repco. And Repco is a name that's been around actually 2 years longer than Genuine Parts has been around, and they are the #1 brand over there. It's an iconic brand in their home markets. So our plan would be to use our sourcing leverage, combined sourcing leverage, to enable them to continue to do what they do. And they've got their own private label brand in addition to some manufacturer brands. And we're going to continue to let them operate as Repco because they are, in fact, the most highly recognized brand in that marketplace.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And just a question on the states within auto. What can you tell me about maybe this quarter versus Q4 and Q3 from a product mix standpoint? I think you mentioned that average ticket was still up, account was down. Are you seeing consumers go back at all -- or some of your customers go back at all to the mid-grade and potentially high-grade products?","Paul D. Donahue","Brian, this is Paul. We're seeing some shift, but not that significant. If you look at it by product category, I think I mentioned earlier, we're seeing strong growth out of our battery categories, strong growth out of some of our electrical products, wiper, some of the winter-type related products, which is a good thing. The brake business continues to be challenging for us, as it has been, and I think for many in the industry, but we are starting to show signs of some improvement in that product category as well.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And there's still -- there is still a reticence by your customer base, though, to move up market?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think that's a fair statement, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Patrick Palfrey - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Patrick Palfrey on for Scott. Earlier in the call, you mentioned that it's just a more competitive sales environment. And I was just wondering if you're seeing that environment more pronounced in one of your segments over the other?","Thomas C. Gallagher","I think it's probably the same across all. And look, we've been through different cycles before. And things tend to get a bit more competitive when we see end market demand slow up some. And everybody's trying to find ways to improve their relative positioning in markets like this. So I don't think it's any more pronounced than what we've seen in other cycles, but it hasn't diminished at all, either.","Operator","Our final question comes from Efraim Levy with S&P Capital.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","Last quarter, you said you thought that Q1 would be down, and it was. And then there was some thoughts that possibly -- and this may be specifically to EIS or, I'm not sure, it could be broader than that, that it would be weak. So firstly, has your Q2 view changed?","Thomas C. Gallagher","Well, no. We knew that -- actually, what I think we said was that we thought the first half of the year would be more challenging than the back half of the year, with the first quarter being the most challenging. As we look toward the remainder of the year, I think that if we look at the Industrial-related businesses, their recovery will be a little slower than what we would expect in our Automotive business. And frankly, our Automotive business, I think, held up pretty well under the circumstances and considering the fact that we had all of the variables at play there. So I think Automotive should fare well going forward. I think the others will all improve their position as the year progresses. But I think it will take -- it will be one extra quarter for Industrial and Electrical to probably get back to where they think they'll be.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And you have your guidance for CapEx. But I wasn't clear exactly what the reason was why it was down so sharply as a percentage in the first quarter versus last year?","Thomas C. Gallagher","It's a timing difference.","Carol B. Yancey","It's a timing thing of projects. So usually in the beginning of the year and dependent on weather and things like that, you may have fewer building projects and things like that. So it's really just a timing thing. We're usually a little lighter in the first quarter. And then honestly, with the slowdown in business, they may have delayed starting some things to start those in Q2 or Q3.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And just one more. In the past, you've sometimes differentiated the aftermarket, auto versus tire trends. Is there anything to highlight in that segment?","Thomas C. Gallagher","No, I don't think we have any data that we could update you with","Operator","Thank you. That was our final question. I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Carol B. Yancey","We thank you for your time and interest and your support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to talking to you in our second quarter release. And if you need anything else, please let us know. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."],"10121":["Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 21, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Sid Jones - Vice President, Investor Relations","Tom Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Paul Donahue - President","Carol Yancey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush","Michael Montani - ISI Group","Liang Feng - Morningstar","Operator","Good morning.

(Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn today\u2019s conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Sid Jones - Vice President, Investor Relations","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts second quarter 2014 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company\u2019s latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Tom Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Sid. And I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President along with Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and I will each handle a portion of today\u2019s call. And once we have concluded our individual remarks, we will look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.","Earlier this morning, we released our second quarter 2014 results and hopefully you have had an opportunity to review them, but for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.908 billion, which was up 6% over the prior year. Net income was $197.7 million, which was down 9% on a reported basis, but up 9% on a comparative basis, which I will comment on in a moment. Earnings per share were $1.28 this year compared to $1.39 last year and this represents an EPS decrease of 8% on a reported basis, but up 9% on a comparative basis. As a reminder, last year\u2019s net income and earnings per share numbers were favorably impacted by the one-time positive adjustments that are attributable to the purchase accounting treatments on our Australian acquisition that was completed in the second quarter of 2013. Carol will cover this in more detail during her comments, but in looking at the results from pure operating standpoint, with sales up 6% and both net income and earnings per share up 9% on a comparative basis, we feel that the GPC team operated pretty well in the quarter.","Looking at the sales results by segment, our automotive operations were up 5% in the quarter. Considering the fact that currency exchange had a negative impact of almost 2%, which indicates an underlying growth rate of 7%, we feel that this is reflective of the good sales job being done by the automotive team and Paul will cover more of the automotive details and highlights during his comments.","Our industrial operations also had a solid quarter, posting a 7% increase. Acquisitions contributed a little over 3% to the increase, while currency exchange had a negative impact of just under 1%. Netting all of this out means that our underlying industrial business was up a bit over 4% in the quarter, which is right where we expected them to be and it continues a trend of gradual revenue improvement for our industrial operations over the past few quarters.","In looking at our sales results by customer category, 9 of our top 10 customer segments were positive in the quarter and 7 of the 10 had increases of 5% or more, which we feel shows good balance in the results and is a bit encouraging. Automotive, iron and steel, coal aggregate and cement, lumber and wood products were among our top performing sectors perhaps indicative of a gradually improving overall economy. And at this point, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for our industrial business over the second half of the year.","Our electrical segment had another strong quarter, with sales up 32%. Acquisitions completed over the past six months basically accounted for all of this increase and we are pleased with the contributions and progress being made in both the wire and cable and fabrication sides of the business. We continue to struggle in the electrical\/electronic side of the business however.","Sales into the original equipment manufacturing side of the electrical business have not recovered yet as they have for the industrial segment. And sales for the electronics side of the business are being impacted by non-recurring sales to electronic contract manufacturers in 2013. Fortunately, our EIS team feels good about our continued progress in the second half for the wire and cable and fabrication businesses. And based upon what they currently see they are anticipating a modest recovery for the electrical, electronic business in the months ahead.","Turning to the office products segment, we are pleased to report a 4% increase. This is their best quarter in sometime and while the GCN acquisition that was completed earlier in the year accounted for about one half of the increase, we were encouraged by the fact that both the independent reseller segment and the mega channel each had positive growth in the quarter. While the mega results have been positive in five of the past six quarters, this is the first time that the independent channel has shown positive growth over that same timeframe. And we are hopeful that this is a turning point for this important segment of our office products business.","On the product side we had increases in the quarter in the cleaning and break room furniture and core office supplies categories and a modest decrease in the technology category. And we are a bit encouraged by the fact that all four categories had second quarter results that were stronger when compared to the first quarter results, so a bit of sequential improvement which hopefully we can sustain in the quarters ahead. Before closing on office products, we do want to mention that we completed the acquisition of Impact Products on July 1. Impact is a distributor of safety and facility services products and they will add approximately $85 million in revenue on an annual basis. Additionally, the Impact acquisition complements the GCN acquisition mentioned earlier. And it enables S. P. Richards to further diversify its product offering as well as its customer base which is an important part of our long-term strategy for the office products segment. And we are pleased to have the Impact Products team now part of the GPC family.","So that will conclude our comments on the non-automotive businesses. And I will ask Paul to cover the automotive segment. Paul?","Paul Donahue - President","Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone and welcome to our conference call. I am pleased to join you today and have an opportunity to provide you an update on the second quarter performance of our automotive business. Just as a reminder, we mentioned in last quarter\u2019s conference call that on April 1, we annualized our acquisition of GPC Asia-Pacific and you will see that reflected in our Q2 numbers and on a go forward basis. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks our automotive business grew top line revenues by 5% in the second quarter.","To further explain our growth, our core automotive business grew 7% with a 2% offset due to currency exchange. I would like to take this opportunity to walk you through our automotive numbers and provide you an overview of our second quarter performance. As we look back on this past quarter\u2019s results you will see \u2013 you will note our numbers are fairly consistent with both our fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014. Our teams continue to execute well in the field and coupled with solid industry fundamentals enabled us to report another good quarter with underlying growth at plus 7%. When evaluating our quarterly performance, we are encouraged to see that all regions of the U.S. are positively contributing to our sales growth. As has been the case the past couple of quarters, our divisions stretching from the Plains across the Great Lakes to the Northeast continue to lead the way for the company.","In the second quarter we also saw strong sales growth in both the Southern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the country. An update on the automotive aftermarket wouldn\u2019t be complete without a weather update. So after one of the coldest winters in a number of years, patches of extreme weather conditions continue to impact our business along with our good customers. The dry conditions in out West continue to plague the state of California as over one-third of the state is officially in a drought. This has a direct impact on the dairy and agricultural businesses and ultimately our customer base. On the opposite extreme the month of June was the wettest on record in the past 25 years. But despite these headwinds along with the shift in the Easter holiday, our team persevered and produced solid sales results across the U.S.","Now turning to our U.S. company-owned store group, comparable same store sales growth in the second quarter came in at plus 7%. This 7% increase is on top of 5% same store sales growth in the second quarter of 2013 giving us a to two year stack of 12%. In addition, it continues a solid pattern of organic growth dating back to the fourth quarter of \u201813 when we generated a 7% same-store sales increase in the first quarter of \u201814 when we grew same-store sales 8%. Our sales growth in Q2 was driven by healthy 7% increase in our commercial and wholesale business.","Diving deeper into our commercial results, our two big wholesale initiatives Major Accounts and NAPA AutoCare, once again delivered double-digit increases in the quarter. This marks four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in the Major Account business. And turning to our 15,000 plus NAPA AutoCare centers, this group posted double-digit growth for the third straight quarter. Overall, we are pleased with the progress our team continues to make in both of these segments of our business. It\u2019s also worth noting we posted strong results in our fleet business generating 6% growth in the second quarter. We are encouraged by these results as our team has now generated solid fleet numbers in back-to-back quarters. We can also report improving trends in our average wholesale ticket value with little or no inflation support and our average number of tickets increased in the quarter as well.","Turning now to our retail business, this segment of our business grew 7% in the second quarter. We continue to be encouraged with our growth in our retail business. And if you recall, we increased this segment 9% in the first quarter. As we saw with our wholesale business both our average ticket value and our average number of tickets increased in the quarter. Our team has been working hard to drive our retail business and it\u2019s great to see the improved results these past few quarters.","Let\u2019s take a look at the product categories driving our growth. Our heavy duty business continues to post strong results as this group generated double-digit growth in the quarter. We also saw high single-digit growth from core product category like brakes, chassis and our filter business. We would also mention that we continue to see good momentum in our electrical business driven by strong battery sales. I\u2019d like to give a special plug to our electrical team as once again we are promoting in the month of July our battery starter and alternator products, with a portion of the proceeds being contributed to the Intrepid Fallen Hero Fund. Supporting our returning military veterans is something our NAPA team believes in very strongly and we are proud to announce that once again this year we will raise in excess of $1 million for this very worthy cause.","So, in summary, we remain encouraged as our automotive operations report another quarter of strong results. We remain positive about the core fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket and the growth opportunities available to us in both the retail and commercial sectors. The industry fundamentals have not really changed quarter-over-quarter. The average age of vehicles on the road remains in excess of 11 years and deferred maintenance remains at historically high numbers.","A couple of key metrics we continue to monitor closely are the price of gasoline and miles driven. While earlier in the quarter, we saw a spike in fuel prices, we have now leveled off and are essentially flat year-over-year. And in the all-important miles driven category, after posting negative numbers earlier in the year, we saw positive growth in both March and April.","So, in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter results as well as the first half of 2014. We are proud of our management team and know they remain committed to driving profitable growth throughout 2014. And while we have much work ahead of us, including tougher comps in the second half of the year, we remain optimistic that the initiatives our team is focused on will continue to drive strong results. We would like to personally thank all of our associates both at NAPA North America and at GPC Asia-Pacific and Australia and New Zealand for their efforts in the second quarter. So that completes our overview of the automotive business.","And at this time I will hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?","Carol Yancey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Paul. We will begin with the review of our second quarter and six month income statements and the segment information and we will also review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up and then we will open the call up to your questions.","Our total revenues were record $3.9 billion for the second quarter an increase of 6% from last year, including the 5% underlying sales growth and a 2.5% contribution from acquisitions, and this was offset by the current headwind of slightly more than 1%. If we turn to our gross profit and SG&A, we want to remind everyone as the prior year one-time items that are impacting our comparisons. In the second quarter 2013, we reported a favorable purchase accounting adjustment associated with the April 1, 2013 acquisition of the remaining 70% interest in GPC Asia-Pacific.","To that end, we are required to revalue the company\u2019s initial 30% investment and this re-measurement met a certain one-time purchase accounting cost amounted to a free tax income adjustment of approximately $36 million. And when combined with a lower tax rate, this favorably impacted our earnings per share by $0.22 in the second quarter of 2013. In accounting for the pre-tax adjustment, approximately $18 million was recorded in cost of goods sold and a $54 million gain net of expenses was recorded to selling, administrative and other expenses on our income statement. Additionally, the $36 million net adjustment is included in the other net line in the segment information provided in today\u2019s press release.","Any references we may make through our comparable results are intended to exclude the prior year impact of these one-time items. With all that said, our gross profit for the second quarter was 30.2% compared to 30.1% last year. For the six months, our gross margin of 30.1% compares to 29.5% reported last year. On a comparative basis, our second quarter gross margin is down 40 basis points from an adjusted 30.6 basis points in 2013. This is due mainly to customer and product mix shift across our businesses, but primarily in the automotive and office segments. We thought it would be good to add as well that the gross margin differential at GPC Asia-Pacific is no longer relevant in our quarterly comparisons as we have anniversaried that acquisition on April 1 as Paul mentioned earlier.","Turning to the periods ahead, we certainly see room for improvement and we remain focused on seeking those opportunities to expand our margins over the longer term. For the balance of 2014, however, we continue to expect our margins to be in the 30% range. As an additional point of interest, we are seeing some slight inflation in our non-automotive businesses to-date, but we continue to see very little inflation in the automotive sector. And we don\u2019t expect this to change much over the balance of the year. Our 2014 year-to-date pricing is 0.1% for automotive, 1.0% for industrial, 1.1% for office products and 0.4% for electrical.","Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses were $869 million in the second quarter, which is 22.2% of sales compared to 21.5% reported last year. For the six months, our total SG&A expenses were $1.7 billion, which is 22.7% of sales compared to 21.7% for the same period in 2013. On a comparative basis, our second quarter SG&A expenses have improved as a percentage of sales decreasing 80 basis points to 22.2% of sales from the 23.0% in the second quarter last year. This improvement primarily reflects the expense leverage gained on our sales volume for the quarter as well as cost savings associated with the freeze of our pension plan that was effective January 1. We expect the pension freeze to continue to favorably impact the overall retirement related cost in the periods ahead and we continue to remain focused on effectively managing the cost in every area of our business. Through these initiatives, we expect to show continued progress on our SG&A line in the periods ahead.","And now, let\u2019s discuss the results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.1 billion and represents 54% of total sales and is up 5%. Our operating profit of $207 million is up 11%. So, their margin improved nicely up 50 basis points to 9.8% from 9.3% last year. For the six months, our automotive sales of $4 billion, also represent 53% of our total sales and is up 13%. Our operating profit of $357 million is up 16% and our margin is up 30 basis points to 8.9%. Our industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, which is 31% of our revenues and up 7%. Operating profit of $94 million is up 7% and our operating margin of 7.9% is unchanged from the prior year.","Our year-to-date industrial sales of $2.35 billion represent 31% of our revenues and are up 5%. Our operating profit of $178.5 million is up 6% and our margin of 7.6% is up 10 basis points from last year. Our office products revenues of $419 million in the quarter or 10% of our total revenues are up 4%. Our operating profit of $31 million is up 5%, so their margin was unchanged at 7.4%. For the six months, our office revenues are $837 million, representing 11% of the total and is up by 2%. Our operating profit of $65 million is up 3% and our margin is up 10 basis points from last year to 7.8%.","The electrical\/electronic group had sales in the quarter of $188 million, which is 5% of our revenue and up 31.5%. Our operating profit of $16.5 million is up 35% and their margin is 8.8%, which is up 30 basis points from the 8.5% last year. Year-to-date, our sales for this group were $368 million, which is 5% of our revenues and up 31%.","Our operating profit of $32 million is up 41%. So, our margin is up significantly to $8.7 million from the $8.0 million, which is an increase of 70 basis points. So, our total operating profit was up 10% in the second quarter and our operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to $8.9 billion. This follows a 20 basis point margin improvement in the first quarter. And for the six months, our total operating margin is 8.4%, which is up 20 basis points from 2013. Especially encouraging is our overall growth is supported by year-to-date margin expansion in each of our four businesses. So, we are very pleased to report this level of progress and we remain focused on continued margin expansion in the periods ahead.","We had net interest expense of $6.2 million in the second quarter, which is down from the $7.9 million last year. For the six months, interest expense is $12.4 million and we expect this cost to remain relatively steady over the balance of 2014. We currently estimate $24 million in net interest expense for the full year.","Our total amortization expense of $8.5 million for the second quarter and it\u2019s $17.4 million for the six months. Our year-to-date amortization is up from last year due to the acquisition activity across our four segments. We expect amortization expense to be in the $35 million to $37 million range for the year.","The other line, which reflects corporate expense, was a $25 million expense for the second quarter. This is an increase from last year, but relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2014 corporate expense. In the second quarter last year, this line was a $14 million income item, which reflects the $36 million positive purchase accounting adjustment that we covered earlier. For the six months, this line shows an expense of $48 million, which is up from $36 million last year, excluding the accounting adjustment. This increase reflects higher expenses for a variety of items, including legal and professional, insurance and incentive-related costs. Currently, we expect this line to be in the $80 million to $90 million range for 2014.","For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 36.25% compared to 31.3% last year. For the six months, our 35.9% rate compares to 32.8% for the same period last year. The increase in our tax rates for both the second quarter and the six months relates primarily to last year\u2019s favorable tax rate on the gain that was generated by the re-measurement of our Asia-Pac investment. Looking ahead, we expect our full year tax rate to be in the 36.0% to 36.3% range for 2014.","As Tom mentioned, net income for the quarter was $198 million and EPS was $1.28 and on a comparative basis, both our net income and EPS increased by 9% from the second quarter in 2013. For the six months, our net income of $355 million is up 9% on a comparative basis and our EPS of $2.30 is up 10% on a comparative basis.","So now, we will discuss a few key balance sheet items. Our cash at June 30 was $153 million, which is down from $197 million in June 2013 and also at December 31. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives in each of our businesses and we remain comfortable with our cash position at June 30. Our accounts receivable of $1.9 billion at June 30 increased 8.5% from the same period in 2013, which is slightly higher than our 6% sales increase for the quarter.","We remained focused on our goal of growing receivables at a rate less than the revenue growth. And we see room for improvement in this area in the periods ahead. We are also very satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Inventory at quarter end was $3.0 billion, which is up approximately 1% from December 31 and up 7% from June 30 of last year. Before the impact of acquisitions, our inventory is basically unchanged from December 31 and up only 4% from last June. So our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels. We will remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward through the year.","Our accounts payable balance at June 30 was $2.5 billion, up 21% from June 2013 due to the positive impact of extended payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors as well as the impact of acquisitions. Our continued improvement in this area and its positive impact on our working capital and days in payables is encouraging and we expect this favorable trend to continue in the periods ahead.","Our working capital of $2.0 billion at June 30 compares to $1.8 billion at June 30, 2013. Effectively managing accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable is a very high priority for our company. And our ongoing efforts with these key accounts have resulted in solid improvement in our working capital position and our cash flow. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition at June 30, 2014.","Our total debt of $806 million at June 30 is down from the $900 million at June 30 last year and represents approximately 19% of total capitalization. Our June 30 debt includes two $250 million term notes as well as another $306 million in borrowings under our multi-currency syndicated credit facility. We are comfortable with our capital structure at this time although we may choose to pay down some of our debt outstanding under the credit facility during the year depending on the investment opportunities that could arise.","Thus far in 2014, our cash from operations is approximately $367 million and for the full year we currently expect cash from operations to be approximately $950 million. We expect free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $450 million range. We are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flow and we remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority for cash is the dividend, which we have paid every year since going public in 1948 and have now raised for 58 consecutive years, a record continues to distinguish Genuine Parts from other companies. Our annual dividend of $2.30 per share for 2014 represents a 7% increase from the $2.15 per share paid in 2013 and it\u2019s approximately 52% of our 2013 earnings per share, which is well within our goal of 50% to 55% payout ratio. Our goal would be to maintain this level of payout ratio going forward.","Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our core businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Our investment and capital expenditures was $21.5 million for the second quarter, and is $39.9 million for the six months. Although these expenditures are down from the second quarter and the six months in 2013, we currently expect our capital expenditures to pick up over the balance of the year. We currently look for CapEx spending to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million which compares to the $124 million last year. As usual, the vast majority of our investments will be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology.","Our depreciation and amortization was $37 million in the second quarter, which is consistent with the prior year and at $74 million for the six months which is up from the $63 million in the prior year. This six month increase on this line reflects the impact of GPC Asia-Pacific as well as our more recent acquisitions and we currently expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $145 million to $155 million for the full year.","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash for us and they are integral to the growth plans for the company. For the second quarter, we have added four acquisitions, including one in each of our four business segments and with estimated annual revenues totaling approximately $255 million. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we added our fifth acquisition for the year on July 1 with the addition of Impact Products to the office products group. We are encouraged by the growth opportunities we see for each of these acquisitions and will continue to seek new acquisitions across our businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth and generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million range.","Finally, thus far in 2014, we have used our cash to purchase approximately 635,000 shares of our common stock under the company\u2019s share repurchase program. Today, we have another 10 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. And while we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program over the balance of the year. We continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","So, that\u2019s our financial update. And in closing, we want to thank all of our GPC associates for all that they do. It\u2019s a team effort here and everyone\u2019s hard work is truly appreciated. The company is well-positioned for continued growth over the balance of the year and beyond and we look forward to updating you on our future progress when we report again.","I will now turn it back over to Tom.","Tom Gallagher - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paul and Carol. So, that\u2019s a recap of our second quarter and first half results. And as we look back over the past two quarters, we feel that our folks have made good progress in a number of key areas. Our sales and earnings on a comparative basis at the mid-year point are at record levels and all four of our business segments are showing year-to-date operating margin improvements.","On the balance sheet side, accounts receivable and inventory have been managed well and accounts payable continues to trend in the right direction. Cash from operations is solid and working capital efficiency has shown nice improvement. From an individual business perspective as we look back over the first six months of the year, we are encouraged by the steady and consistent performance in our automotive business on a comparative basis and we are encouraged as well by the sequential improvements in our non-automotive businesses. At the same time, we are a bit unclear as to where we are in the economic cycle. While most of the external indicators and indices are generally favorable for all of our businesses, we still hear and sense a degree of uncertainty and caution among many of our customer base and the strength of the economic recovery is a bit weaker than many had predicted.","Additionally, we still have the variability of currency exchange which as we said earlier impacted us by over 1% both on the revenue and earnings side in the quarter and first half of the year. With all of that said, however, based upon our performance year-to-date and the solid initiatives that are underway across each of our businesses, we feel that a few modest upward adjustments in our revenue guidance are appropriate. At this point, we would leave industrial and electrical the same. Our prior guidance was plus 5 to plus 7 for industrial, which we would leave the same. Electrical was 25 to 30 and we\u2019ll leave that the same. But in the automotive segment, we think we need to increase the prior guidance of plus 6 to plus 7 to current guidance of plus 7 to plus 8.","In office products, our prior guidance was plus 3 to plus 4. And at this point, we would raise it to plus 6 to plus 7. And this increase for office products includes the contribution from the Impact Products acquisition in the second half of the year as well as the increased business that we will be getting from the new Office Depot agreement. The net result of all of this is that we would increase our overall GPC guidance from a prior 6% to 8% increase to a current 7% to 8% increase. And on the earning side, we feel that an upward adjustment is also appropriate. Our prior guidance called for earnings per share of being in the $4.49 to $4.59 range and at this point we would raise that to $4.54 to $4.60, which would give us an EPS increase of 3% to 5% on a reported basis and 8% to 10% on a comparative basis.","So that will conclude our prepared comments. And at this point, we will turn the call back to Holly to take your questions. Holly?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning. This is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. How are you?","Tom Gallagher","We are fine. We hope you are.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thank you. We just had a quick couple of questions. We wanted to check if there is any impact for you winning the consolidated Office Depot of snacks business now that particularly as the business shifts to you as the acquisition seasons?","Tom Gallagher","Well, what we have said in our prior call was that on an annualized basis this will yield about $100 million in annual revenue. The revenue is starting to shift currently. We have said prior that it would start to kick in on July 1 and it is in fact starting to flow through currently. And then there was a question in the prior call as to whether or not this would impact our gross margins and we said that it would have some impact on the gross but we will get some leverage off of the increased volume as well.","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs","Alright. Perfect. Thank you. And my second question relates to your industrial margins, we wanted to basically understand is there potential for stronger recovery on industrial margins, particularly now that you are starting to see some revenue growth and as this growth continues to persist into the year?","Tom Gallagher","If in fact the growth continues in the high-single digit levels, yes we would think that there might be some opportunity for margin expansion.","Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs","Alright. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.","Tom Gallagher","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line at Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning Chris.","Carol Yancey","Good morning Chris.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","A couple of questions on the updated guidance, so the increase in auto and office is that mainly and each one of those reflecting the year-to-date and then in the case of the office now you have this acquisition or are you inherently raising your outlook for the back half as well?","Tom Gallagher","Well, I think it\u2019s a combination. The first part of your comment I think is accurate. We have seen \u2013 we will see the impact in office products of the Impact Products acquisition as well as increased Office Depot business which will have a positive impact. In the case of automotive, we have seen some \u2013 we think pretty good performance from the automotive team. We think the external factors are generally positive and our expectation is that based upon where we ended the first half of the year that something in that 7% to 8% range is a reasonable expectation for us on the automotive side.","I would just add one other thing, Chris. We were a little bit encouraged by a couple of things in office products. It may be too early to tell if it\u2019s a trend. But I mentioned in my comments that we did see sequential improvement in all four of the major product categories. And then we also saw improved performance coming from our independent resellers which our team has been working on for quite some time and hopefully that\u2019s the beginning of what maybe some sustainable positive growth coming from that important part of our business.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Okay. So then just to clarify, it sounds like auto is sort of what we are seeing year-to-date passing out through to the revenue outlook for the year or whereas in the office there is the acquisition and some encouraging signs that\u2019s taken your confidence up as to actual back half outlook?","Tom Gallagher","I think that\u2019s accurate.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Okay. I know your last year you mentioned June being a pretty wet month out there, are you normally hoping for very hot weather, so cars are breaking down or was that actually a drag to the auto performance in June?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Chris this is Paul, certainly a bit of a drag. What we had hoped for coming off that brutal winter we had in many parts of the country was to move right into the hot summer. And we have not seen that in most parts of the country and certainly June being as wet as it was, we did not see the kind of lift that we normally would have with some hotter temperatures across the country.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","But is \u2013 I guess is your \u2013 does that suggest that or how do you think that plays out than as you look out over this summer and then to the balance of the year I mean the lag impact from the weather, is your outlook anymore positive or negative as a result of June\u2019s outcomes?","Tom Gallagher","I don\u2019t think our attitude is anymore negative. If we get a hot stretch we get two weeks of unusually warm weather, yet in July or in August, we think that we will see some positive impact from that, but even absent that, I think that the performance that Paul had outlined both on the retail side and on the commercial side, Major Accounts, NAPA AutoCare, I think those results are really what give us a little more confidence in partly why we have raised our guidance.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Understood, very clear. Thanks very much.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thanks, Chris.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli & Company.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company","Hi, good morning Tom. Hi Carol. Hi, Paul, how are you?","Carol Yancey","Good morning, Brian.","Paul Donahue","Good, Brian.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company","A question on just within auto, you\u2019ve got a lot of changing dynamics regarding the competitive landscape, what are you seeing as far as maybe your ability to either gain some share this quarter or do you think that, that you are performing in line with your peers?","Paul Donahue","Well, Brian, this is Paul. We are the first ones out. So, we will hear our peer group here in the weeks ahead, but we are pleased with our quarter. It\u2019s consistent with our first quarter and it\u2019s consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. And we are very pleased with the cadence of the quarter, April was strong, May was strong, June as was referenced earlier was a bit softer, but the comps get tougher in the second half. And I think I referenced that in my comments. But we are pleased with where we find ourselves and with the initiatives that the guys are all working on it.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company","Any opportunities to \u2013 have you taken in any prior Carquest distributors into the NAPA family?","Tom Gallagher","We have taken some, Brian and hopefully we will take some more as time goes on.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company","What do you think has been the biggest differentiator for you in having those crossovers take place?","Tom Gallagher","But I think those that have made the change have benefited from the comprehensiveness of the NAPA program. And I think they have been surprised by the strength of the NAPA program. And I think they are pretty outspoken in terms of what is done for them and their business. So, hopefully there will be a few more that will make their way to the NAPA system in the months ahead.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company","And the other three businesses, if I am looking at the last eight months or so you guys have obviously been very acquisitive, what does that pipeline look like now for potential deals and just do you think you have another good 12-month, 24-month runway, where you can be this acquisitive?","Tom Gallagher","Well, in the acquisition side of it, you never know what the timing is going to be. And you have always got to have a number of discussions going on at any given time. So, I think the best way I could answer that is to say that we have multiple discussions that are occurring, but we will have to wait and see how many of them actually develop and come to fruition, but we are pleased with where we find ourselves in terms of the discussions and we are certainly proud of the team for what they have been able to get done over the past year or so.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company","If you were to find something that would be the size of an Exego either in any of your four groups, would that side scare you at this point or would you be open to it?","Tom Gallagher","No, I don\u2019t think we would be intimidated by the size. It really is a function of how accretive it could be to the shareholders at Genuine Parts Company. And if we can find any business that we acquire needs to be accretive to GPC. We don\u2019t knowingly do any acquisitions that are dilutive. So, the size is not the most critical factor. It\u2019s what we think the performance will be post-acquisition.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company","Alright. And just last one from me. Carol, I think I heard you say that you may look to pay down some debt with cash flow as the year progresses, if you are paying 3% on your debt and you get a 2.6% current return on given the dividend, why wouldn\u2019t share repurchase, more aggressive share repurchase be the right use of capital there?","Carol Yancey","Well, Brian, we are not committing to anything. What we are doing is trying to keep some flexibility as we look at our balance sheet and our capital structure so and keeping that flexibility be it incremental share repurchases or an acquisition opportunity. So, we are just trying to balance. We haven\u2019t totally committed on what we are going to do on the debt. We are just going to look to balance what our cash needs are and what makes the most sense for the shareholder.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company","Alright, thank you very much.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Good morning.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning Bret.","Carol Yancey","Good morning Bret.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Couple of quick questions and in your prepared remarks you had mentioned some gross margin pressure in the automotive from customer and product mix, could you give us a little bit more color, is that just a migration to national accounts or is there anything changing on the promotional environment on the products side?","Carol Yancey","I guess I will give a couple of comments and then Paul might comment as well. One of the things we are talking about is the product and customer mix across all of our businesses, but primarily not with automotive and office. So as Paul mentioned the key wholesale programs that we have and talking about some of those with the double-digit growth and those would be generally at a lower gross margin and then on the product mix we called out a couple of product categories that do come in at a little bit lower gross margin. But I would point out that we continue to have programs in gross margin, all of our businesses have key things going on, on the buy side and sales side to hopefully get those margins back up or at least flat. But the really nice thing is we have been able to do on the SG&A side so what you are getting is we saw that volume going through is we are able to leverage more on the expenses. So the teams and primarily auto have a done a terrific job on the SG&A line for us.","Paul Donahue","And Bert to the second part of your question there hasn\u2019t been any fundamental change in promotional activity.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, great. And then as we look at the comp and we have got Exego in the mix for the full year now, can we get a feeling for how the Exego business performed on a sort of a standalone comp basis?","Paul Donahue","Well. We don\u2019t breakout the Australian numbers, but we can tell you that they are performing in line with our expectations and they are performing in line with our overall automotive business.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then one last question on the accounts payable, it\u2019s a pretty good number there. If we look at the business lines separately and clearly the auto vendors are more used to being asked for extended payables. I guess how much room is left if your \u2013 is auto getting close to 100% APed inventory and the other \u2013 other segments need to raise theirs or is there still room to extend payables on the automotive vendor side?","Tom Gallagher","I think we still have some room we have ahead of us on the automotive. And you are right in your comment that this is much more prevalent than the automotive business than it is in the other businesses that we are in. But I think there is still some opportunity for us in the non-automotive businesses. So I think in the quarters ahead you will continue to see some nice improvement.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","And with Exego\u2019s payables been well levered as well or is there still would there be more room within the Exego?","Tom Gallagher","Well, I think we will just leave that there is still room in the automotive side of the business and we feel good about our prospects honestly.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks. Is there a target for APed inventories you have out there sort of on a two or three year basis company side?","Carol Yancey","We don\u2019t have a stated target, I guess what we look at is our working capital and we have \u2013 we make sure that we have plans in place for all the categories for improvement each year, so no specific target.","Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Nice Brett.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush","Good morning.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning Seth.","Carol Yancey","Good morning Seth.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","The first question I have to you goes on some small cost items for clarification, it seems like you have bumped up the cost expectations for the other line as well as D&A, can you just give us some more color as to the drivers there?","Carol Yancey","Well, I think as we called out on the other lines, what we are seeing is some of the legal and professional, insurance and some of our incentives related costs. So that would primarily be what\u2019s driving that line and some of it is in the technology area, we mentioned some of our technology improvements. So that\u2019s primarily what\u2019s driving that line. And then the other depreciation and amortization, was that your other one?","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush","Yes.","Carol Yancey","Yes, the depreciation and amortization that\u2019s the combination of a function of the additional acquisitions and the amortization that flowed in. And then the incremental depreciation if we look what our increase in CapEx is going to be on the full year.","Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush","Got it. Okay. Despite those bumps up, obviously you guys had great SG&A leverage you are expecting SG&A leverage going forward, was there anything different about this quarter relative to last in terms of the cost base and some of the moving pieces that drove the strong leverage?","Carol Yancey","I would just comment as we mentioned \u2013 that both Tom and Paul mentioned as you look from Q4 to Q1 and Q2 where we saw the sequential improvement especially in the non-automotive businesses or as you look at their core business improving over the last quarter or two, Q2 being the stronger one. What we are getting is additional leverage off the SG&A there.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","Got it. And within auto itself, did you have better SG&A leverage this quarter even with the same type of top line growth?","Carol Yancey","Well, we did. And I mentioned that earlier, automotive, again with that strong volume that\u2019s pushing through, we are having some nice improvement on their SG&A as well.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","Got it. Okay. And then looking at Exego, can you give us anymore color on how you think you can grow that business going forward? Have you examined the growth opportunities? Do you have any color to share?","Tom Gallagher","We have examined it. And we think there were several opportunities there. I think that expanding the store count will help us as we go forward and that can either be organic growth or perhaps acquiring some smaller independent companies and then some product line extensions we think will help them in their growth strategy going forward. So, we are pretty optimistic about what can happen with that business.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","And that\u2019s all within existing geographies?","Tom Gallagher","Well, that would be in existing geography. And then at the outset when we made the acquisition, we have said that our first priority would be to continue to build out and enhance market share in Australia, New Zealand and then medium term, we would be looking to use that company as a platform company to expand up into some Southeast Asian markets, which we still think could make some sense.","Seth Basham - Wedbush","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Michael Montani, ISI Group.","Michael Montani - ISI Group","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Tom Gallagher","Hey, Mike.","Carol Yancey","Hey, Mike.","Michael Montani - ISI Group","First one was for Carol, just wanted to understand how you guys are thinking about gross margins for the back half. I think from the last quarter\u2019s call, it sounded like there was opportunity for slight upside to gross margins and now I am hearing kind of around 30. So, is there any initiatives maybe you have on track that could kind of take those margins up all else equal or is it really going to be a function of customer mix and product mix?","Carol Yancey","What \u2013 I think what we are saying is we are getting a little bit further down we are saying around 30%. I mean, we certainly as I mentioned all four of our businesses have committees and a lot of initiatives going on, where they are looking at a lot of things, but I think some of the things that are headwinds to us will remain and some of that as I talked about within automotive and their key large customers, but we have got initiatives working in all our areas. And I think I guess that will be helpful just to maintain those margins or not have the deterioration that we have had, but certainly we are combining that with our SG&A improvement and the idea would be that we maintain this 20 basis point improvement in operating margin that we have right now.","Michael Montani - ISI Group","Alright, okay. Thank you. And a follow-up for Paul if I could on the auto side, there has been so much made of kind of volatility in weather and you touched on it somewhat, but the way we have been thinking about it is maybe like a low double-digit increase in April could still be up low to mid single, can you provide any color in terms of either how you guys exited, what July looks like or really what the sequential moderation would have been there?","Paul Donahue","So, Mike, we came out of Q1 as you know very strong and that continued right through both April and May. We saw some deceleration in June. And while it was still a good month, we were certainly up against some stronger comps. And I would say that early in July, just a couple of weeks in, we are seeing some of those same, I don\u2019t want to say softness, but it\u2019s not at the run rate at April and May.","Michael Montani - ISI Group","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess the last question I had was just on the mega versus independent splits, in the past you guys have provided some color there in terms of year-over-year growth, can you provide an update there perhaps Tom or just how should we think about the balance between those two?","Tom Gallagher","But the mega growth was mid single-digit and the independent growth was just a tick down from that. And as I said, it\u2019s the first positive quarter that we have seen on the independent side in six quarters. So, we were pleased to see it and it\u2019s the closest comparable performance we have seen between the two over that same time period.","Michael Montani - ISI Group","Okay, great. Thanks guys. Good luck.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Mike.","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","And we do have time for one final question. Your final question for today will come from the line of Liang Feng with Morningstar.","Liang Feng - Morningstar","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Liang Feng - Morningstar","Could you discuss in further detail the main drivers of your Major Accounts growth and whether your go to market strategy in this segment has changed a lot to help drive this double-digit performance?","Tom Gallagher","I will take a first step at it and Paul may jump in. The way the program is structured is that we have headquarters to headquarters contact. And we talk about what our capabilities might be and what our value proposition might be to a major account. If there is an interest on their part to expanding the relationship, some of the terms and conditions are negotiated at the headquarters level. But then the actual implementation is done at the store level, market by market. And our proposition to the major accounts hasn\u2019t changed for a number of years. Perhaps our consistency, dependability, our level of execution in the field may be partly what\u2019s driving that at the rates that we are growing today.","Paul Donahue","Yes. I would just add to that that we have got great relationships with our key partners on the major accounts side. So you are talking about the likes of AAA, and Firestone, and Goodyear tire kingdom. Our competitors are chasing that business as well. We have got a very focused effort. We have got a great team that works very hard to grow our market share inside of those major accounts. And our team has done a very good job as I think is evident in our recent numbers.","Liang Feng - Morningstar","Yes. This performance is particularly notable because several of your larger competitors have noted the desire to target major accounts more aggressively, have you noticed any changes within your competition from these larger competitors within this field?","Paul Donahue","No, I would just say that everyday the battle, right. Whether it\u2019s major accounts or the business on the street, but we have not seen a major change in the levels of competition with our majors.","Liang Feng - Morningstar","Thank you.","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","And that will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer portion. I would like to turn the conference call back over to management for closing remarks.","Carol Yancey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We want to thank everybody for participating in today\u2019s call.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Thank you, Mr. Jones. You may begin.","Sid Jones","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter 2018 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for 2019. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results. I will make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our businesses. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2019. After that, we'll open the call to your questions.","We were pleased to build on our prior progress in 2018 and report another solid quarter of improved results. For the second consecutive quarter, each of our three business segments grew their revenues with positive core sales comparisons and combined with the added benefit of our accretive acquisitions. We further improved our operating results with a 30 basis point increase in total operating margin. These results let our team to produce record sales and earnings for 2018 as well as improve our working capital position and generate strong cash flows. To recap, total GPC sales in the fourth quarter were $4.6 billion of 9.4% from 2017 driven by a 0.6% comp sales increased and a 6% benefit from strategic acquisitions, net of a 1.2% negative impact from foreign currency translation. The 4.6% increase in comp sales reflects our strongest growth in 2018 up from the 4.3% increase in the third quarter plus 3.4% in the second quarter and the plus 2% in the first quarter.","Net income in the fourth quarter was $187 million and earnings per share were $1.27. Excluding the impact of transaction and other costs as we covered in our press released adjusted net income was $198 million or $1.35 per share up 13% from the adjusted earnings per share in 2017. For the year total sales were record $18.7 billion a 14.9% increase compared to 2017. Net income was $810 million and EPS were $5.50. Before the impact of transaction and other costs, adjusted net income was $836 million and adjusted earnings per share, $5.68 a 21% increase on a comp basis to 2017.","Turning to a review of our business segments, sales at our Global Automotive Group were up 11.4% in the fourth quarter, including a 3.8% comp sales increase and the benefit of acquisitions less than unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 2%. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in our Global Automotive comp sales growth, which was up from a 3.3% increase in the third quarter, a 2.1% increase in the second quarter and a plus 1.5% increase in the first quarter of 2018. We would add that the operations in each of our regions, including North America, Europe, and Australasia contributed to the improved fourth quarter sales comp. In our U.S. Automotive division sales were up 4% in the fourth quarter with comp sales accounting for most of that at plus 3.3%. This was in line with our 3.2% comp sales increase in the third quarter and reflects a solid execution of our sales initiatives, sound fundamentals for the aftermarket and generally favorable weather conditions which drove improved demand for much of the year.","Following a cold winter in early 2018 the U.S. experienced a hot summer and warmer than average temps for most of the third quarter. This was followed by an early cold snap in October and November producing the coldest November in 27 plus years while December was impacted by warmer than normal temps and heavy rainfall in many regions of the U.S.","Our fourth quarter sales increase was driven by the positive growth with both our commercial and retail customers. Sales to the commercial segment, which represents 75% to 80% of our total U.S. Automotive sales outpaced our retail sales for the second consecutive quarter as sales to our NAPA AutoCare customers were strong at plus 3.8% for the quarter. NAPA AutoCare, an industry leading commercial program for our automotive business and a key sales driver for us ruled over 18,000 members and 2018. To that end, we are pleased with the improved numbers our team is driving through our NAPA AutoCare segment and we remain confident that improving trend will carry over into 2019. We're also pleased to report continued progress with our major account partners as sales to this group improved in the fourth quarter. We expect to see this positive trend continue in the quarters ahead, do our ongoing and extensive efforts to meet and exceed both the product and service demands of these national and regional customer.","In our retail business, we continue to deliver positive sales comps due to initiatives such as NAPA Rewards Program, now 9.4 million members strong and growing, expanded store hours across our network and our retail impact store project. In 2018 we completed the rollout of the retail impact initiative in our company owned stores and we're pleased that these stores continue to outpace the sales growth and our non-impact traditional stores. We also began implementing this initiative with our independently owned stores in 2018 and we'll continue this roll out over a multiyear process to drive additional retail sales across the NAPA network. In summary, our U.S. Automotive team delivered a solid fourth quarter and for the year this group produced 4% sales growth. We are pleased to see the momentum built throughout the year and expect to see this continue into 2019.","Turning to 2019 we entered the new year with Kevin Harrington as President of the U.S. Automotive Operations. Kevin is a 29-year NAPA veteran with significant leadership experience and a deep knowledge of the automotive aftermarket and we're excited to have him lead the U.S. Automotive team into the future. We further bolstered our North American automotive business with the addition of Scott Sonnemaker, who joined the company earlier this month as Group President, North American Automotive. And this key role created the streamline the automotive structure and further our global focus. Scott has responsibility for all aspects of the automotive business in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Scott is a seasoned executive in the distribution industry having spent 20 plus years in leadership roles at Sysco Foods. We're excited to have Scott on board and lead our efforts to maximize the future growth of this important segment of the company.","Rounding out our North American automotive operations, total sales were up mid-single-digits of both NAPA, Canada and in Mexico before the negative impact of foreign currency translation. In Canada, we continue to drive our core sales growth with the solid execution of our sales initiatives and continue to benefit from our creative tuck in acquisitions which have expanded our Canadian presence. Our leadership team in Canada is also doing a fine job of improving their operating results and we expect another solid year in Canada in 2019. In Mexico, we have operated for the last several years under two banners, Autototo, our legacy business model in Mexico and NAPA Mexico. We launched our NAPA Initiative in 2014 top rate in sync with our U.S. and Canadian NAPA Operations.","Our long-term strategy has been to move to one banner in Mexico. To that end, we have entered into an agreement to dye bath the Autototo business effective March 1, 2019. Autototo represents approximately $100 million in annual automotive revenues and was not a significant contributor to our overall profitability. We're excited to move forward with a greater focus on NAPA, Mexico and the growth opportunities we see to expand on our sales, market share and growing our NAPA footprint in Mexico. ","In Europe, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of the AAG acquisition in November of 2018 and in both the fourth quarter and full year, this business produce solid sales and operational results across its European footprint. This is a spatially encouraging in light of the unusually mild weather and many regions of Europe during the fourth quarter as well as the continued political unrest in France and ongoing Brexit concerns in the UK. All in, the AAG team remain focused on finishing the year strong, producing mid-single-digit comp sales increases driven by positive growth in each region. In addition, AAG is on positive growth in each region. In addition, AAG's ongoing acquisitions favorably impacted our sales in Europe with TMS Motor Spares acquired on August 31 and Platinum acquired October 2, having an especially positive impact in the UK. As you may recall, TMS is the leading automotive parts distributor based in Carlisle, England with seven locations there and 17 locations in Scotland. Platinum International Group based in Manchester, England is a value-added battery distributor with nine UK locations and one location in the Netherlands.","We see additional opportunities for acquisitions in Europe and we are pleased to begin the year with the closing of the Hennig Group acquisition on January 8. Previously announced in 2018 Hennig Group is one of Germany's leading supplier of vehicle parts with 31 branches across Germany and estimated annual revenues of $190 million. The addition of Hennig Group further expands our presence and scale in the German marketplace and we're excited to have them join the AAG team. ","We are quite pleased with AAG 2018 performance and positive contribution to GPC. Our strategic expansion into Europe require the right partner with a history of proven success and a vision for the future and with AAG we have that team in place. We enter 2019 excited to begin our second full year with the AAG team and are encouraged by the growth opportunities we see for our European operation. In Australia and New Zealand, we had another solid quarter with both total sales and comp sales up mid-single-digits in local currency. Additionally, the age of PAC team did a fine job of converting this strong growth to improve their fourth quarter operating results. All in, 2018 proved to be another year in a series of strong performances by the age of PAC team and we expect this to continue into 2019. The economic growth in Australia is fairly robust and projected remains wrong. The favorable economy and sound aftermarket fundamentals combined with the ongoing execution of our growth plans both well for the continued growth of our Australasian automotive business.","In summary, our global automotive group posted solid results in the fourth quarter and we move forward into 2019 with plans for digital sales growth and operating improvement.","Now let's turn to our Industrial Parts Group, which continues to post some progressive sales growth and improved operating results. Total fourth quarter sales for Industrial, were $1.6 billion, an increase of 8.7% including a 7% comp sales growth plus a benefit of acquisitions. This represents the second straight quarter of 7% sales comp, our strongest since 2014. It also continues our two-year run of consistent sales increases driven by the effective execution of our growth initiatives and the favorable economic and industry-specific factors which continue to benefit the industrial marketplace. These factors include industrial indicators such as purchasing managers index, manufacturing industrial production, active rate counts, and U.S. exports. A broad strength in the industrial marketplace is also evident in our product and industry sector sales performance. Again, this quarter of 14 of our major product groups posted sales gains with a specially strong results and safety products and industrial supplies, hose, pumps and pneumatics [ph]. Likewise, sales to 10 of the Top 12 industries we serve were up as well highlighted by double digit increases in the iron and steel, chemicals and allied products, oil and gas extraction and rubber and plastic industries. ","Our growth initiatives for Industrial include ongoing strategic acquisitions. The addition of hydraulic supply company in the fourth quarter performed well and was a creative to our results. Last week we also announced the acquisition of Axis New England, which we expect to close next month. Axis is a leading automation and robotics business with locations in Danvers, MA and Rochester, New York. It further expands our capabilities in the area of Industrial plant floor automation. Axis highlights our ongoing strategy to participate in the fast-growing automation space and further builds on our previous acquisitions. We look forward to having Todd Clark and his talented team join us as part of the motion automation solution group. We expect this business to generate estimated annual revenues of $55 million. We are proud of the Industrial team and their tremendous operating performance in 2018 and as we look ahead to 2019 we expect to build on last year's success under the leadership of Randy Breaux, the recently appointed President Motion Industries.","Randy is a tremendous leader with significant experience in the industrial manufacturing and distribution markets. We're excited to have Randy lead our talented Motion team into the future. In addition to our future growth prospects in North America, we are planning to expand our industrial footprint into Australasia in 2019 with the full purchase of Inenco. As a reminder, this Australian based distribution company has operations in New Zealand as well as the growing presence in Indonesia and Singapore. GPC originally made a 35% investment in Inenco in 2017 and they have performed extremely well while growing both top and bottom line the last two years. We expect to be in a position to complete this acquisition at some point in calendar year 2019. Inenco's annual sales are approximately $400 million and is a great strategic fit with Motion aligning well with our strategic supplier base and providing for a market leading presence in Australasia, Indonesia and Singapore.","Now, a few comments about S.P. Richards, our Business Products Group. This segment reported total sales at $457 million up $1.6 million for the fourth quarter driven by the growth in comp sales. This represents a third consecutive quarter of sequential sales improvement for this business and follows a positive sales comp reported in the third quarter of 2018, the first positive comps since the third quarter of 2015. In addition, sales were up in three of our four product categories for the second straight quarter. These include core office supplies, technology and our facilities break room and safety supply category. It's also important to highlight that the SBR teams significantly improved their operating results in the fourth quarter hosting a 270 basis point improvement in operating margin. This was an excellent way to finish the year and we want to thank all of our S.P. associates for their great efforts. Today, S.P. Richards represents the only independent national business products wholesaler in the U.S. and we continue to believe that there is opportunity for this business to grow and deepen its relationship with both independent dealers and other customer channels. We will continue to invest in these growth opportunities where and when appropriate. ","So that recaps are consolidated and business segment results for the fourth quarter of 2018. We were pleased to report sales growth in each of our business segments and also show progress and our overall operating performance. Our team finished 2018 with positive momentum, which we will carry with us into 2019.","With that, I'll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol. ","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will discuss our full-year outlook for 2019. Our total sales of $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter were at 9.4% driving gross margin of 33.5% compared to 30.5% in 2017. For the full year, our sales of $18.7 billion increase 15% and our gross margin improved to 32% from 30% in the prior year. These comparisons reflects significant improvement in our 2018 gross margin due to several reasons. The Automotive and Industrial businesses have benefited from effective margin initiatives including ongoing negotiations with our global suppliers, more flexible and sophisticated pricing and digital strategies as well as more favorable product mix. In addition, the higher gross margin model at AAG and other acquisitions has positively impacted our gross margin throughout the year.","Specific to the fourth quarter, all three of our segments earned additional supplier incentives due to improved volumes and we also had the benefit of year-end inventory gains net of life out, which further improved our gross margin relative to 2017. With the continued emphasis on our margin initiatives, we expect our 2019 gross margin rates to remain relatively in line with our full-year 2018 rate. This the same as reasonable in place and have 1% to 2% and consistent levels of volume incentives. We experienced an inflationary pricing environment across each of our segments in 2018 with more normal inflation in our industrial and business products and more pronounced and more pronounced in place and in the fourth quarter for Automotive.","Overall, we attribute much of the fourth quarter and present place into the direct and indirect impact of tariffs, but we also had steady price increases for raw materials, commodities and supplier freight spread throughout the year. While the impact of tariffs was not significant in 2018, we passed on the supplier increases to our customers to maintain our growth margin. We expect this to continue in 2019. Our cumulative supplier price increases for the 12 months of 2018 were up 1.8% in Automotive, up 3.8% in Industrial and up 1.8% in office. Our selling administrator and other expenses in the fourth quarter were $1.2 billion representing 26.4% of sales. For the year, these expenses were $4.6 billion or 24.6% of sales. These operating costs were up from 2017 and both the quarter and the year due to several factors including the impact of a higher cost model at AAG and other acquisitions as we discussed earlier.","In addition, increase investments in facilities and people in 2018 as well as rising costs in areas such as payroll, freight, delivery IT, cyber security also impacted our operations. Additionally, in 2017 we benefited from lower than expected year-end expenses in areas such as incentive compensation, legal and professional and insurance. This made for a more difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our selling, administration and other expenses on the income statement also includes $17 million and $30 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 respectively in transaction and other costs primarily related to AAG and the attempted transaction to spin off the business products group net of a favorable termination fee we received. In 2017, transaction and other costs primarily ray to AAG were $25 million and $44 million for the fourth quarter and the full year. We account for these items on the other net line in our segment information schedule in today's press release.","To improve on our operating expenses, we continue to work towards a lower cost but highly effective infrastructure. Our plans includes steps to accelerate the integration of our acquisitions, investments to enhance our productivity and supply chains and innovative strategies to unlock greater savings and efficiencies across our global operations. ","Now let's discuss the results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.6 billion up 11% from the prior year and their operating profit of $199 million was up 9% with an operating margin of 7.7% compared to 7.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017. While we continue to improve our leverage on solid sales SalesPro, this was offset by the increased investments in our facilities and people as well as rising costs in areas such as payroll and freight. Our Industrial sale for $1.6 billion in the quarter, a strong 9% increase from the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our operating profit of $131 million was at 12% and their operating margin improved to a solid 8.3% from 8.1% last year with a 20 basis point increase due to gross margin expansion and the ability to leverage their expenses on the strong sales growth. The Industrial business has been operating well now for eight consecutive quarters.","Our business product revenues were $457 million a 2% increase from the prior year and their operating profit of $26 million was up significantly driving 5.7% operating margin, which is up from 3% in 2017. There's a tremendous business to the year for the business products team. Our total company operating profit in the fourth quarter was up 14% on a 9% sales increase and our operating profit margin with 7.7% compared to 7.4% last year for a 30 basis point increase. This represents our second consecutive quarter of operating margin improvement. We had net interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter and for 2018 net interest was $93 million. In 2019 we expect net interest to hold fairly steady in the $91 million to $93 million range despite four rate increases in 2018 and another two expected for 2019. Our total amortization expense was $22 million for the quarter and $89 million for the full year. For 2019, we expect full year amortization to increased slightly to $90 million to$ 92 million. ","Our depreciation expense was $42 million for the fourth quarter and $153 million for the full year. We expect this to increase to $170 million to $180 million in 2019 due to the increase in capital expenditures in 2018 and our plans to further utilize our tax savings and strong cash flows for additional investments in 2019. On a combined basis, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $260 million to $270 million in 2019. Continuing with the segment information presented in our press release, the other line, which represents our corporate expense with $58 million in the fourth quarter and that includes $17 million in transaction and other costs discussed earlier. Excluding these costs, our corporate expense was $41 million or a $16 million comparable increase from 2017.","For the full year, our corporate expense was $174 million including $36 million in transaction and other cost or $138 million excluding these costs. This is up $27 million from 2017 on a comparative basis. Primarily, the increase in corporate expense for the fourth quarter and the full year reflects the incremental costs associated with our retirement plan valuation and other retirement benefits as well as an increase in short and long-term incentives, IT and security and cost-related to minority interests. With the these and other costs in mind, we expect our corporate expense to be in the $125 million $135 million range for 2019. Our tax rate for the quarter was 26.6%. This compares to our fourth quarter 2017 rate at 51% which included the required one-time unfavorable provisional adjustment related to tax reform. Our fourth quarter 2018 tax rate was higher than the first three quarters of 2018 due to the final transition tax expense adjustments as well as the non-deductible retirement plan expense that we mentioned earlier. The effective tax rate was 24.6% in 2018 and we're planning for a full year tax rate of 25% in 2019.","So, now, we'll discuss our balance sheet which remains strong and in excellent condition. Our accounts receivable was $2.5 billion up 3% from the prior year and well below our fourth quarter sales increase. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at December 31 was $3.6 billion down 4% from 2017 so our team's made significant progress in 2018 and are doing an excellent job of managing this key investment. Our accounts payable of $4 billion is at 10% due mainly to the benefit of improved payment terms with our key global partners. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio improved to 111% at December 31 of 2018. We're very pleased with the improvement in our working capital position and its positive impact on our cash flows. Our total debt of $3.1 billion at December 31 is down slightly from the $3.2 billion in 2017. We're comfortable with our current debt structure and we have a strong balance sheet and the financial capacity to support our future growth initiative as well as ongoing priorities for an effective capital allocation.","We generated strong cash flows in 2018 with $1.1 billion in cash from operations up 41% from 2017. In addition, our free cash flow, which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend improve to nearly $500 million from $263 million in 2017. We expect another solid year in 2019 and we're currently estimating $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow in the $400 million range.","Strong cash flow continue to support our priorities for the use of cash which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our key priorities for cash remain the real investment in our businesses, their repurchases, strategic acquisitions and the dividend. Regarding the dividend, yesterday, the board of directors approved a $3.05 per share annual dividend for 2019 marking our 63rd consecutive annual increase in the dividend paid to our shareholders; this represents the annual increase in the dividend paid to our shareholders, this represents the 6% increase from the $2.88 per share paid in 2018 and it's approximately 54% of our 2018 adjusted earnings per share which is in line with our targeted payout ratio. We invested $232 million in capital expenditures in 2018 and this reflects the step-up investment related to the addition of AAG and our plans for incremental spend in areas such as technology and productivity in our facilities.","For 2019 we will continue to reinvest our tax reform savings and our working capital improvement and we're planning for capital expenditures in the range of $300 million.","Regarding our share repurchase program, we purchased approximately 1 million shares of our common stock in 2018 and today we have 16.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We accept to be active in the program over the long-term and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.","So now let's discuss our guidance for 2019. And arriving at our 2019 full year guidance, we considered our performance in 2018, as well as our current risk, plans, and initiatives including the previously announced [indiscernible] acquisition. In addition, we took into account the impact of a strong U.S. dollar and the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future which by most accounts indicate the potential for a global economic slowdown at some point in 2019. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2019 to be in the range of plus 3% to plus 4% or plus 4% to plus 5% before the approximate 1% headwinds from foreign currency translation.","This guidance excludes the benefit of any unannounced or future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 2.5% to plus 3.5% total sales growth for the automotive segment, or plus 4.5% to plus 5.5% before the impact of an approximate 2% currency headwind. For the industrial segment, total sales growth of plus 5% to plus 6% and flat total sales for the business products segment. On the earnings side, we currently expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.90 or an adjusted $5.81 to $5.96 before the impact of an approximately 1% currency headwind.","Our going forward reflects the cautiously optimistic outlook for 2019. We are being cautious due to the potential front economic slowdown and in particular, a slowing industrial economy in the second half of the year. In addition, expect to see more challenging sales environment in Europe in 2019. Despite these conditions though, we're optimistic that our management teams have the plan and initiatives in place to work through the issue and show more progress than 2019. Likewise, we're very confident in the underwriting fundamentals of our broad and growing business platform which provides us with sustained long-term growth opportunities.","So that's our financial report for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2018, as well as our outlook for 2019. We were very pleased to finish the year with solid results and we look forward to reporting from progress in the coming quarters.","With that, I turn it back to Paul.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Carol. Reflecting on 2018, our team was hard at work executing on their sales and cost initiatives to drive stronger pipeline topline growth, improve our operating results and enhance our earnings growth. We were also focused on ensuring a successful year in our European operations and capturing the synergies planned for this acquisitions. Likewise, with the combination of VIS and Motion on January 1 of 2018. We focus this year building on the synergies created by a larger and stronger industrial operation.","Finally, we significantly improved our working capital position during the year driving exceptional cash flows utilized for key investments in the company, as well as turn of capital via share repurchases and dividend which we just increased for the 63rd consecutive year as announced earlier today. With these things in mind, we're pleased to achieve record sales and earnings for the year, and encouraged by the operating improvement across our global distribution platform in North America, Europe and Australasia. Our team had many accomplishments and we are proud of their efforts to create long-term value for our shareholders.","Turning to calendar; we are excited for the opportunities to build on the positive momentum generated in 2018. GPC is well positioned to capital on it's many global prospects, and further improve our operating results. With that said, we are also very aware of the potential for a slowdown in the global economy as Carol mentioned, and that was a key factor in arriving at our outlook for 2019. Our growth plans, however, our solid, we remain committed to an organic and acquisitive growth strategy to drive long-term and sustain revenues while also focusing on the continued improvement in our gross margins and cost management. We are confident that our unwavering focus in these areas combined with a continued emphasis on a strong balance sheets, excellent cash flows and effective capital allocation will serve to maximize your return to our shareholders. We're excited for the future and as always we look forward to updating you on our progress when we report again.","With that, we'll turn it back to the operator and Carol and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","On the Allianz [ph] business, I mean you've talked about some weather and the political concerns. Could you sort of stack which was a bigger issue? And it sounds like you still copped up mid-single-digits. Was that local currency?","Paul Donahue","That was local currency, Bret. And look, our team at AAG, despite some of the challenges that they faced in the quarter, had a darn good quarter. And I give them a whole lot of credit for executing on a number of their key initiatives. We've got a -- as you know, that market, Bret, it's fragmented. Lots of opportunities to continue to roll up bolt on acquisitions as well as some good strategic ones. And again, I give our team a ton of credit because they had some real headwinds, but despite those headwinds posted a solid quarter.","Bret Jordan","What are you saying over there as you look at payable program both in the European business and maybe Australasia as well? Carol, maybe you could talk about what can be liberated out of working capital maybe?","Carol Yancey","And our working capital improvement that we had this year was not related to Europe, but having said that, we worked with the teams over there and our teams here to start putting in place a number of our similar programs. So, we do expect to see some working capital improvement starting in 2019. We have similar supply chain programs already in place for Europe and we have some of our global partners, some on and some coming on. So we would expect to see some working capital improvement from them in 2019.","Bret Jordan","And then I guess one just housekeeping. As you look at the fourth quarter in the U.S. business, the sort of the cadence of the quarter I'd imagine it's similar to what other people are saying October, November, strong and December weak. But maybe you could talk maybe a little about the cadence and regional performance. ","Paul Donahue","Now, that's exactly right, Bret. We're no different than many others who have reported October and in November were definitely the strongest two months and then we saw our sales moderate in December. And think the moderation in December was really related just to kind of how the holidays timed out coupled with the warmer temps and a ton of rain across the U.S. As we look at our regionality of our business, I got to give a call out to our Midwest team. They had a terrific Q4. And you know, when you look at some of the temperature up in the cities like Chicago in Q4 and on end of January and as the polar vortex rolled across, had really spiked our business and it continues to do well. So Midwest was definitely a top performer for us. The Northeast performed well again as they did all of 2018 and the Central Division. So again, you look across the Upper Midwest, Brent really going from the Midwest all the way to the Northeast was solid business for us. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Suzuki","So, the business products segment made a pretty nice come back here with solid comps through the last two quarters and some nice operating margin expansion. Since the spinoff plan fell through, has there been a reallocation of attention or resources to S.P. Richards? And then what do you view as the longer term outlook for that business? ","Paul Donahue","Well, Liz, great question. And I would say a few things about our office team led by Rick Top and they had a really solid second half of the year. They were focused on the business and won some new business. And in addition to driving some good core results out of our office supply, the core office supply business, I would also tell you that we saw good growth in our facilities and break room business and along that up the line and it kind of goes with the second part of your question about are we make an investment in the S.P. Richards business. We just brought on a key executive -- industry executive, Steve Shells [ph] to run our FPS business. And he is a well-qualified executive. We expect to see continued growth out of that segment. Long-term, Liz with S.P. Richards, we are head down operating the business and I think what you saw with the much better performance in Q3, Q4 when our team is solely focused on running the business and the changes that are happening in the industry we'll see better results. And again, we're really proud of the team and a great job they did in the second half of the year. ","Elizabeth Suzuki","And just a question on NAPA, I hear automotive segment has had a split of about 75%. DIFM about 25% DIY for a long time. And if we look at this business in 20 years, do you think the split is still going to be about 75%, 25% or is there a plan to evolve that over time?","Paul Donahue","Well, you know, Liz, we have embarked on a longer-term plan to upgrade our stores and we've now completed all of our company stores and we saw a nice lift in our retail business. We're now embarking on a similar strategy with our independent owned stores and our goal is to help our independence lifts their retail business as well. But even with those key initiatives, DIFM is going to be the larger segment. It certainly the faster growing segment, the vehicle population today is only growing more and more complex. I don't see that changing anytime soon. So I would expect certainly into the future our mix will stay relatively similar to what it is today. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","So, first one I got through the impact of tariffs. So to start with, it looks like your Automotive inflation year to date moved to 140 basis points relative to last quarter. That seems pretty massive. I would like imply something, the order of 500 basis points of inflation to Q4 and actually have something wrong there. Just wanted an aiding comment on that.","Carol Yancey","So, first of all, the tariffs, as we talked about it in our last quarter, the 10% tariff that went into effect that relates to about 18% to 20% of our U.S. cost of goods sold that's coming from China. So as it relates to that cost of goods sold, we worked with our Chinese suppliers, we took into account many factors with our teams, our cross-functional teams, we negotiated with the Chinese suppliers, we looked at the effect of currency and ultimately, we had more of say 4% to 5% increase that we took and that we also passed on to our customers. So what you saw in Q4 was definitely the impact of the tariffs coming through in the quarter that was pretty late in the year. So, we were able to pass that through and obviously you can see that in our growth margins.","So as we look ahead, we're expecting about a 1% inflation for U.S. Auto for 2019. That does not contemplate any further changes to tariff. ","Chris Bottiglieri","I guess maybe two follow-ups there. So you would think, I mean, if it was 4% to 5% Q4 take several quarters for you to anniversary that. So why wouldn't the inflation impact, I guess be more '19 and what percent? That's the first part.","Carol Yancey","So again, I think the 4% to 5%, it's not on all categories. There was only certain categories that this tariff applied to, so there were some key categories that it applied to. So when you blended in to the total automotive business and you look at it across the board, it waters itself down to say a 2% or 1%, and that's a cumulative number as it comes through. So we're not expecting a lot of those changes went in late Q4, so we're expecting some additional inflationary environment going into 2019 is probably the best way to say that. We said in our prepared remarks that inflation would be 1% to 2%, and I would tell you right now our best estimate is about 1% for U.S. Automotive, and about 1.5% to 2% for Business Products and Industrial. And again, more than anything, what's important is that our ability to take those price increases and pass it through to the customer.","Chris Bottiglieri","And then I wanted to -- kind of given your weaker economic outlook, or just -- I guess preparing for that; I wanted to ask you a question on kind of downside risk. If you look at your automotive business in the U.S. can you tell us how the business performed out of same-store basis back in the economic downturn, the next one could be as bad as the but I just want some context. And then, similarly, I know you're new to the UK and to Germany, but those management teams are still obviously with the company and I'm sure that a lot of them are around with the downturn. Is there a way to contextualize how those business performed in the last economic downturn as well just to understand the cyclicality of those business in Europe? Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Well, I think the first comment I want to just clarify; so our U.S. business comps, you're coming off -- I mean, obviously, second half is stronger than the first half but we had about 1.6% U.S. comps for 2018. We're implying in our guidance for U.S. comps to be up 3% to up 4%; so we are not implying weakness in our U.S. comps, I think what you're speaking to more specifically is probably related to either Europe or the industrial business but our North American automotive businesses and our Australasia and automotive businesses going into 2019 are improved from 2018.","Paul Donahue","And Chris, I would just add to that, generally what we see in the automotive aftermarket in a slower economy which generally will result in fewer new cars sold, the automotive aftermarket generally performs pretty well, people hold onto the vehicles longer, they are conducting more repairs on those vehicles during the course of the year. So whether it be in Europe or the U.S., if there is a slowdown, and that's yet to be determined, I think our automotive aftermarket will be just fine and as you mentioned, we've got a very experienced team on the ground in Europe that has worked their way through these economic cycles that I think will be just fine.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","My first question on the U.S. auto business, you spoke to favorable weather trends for most of 2018, based on what you've seen in 2019 to-date, how do you think the weather situation is setting up for 2019?","Paul Donahue","Seth, I think that while we can't go into too many specifics about what we're seeing in Q1, anytime we're seeing that kind of extreme weather pattern, so we're seeing again and we're seeing actually this week across parts of the U.S.; that's going to bode well for the automotive parts business and I think what we're now experiencing is really the back-to-back normalized winters. And as we have said many times in these calls through the years, that's what this business needs and our business like our peer group, generally performs much better when we're in those kinds of normalized weather patterns.","Seth Basham","Excellent, that's helpful perspective. Secondly, as we think about the gross margin outlook here; first, in terms of the fourth quarter performance for auto, you talked about a few drivers, maybe you could help us tell [ph] in terms of listing the biggest drivers in terms of degree of magnitude to the gross margin improvement between supplier negotiations and pricing and rebates?","Carol Yancey","Yes, so happy to answer that. As you may recall, through the nine months our gross margin with AAG was up about 150 basis points and we ended the year up 180 basis points. So the strong fourth quarter was a combination of several things; so as we have said all year, automotive and industrial had improved gross profit all year and that continued into the fourth quarter, as has AAG. So AAG including some of the synergies as we continue to integrate those business, as well as their acquisitions have had a strong gross margin. In addition, as Paul mentioned, our favorable results in office products that grew; if they had a more favorable product mix and that helped with their gross margin conversion, so you see that in their operating margin and a lot of that flow through to the gross margin line.","And then lastly, automotive, industrial and office, all of them had better volumes which led to incremental supplier incentives that went into that number. And then we also had with some of this inflationary environment, we had favorable inventory gains and that was net of the LIFO at automotive and industrial. So while we're not going to breakout any one of those, those factors went into the Q4. Having said that we feel like this 32% rate as we look ahead is appropriate as we go forward.","Seth Basham","Just one follow-up on that. Regarding the pricing and digital initiatives that you've undertook in auto; can you give us some perspectives on how material they've been to your improvement in gross margin rate? And how you think those will benefit you going forward?","Carol Yancey","I guess we've factored that in, I mean you've seen the gross margin improvements all year in auto, and we would say that it's not any one thing but circling [ph] our investments and pricing and data analytics and some of the new strategies that we're doing have gone into that. But also, from a global sourcing and our global supplier partners, I mean it's buy side and sell side strategy that have gone into that. So we've seen that throughout the year, and again, we would expect that to continue on into 2019. And then the great thing is, we had some inflation for the first time in many years, and as we look ahead to 2019, we expect to have a little bit of that as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers","I know you said that potential risk in the back half on a global economic slowdown. Is there anything that you're seeing now in the industrial business that's alerting you or causing you any concern or is it more sort of speculative and what others are talking about that -- just putting this in your guidance?","Paul Donahue","It's a great question, Chris, because what we're seeing on in on the industrial side, certainly with some of the key metrics that we follow very closely like, PMI, and manufacturing output. The PMI number in January was up from the December number; so it actually I think was over 56 in the month of January which we take as a real positive, and then you get a federal reserve number on industrial output and productivity and that was a little bit slower in the month of January. So there is some mixed signals out there, I would tell you that we're not feeling in our business yet, but there is just a lot of noise out there that you kind of worry about avoiding; we worry all the time, right, if you don't know pretty sure. But our full year projection, we still feel good about where our industrial business is going, and the team we have in place running that business.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then, as you're following up on the winter question asked before, I mean, [indiscernible] -- Canada I think was in polar vortex from the past 7 weeks or something like that and obviously the Midwest has been hit harder. Do you think the regional performance in the U.S. in 2019 could be different from what you've seen? I think the West was weaker earlier in '18 and really the Northeast and Midwest -- Northeast lead for most of the year and now it seems like the Midwest has picked up. Any sort of -- I'd love to hear your thoughts in terms of how the regional performance might change based on what we've seen so far?","Paul Donahue","Well, I think that question Chris is -- and it's a bit hard to say at this point. We have a number of initiatives that are going on in all of our geographical regions outside of weather impact that will influence our performance in those particular divisions, but as we sit here today and looking at another potential polar vortex coming across the U.S., it does appear that many of the same regions; the Midwest, the Northeast, the Central will be the benefactors of that extreme weather. I would add one of our geographical regions that we've seen a nice spike in '19 as out in out mountain division, so that includes Seattle and Colorado and Wyoming, etcetera; that business has gotten off to a good start in 2019. So it's good to see those folks stepping it up. So we'll wait and see, but again, we've got many key initiatives in the works that will certainly bolster all of our divisions in 2019.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then in terms of the operating margin outlook, is there any difference in terms of how you're thinking about the three divisions? And then related to that; is your comp needed to drive expense leverage coming down in '19 or will it be relatively consistent for 2018?","Carol Yancey","Chris, I think as we think about our operating margin, and look, we were pretty excited to have a second half operating margin as 7.7% in total. Our Q4 improvement at 30 bips was really great to see after 10 bips in Q3. We're anticipating 2019 probably something like 10 basis points to 15 basis points in total operating margins. I would have to say, just given our growth outlook that that would come from primarily automotive and industrial. But I want to point out and it's -- there are a lot of investments in our business that -- again, we've talked about our tax savings, we've talked about our CapEx, and we have been investing in our facilities and productivity, in people, and -- again, pricing, data analytics, supply chain, a lot of investments for the future, and those investments will help us. And I think those investments as it flows through the SG&A line, also depreciation, we've got that -- that we know will be beneficial long-term but we're still fighting these headwinds as we've talked about with the tight labor market and wages and payroll. And then also freight and delivery, so those categories still grew greater than our sales and I -- while we think some of the freight in field will level up in 2019, this tight labor market we're in and with wages, we're not sure that that necessarily cycles out.","So, I don't think it's a lower comp number, we have the margin improvement but again, we've implied some improved comp numbers for all of our businesses going forward. So again, on a long-term basis, we would expect to see operating margin improvement.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing comments.","Carol Yancey","We'd like to thank you for participating in our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. We appreciate your support and interest in Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to reporting out on our first quarter results.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sid Jones, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sid Jones","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts' third quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our earnings results and outlook for the full year. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Sid. And I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer are both on the call as well, and each of us has a few prepared remarks and once completed, we will look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have.","Earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2015 results and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.922 billion, which was down 2%.","Net income was $188.1 which was down 1%, and earnings per share were $1.24 this year compared to $1.24 in the third quarter last year, putting us even in EPS for the quarter.","As has been in the case for year along, currency exchange has been a significant headwind for us both on the revenue and earnings results and the impact accelerated in the third quarter. Importantly, the local currency results for our international businesses remain solid but when converted to U.S. dollars we lost 4% on the revenue line and 5% per share in EPS in the quarter. Or stated in another way without currency impact our sales were up 2% and EPS was up 4%.","In addition to the currency headwind, we continue to experience a slowdown in specific segments of the economy which impacted several of our businesses but most significantly in industrial and electrical. We will comment on this factor a bit more as we review the individual businesses and as we customarily do I will cover the non-automotive operations and then Paul will report on the automotive segment.","Starting with Office Products, this Group saw this deceleration on the revenue side in the quarter. After being up double digit since sales growth in each of the first two quarters, the Office Products team ended the quarter up 3%.","The deceleration is primarily attributable to anniversary in both increased volume from the Office Depot\/OfficeMax merger last year, as well as the impact products acquisition that was completed in July of 2014.","Each of these was a significant contributor to the double digit growth rates generated over the past four quarters and we anticipated the moderation in Q3. However, we would have to say that we saw a bit more deceleration than expected and more so as the quarter progressed. Our sense is that the underlying Office Products demand has softened over the past 90 days.","From a channel perspective, the softening was more pronounced on the independent reseller side and we ended the quarter down mid single digits. Our mega channel remains strong posting another big double digit increase.","On the product side, facility and breakroom supplies and furniture each had strong quarters and core office supplies were positive as well. Our technology products were down mid single digits.","So putting it all together, our Office Product segment was up 3% for the quarter which in the current environment is probably a solid performance. However, we were expecting just a bit more in the quarter and we're watching the recent slowdown closely.","Before closing on Office Products we do want to mention the acquisition that was completed on October 1. Malt industry is a $20 million distributor at safety products and this acquisition will help to further diversify both the product and customer portfolios for impact products and for S. P. Richards and we\u2019re pleased to now have miles industries as part of our organization. They will contribute nicely to our Office Products results in the quarters ahead.","Moving over to the industrial segment, Motion industry has experienced another challenging quarter ending the quarter with a 4% decrease. And demand patterns across our customer base were similar to what we have seen pretty much all year long.","Customers and segments like lumber and wood products, food processing, cement and aggregate and automotive were generating solid positive results for us and we continue to make good progress with these accounts.","Conversely, however, customers in the mining and resource oil and gas, iron and steel, pulp and paper and original equipment manufacturing are all running sizable decreases for the third quarter and year-to-date and notably the rate of decline actually accelerated as the quarter progressed.","So despite the fact that there are number of positives within our industrial results, they are being more than offset by some of the specific headwinds and circumstances that we\u2019re encountering and we don\u2019t see this changing in the near term.","In the meantime, our industrial team remains focused on key elements of their growth strategy. They were able to complete one acquisition in the quarter, Lake Erie Tool & Abrasive was acquired on September 1. This is a pre location distributor of tools and abrasives with annual revenues of approximately $30 million and Lake Erie will be a nice addition to the Motion organization.","Additionally, the Motion team continues to make progress in the areas of securing new corporate account agreements, penetrating new markets and expanding share of wallet initiatives, each of which will contribute incremental revenue in the months ahead and will help to offset some of the declines that we are experiencing in the key customer categories mentioned earlier.","But as with office products, we saw deceleration in our industrial results over the quarter which we feel is reflective of the ongoing challenges being faced by many segments of the manufacturing sector in the economy and this is a situation that will take a bit more time to work us way through.","And I will wrap up the non-automotive operations with a few comments on EIS, our Electrical Segment Entity. This Group ended the quarter up 2% but in looking at the results more closely it shows that they are down 2%, netted acquisitions and copper pricing and similar to Motion many of their manufacturing base customers are experiencing end market headwinds.","However it's interesting to note that EIS is made up of three different business segments. Electrical is the largest at 40%, fabrication is 30% and wire and cable is 30% and it's in the electrical segment where we are experiencing the most challenges.","This business is running behind year-to-date while our fabrication and wire and cable segments are both generating solid increases, validating the diversification strategy that was embarked upon several years ago and this is something that they will continue to drive in the quarters ahead.","End markets will remain challenging for the EIS team at least for the near term especially on the electrical side but they do have a number of potentially positive initiatives underway primarily in the fabrication and wire and cable sides of the business, and we are pleased with the progress they have made in each of these segments.","So that will conclude the comments on the non-automotive businesses. And Paul will now review the automotive operations with you. Paul?","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Tom. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I\u2019m pleased to be with you here today and have the opportunity to revive you an update on our third quarter performance of our automotive business.","For the quarter ending September 30, our global automotive sales were down 2% year-over- year. This performance consists of approximately 4% in core automotive growth, which is consistent with the second quarter and improved from the 3% underlying growth we reported in the first quarter.","However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 6% in the third quarter, which is up from a 4% currency impact in the first and second quarters. Previously, our expectation was the currency to hold at\/or around 4%.","Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the third quarter which is improved from the 3% growth we reported for the first and second quarters. Our international businesses which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand reported another quarter of mid-single digit growth and local currency.","We are encouraged by the positive trends we are experiencing in our U.S. results and the steady growth across our international markets. We expect that these trends continue in the periods ahead.","In the U.S. we are pleased with the progress and we are seeing in our field operations across the country. While result vary by geographical reason, our teams are executing on our key initiatives and again we are pleased with the progress","The Atlantic, North East, Central and Southern Region showed the strongest growth in the quarter. Likewise, our sales in the mid-western region of the country rebounded nicely in the quarter. This pay group reported solid growth following flat sales in the second quarter, which was directly related to the wet weather patterns experienced in this spring and early summer.","The number of our stores throughout the South West including Texas and Oklahoma, as well as a number of our stores in the mountain division which includes Montana and the Dakotas continue to feel the effects of the downturn in the oil and gas business.","So now let\u2019s take a look at our same store sales for Q3.We are pleased to report our U.S. Company own store group. Group stores sales grew comps store sales in the third quarter by 5%. This is an improvement over 3% comp store increases we reported for both the first and second quarters. This 5% increase is on top of the 6% increase generated in the third quarter of 2014 giving us a two year stack of 11%.","Our 5% increase in the third quarter was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business and by our retail business. Let's start with that retail results.","As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand our revamp DIY initiatives across our company owned store group. We\u2019re pleased to report these initiatives are having a positive impact on the results as evidenced by an 8% increase in our retail business. This increase is being driven by both transaction and basket size increases, and is up from a 7% increase in the second quarter and on top of the 5% increase one year ago.","As mentioned earlier, our retail initiatives have had a positive impact on both the size our average ticket and the numbers of tickets moving through our stores. In the third quarter we experienced an increase on our average retail ticket and a significant jump in the number of retail tickets.","While we are still on the early dates of our rolling out our retail strategy, we are pleased with the initial returns. We have a great deal of heavy lifting in front of us but our team both in the stores and here at headquarters is truly energized.","Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business, this is the dominant segment of our automotive business and in Q3 we turned in a 4% increase. This is a nice improvement from the 2% increase we reported in the second quarter and is on top of the 6% increase in the third quarter of 2014.","The centerpiece of our commercial and wholesale business remains our major account alliances, as well as our NAPA AutoCare business. Our NAPA AutoCare business surpassed another milestone in the quarter, as our membership count has now gone over the 16,000 mark in the U.S., this Group generated high single digit sales increases in the quarter.","And we can also report our major account partners delivered steady and solid growth in the quarter. Our fleet business bounced back after moderating somewhat in Q2. Sales to our fleet account showed a low mid-single digit sales increase in the third quarter which is in line with the overall growth of our U.S. commercial wholesale business.","Our wholesale ticket trend was consistent with what we experienced in the second quarter.","Our average wholesale ticket value was up mid-single digit with no benefit from inflation, while we saw a slight decline in the average number of tickets.","Let's take a look at a few of our key product categories and review the trends we experienced in the third quarter. Our brakes category was a highlight again in the third quarter and it has been a strong category for us all year. And as mentioned in last quarter's update, we experienced a strong selling season with our heating and cooling categories.","The warm summer temperatures we experienced across many parts of the country drove strong air conditioning sales well into September. We also saw a resurgence with our battery sales in the quarter. This category was off its historical growth rates in the first half of the year, but we are pleased to see a rebound in the third quarter.","And finally, our NAPA import parts business continues to expand as we registered another quarter of low double-digit growth. So looking ahead to the fourth quarter of the year, we expect the significant foreign currency headwinds impacting our reported results to continue.","That aside, we'll be working hard to further improve on our 4% underlying automotive growth achieved thus far in 2015.","Turning to the trends we are seeing across the automotive aftermarket, the fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains.","US driving topped 1.8 trillion miles over the first 7 months of the year, which is a new record. In addition, the latest month with reported figures is July, which was up 4.2% year-over-year, also a new record. This makes 17 consecutive months of increases in miles driven.","As we look ahead, strategic M&A will continue to be a growth lever for our automotive business. We mentioned in our Q2 conference call that we entered into an agreement to acquire Covs Parts, a 25 branch distribution company in Western Australia.","Covs will serve as a nice complement to our existing Repco business as they are focused on original equipment and aftermarket automotive parts, truck products and mining and industrial consumable.","We had hoped to close this acquisition on October 1, but are currently awaiting regulatory approval and are targeting a close date no later than December 1. The addition of Covs Parts further expands our presence and scale in Western Australia and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $90 million in US dollars.","Based on - back on August 1, we closed on a smaller store acquisition in Australasia, and although the revenues for this business are less than $10 million annually, these types of bolt-on acquisitions throughout North America and Australasia will continue to be a key focus for our teams.","So in closing, we are pleased to show progress in our third quarter automotive results and we're working hard to continue these positive trends. We would like to thank our teams both in North America, as well as Australasia for their efforts and appreciate all that they do for the GPC automotive business.","So that completes our overview of the GPC automotive business and at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul and good morning. We'll begin with a review of our income statement and segment information and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items.","Our total revenues for the quarter were $3.9 billion, consisting of underlying sales growth of 1.4%, seven tenths of 1% contribution from acquisitions. These items were offset by a strong currency pressures of 3.7%, which was somewhat stronger than we had anticipated.","For the nine months through September, our total revenues of $11.6 billion, a 1% increase, consists of 2.4% core growth and 1.2% from acquisitions, offset by a 3% currency headwind.","Our gross profit for the third quarter was 29.8%, up slightly from the 29.7% gross margin last year. For the nine months, our gross margin of 29.8% compares to the 29.9% reported last year.","The progress we made in the third quarter is encouraging and primarily reflects the improvement in our automotive margins, although the office and electrical businesses also increased.","The improvement in these businesses was partially offset by the continued pressure we're experiencing in our industrial business, which is due to the sluggish sales environment and lower inventory purchases, which ultimately negatively impacts supplier incentives earned.","Executing on our gross margin initiatives is a key priority for our management team and we're committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long-term. We would also add that our gross margin initiatives are critical in offsetting the low inflationary environment that has persisted across our businesses for several years now, especially in automotive.","Cumulative supplier price changes through September are negative three tenths of 1% for automotive, positive seven tenths of 1% for industrial, positive six tenths of 1% for office products, and a negative 1.5% for electrical.","Turning to our SG&A, our total expenses were $869 million in the third quarter, which is a 2% improvement from the third quarter in 2014 and at 22.1% of sales compared to 22.2% last year.","For the nine months, our total expenses are $2.6 billion, which is a slight increase from 2014, but improved as a percentage of sales to 22.4% compared to 22.5% last year. Our teams remain focused on controlling expenses in this environment and we continue to take actions to further improve our productivity and streamline our operations to enhance performance.","Although we would expect to see more progress on this line in the periods ahead, it's also important to note that our SG&A as a percentage of revenue traditionally trends upward in the fourth quarter relative to the first nine months of the year and we are planning for that.","Now let's talk about our segment results. Our automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.1 billion, which is down 1.7% from the prior year and 52% of sales. Our operating profit of $202 million is up 4.5% and their margin improved just strong 60 basis points to 9.8%, which was due to improved gross margins and also expense controls.","For the year, automotive sales of $6.1 billion are down seven tenths of 1% and our operating profit of $560 million is up 1.8% and our margin is improved year-to-date by 20 basis points to 9.2.","Our industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the third quarter, a 4% decrease in 2014 and 30% of our revenues. Our operating profit of $90 million is down 5.4% and our margin was down slightly 10 basis points to 7.7.","For the year, industrial sales of $3.5 billion represent 30% of our total revenues and are down 1% from 2014. Our operating profit of $267 million is down 2.6% and our margin is 7.5%, which is down 20 basis points from last year and this relates to the loss of leverage and lower incentives that have pressured this group for most of the year.","Office products revenues were $511 million for the quarter, up 2.9% and representing 13% of our revenues. Our operating profit of $36 million is up 9.3% and their margins showed nice improvement up 40 basis points to 7.1%.","This increase was driven by progress on both the gross margin and expense lines and it was partially related to the Office Depot, OfficeMax business, which we anniversaried July 1 of this year.","For the year, office product revenues were $1.5 billion, up 10.9% from 2014. Our operating profit of $107 million is up 9% and our margin is down 10 basis points from last year to 7.3%. So we're pleased to see our margin for this business stabilize.","The electrical electronic group had sales in the third quarter of $197 million, a 2% increase and 5% of total revenues. Our operating profit of $20 million is up 12.5%, so the margin for this group showed strong growth of 100 basis points to 10.2% which is a new record high.","For the year, sales for this group are $574 million, up 2%. Their operating profit of $54 million is up 8.6% and the margin has improved to 9.4 from 8.9 last year. So a very solid 50 basis point improvement.","So for the third quarter, our total operating profit was up 3% from last year and our operating margin improved by 40 basis points to 8.9% from 8.5%. For the year, operating profit grew 2% and our margin is 8.5%, which is up 10 basis points from the prior year.","Our margin expansion in the third quarter was driven by improvement in gross profit and also solid progress in managing our expenses. We're very pleased with this expansion given our current sales environment.","We had net interest expense of just over $5 million in the third quarter, and our year-to-date interest now stands at $16 million. We expect net interest expense of approximately $21 million to $22 million for the full year.","Our total amortization expense was $8.5 million for the third quarter and is $26 million through nine months, which is consistent with last year. We currently estimate total amortization expense to be approximately at $35 million for the full year.","The other line which reflects our corporate expense was $34.3 million for the quarter, which compares to $26.1 million last year. Through September corporate expense was $84.2 million compared to $74.5 million for the first nine months of last year.","Primarily unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments of $5 million and $7 million for the quarter and the nine months account for the increases. In addition, we've experienced slight increases in cost such as legal and professional and IT related investment.","Looking ahead we will expect that corporate expense line to be in the $100 million for the full year.","Our tax rate was 37.45% for the third quarter and 36.85% for the nine months. These rates are up from 2014 due to the changes in our mix of foreign income and the related foreign tax rate, as well as the unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustment that was recorded in the last two quarters. With these factors in mind, we currently expect our tax rate to be approximately 37% for the full year.","Our net income for the quarter of $188 million compared to $190.5 million in the third quarter last year and our EPS at $1.24 was equal to last year. For the nine months, our EPS at $3.56 is up 1% from the same period last year.","Now let's turn to our balance sheet, which we were able to further strengthen again in the third quarter. Specifically this speaks to our ability to effectively manage our working capital and drive increased cash flows.","Our cash at September 30 was $199 million, an increase from $136 million at September of last year. We continue to use our cash to support the growth initiatives across our distribution businesses.","Accounts receivable was $2 billion at September 30 is down 1% from the prior year and relatively in line with our 2% increase in sales for the third quarter. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time.","Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3 billion or down 1.5% from September and a decrease of approximately 2.5% from year end. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we\u2019ll remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels in the periods ahead.","Our accounts payable at September 30 was $2.9 billion, up 12% from last year, which reflects the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We're pleased with our continued improvement in this area and we're encouraged by the positive impact it has on our working capital and days and payables.","Our working capital was $1.9 billion at September 30, an improvement of 5% from last year. Effectively managing our working capital and in particular our accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable, remains a high priority for our company and we're pleased with our ongoing progress in this area.","Our total debt at September 30 was $625 million, which is a decrease from the $835 million last year and a decrease from $850 million at June 30. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 16.5% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time.","We believe it provides the company both the financial capacity and flexibility necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength for the company.","We also continue to generate solid cash flows driven by the significant improvement in our working capital. We\u2019re raising our 2015 cash flow projections for the full year. We're now planning on approximately $950 million in cash from operations.","Additionally we currently expect free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be approximately $450 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value.","Our first priority for cash is the dividend, which we've raised for 59 consecutive years. The 2015 annual dividend of $2.46 per share represents a 7% increase from the $2.30 per share paid in 2014 and its well within our goal of 50% to 55% payout ratio.","Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of our four businesses, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.","Our investment in capital expenditures was $25 million for the third quarter and through the nine months capital spending is $62 million. We expect our expenditures in the fourth quarter for the full year to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. The vast majority of our investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects primarily in technology.","Our depreciation and amortization was $34 million in the third quarter and its $106 million through nine months, which is down slightly from 2014. Looking ahead, we're projecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $140 million to $150 million for the full year in 2015.","Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of our cash for us and they're integral to our growth plans. For the nine months through September, we've invested approximately $115 million for the acquisition of several new distribution businesses, including the two in the third quarter previously covered by Tom and Paul.","Also as previously mentioned, we closed on an acquisition on the office products business, small industries and we expect to acquire Covs, as Paul mentioned, later this quarter.","So as you can see, acquisitions are important to our growth plans and we'll continue to seek new acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth.","Although many of these opportunities will be smaller sized companies with annual revenues in the $25 million $150 million range, we're open minded to new complimentary distribution business of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investments.","Finally, during the quarter we used our cash to repurchase approximately 950,000 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. For the nine months, we've repurchased 2.5 million shares and today we have seven million shares authorized and available for repurchase.","We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we've been slightly more aggressive with our repurchases given the value of our price during those for this year. We expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","That concludes our financial update for the third quarter and nine months. So in summary, we've growth plans in place and are intensely focused on showing progress in periods ahead.","Despite our recent challenges and the relative uncertainty in the global economy over the near term, we're encouraged by the fundamental opportunities we see across our distribution businesses.","In closing, we would like to thank all of our GPC associates for their hard work and commitment to their jobs. Our people truly are our greatest asset.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Tom.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Carol, and thanks to you and Paul for the comprehensive updates.","So that will conclude our prepared remarks and clearly it was another challenging quarter for us. However, underneath the headline numbers, there were a number of positives as well. Few examples, the 4% constant currency increase in automotive and 5% company store same-store sales growth shows steady progress as does our mid single digit local currency increases in Australasia, Canada and Mexico.","Also in Automotive, the continued strong results coming from the NAPA Auto Care and major account initiatives are two primary and commercial programs and the solid 8% increase in our retail business show good progress on both the commercial and retail sides of the business.","The completion of two key acquisitions in the quarter, one in office products and one in industrial and we expect to announce a few others of similar size before yearend and all this will give us a bit of a sales lift going into 2016.","Gross margin improved 12 basis points in the quarter and SG&A decreased six basis points enabling us to show operating margin improvement in three of our four businesses and an overall GPC operating margin improvement of 40 basis points.","On the balance sheet, good work was done in the areas of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, enabling us to show a nice reduction in working capital as well as a nice increase in cash generation and there are ongoing progress being made by GPC team in a number of key areas as well, which will all serve as well in the quarters ahead.","However, the one area that continues to give a significant challenge is revenue growth across all of our businesses. Currency is having an effect on each of the businesses to one degree or another both directly and indirectly, and specific economic issues are impacting us especially in industrial and electrical. Although both of these issues are transitory, we don\u2019t expect them to moderate in the near term.","Additionally as mentioned, we saw deceleration in our growth rates in three of our four businesses as the quarter progressed and the early October results are bit softer than planned. At this point, we don\u2019t see any evidence of share loss across the businesses and our sense is that we are seeing further softening and overall in market demand.","With all of that said considering current market circumstances and trends, we feel that's appropriate to revise our year-end guidance downward. Prior we gave you guidance on automotive of being up 1% to 2% and currently we would say that automotive will be flat to up just slightly with a 5% headwind from currency exchange.","Industrial, our prior guidance was flat to up 1 and now we would say down 2% to down 3% with a 1% currency impact. Office Products will remain the same, prior it was up 7% and 8% and currently we say it will be 7% and 8%. And electrical prior guidance was to be up 3% to 4%, and we would say now up 2% to 3%. So for total GPC prior guidance was up 2% to 2.5% and right now we would say flat to up slightly with little bit more than a 3% impact from currency exchange.","And with revenues at these levels, our prior guidance per earnings per share was to be $4.65 to $4.70, but we would say now $4.55 to $4.60 with a $0.15 to $0.16 per share currency exchange impact and on a comparable basis that would put us at $4.70 to $4.76, which will be up 2% to 3%.","So that will conclude our prepared comments. And at this time, we will turn the call back to Victoria to take your questions. Victoria?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Good morning, guys. Can you parse out the foreign exchange impact between Australia and Canada, et cetera? And do you think the headwinds should start to ease in maybe not the next quarter, but starting 2016?","Tom Gallagher","I'll try to answer that Elizabeth. We can't give you the specifics right now on the impact by country, but I can\u2019t tell you that currency exchange quarter-end-over-quarter-end we were down about 20% in Mexican Pesos, about 18% in both Canadian and Australian Dollars. If that helps, we will be happy to follow up with you.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Okay, thanks. In the industrial segment, are there cost-cutting measures or price cuts that you can execute to try to offset the demand headwinds? Are you noticing any market share shifts among your competitors at all?","Tom Gallagher","We are adjusting our cost structure as we go forward. What normally happens is when we get in the periods like this and we have seen prior periods similar to this. Revenue declines a bit more quickly than we can get to cost structure down, but eventually, we will catch up with it.","And then at least based upon prior experiences what we have seen is that, when revenue does start to come back, the earnings come back fairly quickly and at a bit stronger pace because of the good work that the team does on the cost side of the business.","As far as share shifts, we don't see anything right now that would indicate to us that we are losing business. I had mentioned in my comments that good work is going on in landing new agreements with specific customers, which might suggest that we are at least holding our own, perhaps picking up a little bit, but as being overshadowed by the declines we are seeing in certain categories right now.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Becks with JPMorgan.","Mark Becks","Hi, thanks. On the sales guidance, I just wanted to sharpen the pencil on automotive and industrial. So it looks like it's implying kind of 5% to 9% declines in industrial and then in automotive, it seems like 4Q is like 2% to 6%. So I was just hoping you can - obviously, with 4Q being a little bit of a smaller quarter, it gives a wide range, so I'm hoping you can drill that down a little bit.","Tom Gallagher","You're going to have to help me on that. I get a little confused when you referenced second quarter.","Mark Becks","Yes, so if we use the guidance for down 2% to 3% in industrial, it seems to imply a down 5% to 9% decline in industrial. So I want to see if that seems appropriate. And then similarly with automotive, if we should be thinking about kind of 2% to 6% sales growth in that category for the fourth quarter.","Carol Yancey","I think on the industrial, you are probably a ted high. What you saw as Tom mentioned, the later part of the quarter got worse in the industrial segment. So we are guiding for a little bit worse in Q4 so it\u2019s probably more at the lower end of the range that you talked about.","And then I think as you look out for what automotive would be Q4, I think you are in line with what we are using. Part of that is the currency. If currency won\u2019t be quite as strong of an impact in Q4, it's going to be more back to where it was like Q2.","Mark Becks","All right, that's helpful. And then within industrial more specifically, if I look at your 4% sales decline, it looks like it was a little bit more severe than some of the competitors out there. I was just curious who you see the major competitors being, whether it be an Interline or perhaps maybe a Grainger or Fastenal who looked like their top line was a little bit stronger?","Tom Gallagher","Yes. We would not say that they are direct competitors. The best comparison I think would be with Applied Industrial Technologies with Kaman and with DXP. They would be the ones that we would encounter most frequently and would have the cost with the clearest overlap in product offering.","If we look at Interline or if you like at Grainger or Fastenal, we really don\u2019t overlap with them as much on the product categories that we sell.","Mark Becks","Understood. And then just last question, you operated a distribution business essentially with four distinct segments. I know some of the facilities are shared warehouses, but I was just hoping you can kind of tease out what benefits you derive from operating the multiple segments and then the potential synergies you gain, whether it be from fleet or transportation or shared services from the various segments? Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","You mentioned three of the areas where we do get some leverage, certainly on transportation both inbound and two to three outbound. We certainly get it in the area of shared services without question.","We don't share facilities to a large degree today. Each business runs independent facilities. That\u2019s something that we think potentially we could do as we go forward. We are looking at it now between the couple of the businesses. But we share technology enhancements and capabilities. We generally pilot something new in one of the business, prove the concept and then start to roll it into other businesses.","There are several things that we do across all of the businesses once we prove that the concept gives us a kind of returns that we are looking for.","Carol Yancey","And Mark I just want to be clear on automotive guidance that we talked about. What we were talking about is probably flat up slightly for Q4 that\u2019s what implies, but the FX would be about 4%. So that is kind of what you are talking about.","Mark Becks","Okay. So with kind of the 4% core automotive growth rate, it seems like that's a good number to think about for fourth quarter as well.","Carol Yancey","Yes, it is. And last year Q4 our automotive comp was at 6%. So that\u2019s a good number.","Mark Becks","Okay, great. Best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. Tom, I think in your final comments, you mentioned that revenue decelerated across the business through the quarter. Could you help, I guess give a little bit more color then into October and specifically in auto what you saw. Does that mean that auto had a really strong beginning of the quarter and now it's just at that lower level that you just inferred or what do you think is going on there?","Tom Gallagher","We saw the quarter was softer. The underlying business as Paul mentioned was pretty good. But we did see deceleration in our U.S. based business, as well as in the international businesses. The delta is not as significant in automotive as it is in industrial - and to a degree in office products.","The only business that we did not see deceleration across the quarter was in our electrical business. The other three all declined. If we look at the early results in October, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we saw in the back half of the quarter is softer than what it had been.","We think right now based upon what we can gather from talking with our customer base and with our supplier base is we think end market demands have pulled back a bit from what we had seen earlier in the quarter and certainly through first half.","Greg Melich","If I could follow up on the gross margin, what drove the expansion there, again, especially in auto? Was it the stronger dollar helping, price optimization, vendor leverage? What are you seeing there?","Carol Yancey","Actually Greg, it\u2019s all those things. We were pleased - this has been our second quarter, our gross margin improved with automotive and some of the things that we put in place earlier in the year and certainly you talked about it with our foreign operations.","We had to put some things in place on both the buy side and the sell side to combat the currency issues. Those are working quite nicely for us in Q2 and Q3. And then really on the U.S. business too, their gross profit is up as well and that\u2019s really just strong focus on both the buy side and the sell side. It\u2019s just really all across the board.","So we\u2019ve been pleased to see their improvements. I'd tell you going into Q4, the only headwind is going to be coming with industrial and just a further softening in their top line. So if we can maintain where we were at be flat or slightly up, through the rest of the year, but we\u2019ve got a little bit of headwind with industrial.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning to you. The first question I want to ask is about the cadence of cost control. The Company responded quite well to the revenue slowdown in the quarter, both in SG&A and in working capital. And the deceleration in SG&A growth or I guess the move to a decline was a real step change from where you had been.","The guidance that you gave as best I can tell suggests a trend in SG&A much closer to the year-to-date number than what you saw in the third quarter. So can you talk about what enabled you to cut costs so substantially in Q3 and why you don't expect that same pace of expense reduction to persist into Q4?","Carol Yancey","What we talk about is, look we were extremely pleased with the progress in Q3 and I'd tell you from an SG&A standpoint, again our team suggesting our cost structure to where we saw the topline to be and it\u2019s in a lot of different areas on SG&A and we\u2019ve seen improvement that\u2019s come in automotive really all year with SG&A.","It\u2019s really hard with industrial and their lack of top line for them to have. And they are going to have continued pressure on their SG&A line. When you look at the full year, I\u2019d really point you to look at our operating margins through the nine months where each of our businesses except industrial have improvements through the nine months and where we are at 10 basis points operating margins, that\u2019s really probably more of what we expect to be for the full year. ","We had sequential better sales in Q3, especially in automotive. So we leverage better on the SG&A. Q4, you just have a lower sales volumes, their seasonality. You won't get as much SG&A leverage. And then we are guiding on the corporate expense. You see a change there for the end of the year. We had some favorable onetime items in corporate expense at the end of the year and we called those out last year and there was a swing of almost \u2013 there will be a swing of almost $10 million in that retirement plan adjustment.","So some of those things are factoring into our full year guidance to get us more to the year-to-date number you\u2019re looking at.","Matthew Fassler","Okay. Secondly, and very briefly, I know you announced a couple of new acquisitions. Is it possible just to sum up I guess the annualized revenue that you acquired and just how we think about that factoring into the full-year guidance? I suspect that the numbers are going to be reasonably small contributors, but anything we need to factor in as we build up our organic versus acquisition model for Q4?","Carol Yancey","Well, we have contemplated those acquisitions in our guidance. The one that Paul mentioned, the Covs acquisition doesn't close to December 1. So there is a very small amount that would go in there. But if you look at the ones we've already exposed on, you\u2019re talking about something around 140 million on an annual basis and that excludes the Covs deal but hasn't closed yet.","Matthew Fassler","And these are acquisitions -- the $140 million are for acquisitions you announced today?","Carol Yancey","They are the ones going back to January 1.","Matthew Fassler","Okay, got it. ","Carol Yancey","We have had about 7. But those are in our 2015 guidance already.","Matthew Fassler","So the new news we would have to add to our models is kind of immaterial for the rest of the year?","Carol Yancey","That's correct.","Matthew Fassler","And then finally interesting commentary on office products and I guess wondering for your insights on the independents sort of bearing the brunt of the slowdown. When do you typically see that in a cycle? I know that there can be some volatility by channel, so I don't want to make too much of it, but you did call it out. So curious for your read from the field on what that typically means.","A \u2013 Tom Gallagher","Well, the independence this is two consecutive quarters at the independent side of the business that has been down and we see further consolidation happening in that customer segment currently. We see more of that continuing honestly as we work away through year end but our expectation would be that the independent side of the business would be positive for us in 2016, probably have another quarter or two were to be negative ahead of us yet.","Matthew Fassler","It sounds like you have visibility, Tom, to some consolidation by actual deals that have happened that are changing the landscape a bit and then those run their course.","A \u2013 Tom Gallagher","Well there are some of that, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. And we have visibility to some that we think are going to happen.","Matthew Fassler","Fair enough. Got it. Okay, thank you so much, guys.","A \u2013 Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the industrial side looking at the margin performance there, which was very good all things considered. Can you help us understand a little bit more on the gross margin side versus SG&A side where you saw more pressure and how you expect that to play out in the fourth quarter?","Carol Yancey","So on the industrial side and their growth margin is actually down and then their SG&A is not improved either. That\u2019s the one area that I mentioned that - look the size the top line, it's also the volume incentive, so their volume incentives are down similar to their sales decrease in the quarter and we would expect those to be down for the full year as well.","So they are just not getting the same level and so that\u2019s going to be, I think both pressure on gross margin and SG&A. So where their margins down 10 basis points through the nine months given where we have guided to for the full year we could see a little more pressure on that operating margin for the rest of the year.","Seth Basham","Got it. So only a little bit more than 10 basis points. Does that mean 2030 or even more severe than that?","Carol Yancey","Well, we\u2019d hope that will not be more severe than that. Look we are really hopeful that - right now we just don\u2019t know but hopefully it\u2019s something what you described.","Seth Basham","Got it, okay. Moving on, on the auto side, looking at the core business on the wholesale side in the U.S., this is the second quarter in a row that you've talked about ticket counts being negative, not dramatically so, but any more color there why that's happening, Paul?","Paul Donahue","Yes, and I think you and I talked about that last quarter. Look there is a couple of things happening here, one certainly vehicles, vehicle quality is a heck of lot of better today and I think we\u2019re seeing some of that impact on the number of cars coming into the bays. But what you do see when they do come in that the repair is at a higher price which were seeing and we\u2019re pleased to see as our average ticket value continues to - continues to go up in the right direction.","So, it's something that we\u2019re watching a bit Seth you are correct it is two consecutive quarters and we\u2019re going to continue to monitor it but we would expect that to bounce back in 2016.","Seth Basham","Got it. Is there one segment of your wholesale business that is showing more weakness? Is it the up and down the street garage customer?","Tom Gallagher","No, not really, Seth. I mean if you - the numbers that we shared with you, our auto care business continues to be strong and that's, that\u2019s all different sizes of shops. Our major account business continues to be solid, so there is no one area jumping out.","Paul Donahue","It maybe reflective but what\u2019s happening with the car counts in the bays and I think there is some inconsistency across the board in the industry with car counts I think some are experiencing increased car counts and others are flat to may be down just slightly.","Seth Basham","Understood. Okay, thank you very much and good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Management.","Tony Cristello","Thanks, good morning. Tom, can you sort of maybe categorize a little bit how this slowdown feels versus other slowdowns you've experienced? The severity doesn't seem like it's as bad in any way, but the beginning stages here I guess give pause and I think you even alluded to watching some things to maybe give you an indication how this may play out.","Tom Gallagher ","It\u2019s an interesting question Tony. On the one hand we looked at a set of data points that would indicate that things are going along, okay. On the other hand you look at a different set and they suggest to you that it\u2019s in consistent what the first set of data might indicate.","Right now it feels like we\u2019re in a grind-it-out mode in several of our businesses and there seems to be quite a bit of caution on the part of a number of our customers primarily in the non-automotive businesses in terms of CapEx and investing for future growth. And I think people are being very careful about how they\u2019re spending their money right now on investing for the future.","So, right now from at least from my perspective we still have a couple of quarters I think to work our way through this and I think it\u2019s going to be a gradual path forward not anything that\u2019s going to be a hockey stick type recovery. I think it\u2019s going to be slow for another quarter or two and then hopefully we\u2019ll start to see the evidence of that.","And if you look at the disconnect, on the industrial side the disconnect between industrial production and capacity utilization, they seem to be going in different directions right now and historically they tend to move in line with one another. So again, just they\u2019re conflicting sources of information currently.","Tony Cristello","Okay. And was there something in particular on the office side as well, which seems to be holding up better that gives you a little bit of a pause in a different manner than what you've seen in industrial?","Tom Gallagher ","On the office products side, we thought like the team together a pretty darn good quarter having anniversaried the two significant impacts. Being up 3% in the current environment I think is reflective of some good work being done by the office products team.","The thing that gives us a little bit of pause though is, we actually thought we might be just a slightly better as we went into the quarter, we thought it might be a little bit stronger than the way it turned out and we saw some deceleration as the quarter progressed as I mentioned and that\u2019s continued on into the first half of October.","So we don\u2019t have the sense right now as to what the real cause but what we do know and talking with our primary vendors is that this is not unique to S.P. Richards or Genuine Parts, they're seeing this across most of their customer base and it just seems to be a temporary slowdown that hopefully we will reverse itself as we work our way through the quarter.","Tony Cristello","Okay, that's great color. Maybe if I can ask one more, on the automotive side, you are having very good success in terms of the DIY and gaining some traction with various initiatives. Maybe if you could just add a little color to that in terms of is it simply you're a much higher percentage commercial business and so adding that emphasis on DIY is easy to gain that share? Is there something you are doing perhaps differently than what your traditional DIY-focused retailers would? Or is it a situation where even your affiliates are seeing an increased appetite for that type of product and maybe they are gaining some share from what seems to be a competitive marketplace with some disruption over the last couple of years?","Paul Donahue","Yes, Tony this is Paul, I would tell you that and we\u2019ve talked about it a bit in previous calls. We have put a renewed focus on our DIY business. We've addressed many of the fundamentals expanding our store hours, additional training for our folks, we\u2019ve added some personnel in the stores, and we\u2019ve also are testing out a new retail store format Tony that we've began to roll-out in 2015.","And it\u2019s very early yet, but we\u2019re pleased with the results and we'll be reviewing that the balance of this year and make a decision as we go into 2016.","Generally what takes place, you mentioned our affiliates are independent owners, they will many times let us pioneer some new ideas and certainly new approaches. I think they will get on board when they see the kind of success that we're driving in the retail side.","Many of our independent owners do a heck of a job today on the retail side of the business anyway. So it's early yet, Tony, but I would tell you we're pleased with the results that we are seeing.","Tony Cristello","Okay. Now that's great. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carolina Jolly with Gabelli & Company.","Carolina Jolly","Thanks, good morning. So looking at your results, you've got some challenged end-market promotions. Has this distress made any potential acquisition targets, maybe something similar to Lake Erie, more willing to discuss a potential sale?","Tom Gallagher","Well, as you know, it takes a willing seller and a willing buyer. We are a willing buyer. We just have to find more willing sellers that are willing to sell at prices that we think are favorable to the shareholders of Genuine Parts Company.","I mentioned in my comments that we have a couple more that we think we'll announce prior to year end, none of which will have any material influence on Q4. But will help us as we go into the first quarter of next year.","So there are a number of conversations that are going on. A couple are further along and we feel confident that we'll get a few closed by year end and hopefully we can generate some additional interest from some others.","Carolina Jolly","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Morning. A good question. I guess as we talk about Mexico, and it was about a year ago that you began to go to Mexico with the NAPA brand as opposed to Auto Todo. Could you give us any color on how the traction is building there as you are rebranding?","Tom Gallagher","You bet, Bret. It was - you've got a good memory, it was just about exactly one year ago that we launched our initiative in Mexico and bringing the NAPA brand down to Mexico.","We - where we are currently, we're on track, we're on target. We expect to end the year with 20 to 25 NAPA stores in the region. I would also tell you that probably since we last talked, we're in the process of recruiting a couple of strong entrepreneurial independent owners who are opening stores down in the region as well. So - so far we're on track.","Bret Jordan","Okay, and then one other regional question. You mentioned some of the energy states were a little softer than the average in performance in the quarter. How about the West ex the energy states? If you go all the way out to the coast, how was the regional performance there?","Tom Gallagher","Yes. So the west - and I did mention our team out West, but they are holding their own, Bret. They were right at the overall growth number for the commercial business and our overall business.","So West is holding up okay. We're seeing, as I mentioned solid growth up and down the East Coast, all the way down into the southern and Florida groups, most of our softness or where our softness is, it's almost directly tied to some of those oil and gas markets.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then one last question, as you were talking about M&A, is there any thought about increasing the Company-owned store base within NAPA, either just buying in independents as they retire or doing something more structural there?","I mean, obviously, as you are getting a retail operation, you get maybe a better return on the average store. Is there a thought about upping the Company-owned store count?","Tom Gallagher","I think you'll see that happen as time goes on, Bret. Our basic philosophy is we'll own the stores in and around the major metropolitan areas and we'll have good independent owners in the outlying areas.","And I don't think that will change materially going forward. But as a percentage of our total automotive volume going out a few years, you'll probably see the corporate stores represent a little bit higher percentage of the total volume than the independent stores do today.","Bret Jordan","All right. Great, thank you.","Tom Gallagher","All right, Bret.","Operator","Your next question \u2013 your final question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me in under the wire here. Couple of things, first of all, I guess, obviously, we did see at least a slight deceleration in auto despite what seemed to be pretty favorable weather for most of the quarter. So for the sake of focusing on an admittedly short-term issue, I guess the question is probably for Paul. Do you have concerns that we could start to see a little bit of incremental softening if the mild weather we've seen for most of the fall here continue deeper into the quarter?","Paul Donahue","Scot, you hit it. Our - we did see slight deceleration as the quarter progressed. We had a really strong both June and July saw a little bit of a downtick, slight downtick in August and September.","It's early yet, but we're certainly optimistic that the quarter will come in as we projected. But I think as Tom mentioned in his comments, in the overall environment that we're in, we are in a - we are definitely in a grind it out kind of mode right now as we go into the fourth quarter.","Scot Ciccarelli","So would you attribute the little bit of deceleration that we saw in auto to weather or was it something else, just so it's kind of clear for everyone?","Paul Donahue","No, I don't think it's tied to weather, Scot. Actually the weather throughout the summer and even into September we had I think a warmer than normal summer, which resulted in some good numbers for us and categories like air conditioning was strong, batteries were solid in the quarter. So no, I don't think it attributable to weather at all.","Scot Ciccarelli","Well, you've mentioned before that you guys are exposed to more industrial related to stuff in NAPA than maybe some of your competitors are. Is that where you are seeing it, some of the items that you've mentioned before on that front?","Paul Donahue","No, as I mentioned in a previous question, where we are seeing softness, it is directly in some of the more dominant oil and gas markets, Southwest for sure, some of the mountain areas, which includes some of the fracking country up in the Dakotas and Montana.","We do - do a lot of business in the fleet, Scot. We do a lot of heavy duty business. We do a lot of heavy duty filter business and we are seeing some fairly significant declines in those categories in those markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay, I knew you mentioned the geography. I was just trying to clarify on the product. That's helpful. And then previously, I think, as Carol mentioned, you guys are comfortable with the receivables.","Can you help us understand how much exposure you have to some of these troubled end markets? You've referenced mining, oil, gas, etc. and is there a point where you start to consider changes to terms to some of these customers as you try and protect against potential losses, just given the strain on some of their own balance sheets?","Carol Yancey","Actually, we very closely monitor accounts receivable and certainly what you are speaking about in the industrial area, right now, we're not taking steps, additional steps to modify anything. But I can tell you its just a constant focus on our receivables.","We feel like we're in pretty good shape. We actually already have an outlook and an estimate for what our full year bad debt expense will be and we don't have anything that we're concerned about.","I think our customers and the terms that we have, we have a pretty close insight as to what's going on. So I wouldn't see anything there.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Carol Yancey","All right.","Tom Gallagher","I've got just one last point. Keep in mind that I think across the enterprise our team has done a very good job in accounts receivable management. Carol pointed out earlier that we are down 1% in receivables year-over-year, which I think is a pretty good job.","Scot Ciccarelli","Thanks, Tom. I appreciate that.","Carol Yancey","We'd like to thank everybody for participating in this quarter's conference call. And if you have any further questions, let us know. But we appreciate your interest in and support of the company and we look forward to talking to you again after our fourth quarter earnings in February. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]","At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Sid Jones","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company first quarter 2016 conference call to discuss our earnings results and he outlook for the full year.","Before we begin, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We will begin this morning with comments from Tom Gallagher, our Chairman and CEO. Tom?","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Sid, and I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Paul Donahue, our President and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer are both on the call as well. And each of has a few prepared comments and once completed, we'll look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have.","Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2016 results, and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.718 billion, which was down one half of 1%. Net income was $158 million, which was down 1.9% and earnings per share were $1.05 this year, which was even with the $1.05 reported in the first quarter of last year.","Once again this quarter, currency exchange was a headwind to all of our results. The impact of the strength of the US dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currencies was 1.6% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in earnings per share. Stated another way in constant currency sales were up 1.1% and EPS was up 1%. While a bit better than the reported results, we still find ourselves revenue challenged primarily in our non-Automotive businesses and this is clearly pointed out if we look at the results by segment without currency impact.","In constant currency our Automotive business was up 4.4%, industrial was down 1.7%, Office Products was down 2.5% and Electrical was down 3.4%. So the difference between our Automotive operations and our remaining three segments is quite pronounced and Paul will cover the Automotive segment in a few minutes. At first I\u2019ll make a few comments on the non-Automotive businesses starting with industrial.","Motion industries ended the quarter down 2.5% on a reported basis and down 1.7% in constant currency. And although we continued to run decreases in this segment, we are just a bit encouraged by these results for two reasons. First, the first quarter of 2015 was our strongest quarter of the year at plus 3% and secondly, our Q1 2016 decrease was a smallest decrease that we\u2019ve seen in several quarters. Additionally our mid mine [ph] paper results are modestly positive and hopefully this is something that we can maintain as we move forward in the month and in the quarters ahead.","However, it is important to point out that if you look at our performance by industry segment, by tough customers and by tough product categories, it shows just how uneven and choppy our business continues to be. If we look at our top 12 industry segments, first we have six that are up and six that are down. On the positive side in no order our lumber and wood products, boot products, cement, chemicals and automotive. On the down side we have, oil and gas, equipment and machinery, iron and steel and equipment rental and leasing.","Our top 20 customers are actually up low single digit, with 15 of these customers running positive results thus far, but five are down. In our top 12 product categories, six are up and six are down. So as you can see, it\u2019s a real mixture with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in other areas. And all of this in our opinion is reflected of the tepid state of the economy both domestically and globally. But this is the environment that we\u2019ll face for a bit longer and we\u2019ll try to offset this with a combination of specific market share initiatives and acquisitions.","Moving on to EIS, our Electrical distribution segment, this group ended the quarter down 3% and some of the same factors that impacted our industrial business were headwinds for the Electrical segment as well. Things like the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower corporate pricing again in the quarter which caused just over 1% in sales growth. The impact of the stronger dollar on our export oriented customers and the overall sluggish economic climate. And these factors we think will persist for a bit longer, but it\u2019s interesting to look at the individual performances of the three segments that comprise EIS.","You may recall that the Electrical segment is our largest representing about 40% of the total company revenue, fabrication and wire and cable each represent about 30% and in general fabrication and wire and cable both had positive results in the quarter, but Electrical was down mid-teens. So our challenges are primarily concentrated in the Electrical portion of the business and our folks are working hard to turn this segment around, while at the same time working to maintain the positive results in the fabrication and wire and cable segments.","And finally a few comments on Office Products. As reported earlier this segment was down 3% in the quarter with mid single digit growth in the mega channel being offset by high single digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facility breakroom supply category turned in the strongest results ending the quarter with a high single digit increase and we continue to be pleased with our growth in this segment. The furniture category was even followed by a slight decline in Office Products and a low double digit decrease in technology products.","Putting it all together, we\u2019re making good progress in areas like facility and breakroom, overall end market conditions remain challenging for our Office Products team and they\u2019re working hard on share of wallet and market share initiatives across their product categories and their customer base. Additionally, they\u2019re continuing to work on diversifying their business through new product additions and the opening of new sales channels. And we hope to report in the next call that we were able to close on a strategic acquisition later this quarter that will further bolster their diversification efforts.","So that\u2019s a quick overview of our non-Automotive businesses and at this moment we\u2019ll ask Paul to cover the Automotive operations. Paul?","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Tom. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our Automotive business.","For the quarter ending March 31, our global Automotive sales were up 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 4.5% in total Automotive growth which includes an approximately 1% benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 2.5% in the first quarter.","Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the first quarter, an improved performance from the 2% growth we reported in the fourth quarter and the 3% growth we experienced for the full year of 2015.","Turning to our international business, which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, this group once again reported another quarter of mid single digit growth in their local currency. Despite challenging local economies, especially in Australia and Canada, we remain encouraged by the consistent mid single digit growth we are experiencing across all of these international markets.","In the U.S., our results varied widely by geographical region and product category. Geographically our business in the Florida, Atlantic and Western regions of the country all out performed in the quarter. On the other hand the Central, the Eastern, Midwestern regions of the country all under performed. We would attribute the warmer than average temperatures experienced across the Northern states in February and March is having a negative impact on our business in that region of the country.","And as we look at our winter related goods, we saw a similar trend in sales. After experiencing double digit growth in January, our battery business was flat in both February and March. Again we believe warmer than normal weather patterns impacted this segment of our business.","So now let's turn to our same-store sales for the first. Our U.S. company-owned store grew same-store sales in the first quarter by 3.6% The cadence of the quarter saw our team post solid results in January with sales moderating somewhat in February and March. is compares to the 3% comp store increase we reported through nine months. Again we would attribute a good bit of this slowdown to the weather as well as the impact from Easter week moving from April in \u201815 to March in 2016.","This quarter's 3.6% same-store sales increase compared to a plus 2% in the fourth quarter and was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business as well as by our retail business.","So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand or revamp DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. As a reminder these initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extending our store hours, increased training for our store associates, and the nationwide launch of our NAPA Rewards Program to name just a few. We are still early in the process, but we can report the results we\u2019ve seen thus far outpacing our expectations.","As previously announced, we\u2019re expanding our initial 20-store pilot which we tested in 2015 to include an additional 150 company-owned stores in 2016. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results. And for the first quarter, we can report a total increase of 3% in our retail business. And we couple this 3% increase with the 6% increase we posted in the first quarter of 2015, it gets us to two-year stack of plus 9%. Our retail initiatives are driving increased transaction accounts and in quarter one, we again saw a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. We can also report a low single digit increase in our average basket size for the quarter.","Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business, this segment of our Automotive business posted a 4% increase in the first quarter, an improvement over the 2% increase we generated in the fourth quarter of 2015. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continued to center around our Major Account business as well as our NAPA AutoCare centers. We had a strong quarter with our 16,000 plus AutoCare customers as this business trended up mid to high single digit.","On the Major Account front, our team drove sales increases in line with our overall Automotive growth for the quarter. We were also encouraged by the slight improvement in our fleet business, which was up 2% for the quarter and an improvement over the 1% increase we posted in Q4 of 2015. And voluntarily we are working really hard to gain some positive momentum with this important customer group.","Our average wholesale ticket value was up low single digit with no benefits from inflation. We were flat in the average number of tickets, although our first quarter performance was improved over a downward trend we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters. So, earlier in my comments, I mentioned our battery business, so now let\u2019s take a look at a few of other product categories and review the trends we experienced in the first quarter.","Our brakes business was a highlight again in the first quarter. This category grew low double digits in the quarter and we can also report solid growth in both our tool and equipment business, as well as our filtration business. We are especially pleased to see the growth in our big filter [ph] business. This key product category came under pressure last year as our industrial, energy and our fleet business softened. We hope to continue this trend as the year progresses.","We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA Import Parts business. Our underlying Import Parts business was up high single digits in the quarter before the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business we acquired just past February. We can report good progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we will continue to search for additional acquisitions in this growing segment of the aftermarket.","We would also like to update you on the closing of our Covs Parts acquisition on March 1st. As you may recall, we announced in February that we received approval to acquire 21 of their 25 branches. This allows our Asia-Pac business to further expand its market presence and scale in Western Australia. This is an important strategic acquisition for the Asia-Pac team and we expect Covs to generate additional annual revenues of approximately 70 million in US dollars.","On the acquisition front, we are encouraged by the ever increasing level of activity in all geographical regions and in all segments of our Automotive business. We are pleased to report today, we will be closing on May 1st on Atlanta, Georgia based heavy duty truck parts business. We would like to welcome the team from Global Parts Incorporated.","Global operates six branches in three states and generates sales of approximately 20 million plus on an annualized basis. This business will serve as a nice complement to our growing business in this segment of the Automotive aftermarket. And as we look ahead, strategic acquisitions will continue to be a growth lever for Automotive businesses both in the U.S. and abroad.","Now, turning to the trends we\u2019re seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continued to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gain, Miles driven increased 2% January following a strong 3.5% increase in 2015.","January marks 23 consecutive months of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gas was $2 in the first quarter, which is down from 240 per gallon in 2015, the second cheapest annual average in the past 10 years. And although gas prices appear to be moving upward in the recent weeks in most parts of the U.S., the current cost of gasoline remains well below last year and these low gas prices should bode well for future increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchase.","In closing, we were pleased to show positive sales growth in the first quarter and look forward to building on our growth plans over the balance of the year. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing on our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions.","We want to thank our teams both in North America, as well as Australasia for their efforts and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. So, that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. And at this time, I will hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we will get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we will review a few key balance sheet and other financial items.","Our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the first quarter were down a 0.5% or up 1% excluding the impact of FX. Our gross profit for the first quarter was 29.7%, compared to 29.8% last year.","The slight change in gross profit margin primarily reflects the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. Excluding this factor, we\u2019re pleased with the positive impact of our gross margin initiatives across all of our businesses.","On SG&A, the impact of SG&A in the quarter was flat and we had some impact from our cost saving initiatives and just the loss of leverage. So, our efforts to enhance gross margin are especially important in our low inflationary environment.","I want to mention what our cumulative supplier price changes are for 2015. We\u2019re down six-tenths of 1% in Automotive. We\u2019re up two-tenths of 1% in Industrial. We\u2019re up one-tenth of 1% in Office and we\u2019re down 1.25% in Electrical. The talking about SG&A, again, I\u2019m sorry about that, our SG&A was $850 million or 23.07% of sales, which is in line with first quarter of last year.","So, our cost control measures continued to positively impact our results and they are driving our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. For the first quarter, however, the benefits of our overall cost savings were somewhat offset by the deleveraging of our expenses in our non-Automotive businesses. As we look ahead, our teams remain committed to controlling our expenses and enhancing our productivity and streamlining our operations. We expect to show continued progress on these initiatives as we may have had.","Now, let\u2019s discuss our results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the first quarter was $1.9 billion or up 2% from the prior year and 52% of our total sales. Our operating profit of 154 million is up 2% and their margin improved 10 basis points to 8.0. Our Industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 2.5% decrease from the prior year and 31% of our total revenues.","Our operating profit of $82 million is down 6.8% and our operating margin was down 30 basis points to 7.1%, primarily driven by lower supplier incentives, as well as expense deleverage. Our Office Product revenues were 477 million in the first quarter, down 2.8% and representing 13% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of 34 million is down 6.4% and our operating margin of 7.2% is down 20 basis points.","The Electrical and Electronic Group had sales in the quarter of 176 million, down 3.4% and that\u2019s 4% of our total revenues. Their operating profit of 15 million is down 4% and the margin for this group was down 10 basis points to 8.4.","For the first quarter, our total operating profit margin was 7.7% compared to 7.8% in the first quarter of last year. This follows a 10 basis point margin improvement in the fourth quarter and for the full-year of 2015 and basically reflects the lack of leverage associated with the sales environment in our non-Automotive businesses. We are intensely focused on continued progress in this area with further margin expansion being a key goal for the company.","We had net interest expense of 4.8 million in the quarter and for the full-year, we continue to look for net interest expense to be $21 million to $22 million. Our amortization expense was 8.8 million for the first quarter and we continue to expect total amortization expense to be $36 million to $38 million for the full-year.","Our depreciation expense of 26 million for the quarter, we are now projecting for depreciation to remain at 120 million to 130 million for the full year. So, combined depreciation and amortization of 34.7 million for the first quarter and we would expect this to be in the range of 155 million to 170 million for the full year.","The other line which primarily reflects our corporate expense was 24.4 million for the quarter compared to 25.1 million last year. For the full-year we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range.","Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36% which is in line with the first quarter of last year. We expect this rate to increase over the balance of the year and continue to project at 37% tax rate for the full-year. Our net income for the quarter of 158 million compared to 161 million for the last year and our EPS was $1.05 which is flat with last year.","Now let\u2019s turn to the discussion of the balance sheet which we continue to further strengthen with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at March 31 was 205 million which is in line with our cash position at year-end and up a bit from 166 million at March 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses.","Accounts receivable of 2 billion at March 31 is flat with the prior year and relatively in line with our sales. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with their quality at this time. The inventory at the end of the quarter was 3.1 billion, a 2% overall increase although this is flat excluding the impact of acquisitions in the last 12 months.","Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate level as we move forward. Accounts Payable at March 31 was 3 billion up approximately 14% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We are encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and days in payable.","Our working capital of 1.6 billion at March 31 is improved from the prior year and down 67 million on a comparable basis which excludes the reclassification of the 250 million in term debt from long-term to current. Effectively managing our working capital and in particular key items such as account receivable, inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company.","Our total debt of 700 million at March 31 is 194 million less than the 894 in March of last year. Our debt includes two 250 million term notes as well as another 200 million in borrowings under our multicurrency credit facility. We would also add that one of the term notes is due this November 30 and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date.","Our total debt-to-capitalization is approximately 18% and we are comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides the company both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue.","In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We continue to generate strong cash flows and following a record year in 2015, we appear well-positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the 900 million to 1 billion range for the full-year and free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the $400 million to $450 million range.","We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash includes strategic acquisition, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividends which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 60 consecutive years.","Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and they\u2019re integral to our growth plans. Thus far in 2016, we have added the Olympus automotive import parts business as well as three additional acquisitions which closed on March 1. As previously covered by Tom and Paul, our Asia-Pac business also acquired Covs Parts with expected annual revenues of US$70 million and Motion added Epperson and Company and Missouri Power Transmission with combined annual revenue of $50 million.","For the balance of 2016, we\u2019ll continue to seek acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although, many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on types companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are open minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small assuming the appropriate returns on the investment.","Turning to share repurchases, we have purchased 576,000 shares thus far in 2016 and we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best returns to our shareholders.","Our investment in capital expenditure was 12 million in the first quarter which is down slightly from last year. For the year however, we continue to plan for capital expenditures to be in the range of 140 million to 160 million, so you will see CapEx picking up over the balance of the year due primarily to the timing of several large projects.","Turning to our dividend, our 2016 dividend of $2.63 per share approved by the board in February was a 7% increase from the prior year and is approximately 57% of our 2015 earnings. Was slightly above our stated goal of 50% to 55% payout ratio, we are very comfortable going beyond the stage from time to time due to our strong cash flows.","Now that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2016. And in summary we operated relatively in line with our expectations, let\u2019s assume fairly steady underlying growth for the Automotive business but in another quarter of challenging economic conditions across our nonautomotive businesses. We manage to offset some of the challenges with key sales initiatives and cost controls and also further improve the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports ongoing investments and opportunities such as acquisitions as well as return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the period ahead.","At this point I will turn it back over to Tom.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you Carol and thanks to you and Paul for your comprehensive updates. So that\u2019s an overview of the financial and operating performance for the first quarter. And in looking back, our feeling is that our teams did a reasonably good job of operating with the Automotive group turning in the best performance. A lack of revenue growth in the non-automotive businesses did not enable us to gain any operating average unfortunately.","Turning to the balance sheet we feel that folks did a pretty good job overall and we look for another strong year in cash generation and asset management. The one area that we continue to be challenged in is sales growth and across all of our businesses, organic growth initiatives and strategic bolt on type acquisitions are getting a lot of attention. And on the acquisition front based upon what we see right now, we think that we\u2019ll have a bit more to talk about in the second and third quarters.","Now as far as the reminder of the year is concerned, we feel that previously provided guidance remains appropriate at this time. You may recall that we guided for Automotive revenues to be up 2% to 3% for the full-year against the current 1.8% increase. We said Industrial would be up 1% to 2% compared to 2.5% decrease for the first quarter.","Office Products down 1 to up 2 compared to 2.8% decrease in the quarter and Electrical will be up 1 to 2 compared to the 3.4% decrease in Q1. So for the total company we feel that 1% to 2% increase is appropriate compared to the half of 1% decrease through the first quarter. And then on the earnings side, we feel that an expectation of $4.70 to $4.80 per share remains appropriate and this should be up 2% to 4% over the prior year.","At this point we would like to address your questions and we will turn the call back to Catherine.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning, Seth.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Seth Basham","My first question is just on the guidance Tom, could you tell us what your expectations are for FX impact this year and any additional revenue you\u2019re assuming in your guidance from acquisitions?","Tom Gallagher","Well, the FX is pretty difficult quite honestly, Seth as you know, we think back to January of this year currency exchange was an even heavier factor, we were down mid to upper double digits in the exchange rates between the Canadian, Mexican and Australian rates. We did see some moderation, some strengthening of the dollar in February and March, but at this point for the quarter it was still double-digit impact and we really don\u2019t have a clear look at what we think is going to happen as we go forward. I think perhaps this thing to say would be that, for the whole company we\u2019ve guided to being up 1 to 2 and perhaps for the whole company FX is going to be a headwind of 1.5% to 2% at this point. As far as the acquisitions, the only ones that we have included in our guidance are the ones that have been completed. So, Paul covered a couple of them. Carol covered a few more. They are the only ones we have included and our practice is not to include anything until we actually close on it. And at that point, we\u2019ll incorporate it into our future guidance if that answers your question.","Seth Basham","That\u2019s helpful. Just to confirm relative to your guidance you provided initially for 2016 in February, you assumed at that point in time 3% or 4% sales growth for entire company ex FX and now you are now looking for 1% to 2%?","Tom Gallagher","Well, no, we\u2019re looking at 1% to 2% including FX and then 1.5% to 2% headwind from FX, so on a constant currency basis, you would have to add that 1.5% to 2% back in.","Seth Basham","Got it. Okay. Helpful. All right, and then my other questions on the auto business, looking at U.S. comps, it seems like they slowed down to your stack basis. Also it seems like your Major Accounts business growth slowed a little bit. I understand I think weather is a drag. Any other factors you can point to that might be impacting your business relative to the industry?","Paul Donahue","Seth, this is Paul. No, it just - I touched on many of the factors. Seth, we hate to play the weather card, because at the end of the day we still need to execute on our initiatives. Look, I think our team is doing a pretty good job. But when you look at the delta between our big divisions up in the northern states versus some of our business in the southern states, it certainly had an impact. Our NAPA AutoCare business continues to be solid, very solid. Our Major Account business is good. It\u2019s not growing at the double digit rate perhaps that we saw a couple of years ago, but it\u2019s still growing at a good pace overall. So now, I think, Seth, there is just a bit of sluggishness out there right now, but we\u2019ve got some great initiatives. We just need to continue to execute and I have no doubt that business will bounce back quickly.","Seth Basham","Got it.","Tom Gallagher","Seth, I\u2019d add to that. If you look at across the spectrum of our larger accounts, the major accounts and the AutoCare customers, those in the northern tier, as Paul pointed out, are having a more difficult time than those in the southern tier. But also those that are more heavily oriented toward tires, are a bit more challenged than those that are more heavily oriented towards the service side. So we will see all that reverse at some point, but we just don\u2019t know when.","Seth Basham","Got it. Since you brought up weather as an important point here, if you think about warmer winter weather and the impact on parts stress, would you expect heading into the summer season there to be fewer part failures and more limited parts sales as a result of that?","Tom Gallagher","It depends upon how warm and how hot it gets in the summer. That\u2019s going to put the second round of stress and that\u2019s a key determinant. So if we have a hot summer, I think we will see some of the summer related products, heating and cooling as an example, I think we\u2019ll see some pick up there, if we have a modest summer, we won\u2019t get that increased demand.","Seth Basham","Got it. Thanks a lot and good luck.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Seth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thank you for taking my call. My first question is, can you talk about your plan for enhanced store openings and you\u2019re trying to pick it up for the company-owned store group. This is primarily in the U.S. So, is it going to be focused abroad and then ultimately how many stores do you think you could have in the US?","Paul Donahue","Yeah, Chris, this is Paul. So, our store expansion program includes all of our markets, so Australia, New Zealand, where we will continue to grow via acquisition as well as organic growth and we believe we have opportunities to continue to grow in both Australia and New Zealand markets. In Canada same thing as well as Mexico, in Mexico, as you may recall, we\u2019ve rolled out our NAPA Mexico initiative, which we have 20 plus stores in Mexico today branded under the NAPA brand both company-owned and independently-owned. We believe and we\u2019re not going to put a targeted number out there, Chris, but we believe we\u2019ve got significant opportunities to continue to grow our store footprint in Mexico.","And then in the US, again, same type of initiatives both acquisition, bolt-on type acquisitions as we announced already do this year, but in addition, organic new distribution as well across the U.S. and we think again there is many open markets across the U.S., so we can continue to expand the NAPA brand.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you, then I have one quick follow-up. As I understand it historically more [Indiscernible] facilitator of independents when I look to exit the business, you sell from one independent to the other. Is there any change in philosophy if the company acquires some of these independents or how do you see that playing out?","Tom Gallagher","Chris, this is Tom. Our attitude is exactly what it has been and that is if it\u2019s an independently-owned store in an outline market, if there is another independent owner that\u2019s ready to step in and make that acquisition, we\u2019ll help them do that. If there isn\u2019t someone ready to step in, but the current owner has a desire to get out and we\u2019ll buy the store and we\u2019ll run it for a period of time until we find a good independent owner. If it\u2019s in a metro market, we\u2019ll buy the store and we\u2019ll operate it for the long term as a company-owned store. So the attitude is essentially the same.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay. Really helpful. Thank you for the comments.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Chandni Luthra","Hi. This is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Tom, I have a quick question on your Industrials business. So, I just want to understand about the performance in the Industrial segment. It appears that you guys outperformed versus how we saw your peers report in the last week or so. Could you perhaps throw some light in terms of what drove that performance and what was the cadence, because a lot of your peers talked about a very sharp decline in the second half of March. I just want to understand if you guys also saw a dip in March and you know how the quarter trended? Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","Well, I\u2019ll take the latter part of the question first. We did see March being the weaker of the three months in the quarter, but still better than what we had been running. In terms of what\u2019s happening within our Industrial business, I think our teams have been working hard on some of their share of wallet and market share initiatives, as well as on the acquisitions we did and had the benefit of the two acquisitions that closed late in the quarter that Carol mentioned.","But additionally our folks are finding additional opportunities with existing customers and they are also opening up some new customers. So as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we can look at about half of the business and see that it\u2019s performing pretty well and then we look at roughly the other half and we see that we\u2019re still challenged. So hopefully we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of a turn and maybe the quarters ahead will be a little bit more reflective of what we\u2019ve seen in Q1 and then also early in the month of April.","Chandni Luthra","Got it. Thanks for the color. And quickly on the Office segment, so you guys had your business decline by about 3%. I just want to understand how should we think about go forward given that you\u2019ve maintained your guidance and in terms of what gives you confidence to kind of catch up with that guide given that cycling of the ODP, OMX [ph] businesses having some impact to you?","Tom Gallagher","Well, in terms of maintaining the guidance, we did say that. We guided to down one to up one for the full year, having finished the first quarter down 3%, we would say may be closer to the mid to lower end of the range for the full year. I did comment in my prepared remarks that we think we have an opportunity to close on a pretty good size acquisition for the Office Products group yet in Q2. It will be late in Q2. That\u2019s not in our guidance at this point. But assuming that we are able to complete that, we\u2019ll give you an update on that as we make our comments at the end of the second quarter.","Chandni Luthra","Great. Thank you so much.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will continue on to Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets.","Tony Cristello","Thank you. Good morning","Tom Gallagher","Good morning.","Tony Cristello","My first question, I wanted to just touch on the import parts side of the business and better understand where you are in terms of parts coverage there. It\u2019s obviously growing at - I think you said, Paul, high single digit rate and I wanted to understand is that growth just because you are offering more and more parts. Are you seeing more and more demand from existing or you growing both with the new customer as well.","Paul Donahue","Yeah so Tony, great question on our import parts business. So we - look, we have been in the import parts business for some time and we go to market under the Altrom brand we sell here in the U.S. direct through our NAPA network. And where we see continued growth is both existing customer expansion, but also capturing new customers. So our NAPA Auto Care centers are major accounts are servicing more and more import part vehicles therefore they need access to those parts and fortunately they are coming through us. When we look at the continued expansion of that segment we are excited of our core business, the Altrom business going through our NAPA network, but also with our recent acquisition of Olympus and what that group brings us and I think I talked about a bit in our last call is, we got a great team at Olympus they bring us years and years of import experience that is the value to us and this is the category that we think we can certainly continue to grow at the a greater rate than our overall business.","Tony Cristello","And do you see the same lift of benefits as your companies stores as you all do or see at your independence when you put in new initiatives or focus on being able to sell through on imports or something, I\u2019m just trying to piece together sort of the success across your whole business versus company-owned versus independent.","Paul Donahue","Yeah so Tony, we\u2019ve made a commitment in our company owned stores that we are going to be stocking in import parts and it is a classic parts business in general. If you have the part, you have good people and you\u2019re priced competitively, generally you are going to get the business and what we are finding as we upgrade our inventories across our NAPA company-owned store network business is growing as we upgrade those inventories. On the independent side Tony, it\u2019s been an initiative that we worked on for a number of years as our independent owners. Some have gotten into the business, do a terrific job, others have been a little slower to adapt to stocking in import parts. They may - certainly some of our independent owners are out in more rural markets were they may not be quite at much demand for import parts, but our initiative in growing that businesses both via our company-owned stores and via our independent owners as well.","Tom Gallagher","Tony I might just add on, you may recall that our general approach to any new initiative is that we will test it, pilot it in the company store group will approve the concept and then at that point we will go to be independent owners. We want to make sure that what we are recommending to them work so after we approving the concept we will tell them what we did, how we did it, what it cost, what is the returns are and then our good progressive owners will step up and they will embrace the initiative and we go on from there.","Tony Cristello","That\u2019s great color. I appreciate that and if I can ask just one more question, I think you mentioned CapEx acceleration and several projects that may be hitting in the second half of the year. Can you provide any were information, is that an IT type spend or there any strong store refreshers or something that we should consider?","Carol Yancey","Yeah, it\u2019s both facility refreshes and also an IT project. So mentioning on facilities we have got in each of our segments and both here in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and Australia folks have DC refreshers. So a lot of it is in the area of productivity improvement and so it could be not necessarily a full relocation, but a refresh within the facility. So those are multi-months projects that we know we have started and there\u2019ll be slated for third quarter and fourth quarter and then IT as well we got again, most of our IT projects are going to be in productivity areas were health management, inventory optimization and we have several sights planned for the second half of the year. So those are all in the work, so we expect that to pick up over the balance of the year.","Tony Cristello","Okay, thank you very much for your time.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And Mark Becks with JP Morgan have our next question.","Mark Becks","Hi thanks for sharing the monthly detail in Auto. Understanding that there is a slowdown as far as the end of the quarter I just wanted to clarify what was the impact from the Easter shift and the labor - leap day shift and then does that help or hurt back half of the quarter.","Paul Donahue","Well, Mark this is Paul, we think certainly it was not a help, we estimate and it is hard to put an exact number to it, but we estimates Easter holiday moving from April end of month of March cost us minimum half a point on our top line.","Mark Becks","And then any impact from the leap day?","Paul Donahue","For sure, the extra day, again estimating between a point of quarter to point half.","Tom Gallagher","Ranging between 0.5% and 1% for the quarter at net.","Mark Becks","Understood and then Paul you elevated to widening performance gap in the northern stores versus southern stores. Historically some of your peers is focusing gaps anywhere in the range of 500 to call it a 1000 basis points, is there any way you can kind of frame up the difference between say the north-east market which is more the kind of weather sensitive market versus like the South or the West.","Paul Donahue","Yeah, I will put it this way Mark, when we look at across northern states and not just the north east because we really felt the impact in the Midwest, when we talk about the Central, Mark, that\u2019s Ohio, Pennsylvania but all the way into the north-east as well. That group and those are some of our larger operations that group grew low single digit, when we compare those to some of our southern division, so I mentioned Florida, I would throw the Southern group in there as well, the Atlantic which should be the Carolina South and then even West that group grew mid to high single digits across, so it was more of a significant delta that helps seen in some time.","Mark Becks","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and then last question for me Tom and Carol you mentioned you\u2019re open to more larger transformational type of acquisitions and historically [indiscernible] you\u2019ve opted for more than smaller bolt-on type acquisition. So just trying to get an idea of historically why that has been the route you have gone by that it is just there is more opportunities of that nature in the marketplace or culture or anything else there.","Tom Gallagher","Mark, I will take a stab at that. You have hit on one key point and that is generally speaking there are many more opportunities in that $25 million to $250 million range. Secondly, our philosophy has been that any acquisition we do needs to be accretive and hit the minimum threshold within three years and it seems that we can get to some of the back office synergies more quickly and more easily in the 25 to 150 range than something well above that. And then the third thing is that, we got a general approach that we want to make multiple acquisitions across each of our businesses and spread the investments spread, the risk so to speak, but also to leverage the strong management teams that we have across our businesses. Now with all of that said if we were to find - I think you used the word transformational, if we would find something larger, we would be more than happy to look at it, but it has to meet the same general level of expectation within three years and we look for 15% ROIC no later than the third year, but if we found something large that met that threshold then we would absolutely have interest in doing it. The good point is that we have the balance sheet that will enable us to do whatever and it was set that kind of logic that led us to GPC Asia Pacific, the largest acquisition we have done and one that has turned out to be pretty darn good thanks for the shareholders at Genuine Parts.","Mark Becks","Okay. So if you have more to talk about in 2Q and 3Q just it seems like it safe to assume that these will be more of those kind of bolt-on that you are talking about.","Tom Gallagher","We just have to wait and see.","Mark Becks","Okay, thanks.","Tom Gallagher","All right thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go on to Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Hey guys just a quick question for Paul, looking at the auto business in Texas and other oil related markets you guys mentioned that the broader region underperformed, but do you have data on those markets specifically in terms of their performance year over year in the quarter.","Paul Donahue","Yeah, so Elizabeth if I look at our businesses down in the Southwest part of the country and that group was under some stress all last year and if I look at Q1 that group was up low single digits, so certainly on the lower end of our performance amongst our many divisions.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Okay, great thank you.","Paul Donahue","Welcome.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys.","Carol Yancey","Hi Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli","I apologize in advance for kind of stick on this weather things here, but couple of questions. What other categories outside of batteries would you attribute kind of whether gyration is the first question? And then second relate to that I guess winter of 2011 - 2012 is probably the closest comparable that we have to this year\u2019s warm winter weather. So I\u2019m not sure if you have that data in handy or not, but can you remind us of your sales cadence in these types of categories in 2012, how they kind of trended from February to March and into the spring - later spring and summer months.","Paul Donahue","So, Scot I will take the first part first and then I\u2019ll let Carol handle the historical data, if she has it. But yes outside of batteries and certainly the entire electrical category Scott, when we look at starters, alternators and including batteries that entire category, which is the big category for us only, grew low single digits in the quarter. Heating and cooling, certainly heating is another area that was impacted, we saw slower than kind of our fleet average growth. And then all of our chemicals in commodities type products were another area that we saw slower than our typical growth or in our overall growth for the first quarter, so all of those categories really can be impacted one way or the other by the weather.","Tom Gallagher","It goes even further Scot, if you think about up in your neck of the woods when you got that extreme cold weather, it tends to cause additional puddles up North and through the Central and Midwest parts of the country as well, which in fact potentially can impact some of your chassis product in the ensuing quarter or two so. It is pretty pervasive in terms of what it can do and I should say that we are pretty pleased with our chassis business right now, our chaste team is doing a really good job for us and we are getting some pretty good growth currently from that organization.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you.","Carol Yancey","And Scot as far as the weather patterns back in 2011 and 2012 I mean I will have you afterwards, but we are not going to comment or do we have that product line specific cadence in those winter months on how that reacted, but we\u2019re happy to discuss that further.","Scot Ciccarelli","I guess the question is just in general, so obviously you\u2019re not going to break all that out by category, but you kind of went from February to March, you already talked about some sluggishness in some of these categories and Paul just referenced them, did they continue to worsen as you go to the latest spring in summer months or did it kind of will get to a level and just kind of stay there and I just trying to figure out.","Tom Gallagher","I would take a stab at that first, Scot. This is Tom and I would say that we\u2019ve somewhat stabilized in those categories at this point, but we wish we were stabilized at a slightly higher rate.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay thanks a lot guys.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you.","Paul Donahue","Thanks Scot.","Operator","Thank you. And Bret Jordan with Jefferies has our next question.","Bret Jordan","Hi, good morning guys","Paul Donahue","Good morning Bret.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Bret Jordan","On global project accusation could a give us a little color on what you\u2019re seeing in heavy-duty and maybe how that\u2019s comping relative to passenger vehicle parts and maybe sort of give us a feeling for after this deal how big that is going to be relative to your parts distribution .","Paul Donahue","Yeah, so Bret, that\u2019s a business, we don\u2019t talk about a lot, but across North America so US and Canada and in Canada we have got very mature robust business on the heavy duty side it is in our standalone side in excess of $600 million in annual business. It\u2019s a good business, it\u2019s a growing business and there is roughly 8 million heavy duty trucks on the road here in the US and it\u2019s the category that we think we can continue to grow. The acquisition of Global which is Atlanta again much like Olympus acquisition that we did on the import side, brings us a great team, a knowledgeable team experienced team in the category, we believe we\u2019ve got well [indiscernible] synergies and again just bring in another experienced group into our business and we will complement our heavy-duty business here in the Southeast quite nicely.","Tom Gallagher","Bret just to add on to that, by our estimation we would have 5% to 6% of the total available market for the heavy-duty industry and if we can grow that to 10%, we\u2019re talking upwards of $0.5 billion to $600 million more in revenue, so that\u2019s part of the strategy.","Bret Jordan","How was this business is been comping is that comping ahead of your company average in auto.","Tom Gallagher","No, it is actually been - the fleet business it is actually been little bit less than our total Automotive business, but the good news is it\u2019s come back a bit. I think Paul mentioned that we were up 2% in Q1 in our fleet business. So we\u2019re pleased with the fact that it has started to revert back to what is a more normal business.","Bret Jordan","Okay and then one last question on comp, when you look at the NAPA core comp, how do you feel that rate was relative to the industry in Q1. Do you think you\u2019re a share gainer or just performing in line?","Paul Donahue","Hard to say Bret, being the first guys out, I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re going to be where the market is. We certainly don\u2019t believe we are losing any market share across the country and our teams are executing on the initiatives we put out there for them so. We think we will be in line, hard to say though; we will have to wait and see.","Bret Jordan","Okay and then one last question in Mexico are you going to convert the auto total stores to NAPA brand or do they standalone?","Paul Donahue","Yeah, great question Bret, that\u2019s something that we are looking at. I was actually down there with the team last week, we have not made a final decision one way or the other, as you may know we have eight auto total stores down in the marketplace and we\u2019re evaluating that right now, but that absolutely could happen in the future and I would also comment Bret because I know you follow it quite closely, our overall business and sales in Mexico continue to grow each quarter, we are building out our team, we are building out our brand, we just added that talented executive to that group down there and we are still bullish with our opportunities down in that market.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great thank you.","Paul Donahue","Welcome.","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Bret.","Operator","Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. I just want to follow-up on the Easter shift question, make sure I got the math right there and the second one on the margins. If we assume it was 50 or 75 perhaps, should we be thinking that our run rate would simply move that amount of sales in the second quarter from first and Tom when you describe stabilizing trend which number are we stabilizing I guess, is it adjusting for the shift or not or for leap day. And I have a follow-up on margin.","Tom Gallagher","My understanding of the question on the trends was more product oriented and that\u2019s where I think we have stabilized in particular product categories. In terms of the impact of Easter we should see the benefit of that in April, we should pick up a little bit more in April that we gave back in March.","Greg Melich","So [indiscernible] it would be fair to assume that it should be a little better in April so far than we saw in the first quarter.","Tom Gallagher","Well, we will see how it all shapes out and will give you an update on it in our second quarter conference call.","Greg Melich","Okay, so I\u2019ll switch to margins then. I think it was Carol, in your comments you talked about how the industrial was the main pressure on the overall gross margin rate, a lot of the other improvement across the business was still there, but Industrial hurt. So I guess my question is what level of sales do we need to get out of industrial so that we actually start to deleverage it on the gross margin side, thanks.","Carol Yancey","Yes, so you are correct when we look at gross margin the other three segments are find the pressure on gross margin was through Industrial and so lot of our initiatives are in place and I just mentioned Industrial has done a really good job, therefore gross profit was up in Q4 and was also up in Q1. So they\u2019ve done a lot of things on the buy side and sell side to help get that up. So when the volume does come back and it probably needs to be more in the very low single digit range for us to get some of that OEM and center of that, that\u2019s going to really go straight to the margin, but the good thing is their SG&A improvements and their core gross profits, those things are already in place. And when we do get just a little bit of volume back and the top-line growth then we\u2019ll see that on their operating margin.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s great. Thanks, good luck.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Tom Gallagher","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli.","Brian Sponheimer","Last and least I get it.","Carol Yancey","Hi, Brian.","Brian Sponheimer","Hi, Carol. My compliments on the continued working capital improvements and I guess, if you just take APM inventory [ph], it\u2019s $280 year-over-year. Is that coming exclusively from NAPA or is that something that\u2019s really a kind of a holistic entire business approach to working capital.","Carol Yancey","So all of our businesses have initiatives in the working capital and specifically focused in the payables area, so we\u2019ve - what I would say just the - more the majority of the dollars are coming from Automotive, we do have improvement coming from the others and I can tell you their teams, it\u2019s backed into our pay plans as part of everybody\u2019s performance, it\u2019s part of what everybody\u2019s pushing down is working capital initiatives and we are seeing some improvements in the non-automotive as well. So the ideas that we have just continued improvements each quarter, but again it\u2019s more coming from Automotive, but we\u2019re getting some from the others too.","Brian Sponheimer","I understood and then Paul, just one question. You mentioned brakes being up low double digits in the quarter and some improvement on chassis, how much of that is more miles driven and is there any part of that just better supply from some of your larger on and important suppliers within those product offerings.","Paul Donahue","Yeah, Brian, so I answer that two ways, on the brakes business we\u2019ve - our brakes business has been solid now for a number of quarters in a row and that\u2019s across all the brakes, [indiscernible], and Friction, and Caliper\u2019s have all been out pacing our overall growth and I think it\u2019s just a great job by our team out in the field grabbing some market share and we got a great partner on that side. If you recall Brian, a year ago on the chassis side we were having some significant service issues and please to report those are now behind us and we\u2019re seeing that business return back to more normal growth rates, but we were down quite a bit early last year as a result of some of the service problems. So again that\u2019s the business we had to do quite well throughout the first half of the year.","Brian Sponheimer","Alright, terrific. Well, thank you very much.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Brian.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sid Jones","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter 2017 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for 2018. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Carol Yancey our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reports under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.","A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.","Today's call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses as well. The Company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this mornings' press release. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","Now, let me turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Sid and let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights by business.","Carol Yancey, our Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer will provide an update on our financial results and our outlook for 2018. After that we'll open the call to your questions. So, to recap our fourth quarter sales and earnings performance across our global platform total GPC sales were up 11.3% to $4.2 billion with net income at $108 million and earnings per share at $0.73.","Alliance Automotive Group our European acquisition, which closed on November 2nd of 2017 performed in line with our initial projects and contributed approximately $250 million or 6.8% to sales and $0.07 in earnings per share. For the year, total sales were a record $16.3 billion, a 6.3% increase compared to 2016. Net income was $617 million and earnings per share were $4.18. AAG contributed 1.7% to sales and the same $0.07 earnings per share.","During the fourth quarter, there were several events that impacted our reported results which are highlighted in our press release and which Carol will discuss further. In summary, in addition to AAG's two months of operations discussed above, we had transaction related costs associated with the acquisition and recorded a tax expense related to US tax reform.","Before these items fourth quarter sales for our core operations were up 4.5%, net income was up 8.5% and earnings per share of $1.12 were up 10%. For the full year, our core operations were up 4.6% in sales, net income was flat and earnings per share of $4.64 were up 1%. When we combine these core results with AAG's two months of operations our earnings per share were $1.19 for the fourth quarter and $4.71 for the full year.","So, an active fourth quarter for us and we are proud of our teams and the good results they delivered. The fourth quarter was marked by progress in several areas and our teams delivered our strongest comparable earnings growth since 2013. The diversity in our operations combined with an ongoing strategy to drive both organic and acquisitive growth enabled us to deliver the 11% total sales increase for the fourth quarter. The acquisitions we have made to-date and those we may execute going forward, are intended to expand our businesses and further enhance our global footprint and ultimately create additional shareholder value.","In 2017, we acquired 15 businesses with proximally $2.1 billion in annual revenues including approximately $1.7 billion at AAG and another $150 million in sales at the three other businesses we acquired in the fourth quarter. In addition, in April of 2017, we made a minority investment in Inenco Group, a market leading industrial distributor in Australasia which we're planning to add to our industrial platform within the next 12 to 24 months.","Overall, acquisitions added 8.5% to the sales in the fourth quarter and we anticipate that each of these new businesses will positively contribute to our future results. As we review our 2017 performance total fourth quarter sales were driven by increases across automotive, industrial and electrical groups. Turning to our global automotive group sales for this segment were up 16.7% in Q4, including an approximate 1% comp sales increase and a 4% total sales increase before the positive sales contribution from AAG.","In our US automotive operations, total sales were up 2% in the fourth quarter with comp sales up 1%. And while 1% comp sales increased short of our long-term expectations, we did show sequential improvement from Q3 results. Comparable sales to retail customers outperformed our sales to commercial accounts. The sales results are consistent with the past several quarters, which we have attributed to challenging business conditions across many of our major accounts, fleet and now auto care customers.","That said, we continue to see many of our major accounts performing well and our auto care customer group was improved from third quarter. We have several initiatives in place to further build the sales potential with our major accounts and fleet customers and we will be launching new and enhanced benefits for industry leading auto care program which is now grown to over 17,500 members.","We expect these initiatives as well as the further expansion of other value-add services such as our auto tech training which impacts thousands of repair shops and even more automotive technician to drive stronger sales with our commercial customers in 2018. In retail, our sales growth stems from initiatives such as the NAPA rewards program which now has 6.5 million members and additional 1 million members from last quarter and our retail impact store initiative which now totals approximately 500 stores. Our retail sales at these stores continue to outperform our total network driven by strong increases in average ticket values or basket size.","In 2018, we'll expand this retail initiative further with the conversion of another 200 to 300 stores comprised of both boat company owned stores and independent owned stores. In addition to these growth initiatives, we're optimistic for the gradual strengthening of the overall aftermarket industry as well as our US automotive sales for several reasons. We expect the demand for failure and maintenance parts to increase due to the impact of a more normalized winter season, something we haven't experienced for two years. We expect a number of vehicles in the aftermarket sweet spot stabilize in 2018 after falling for the past few years due to the historically low new car sales in the post-recession years of 2008 through 2011.","And finally, the long-term fundamental drivers for the automotive aftermarket remains found with a growing total fleet relatively stable fuel prices which continue to drive more miles driven amongst consumers. Based on the most recent data available, total miles driven increased 1.1% in November and are up 1.3% for the 11 months. We also expect our ongoing acquisition to positively contribute to our future sales. During 2017, we added four automotive store groups including the fourth quarter acquisition of Monroe Motor Parts as well as Stone Truck Parts, the heavy-duty operation to our US network. These types of accretive tuck-in acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy and we expect additional opportunities in the future.","Now let's turn to our international automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada, and Mexico. As a group, these operations delivered a 5% total sales increase in fourth quarter including a 3% comp sales increase in local currency, which is consistent with the third quarter. In Australia and New Zealand, total sales were up low to mid-single digits once again in Q4 driven by a slight increase in comp sales and the ongoing benefit of acquisitions.","The Asia-Pac business finished 2017 with 560 stores across Australasia and like our other businesses has plans for further store expansion in the future. Further underlying fundamentals for the Australasian aftermarket remained solid as we enter 2018 with a growing car part driven by strong car sales relatively low gas prices and upward trends in miles driven. These positive trends are underpinned by an overall healthy Australian economy.","At NAPA Canada, sales remained strong in the quarter with total sales up mid to high single-digit and comp sales up mid-single digits. These results include and are highlighted by a strong performance from our heavy-duty truck parts business as well as solid results across Western Canada. In addition, we announced on December 31 NAPA Canada added Universal Supply Group to its operations. Universal in a Kingston, Ontario based operation with 21 stores which sell auto parts, heavy duty truck parts and paint and body parts.","The addition of Universal Supply strengthens our core presence in eastern Ontario market. So, our team in Canada is headed into 2018 with solid momentum and we look forward to another strong year from our Canadian team. Our automotive operations continue to expand in Mexico and this team finished 2017 with sales up mid-single digits. During 2017, we expanded our NAPA Mexico footprint with eight new auto parts stores and entered 2018 with 42 total stores. We have plans for further expansion of our store base and accelerate revenue growth in the quarters ahead.","Finally, we want to add that the operating results at Alliance Automotive Group for November and December reflect a solid start to this group. As you might imagine there is an incredible amount of planning and other work associated with an acquisition of this size, but our teams both in Europe and the US are doing a terrific job of staying focused on the business throughout this process.","So, looking back at our first 60 days in Europe things have gone extremely well and our talent management team is in position to drive strong results in 2018. We enter our first full year with the AAG team excited for the growth prospects we see for this business across all of our operations in France, the UK, Germany, and Poland.","So, in summary, our fourth quarter global automotive results were in line with our expectations both before and after the added contribution from AAG. We entered 2018 optimistic for further improvement in our results for this largest business segment of GPC.","Now turning to our industrial business, motion industries posted another impressive quarter with sales up 7.4% consistent with the first three quarters of the year. Overall, motions fourth quarter capped off an outstanding year in 2017 with solid mid-single digit comp sales growth further enhanced with their pneumatic engineering acquisition and the addition of Apache Hose & Belting Company. This combination of strong organic growth and acquisitions also led Motion to significantly expand their operating margin.","Favorable conditions in the industrial economy during 2017 drove solid growth across all product categories in the industries we serve. Each of our major product categories posted sales gains in the top 12 industries where we compete. 10 sectors were up again for the fourth quarter with strong growth in the sectors such as equipment and machinery, iron and steel, lumber and wood products, aggregate and cement, equipment rental and leasing, and oil and gas extraction. We expect the strong industry conditions we experienced in 2017 to continue into 2018. The industrial indicators we follow including industrial production, the purchasing managers index, rate counts and the level of exporting goods remain solid and should drive ongoing customer demand across the diverse markets we serve.","Turning now to EIS, our electrical and electronic materials group. Sales for this business were up 8.9% in the fourth quarter driven by the addition of Empire Wire and Cable in April of last year. Empire was an important strategic acquisition for EIS as it further expanded EIS's wire and cable offering and strengthen its capabilities to serve the industrial robotic and automation markets. This ties in well with Motion's expansion in this sector including its Braas in 2016 and the addition of Numatic Engineering in 2017.","The EIS and Motion businesses have a growing number of common attributes including their product offering, suppliers and in many cases their customers. To that end on January 1 of this year, we announced that we were combining the EIS operation in the motion and the industrial parts group.","As a result, beginning our first quarter, with our first quarter of 2018 reporting in any comparable prior year period EIS will be identified as Motion's electrical specialties group. The combination of these two segments will provide strong economies of scale and greater efficiencies which we intend to leverage. The opportunity to build synergies by sharing talent, physical resources greater [ph] and scale and value added expertise in each respective market channel is highly compelling.","Most importantly, we anticipate this combination will create value for both our customers and all our stakeholders. Our management teams are excited for the opportunities they see as a combined operation and are working closely to maximize their future potential as a $6 billion industrial group. Likewise, with the planned addition of Inenco in Australasia which also provides us an entry into growing markets like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore our outlook for the global growth prospects for this group is promising.","Now a few comments on S.P. Richards, our business products group which reported a 2.2% decrease in total sales for the fourth quarter. This business continues to be challenged by the continued pressures and demands through traditional office supplies, although the facility break room and safety supplies category continues to be a bright spot as they accelerate revenues and close 2017 at approximately 35% percent of total sales.","Our fourth quarter business products group results reflect the continuation of challenging trends and the changing landscape of the office products industry. That said, our team remain focused on diversifying this business while building greater size and scale in the growing FBS market. This is a key element of our overall growth strategy and an important consideration as we continue to evaluate our long-term outlook for this business.","So that recaps our consolidated and business segment sales results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Overall, the 4.5% sales growth before AAG was consistent with the first nine months of 2017 and we were pleased with the two months contribution from AAG which provided us with total sales growth of 11.3% for the fourth quarter. Importantly, we also made progress with our profitability and improved our operating margin for the first time in several quarters.","We credit our teams for improved execution while striving to improve our overall operating performance. While we have work yet to do, we are encouraged with our progress in Q4.","So, with that, I'll hand it over to Carol for her remarks. Carol?","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with a review of our key financial information and then discuss our outlook for 2018. As Paul mentioned sales in the fourth quarter up 11% or up 2% before acquisitions and 1% favorable impact of foreign currency. For 2017, our total sales increase of 6% includes 1.5% comparable sales growth, a slight benefit from foreign exchange and a 4.4% increase from acquisitions.","Our gross margin for the quarter was a reported 30.52% compared to 29.92% last year and reflects the benefit of increased supplier incentives in our industrial business as well as the higher gross margin associated with AAG's two-month results. The favorable impact of these items was slightly offset by the $5.6 million purchase accounting costs recorded in the fourth quarter. Before the impact of the AAG acquisition and the related purchase accounting cost, our adjusted gross margin would have been 30.2% in the fourth quarter or 30 basis point increase.","For the full year, our reported gross margin of 30.08 compares to 29.98 in 2016. Before our accounting for AAG our adjusted gross margin would have been 30%. Looking to 2018, we remained focused on enhancing our gross margins through several key initiatives including continued supplier negotiations both globally and across our businesses. The ongoing investment and more flexible and sophisticated pricing strategies as well as improved analytic capabilities around SKU profitability.","We experienced a somewhat inflationary pricing environment in 2017 with at least slight inflation in each of our business segments for the year. Our cumulative supplier price increases for 2017 were three tenths of 1% increase for automotive, 2% percent increase for industrial, 1.3% increase for electrical and six-tenths of 1% for office.","Turning to our SG&A our total expenses for the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, which includes the impact of AAG's two months of operations as well as transaction related costs of $25 million. Excluding these items, our total SG&A would have been $939 million or at 5% and 23.78% of sales which is an increase of 10 basis points from 2016, but improved from the cost increases we reported in the past several quarters.","So, despite the challenge of leveraging our expenses with less than 3% organic sales growth, our teams did a good job of managing their expenses during the quarter and we benefited from favorable year-end expenses an area such as incentive compensation, legal and professional, and insurance.","With these fourth quarter results, our total expenses were $3.9 billion for the full year including two months with AAG and $43 million in transaction related costs of which $18.5 million was recorded in the third quarter. Excluding these items our total expenses were $3.77 billion, up 7% and 23.51% of sales or a 40 basis points increase. As referenced earlier, our expenses were up in 2017 for several reasons including the lack of leverage on low single-digit sales comps. Rising costs in areas such as wages and labor, freight and delivery, IT and digital investments.","To offset these and other increases, we continued to enhance our cost saving initiatives and while we have much work ahead of us we were encouraged by our progress in the fourth quarter. With that said, our goal of achieving a lower cost highly effective distribution infrastructure will take time and our SG&A outlook includes certain costs that we deem necessary to support this objective as we move forward.","In addition, we're considering certain accelerated investments in 2018 to take advantage of our projected tax savings related to the tax cuts and job. We expect this process to pressure our overall SG&A to some degree but we're confident in the positive impact on our long-term profitability. We'll now discuss the results by segment, our automotive revenue for the fourth quarter of 2.3000000000 was that 17 percent from the prior year and our operating profit of $183 million is at 14.5% with an operating margin of 7.9 percent as compared to 8.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Excluding AAG, automotive fourth quarter sales would have been 2.1 or a 3.8% and our operating profit would have been $169 million or 5.7 percent increase reflecting an 8.2% operating margin. This 8.2% core margin is a 20 basis-points improvement from the fourth quarter in 2016 and it's much improved from the 120-basis points year-over-year decrease we reported in the third quarter. So, with this quarter's core operating performance and our expectation for an improved more normalized operating margin at AAG in 2018 relative to its two-month contribution in 2017. The automotive group entered 2018 with positive momentum which is encouraging.","Our industrial sales were 1.2 billion in the quarter, a 7.4% increase from 2016. Operating profit of 103 million was up a strong 27% and their marketing margins significantly improved at 8.3% compared to 7.0% last year.","The industrial group continues to benefit from both organic and acquisitive sales growth as well as improved gross margin including the favorable impact of supplier incentives as well as SG&A leverage. We're very pleased with the margin expansion for this segment. Our business product revenues were $466 million down 2% from last year and operating profit of $14 million is down 31% and their operating margin is 2.9%.","As Paul discussed earlier, this segment remains under pressure due to the continued challenges facing the industry and as we evaluate our outlook for this business, our teams remain focused on the further diversification into the growing FBS market. The electrical electronic group sales were $193 million in the quarter up 9% from 2016. Their operating profit of $13.5 million is down 13% and the margin for this group is 7.0%. This decline reflects the lack of organic sales growth as well as ongoing customer and product mix shift. So, our total operating profit in the fourth quarter was up 13% on our 11% sales increase and our operating profit margin improved by 10 basis points to 7.4%.","If we exclude the two months of AAG, our operating profit was up 8% on a 4.5% sales increase and our operating margin was up 30 basis points to 7.6%. So much improved operating performance for us in the fourth quarter and one that we will look to build on going forward. We had net interest expense of $17.4 million in the quarter which is up $12.6 million primarily due to the increase in debt associated with the AAG acquisition.","With this in mind, we expect our net interest expense to be in the range of $93 million to $95 million for 2018. Our total amortization expense was $18 million for the fourth quarter which is an increase from the $12.5 million last year due to the amortization related to AAG. For 2018 we expect full year amortization to be in the range of $83 million to $85 million Depreciation expense of $32 million for the quarter was up $5.5 million from 2016.","For 2018 we're projecting total depreciation to be in the range of $135 million to $145 million still on a combined basis, we would expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $220 million to $230 million. The other line which reflects our corporate expense was $56 million for the fourth quarter and that includes $31 million in transaction related costs associated with the AAG acquisition. Excluding those costs, our corporate expense was $25 million compared to $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.","For the year, this line was $160 million or $111 million if you exclude the $49 million in total transaction related costs that were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. This is up from the $95 million in the prior year as we had the benefit of certain real estate gains in 2016. For 2018, we're projecting our corporate expense to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 51.3% which reflects $51 million in provisional tax expense related to the transaction tax on foreign earnings as well as the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as was required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017.","Excluding the impact of this expense as well as the two months of operation for AAG and any transaction related costs for that acquisition, our income tax rate would have been approximately 35%. This has improved from the 35.5% tax rate in 2016 due to the favorable mix of US and foreign earnings as well of the change in accounting for stock-based compensation.","For 2018, we expect further shift in our US and foreign earnings associated with the full year of AAG operations, as well as the estimated benefit of tax reform on the US federal rate. So, we expect our tax rate to be 26% to 27% with provisional tax savings resulting from the tax reform that are currently estimated to be $80 million to $90 million.","So now turning to our balance sheet, which remains strong and in excellent condition. Accounts receivable at $2.4 billion is up 25% from the prior year and it's up 3% excluding the impact of acquisitions, primarily AAG as well as foreign currency. This 3% increase compares to our 4.5% sales increase in the fourth quarter and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables.","Our inventory at December 31 was $3.8 billion are up 17% from the prior year and basically flat excluding AAG, our other acquisitions and foreign currency. We're very focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable of $3.6 billion at year-end is up 18% in total and up 3% excluding AAG, other acquisitions as well as foreign currency. The 3% increase reflects lower purchasing activity across our businesses during the latter part of the year offset by the benefit of improved payment terms with certain suppliers.","At December 31 of 2017, our AP to inventory ratio was 96%. Our working capital of $1.8 billion at December 31 compares to $1.7 billion in 2016 and excluding AAG is $1.4 billion. Effectively managing our working capital is an ongoing priority for us and we see additional opportunities for improvement in 2018.","Our total debt of $3.2 billion at December 31 compares to $900 million outstanding in 2016 and reflects an approximate $2 billion in borrowings the same in the fourth quarter related to the AAG acquisition. Our debt arrangements varying maturity and at December 31 our average interest rate on our total debt was 2.7% with approximately $1.7 billion in debt at fixed rates. We're comfortable with our current debt structure and we're fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a financial capacity to support our growth initiatives including strategic acquisitions and investments such as AAG and the Inenco Group, which we believe creates significant value for our shareholders.","So, in summary, our balance sheet will remain a key strength of the company. In 2017, we generated $815 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow which excludes capital expenditures and the dividend was $253 million. Our cash flow were in-line with our forecast and continue to support our ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe start to maximize shareholder value.","Looking ahead we're planning for another strong year for cash generation in 2018 with our cash from operations estimated at $950 million to $1 billion and our free cash flow estimated at approximately $400 million. Our priority for cash remain the dividend, reinvestment in our businesses, share repurchase and strategic acquisitions which Paul covered earlier.","Regarding the dividend, yesterday the board approved a $2.88 per share annual dividend for 2018 marking our 62nd consecutive year of increased dividends paid for our shareholders. This represents a 7% increase from the $2.70 per share paid in 2017 and it's approximately 61% of our 2017 adjusted earnings, including the benefit of AAG's two months. Our capital expenditures were $55 million in the fourth quarter and $157 million for the year. For 2018 we're planning for capital expenditures in the range of $200 million to $220 million an increase from 2017 due to the impact of AAG and certain investments that we're planning on in association with our anticipated tax savings.","In 2017, we purchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock and today we have 17.4 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead. We continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best returns to our shareholders.","So, this concludes our financial update for the fourth quarter of 2017 and as Paul mentioned before, it was a very active quarter for us and we're proud of our teams for all their efforts including the added work related to the AAG acquisition as well as tax reform.","Additionally, while we have more work ahead of us we're encouraged by the progress in our operating performance and we're well positioned to further strengthen our results going forward. So now, turning to our guidance for 2018. Based on our current performance our growth plans and initiative as well as the market conditions that we see in the future we're [ph] our full year 2018 guidance as follows. We expect total sales to be in the plus 12% to plus 13% range including the benefit of any 2017 acquisition such as AAG but no future acquisitions and no impact from foreign currency.","By business we expect plus 19% to plus 21% sales growth for the automotive segment and this includes plus 2% to plus 4% sales growth excluding AAG. For the industrial group, we expect plus 4% to plus 5% total sales growth and for business products we expect sales to be down 3% to down 4%. On the earnings side, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.75. This EPS guidance includes the benefit for a full year of operations with AAG as well as approximately $80 million to $90 million and lower provisional income taxes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","With that said, we'd like to thank all of our GPC associates for the continued hard work and dedication. And at this point, I'll turn it back over to Paul.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Carol. Reflecting on 2017, our 90th year of operation, we had a number of accomplishments and milestones that better position the company for sustained long-term growth. We surpassed $16 billion in total sales for the first time in our company history. We expanded our global footprint with 15 strategic acquisitions across both existing and new markets adding $2.1 billion in annual revenues.","In automotive, we acquired Alliance Automotive Group entering the European market with significant size, scale, and talent. In industrial, we expanded our presence in the growing robotic sector while also acquiring 35% of Australasia's leading industrial distributor. We made significant IT investments to improve our digital capabilities and enhance our B2C online offerings across North America and Australia. We made progress in managing our cost to drive savings at a lower cost structure resulting in improved operating margin in the fourth quarter.","We generated solid cash flows returning $569 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. And finally, yesterday our board approved a 7% increase in the 2018 dividend, our 62nd consecutive year of increased dividends paid by the company.","So, we enter 2018 excited for the opportunities ahead and well prepared to build on our accomplishments. We also have the added benefit of a generally strong economy across most of our global markets as well as future savings associated with tax reform. In addition, we believe tax reform has the potential to drive additional growth in US investment and the economy overall further benefitting US companies including GPC, our GPC associates and our key stakeholders.","So, in closing, we look forward to operating with three primary business segments in 2018. By group our projected revenues will break down as 57% automotive, 33% industrial and 10% business products. We are market leaders in each of these segments and will continue to focus on both organic and acquisitive sales to drive long term sustained revenue growth.","We also moved forward with plans an initiative to enhance our gross margins, reduce our cost and build a highly productive and cost-effective infrastructure. We expect our focus in these key areas to improve the operating performance in each of our businesses and for the company overall and ultimately maximizing shareholder value. We look forward to updating you on our progress again in April when we report on our first quarter 2018 results.","So, with that we'll turn it back to the operator and Carol and I'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Bret Jordan, Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","Paul Donahue","Hi Bret.","Bret Jordan","I got a little late on the call, but I'm not sure if you touched on regional performance in auto and maybe the cadence through the quarter and what you've seen early 18?","Paul Donahue","Yes. Happy to address it Bret. We didn't talk about it specifically, but the cadence for the quarter for GPC a little slower out of the gates in October but we had a good November and a good December both. So, when you have the three up, it equated to a 5% overall increase. Our automotive business and I know specifically of interest to you was the kind of in a similar pattern a really good November and an okay December.","If we look across the geography Bret, where we are seeing outperformance in Q4 was in our northern division. So, for us that's the northeast, the central, mid-west in the mountain. Those northern divisions all performed well, a little softer growth in the southern what we would call our southern divisions. But certainly, see a nice growth in the northern regions and what's part of that you have to attribute to the weather patterns.","Bret Jordan","Yes, great. And then on the Alliance business do you have a fairly common vendor base will there be a lot of synergy as far as leveraging the suppliers there?","And I guess the follow-up to that will those suppliers also be able to deleverage from a working capital standpoint are the extended payables programs something you can put into the European business?","Paul Donahue","Yes. So, it's a little early yet Bret. Actually, our team had a number of meetings last week over in Europe with our global supplier base, and as you would imagine many of our top suppliers in the west, our top suppliers to us in Europe and Australasia for that matter so great companies like [indiscernible] Baash, Gates and Scheffler, Axalta, Delphi they are strategic suppliers for us across all of our markets right now.","And yes, we think there's opportunity in a number of areas but honestly, it's just a bit early yet.","Carol Yancey","And Bret, we do see opportunities from a working capital standpoint. We've already been in discussions and started programs with our banks that would be able to include our European operations. And so, all discussions that we're having we look at it from a comprehensive wide program including the working capital side.","Bret Jordan","Give us sort of ballpark and what cash might come out of the Alliance working capital? I mean with their inventory was going into it.","Carol Yancey","We don't but I can tell you and looking at and giving you what was improved guidance and cash from operations and free cash flow, we've contemplated some improvement in there. But won't specifically break that out.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Paul Donahue","Okay. Bret.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Horvers, JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good morning.","Paul Donahue","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Horvers","I have a follow-up question on Bret's question. As you think about the US NAPA comp outlook. You saw nice improvement from 3Q to 4Q putting up a one comp in the US. How are you thinking about this year and how do you think about sort of the sustainability which of what I assume was a pretty good start to the year?","Paul Donahue","Well, as we look into 2018 and certainly Chris as you would imagine this cold weather, we expect to ultimately be a nice boost for us. Our comps as you mentioned for 2017 were in the 1% range and for 2018, we were expecting still in the 1% to 3% range and certainly, our teams are going to be pulling every lever to get us to the top end of that range.","It's early yet, and again I think this colder weather as reflected in the strong performance we're seeing in our northern divisions, I think longer term that's going to give a boost to our US automotive business.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then on the margin front, you mentioned I think that ex-AAG gross margins are up 30 basis points year-over-year. Was there anything unsustainable about that whether it when their allowances sort of catch up in the fourth quarter that won't necessarily be indicative of how we think about modeling 2018?","Carol Yancey","Yes. I would point out on the gross margin. So, look there was in the Q4 probably two-thirds of that 30 basis points related to incremental rebase and primarily in our industrial group. The other 10 basis points is the core improvement. We had some favorable mix shift and some automotive product categories in the quarter as far as how the category has performed as well as Motions for business.","To say that's not sustainable, I mean look, we're modelling similar core growth for industrial going into 2018 and looking for similar margin improvement. So, we would have to assume that that would stay in the numbers and we actually feel pretty good about gross margin. We were really pleased to see the Q4 opportunities and the trends that presented themselves.","Christopher Horvers","So, it sounds like no less than 10, but maybe not all the way up to 30?","Carol Yancey","Look. One other thing I'd point out Chris and with AAG and the acquisition, I mean we're going to have sometimes acquisitions come in with a little different gross margin and SG&A, but you have similar operating margins. But you've seen us, like I said we had some good improvement in the quarter and I hope we can sustain being around that 30% or slightly better.","And look, some of the things we're doing in the pricing area, that's also going to help us on the gross margin side.","Christopher Horvers","And then my last question is Motion had very strong operating profit expansion, 8.3% in the fourth quarter. And if I look back historically, that low 8% range on an annual basis is where that business seems to [ph] out on sort of when you get into that very strong macro environment. So, is that where that enforce you a good read on how to think about 2018 overall?","Carol Yancey","Yes, well [ph] and again I would point out from Motion, so that improvement it was about a-third, a-third, a-third with incremental rebates, leverage on their core growth with SG&A and then just improvement in their core growth profit. So, as we look to more what their annual margin was in the high seven's, we would expect it to go up closer to the eight.","But long-term, we're always looking for kind of an 8%, 8.5% for the industrial group.","Paul Donahue","And Chris, I would just make a comment. I want to appreciate you calling out Motion. Motion had a very good year across the board. They had essentially 7% increases every quarter last year. We're excited about our acquisition, investment in Australia, basically the motion industry industries of Australia with the Inenco Group and look forward to expanding that investment in the coming 12 to 24 months.","We're very bullish on our industrial business. If you look at all the key indicators from the PMI, industrial production there is no reason we shouldn't see another good year out of our industrial business in 2018.","Christopher Horvers","Thank you.","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thanks for taking the question.","Carol Yancey","Hi Chris.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, just had a quick clarifying question. It's not like the, you might actually see this explicitly. But it's not like the math you gave on the call, what it suggested a 5.7% operating margin for AAG in the quarter. One I guess is that correct?","And then two I was trying to contextualize the 30-basis points pressure, I mean it's put that on 6% of sales, it seems like [ph] repurchase accounting. Is that the right way to think about that or is there an outstanding SG&A adjustment?","Carol Yancey","Well, let me take this in two parts. So first of all, you're doing some math to get to the automotive margin and I would tell you, we put AAG in for two months and two months is not necessarily representative of the full year for 2018. I mean you definitely have some seasonality. December in Europe, I mean you had two less selling days in France, one less selling day in the UK and you've got your level of fixed cost.","So, we didn't give guidance on those two months that we are reiterating our confidence in our guidance in a more normalized margin for 2018. So, that's the first comment, the second comment is there is no purchase accounting or one-time deal cost in our automotive operating margins. We put everything in the other line and the purchase accounting and all that is in that other line.","So, and going forward we would always pull that out of the operating segment.","Chris Bottiglieri","Yes, that's okay. I understood that. And then, just wanted clarification on the weather gap. I think you just contextualized it. But were you able to say with the weather gap actually was between kind of the northeast markets and the rest of the country and had the compare to Q3?","Just want to understand how much of that were actually contributing to the quarter?","Paul Donahue","Yes, Chris for Q4 we saw about two full points of gap between our northern businesses and our southern business. And if you look at Q3, that gap was even more narrow it was closer to a point in Q3. But look the November numbers that we saw and we had good month in November, that also happen to be the coldest month in Q4. So, once again there is a direct correlation in our U.S. automotive business tide to the weather pattern. So again, we're bullish looking ahead at some of this winter weather that we're seeing, we'll be positive for our U.S. business in 2018.","Chris Bottiglieri","And then, I guess somewhat related; I think you talked to the south being weaker, would have thought like it was a rig count and what we're hearing on demand for fleet -- fleet sales etcetera, like heavy duty trucks; can you talk about just generally speaking how your energy markets in heavy duty business is performing relatively?","Paul Donahue","That's a great question, Chris, and I would tell you that our energy markets and specifically our southwestern division, they had a good quarter, they outpaced the balance of our southern division. So if you think -- I mean, when we talk about our southern divisions, we're stretching coast to coast and the southwest and our energy markets absolutely outperformed the balance of our southern divisions.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matt Fassler, Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","My first question is sort of a follow-up from Q3. I think there was one business, I believe automotive where rebates worked against you from a gross margin perspective in Q3. If I'm right in recalling that, did that issue in essence go away in Q4?","Carol Yancey","Yes. So in Q3 we called out some onetime sure off [ph] related to automotive and our business product segment and that was adjusting to what our purchasing levels were, our sales levels; so you had a little more of a true-up in Q3. Q4 was less of a headwind but still had it on the business product side. What helped us on gross margin in Q4 from automotive, we had some product mix shift that were a little bit better, so we had product categories that have higher margin, that didn't perform as well in Q3, those performed better in Q4. And then said the other way, we had lower margin product categories that were performing really well in Q3 that were driving down margins; so we had some product mix favorable side changes in Q4. So definitely not as much incentive noise in Q4.","Matt Fassler","Understood. And then you spoke about tax reform and the amount you're going to flow through; could you help us quantify the discretionary investment if you can do so that you chose to make -- given that tax reform hasn't [indiscernible] a bit of a windfall and I'm going windfall to your net income run rate?","Carol Yancey","So, these are our best estimates right now as you guys know, this is all provisional and we've done the best we can, estimate what that is and looking at the $80 million to $90 million in both cash and EPS savings, you're going to see us evaluate that and put it in our usual priority, so we certainly mention the 7% increase in the dividend this morning. We've mentioned incremental investments in our business and when you look at our CapEx, we certainly had to include an amount in there for AAG but there could be an estimated $25 million to $45 million in incremental CapEx that we've put into our 2018 guidance. And then we want to invest in our facilities technology investments, probably go at a quicker pace since this has presented itself.","And then lastly, we're looking at some programs that would directly benefit our people and this can be in areas like training and talent and compensation and certainly investments in our facilities also benefit our employees as well; so that's all been reflected in our guidance.","Matt Fassler","So the $5.60 to $5.75 includes what you might do with some of that money out of P&L?","Carol Yancey","Yes. And look, I know on the $5.60 to $5.75, I mean we've talked about -- there are some investments that we're having to make in our North America automotive business and those are incremental investments, we've got additional CapEx, we've got some headwinds on the business product segment. And then we did have and we've called out, we did have some favorable one-time adjustments in Q4 that were in insurance, legal and professional; those things present themselves with maybe $0.15 to $0.20 EPS headwind, and that's been contemplated in the guidance that we've given you but we're still putting out there plus 19% to plus 22% increase in EPS.","Operator","We'll take our next question from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","I guess bit of a follow-on to Matt's question if you think about reinvesting and thanks for outlining all that but I didn't mention -- it didn't seem like there is anything on the gross margin side could there be given that some of these -- the investment in people and facilities could be in supply chain? And then I had a follow-up.","Carol Yancey","You're spot-on, I appreciate the additional clarity. We have a long list of projects we've meet in doubt with our Canadian team, our U.S. team and it ranges anywhere from pricing, software and optimization and investments in people, data analytics to supply chain reinvention, to using more predictive analytics in our inventory modeling and supply chain. Facilities is around whether it's conveyers or our warehouse management system combining facilities, you can definitely get productivity improvements, you can get gross margin improvements, so we haven't necessarily put it on each line item, we're just telling you that those investments will benefit us in the long-term.","Unidentified Analyst","And my follow-up was on the motion industries; I think Paul, you've called out how well it's done and how the outlook there seems to be improving. If we look at your guidance for this year on motion; how much of the growth -- I think last year 7% was sort of the numbers that kept put up for this year how much do you expect of the growth to be acquisition as opposed to organic?","Carol Yancey","So last year's full year numbers had a comp number of 4% and acquisitions of 3% and that's what got you to the 7%. We're giving you the plus 4% to plus 5% which would imply a comp of 3% to 4% and acquisitions of 1% to 2%; that acquisitions is carryover from 2017 acquisitions, it's nothing further. I can tell you we certainly hope to be at the higher end of that 3% to 4% and -- but right now we felt like it was appropriate to start with 3% to 4%. Paul mentioned all the favorable fundamentals, we had a presentation from their management team yesterday and we certainly all feel encouraged by the long-term fundamentals but right now we're going to start-off the year with kind of a similar comp into '18.","Paul Donahue","And we've got a really high performing management team at motion and if the right opportunities come along on the acquisition front we will absolutely step into them and continue to look at tuck-ins and bolt-ons for our motion team. But that team we expect to have another really good 2018 and I would just add to Greg, welcome back, it's good to hear your voice again.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Curtis [ph], Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","A very quick question on the new revenue recognition standards for franchisees; just wondering if there is any implications for the numbers for your guys in terms of going forward or perhaps historical numbers?","Carol Yancey","Actually we've been working on that for two years now, we did a lot of analysis, a lot of work on it and came up with a very immaterial minimal adjustment; so really no impact on the company which is why it's not really called out. And so because of our -- the way that we just recognize our product sales and again, we looked at a lot of different things that we will not be reporting much of an impact.","Operator","We'll go next to Carolina Jolly, Gabelli.","Carolina Jolly","I guess as I look to some of the more global occurrences, it looks like we're getting some still tariff and maybe some change to trade agreements. Are we able to expect due to past prices right away or is there some lag in that?","Paul Donahue","Carolina, you were kind of breaking up on us. Can you repeat that question?","Carolina Jolly","So as we see some -- these steel tariffs come through and some change to the trade agreements potentially, are we -- do we expect GPC to pass price along or is there some type of lag in that?","Paul Donahue","I'm sorry, I didn't catch it the first time but I understand what you're asking now. And absolutely if we absorb raw material increase and that our suppliers come to us with increases we will absolutely pass those along and don't anticipate any lag period between us accepting those price increases and us passing those increases along. That said Carolina, we with our scale now in Europe, Australasia and of course, across North America, we are evaluating all of our global supplier base and as the question was asked earlier, we've got some great global strategic suppliers that we'll give every opportunity to partner with us as we move forward. But in terms directly to your question, we will absolutely pass along any price increases that we've received.","Operator","And due to time constraints, I'd like to turn it back to management for closing remarks.","Carol Yancey","We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. We appreciate your support at Genuine Parts Company and we look forward to reporting out on our first quarter results in April. Thank you and have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead Sir.","Sid Jones","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company second quarter 2017 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for the full year.","Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses. The Company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","We'll begin this morning with comments from our President and CEO, Paul Donahue. Paul?","Paul Donahue","Thank you, Sid, and welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our second quarter 2017 results. I will make a few remarks on our overall performance, and then cover the highlights by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for 2017. After that, we'll open up the call to your questions.","So to recap our second quarter performance, total sales were up 5% to a record setting $4.1 billion with net income coming in at $190 million and earnings per share increasing 1% to $1.29 compared to $1.28 in the second quarter last year. These results represent the total sales and earnings across our global Automotive, Industrial, Office and Electrical operations, which we will discuss in more detail throughout this call.","As a diversified global distributor, we continue to benefit from the balance of serving a broad range of markets. The diversity in our operations combined with an ongoing strategy to drive both organic and acquisitive growth produced a second consecutive quarter of 5% total sales growth. Each of our four distribution businesses produced improved total sales with our strongest performances in the Industrial and Electrical segments.","Our teams are committed to generating sustainable sales growth, while also streamlining our cost structure to improve profitability. Thus far in 2017, we have acquired businesses with approximately $180 million in annual revenues and made a minority investment in a market leading industrial distributor in Australia. We anticipate that each of these new businesses will positively contribute to our future results.","Turning to organic growth, total comp sales were up 2% in the second quarter and improved result relative to the last several quarters. And we stand at plus 1% for the first six months of 2017. And while improved from the first quarter, the low single digit comp sales growth continues to pressure our net margins. Looking ahead, we are confident that our sales and cost initiatives will drive stronger growth and improve margins over the long term.","Turning to our Automotive operations, Automotive remains our largest business segment representing 53% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2017. For the quarter global Automotive sales were up 3.6% from last year and improved from the 3.4% increase in the first quarter. Comp sales on a global basis were up approximately 1.5%, which has improved from a 0.5% in the first quarter.","In our U.S. operations, which continued to represent just over 70% of our Automotive revenues, total sales were up 4% in the second quarter including a 1% increase in comp sales which has improved from the first quarter. Across our customer segment sales to retail DIY customer outperformed our sales to commercial DIFM accounts although both groups improved sequentially.","On the commercial side of the U.S. business, sales to our NAPA AutoCare Centers were up 1%, while sales to major accounts and fleet customers remained under pressure and were down low-single digits. Byproduct group batteries, rotating electrical, brakes, chassis, filtration and heavy-duty sales outperformed while categories such as Ride Control, exhaust and heating and cooling remained soft.","These sales trends co-relate to the warmer than average winter weather and cooler summer temps in May and June. By geography our Northern divisions outperformed our Southern divisions although both showed positive sales growth. In the Northern division the Mountain, which experienced the harshest winter conditions in the country continued to outperform while the Northeast and the Midwest divisions also had solid results in the second quarter.","Our Western division, which experienced warmer than normal summer temps in the quarter outperformed the solid growth as well. On the retail ride of the U.S. business we continue to expand our NAPA Rewards Program, which has now grown to nearly five million members. This loyalty program is available in-store and online and is an important initiative for us in the broader scope of our continued retail growth.","We continue to experience higher retail tickets and more frequent visits from our NAPA Rewards members and we\u2019ll continue to enhance this program into 2018. We are also making progress with our retail impact initiative, which includes installing all new interior layouts and in-store graphics, extended store hours and increase training for our store associates.","The 275 stores updated for this initiative through June continue to produce very high single-digit retail sales growth. This program continues to exceed our expectations and we have a plans to have more than 500 of these retail impact stores completed by the end of 2017. This is an increase from our previous plan for 450 stores by year-end.","The retail-end customer has more choices today than ever before, so it's encouraging to see our initiatives driving growth in our retail segment. Our ongoing acquisitions will also positively contribute to our commercial and retail segments as we move forward.","Thus far in 2017 we have acquired three automotive store groups adding 25 new stores to our U.S. network. On June, first we announced the acquisition of Stone Truck Parts a significant regional distributor with four locations distributing heavy-duty truck parts and accessories in North Carolina. Combined we expect these new businesses to further strengthen our Automotive and heavy-duty network and contribute approximately $100 million in annual revenues.","Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket, the long-term fundamental drivers for our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow, the average age of the fleet is up to a 11.7 years. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continue to post steady gains.","Total miles driven increased 1.2% in April, marking 38 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, and they are up 1.5% year-to-date with steady fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.46 in June, which was down slightly from last year. As a result, we expect to see further increases in miles driven and, ultimately, driving additional parts purchases.","Overall our U.S. Automotive sales benefited from the combination of acquisitions and positive comp sales growth for the first time since Q1 of 2016. We believe this is an indication that our retail and commercial initiatives are gaining traction. And we plan to build on this momentum in the second half of the year.","So now let's turn to our International Automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada and Mexico. These operations account for nearly 30% of our global Automotive revenues and as a group delivered a 4% total sales increase including a 3% comp sales increase in local currency. In Australia and New Zealand, second quarter sales were up low to mid-single digits, driven by low-single digits comp sales growth and the ongoing benefit of acquisitions.","The Asia Pac business operated with 29 additional stores in the second quarter of 2017 relative to the same period last year. And that now brings our total store footprint in Australia and New Zealand to 555 locations with further store expansion opportunities in the future.","In addition, the underlying fundamentals for the Australasian aftermarket remains solid with a growing car part driven by record car sales, relatively low gas prices and upward trends in miles driven.","At NAPA Canada, both total sales and comp sales improved in the mid-single digit range, which is consistent with the first quarter results. Our Canadian team is performing at a high level and they've laid out an effective strategy to expand sales across Canada. In addition the industry is benefiting from a more favorable sales climate driven by an improving overall economy and positive industry fundamentals.","These factors bode well for the future of the Canadian automotive aftermarket and we are optimistic for continued outsized growth at NAPA Canada over the second half of the year. And finally, in Mexico, our sales grew by low double digits for the third consecutive quarter as we continue to expand our NAPA Mexico footprint. Today we have 36 total stores with plans to accelerate additional store openings in the quarters ahead.","So that wraps up our Automotive overview. We're pleased to report a 4% increase in our U.S. business despite continued industry wide headwinds. Going forward we'll continue to focus on accelerating our comp sales growth while continuing to search for opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions. Our international automotive business continues to post strong results as we expand our comp sales and add new locations across all of our markets.","So let's turn to our industrial business. Motion Industries representing 30% of our second quarter total revenues and this group was up 7.3% in the quarter. This has an improved result from the 6.9% increase in the first quarter and includes a 5% comp sales increase up from a 3% comp increase last quarter.","We are encouraged by the continued strength in our industrial sales thus far in 2017, which reflects both improving organic growth as well as the benefit of acquisitions. In addition the industry is benefiting from favorable market conditions as broad based industrial indicators such as industrial production and the purchasing managers index as well as rig count and the level of exported goods all continue to trend positively. These factors drive greater customer demand across the diverse markets we serve and we expect to see this continue over the balance of the year.","A review of our Motion business by industry sector, product category and top customers supports the broad nature of our second quarter growth as well. Of our Top 12 industries nine sectors showed solid sales gains with the others down just slightly. Among the top performers would be sectors such as iron and steel, lumber and wood, equipment rental and leasing, big improvements in oil and gas and equipment and machinery.","Along our primary product categories each generated positive sales growth for the second consecutive quarter and likewise our Top 20 customers outperformed with their second consecutive quarter of high-single digit growth. So from a market product and customer perspective, Industrial\u2019s solid second quarter and six month performance was very broad based.","Finally acquisitions also remain an important element of our growth strategy. You may recall back in April we purchased 35% of the Inenco group one of Australasia\u2019s leading industrial distributors of bearings, power transmission, fasteners and seals. And Inenco is currently outperforming our expectation of generating annual revenues of more than $450 million in Australian dollars. Inenco was an attractive long-term investment for us, as it offers us the opportunity to build on our presence in Australasia as well as the potential for synergies with their existing industrial business in North America as well as our Australasian automotive operations.","And in the same vein as our Asia Pac acquisition a few years back, we expect to eventually acquire the remaining stake in Inenco, which we believe will add significant value to our overall industrial operations. We remain excited about our investment in Inenco and we congratulate the team for their record sales performance in the month of June.","On August 01, we'll further expand our industrial automation footprint with the acquisition of Numatic Engineering. Numatic brings over 60 years of experience in Numatic and electrical automation and will add approximately $20 million in annual revenues. This new business in addition to the Braas acquisition announced last September strengthens our distribution capabilities in the fast growing robotics, motion control and industrial network segment of the industry. We are pleased to welcome the Numatic team to the GPC family of companies.","In summary we are encouraged by the first half performance in our Industrial business and remain optimistic for continued growth in the quarters ahead.","Turning now to EIS, our electrical distribution segment; we took 5% of the Company's total second quarter revenues. Sales for this group, which were up 11% in the second quarter due primarily to the Empire Wire and Supply acquisition on April 01. Empire further expands the EIS\u2019s wire and cable business and in particular it strengthens our overall capabilities to serve the industrial, robotic and automation markets.","This new business performed well in the quarter as did the overall wire and cable segment. EIS\u2019s core electrical business is also producing steady increases and overall we expect to see solid total sales growth at EIS over the balance of the year.","So we'll wrap up with a few comments on our Office Products business which was 12% of the Company's second quarter revenue. The Office Products group reported a 5% increase in sales, driven by an 8% sales contribution from acquisitions in their facilities breakroom and safety supplies category. Excluding the acquisitions comp sales were down approximately 3% in the second quarter with the continued decline in demand for traditional Office Supplies pressuring sales across all of our channels.","Our facilities and breakroom category however continues to produce strong sales increases across all channels and we expect to see further growth in the quarters ahead. On the product side sales in the traditional office supplies furniture and tech products categories each posted sales decline while the FBS category posted solid sales results.","These results are consistent with recent sales trends and highlight the significant of our efforts to expand SPR\u2019s product and services offering in the large and growing facilities and breakroom market. This is a key element of our growth strategy and today FBS sales represent 36% of total sales for the Office segment, which is up from 25% last year.","Looking ahead we have plans for the continued expansion of the FBS business as well as key initiatives to grow our overall share of wallet and market share across our other product categories and sales channels.","So that recaps our consolidated and business segment sales results and the initiatives underway to generate sustainable sales growth over the long-term. Overall we produced our second consecutive quarter of 5% sales growth driven by the combination of both organic and acquisitive growth and total sales increases in each of our four business segments. We will look to build on these results over the second half of the year.","So with that I'll hand it over to Carol who will provide a financial update and our updated outlook for the year. Carol.","Carol Yancey","Thank you, Paul, and we'll begin with a review of our key financial information and then we'll provide more information on our updated outlook for 2017. Total sales in the second quarter set a new record our us of $4.1 billion, up 5% including a 2% increase in comparable revenues.","Our gross margin for the quarter was 30.2% compared to 29.9% in the second quarter last year. The 30 basis point improvement is the result of our ongoing initiatives, to enhance gross margins across our businesses as well as higher supplier incentives. In addition, we continue to benefit from those acquisitions with higher gross margin and higher expense models as some of those have not anniversaried in this quarter.","We're encouraged by our progress in improving our gross margin, and we look to produce an approximate 30% gross margin over the balance of the year. We saw somewhat of an inflationary pricing environment across our businesses in the second quarter with each of our business segments showing at least slight inflation through the first six months of the year.","Our cumulative supplier price changes through June stand at one tenth of 1% for automotive positive, up 1.6% for Industrial, up 0.6% for Office and up 1.6% for Electrical.","Turning to our at SG&A our total expenses for the second quarter were $943 million up 9% from last year and at 23% of sales. Rising labor, freight and delivery costs and addition to our ongoing spending for planned technology and digital investments, which are very critical to our long-term growth strategies are driving the increase in our operating expenses.","And as mentioned before we've yet to anniversary certain higher gross margin and higher expense acquisitions. Finally we also continue to experience the deleveraging of expenses associated with the slow organic sales growth environment in several of our businesses. To offset these expense headwinds we remain focused on initiatives to streamline our cost structure while achieving a lower cost, highly effective distribution infrastructure for our businesses.","As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we expect to recognize some of these savings and improve on our year-over-year expense growth rate. Now, let's discuss the results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.2 billion up 4% for the prior year and operating profit at $207 million is up 2% with an operating margin of 9.6%, which is just shy of the 9.7% margin in the second quarter last year.","We attribute this slight decline in margin to the deleveraging of expenses associated with our 1.5% comparable sales growth. Our Industrial sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter, were up 7% from the prior year and their operating profit of $96 million is up a solid 9%. And their operating margin improved to 7.7% compared to 7.6% last year as this segment continues to benefit from stronger overall sales growth, favorable product mix shift and the positive impact of cost savings.","Our Office Products revenues were $504 million up 5% from last year, operating profit of $30 million is down 8% and their operating margin held steady with the first quarter at 6.0%. The margin for Office remains under pressure, due to the decrease in organic sales and the related deleveraging of expenses. Our teams are addressing these concerns with several pricing and cost initiatives to drive more sales and significant savings in this business in the quarters ahead.","The electrical electronic group sales were $205 million in the quarter up 11% from the prior year. Operating profit at $15.5 million is down 3% and the margin for this group is 7.6%. We're encouraged by the overall sales growth again this quarter, although organic sales remained challenged. We continue to be pressured by customer and product mix shift, which are offsetting the positive impact of the cost saving initiatives in this business.","So our total operating profit in the second quarter, increased by 3% and our operating margin was 8.5% compared to 8.7% last year. This has slightly improved from the first quarter on a year-over-year basis and our team enters the second half of the year focused on building on our positive momentum and improving the margins across our businesses.","We had a net interest expense of $6.9 million in the quarter, which is up $2.2 million from last year due to the increase in debt levels primarily associated with acquisition and certain variable interest rates. With these factors in mind, we\u2019re updating our net interest expense to be in the range of $25 million to $26 million for the year.","Total amortization expense of $11.4 million for the second quarter was up from $9.2 million last year due to acquisition. We continue to expect our full year amortization to be approximately $45 million. Depreciation expense was $27.8 million for the quarter up slightly from last year. And for the full year we expect total depreciation to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million.","On a combined basis, we would expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $155 million to $165 million. The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense was $33.8 million for the quarter up from $26.5 million last year due mainly to higher overall costs in areas such as personnel, legal and professional, our digital initiatives as well as IT.","For 2017, we expect corporate expense to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 36.1% compared to 36.2% last year. This slight reduction in the quarterly rate as well as our lower year-to-date tax rate is primarily due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at a lower rates.","In addition their recently adopted change in accounting for stock based compensation has also positively impacted our 2017 rates. For the full-year we continue to expect our income tax rate to range from 35.5% to 36.0%. Net income for the quarter of a $190 million and EPS was a $1.29 up 1%.","So now let's turn our discussion to the balance sheet, which remains strong and in excellent condition. Accounts receivable of $2.2 billion is up 7% from the prior year and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at quarter-end was $3.3 billion, which is consistent with last quarter's investment and up 9% from June of last year. Before acquisitions our inventory is up 6%, which is just slightly greater than the sales. We\u2019ll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward.","Accounts payable is $3.3 billion at June 30 and is up 7% from the prior year due to the increased level of purchases, the ongoing benefit of improved payment terms with our suppliers, as well as acquisitions. At June 30 our AP to inventory ratio was 99%, which compares to 96% at December 31.","Our working capital of $1.5 billion at June 30 is down from last quarter and year-end but it is up slightly from June of last year. So overall, we continue to maintain a relatively steady level of working capital from quarter-to-quarter. Our total debt of $1.1 billion at June 30, compares to $1.025 billion at March 31 and $775 million in June of last year.","Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 25.5% and we remain comfortable with our capital structure at this time. Our average cost of debt is a low 2.49% and we continue to believe that our current structure provides the company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of future growth opportunities.","In summary, our balance sheet remains the key strength of the Company. Thus far in 2017, we generated cash from operations of $345 million and we expect to produce stronger cash flows over the balance of the year. We're forecasting cash from operations of approximately $900 million to $950 million with free cash flow which excludes capital expenditure and the dividends to be in the $350 million to $400 million range.","We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. These include strategic acquisitions, which Paul covered earlier, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. For the first six months of the year, we purchased 1.6 million shares of our stock, which includes 600,000 shares purchased in the second quarter.","Today we have 2.6 million shares authorized and available for repurchase while we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.","Our investment in capital expenditures was $29 million in the second quarter and $54 million for the six months, which is up slightly from last year. For the year, we're now planning for capital expenditures in the range of $140 million to $150 million.","And lastly our 2017 annual dividend of $2.70 per share marks our 61st consecutive year of increased dividend paid to our shareholders. This represents approximately 57% of our prior year earnings and currently reflects an over 3% dividend yield.","So this concludes our financial update for the second quarter of 2017. And in summary our overall top line growth is encouraging and we see further opportunities to enhance our gross margins and to streamline the cost structure across our businesses. These areas continue to have our full attention and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress.","Now turning to our guidance for 2017 based on our current performance, our growth plans and the market conditions we see for the foreseeable future, we're updating our full year 2017 guidance as follows. We continue to expect total sales to be in the plus 3% to plus 4% range, which is unchanged from our initial guidance. This outlook includes the benefit of our year-to-date acquisitions, as well as the Numatic acquisition promotion that Paul discussed that is effective August 01, but assumes no other future acquisitions.","We also continue to expect only a slight headwind from currency translation for the full year. By business, we're maintaining our sales outlook of plus 3% to plus 4% growth for the automotive segment. Plus 2% to plus 3% growth for the Office segment and plus 7% to plus 8% growth for the Electrical segment. In the Industrial segment, we're raising our sales outlook to plus 4% to plus 5% from our previous guidance of plus 3% to plus 4%.","On the earnings side, we are revising our full year outlook for earnings per share to $4.70 to $4.75 from our previous guidance of $4.75 to $4.85. We had anticipated being further along with our cost saving initiatives, at this point in the year and with EPS up 1% for the six months, we've updated our EPS outlook to reflect a 4% to 6% improvement in the second half earnings. And a full year increase over 2016 EPS of 2.5% to 3.5%.","So we continue to plan for improved profitability over the balance of the year and this will primarily come from the cost savings we mentioned before. These savings reflect the headcount reductions, and the facility rationalization and a broad range of productivity projects that are underway across our businesses.","With that said we would close by thanking all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work day in and day out. Our people are our greatest asset, and we\u2019re excited about the future growth prospects and the long-term success of the company. Paul I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.","Paul Donahue","Thank you Carol. We move forward with the goal of building on our six-month performance and remain focused on further strengthening the organic sales in our businesses, as well as maximizing the benefits of our recent acquisitions.","We are also committed to executing on our plans to enhance gross margins and remove unproductive costs from our operations. As Carol mentioned, we have several initiatives in process to reduce expenses and improve our overall cost structure and we expect to recognize some of these savings over the balance of the year.","Additionally, we believe our continued efforts in each of these areas along with a strong balance sheet, solid cash flows, and effective capital allocation will positively contribute to stronger long-term growth for the company and serve to maximize shareholder value.","So with that we'll turn the call back over to Alisia, and Carol and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you Sir. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks good morning everybody.","Paul Donahue","Hey good morning Chris.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Christopher Horvers","Why don\u2019t you focus first on the U.S. NAPA division, on the heels of the O'Reilly pre-announcement, a couple of weeks ago, I think that the plus one in the U.S. probably comes off, certainly a bit better and it looks like you've actually closed the gap to O'Reilly in that regard. So can you talk about, they talked about a stronger April and then you know it sounded like May and June being disappointing. Can you talk about the monthly cadence in the U.S. NAPA division.","Paul Donahue","Yeah, we were pretty consistent across the U.S. Chris. We were essentially up for each month, April, May and June. Globally, it was a little shift. Globally, we saw a little bit of a slide in April. But across the U.S., it was consistent across each month. ","Christopher Horvers","And then if you look at the, it was a lot easier comparison. And as you mentioned, it's been a cool summer so far, at least up until very recently. So we've been waiting to get further away from winter. Does the cooler summer sort of push out the rebound off the two consecutive warm winters? And then related to that, as you look forward, the compares do step up again in the fourth quarter. So are we sort of running out at two year? Or do you expect the business to continue to rebound into the end of the year?","Paul Donahue","Well.","Christopher Horvers","In U.S. NAPA?","Paul Donahue","Yeah, let me take the first part of the question. I may ask you to repeat the second part of that, Chris. But look, if you look across our business, what's encouraging for us is that our Northern divisions, so we're talking about the Northeast, the Midwest, the Mountain divisions, are performing well. And I think I called out Mountain last quarter as our top performer. They just happen to have the most normalized winter in that part of the country. Where we're a little bit softer than we are in the Northern divisions is in the Southern divisions. And so Southeast, Southwest, Atlantic are a little bit softer, and there's a gap between the top performers and the others of about 300 basis points.","We think that will close as the year progresses. The South has been, I think, impacted a bit by the cooler temps. And certainly, we have had a ton of precipitation down here in the South. So we think that, that gap will close a bit as we move through the course of the year.","Christopher Horvers","And some have mentioned some pressure around the Hispanic customer. In fact, the Target CEO was quoted just this week talking about that. Are you seeing areas, Texas and along the border of Mexico, softer trends in those areas? And is that contributing to the softness in the South?","Paul Donahue","Well, I'd answer that a couple of ways, Chris. As you heard me say, our DIY business was good in the quarter. And if you think about the consumer that you're referencing, I think that would probably show up a bit in our DIY retail numbers. So we're quite pleased with our retail business. As a matter of fact, we had a very good June in our retail business. ","That said, I would tell you that our Southwest is down a bit or softer than our Northern Division. Whether I can attribute that to one specific demographic, it's hard to say. There's a lot of different factors at work. ","Christopher Horvers","Okay and just last question, I promise. So as it relates to the cooler summer, are you concerned that, that pushes out the recovery in the U.S. NAPA business?","Paul Donahue","No, you saw our guidance for Automotive, Chris, and we've taken all those factors into account. And we're expecting 3% to 4% overall. And look, I think the good news for all of us, especially in the Midwest, is it's getting hot, and it's getting hot down here in the South. And we'll see business start to turn almost immediate as the temps go up. So we're feeling pretty good about the second half of the year, as I think was illustrated in our guidance. ","Christopher Horvers","Thanks very much Paul.","Paul Donahue","You are welcome, good to talk to you Chris.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, and thank you for taking the question. A couple. One, I guess I just need to clarify I mean, so the comp gap did decelerate a little bit, I mean, sort of the tier comp stack. And then you're getting a lot of self-help initiatives and a little bit of inflation. So maybe I'll ask the question a little bit differently. What do you think the overall market has been doing? Do you think it is, are you nearing at the peers? Or do you think the market itself is a little bit weaker?","Paul Donahue","Well I think, Chris, I have to mention it's a good question. I think that our business, and I can't speak for our public company peers. We'll hear their numbers here shortly. But I think it's an accurate assessment that the automotive aftermarket has slowed somewhat over the past number of quarters, and there's a lot of reasons that we all talk about. And certainly, back-to-back mild winters has been a big factor. You know that. I think one of you guys have referenced it as an air pocket that stepped down in that 7 to 9 year age group of vehicles. ","So that sweet spot has been a little bit of a headwind, I think, for us and in the demand for repairs. And then if you look at some of the tailwinds that we've had in the past, and whether that be miles driven, cheaper gasoline, those tailwinds are still there, but they're lessening than what I think we saw perhaps a year or two ago. So those would be the reasons we'd point to for just a bit of slower growth. But again, we're cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year and as we distance ourselves from these mild winters. ","Chris Bottiglieri","Gotcha and then as you\u2019re seeing really strong performance in the DIY stores that you're doing a lot of self-help out and you're kind of closing the gap to peers. But can you maybe talk about the stores that are just you're chugging along with your kind of normal procedure? How are those stores performing on the DIY side? ","Paul Donahue","Well I\u2019d love to tell you they're performing as well as the stores that we have gone in and gone through our total refurb. But what we've done Chris, is our level of refurbs, if you will, in our stores varies. So it varies from a total overhaul of resetting fixtures to painting the stores to increasing hours to bringing in additional people. That would be on a major overhaul. And to a lesser degree, we're trying to impact all of our stores by increasing our store hours and adding more retail-focused personnel. ","I mentioned our strong performance in June in our retail business. And in June, we saw both transaction and basket size go up for the first time in a couple of quarters. We're investing in business development managers in our retail stores, which I think are having a very positive impact on our business. So overall, we're positive about our retail business. And we're positive despite, I think, a bit of a hysteria out there around what the online players are going to do to DIY.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. Yeah, that's helpful. And then just one final question on Industrial. Yes, extremely strong organic revenue growth. I wonder if you can give us a sense for why you think the incremental margins came a little bit lighter than maybe than I would have expected. Is it your investments, is that bifurcated between gross margin, SG&A, deleverage, like kind of what you're seeing in that segment and kind of your outlook for your outlook for margins in that segment?","Carol Yancey","Look we did little bit lighter margin improvement in the quarter, but I would look to what we've done for the six months. And you've got a 20 basis point improvement in margin for the six months, sales being up 7%, profits up 10%. That is indicative of their gross margin initiatives, which they have been working on for two plus years. Their core gross profit has been up for a number of quarters. We also had higher supplier incentives, which again is tied to the improved growth and the increase in purchases. ","The cost reductions that they made are actually, we\u2019re seeing improvement in their SG&A. But for us to move the needle, it takes some time. And again, showing through six months 20 basis point improvement is a nice job by that team. So we're going to expect that to continue as we move forward. But having said that, the guidance is really more of a factor in the lower comparable sales and the leverage issues that are in the other segments, not Industrial. ","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. That's helpful. So it sounds like the margins have held up pretty well in that segment? Is that the takeaway there? ","Carol Yancey","Yes they have.","Chris Bottiglieri","Very great, thank you very much for your time I appreciate it. ","Paul Donahue","Thank you Chris.","Carol Yancey","Thank you Chris.","Operator","We'll go next to Elizabeth Suzuki of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Elizabeth Lane","Hi guys.","Paul Donahue","Hi Elizabeth.","Elizabeth Lane","Good morning, can you just remind us what percentage of the Auto business is DIY versus to do-it-for-me? And I know you mentioned that DIY outperformed the commercial business, but just curious how much of the Auto business is currently being sold to DIY customers.","Paul Donahue","So it\u2019s good question Elizabeth. And it varies by country. But our U.S. NAPA business, our DIFM commercial business, which is our dominant part of our business, is 75 plus percent, which leaves our DIY business at 25% approximately of the overall. It's different in Australasia, where we have a more stronger retail presence. And Canada is very similar. Mexico is very similar as well. ","Elizabeth Lane","Great thanks that is really helpful and within the Auto segment, you mentioned that pricing was up about a 0.10%. And which product categories within that are showing the most strength? And which are under some pressure? And how would you expect pricing overall to trend going forward for the rest of the year? ","Carol Yancey","Well look we are coming off of five years of either deflation or no inflation in Automotive. So the fact that we ticked positive even though it was 10 basis points, we're encouraged to see that. As far as what we're estimating for the full year, it could be 0.5 point. I'm not sure it'll be a full point. But the categories we're probably seeing it in would be commodities. But again, we're not modeling for a significant uptick in that inflation between now and the end of the year. It's pretty modest, but it was encouraging to see a bit of improvement this quarter. ","Elizabeth Lane","Yes, definitely. And just one more quick one on Auto, is that if used vehicle pricing really starts to come under some significant pressure as supply goes up, do you think that, that would impact the auto aftermarket at all? I mean, does it make the consumer any more likely to scrap their older vehicle than fix it up? Or is the average consumer just not even really looking at that?","Paul Donahue","Well, Elizabeth I don't think that's going to be a significant factor for us going forward. I think the \u2013 everything I read, some of your peers that follow the dealer segment, it appears the used vehicle market is pretty strong right now. That's always a good thing for us. So we don't expect to see any significant shift going forward.","Elizabeth Lane","Alright great thank you.","Paul Donahue","You are welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. ","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Paul Donahue","Hi, good morning Seth.","Carol Yancey","Good morning.","Seth Basham","My questions would fit in the Auto business. If you could maybe fare it out for us a little bit the difference in growth trajectory for the wholesale business versus the company-owned stores on the do-it-for-me inside?","Paul Donahue","I am sorry Seth can you repeat that.","Seth Basham","The wholesale business independents relative to the strength to growth at the company-owned stores, specifically on the do-it-for-me side of the equation, if you can get to that level of granularity.","Paul Donahue","The total sales that we're reporting, we're talking about for the quarter only. Our comps were up 1% overall, and that's all of our business. So that's independents, that's company stores, that's inclusive of all of our stores. And as we saw \u2013 as I think I mentioned earlier, our trend throughout the quarter was very steady, and we were basically plus 4% across the way. DIY, I mentioned, was a bit stronger. But both, I think the other important takeaway, Seth, is that both DIFM and DIY improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter.","I am not sure I answered your questions, Seth, but\u2026","Seth Basham","Yeah, that\u2019s helpful but I was just wondering if the wholesale business grew any more or less than the company-owned stores business?","Carol Yancey","We would say that we had similar results in both the company-owned stores and the independent stores. And again, pointing to the sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2. So it would be similar. ","Seth Basham","Got it helpful. And then secondly, just in terms of what's happening with fleet and major accounts. Any more color on what you think the drivers are of that persistent weakness?","Paul Donahue","Yeah, I think look think our major account business, Seth, which is a significant part of our overall DIFM business, I think our business continues to track with our customers' business. I don't believe we're losing market share. Matter of fact, I would contend that perhaps we've gained a bit of market share overall. But I believe our numbers overall reflect their business. The fleet business, again, sequentially improved. And I would tell you also, in our major account business, we saw sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. ","We also saw sequential improvement in our fleet business quarter-over-quarter. The fleet business, Seth, I think that we're going to continue to see that improve. If I look across \u2013 I mean, you follow the Motion business and how strong our Industrial business is as a whole. Ultimately, and we've always said this, is that fleet tends to lag a bit behind the market. So we're still confident that we'll continue to see sequential improvement in the fleet business going forward. ","Seth Basham","Thank you very much.","Paul Donahue","You\u2019re welcome Seth.","Carol Yancey","Thanks Seth.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Sponheimer of Gabelli.","Brian Sponheimer","Hi good morning everyone.","Paul Donahue","Hi Brian.","Carol Yancey","Hi Brian.","Brian Sponheimer","Want to talk about Motion. You've handled the NAPA business very well. I was a little surprised, given the comp store increase, to see margins expand just to 10 bps. So can you talk a little bit about if there are any friction costs there that would lead to maybe a little bit less leverage than you would normally expect? ","Carol Yancey","I can\u2019t say it is any one thing, Brian. I think what \u2013 look with that group, they are being very cautious on when they're adding back expenses and the payroll that we took out, and we think about the facilities that we rationalized. And as businesses come back, they've had to weigh that in, in bringing back in some of those costs. Some of the gross margin improvements, and you know 50% of that business is with major accounts, national accounts, there continues to be a significant amount of competitive pricing pressures. ","In some of those contracts, you're under pricing agreements, and so you may not be able to pass through. There may be some kind of lag there. So I can't say it's anything in particular. I mean, sometimes, you get subtle changes between the quarters. But still, we like what we're seeing with the 20 basis points through six months. ","I mean, one thing to remember, too, is their core growth \u2013 I mean, the core growth is a function, it's lower than what the total number is. So you got some acquisition costs that are still weighing in there. The other thing I'll just mention, we've kept their inventory down through the six months. And with that, we're not ramping up the level of incentives as quickly as you might expect. So we're trying to work hard on focusing on the balance sheet as well.","Paul Donahue","Hey Brian, I would just add to Carol's comments. First off, thank you for the question on our Industrial business. It gives us an opportunity to brag a bit on our Motion team. We've been, in past quarters, a little bit cautious to go out and say we think that, that business is now coming back full speed. But what we're seeing and continue to see is very encouraging. ","When we look at products like industrial hose and pneumatics that were up double digits in the quarter industrial supplies, hydraulic hose, seals, accessories up high single digits in the quarter, it's very, very encouraging for us. And then you look across the various metrics, whether it be the PMI number in June, which was 57.8 or capacity utilization, industrial production, all with arrows going up. Rigs count, our rigs count was up 500 over a year ago, and it's our highest in two years. So a lot of things to be bullish on and optimistic when you look at our Industrial business.","Brian Sponheimer","And just, Carol, one on AP-to-inventory. Slight slowdown in the three months versus a year ago. If you're looking apples-to- apples kind of on a comp store basis, I guess how much of the deceleration would have been from the acquisitions as opposed to just maybe a little bit larger inventory growth than you're expecting?","Carol Yancey","The issues on the inventory, the comments on the inventory, I would say, and we mentioned that inventory was up 6% without acquisitions versus the 9%, and what you're speaking to is a little bit of change there. I would say certainly, a portion of it is acquisitions and a fair portion of it. And then the other increases are probably more coming from \u2013 on the Automotive side. And again, looking at \u2013 a lot of it is looking at our inventory analytics and some of our predictive modeling and all that. And so we're working hard to get that inventory down in Automotive, but some of that is coming from just the depth and breadth of inventory that you've got to have in really getting into your supply chain and all the data analytics. But acquisitions, probably half of it, and the other part is just probably coming from the Automotive side. ","Brian Sponheimer","Much appreciate, best of luck.","Paul Donahue","Yeah, thank Brian. ","Carol Yancey","Okay Brian.","Operator","We'll go next to Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot, good morning to you.","Paul Donahue","Good morning Matt.","Matthew Fassler","So a couple of questions. The first is on Automotive, and I guess it's sort of a big-picture backdrop question. As you think about the aging of the fleet and where the surge is and air pockets are, et cetera, what are the ages that you think, critical ages ranges that are most important for the different pieces of your business, most notably thinking about commercial and then thinking about DIY?","Paul Donahue","Yeah, so that number, Matt, kind of has shifted through the years, right. We have historically looked at that 6 to 12 year age group as the sweet spot for our DIFM business. And I don't think that has really moved at all. I still think that's the key age group for our DIFM business. As we look at our DIY business, I think that number continues to move out, so anywhere from 12 to 17 and 18. When you look at the average vehicle on the road today at 11.7 years and how well built and constructed cars are today, that number continues to move out, and we're seeing more and more older vehicles, 15-plus-year vehicles, at our stores and shopping in our DIY counter. So I don't think it's changed dramatically but probably a bit more on the DIY side.","Matthew Fassler","And just thinking about your perspective on when VIO trends may have started to weigh on this space because within that 6 to 12 year range, we obviously had this massive depth, and I would imagine that there's maybe a little more volatility, and the impact, maybe more of a bit of a cliff impact. Do you feel like this has been a headwind for a while or are we just seeing it now? Was there a headwind that was perhaps masked by cold weather a couple of years ago? What's your best sense as to when this may have churned and when do you think it might start to rebound in your favor again?","Paul Donahue","Yes, it's a great question, Matt, and I think it was masked. I think that when you go back a couple of years ago, when we were collectively, as an industry, pounding out strong mid to even high single-digit comps kind of quarter after quarter, I think it got masked. We had a couple of really harsh winters that probably drove a higher level of increase than what we attributed to weather. So I don't want to say they snuck up on it, but. certainly, I think last year and this year is having an impact. When we see that trailing off, we'll be really, as we get into back half of 2018 and 2019, we think it will be less of a factor than what it perhaps has been in the last couple of years.","Matthew Fassler","Appreciate it. And then I have very quick follow-ups on the financial front. I'll just ask them together. The first is just directional color on the gross margin assumption embedded in your guidance. It's still roughly flattish year-on-year. And then the second one, I believe that the operating cash flow and free cash flow guidance came down a little bit more than the implied net income guidance. And that's with, I think, a CapEx number that's slightly lower. So did you round it down to the nearest $50 million? Or is there some nuance related to working capital or something else that may have changed for the business? Thank you.","Carol Yancey","Yes, so on the cash flow question, we would say that was more of a working capital change. And we gave you a range, so that was kind of our best thinking at this time, and it would be working capital. And then as far as gross margin, I mean, look, we had a nice improvement through the six months. The quarter looks good. We were just under 30% last year, so we would hope to be right around 30%, which may give us a couple basis point improvement. So we should see it be a little bit better than the prior year.","Matthew Fassler","Great. Thank you so much. ","Paul Donahue","Thanks Matt.","Carol Yancey","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Bret Jordan of Jefferies.","David Kelly","Hey good morning It's David Kelly on for Bret. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick follow-up on your DIY e-tail comments earlier and thinking about your out-performance in the category. Are you seeing any change in the DIY pricing environment, either a strategy shift from any of the traditional peers out there or anything notable from e-tailers trying to enter the market?","Paul Donahue","No, it's been relatively the same, David. We're bullish on our retail business only because I think of the initiatives that we've put into play. And the initiatives, so the bar would settle fairly low for us. And when you look at what we focused on, the retail basics, it's store hours. It's having retail-focused personnel on the floor. It's having the right products on the counters. ","So, I mean, really just an attention to the retail basics. And as that store count that we've gone through, what we call our Retail Impact initiative, we'll have 500 stores now at the end of the year. We started that a couple of years back. It's been a slow ramp-up, but it's now beginning to be a fairly significant chunk of our overall stores. So those stores are impacting our business. And as I've said, we had a good month of June now with both basket and ticket size going up for the first time in a few quarters. So it's good. But I think largely, it's the initiatives that we've put into play.","David Kelly","Okay, great. Thanks Appreciate the color. And last one, a quick follow-up from me. We've long discussed and weighed in on some price inflation in Autos as well. Do you think that's skewed, just thinking out over the next 2 to 3 years, would that be skewed more towards commercial? Or could we also see some price inflation in DIY as well?","Paul Donahue","Well, I think if we see inflation, David, which we're not opposed to as a distributor, I think you'll see it play out on the DIFM side, but I think you'll also perhaps see a bit on DIY. DIY would most likely be more in the chemicals and oil, which we've seen some increases in. So I honestly think you will, and if, and that's a big if because we have not seen inflation, as Carol pointed out, in a number of years. But if we get a bit more, I think, primarily on the DIFM side, but I think some of that will leak over into the DIY as well","David Kelly","Alright great, thanks again.","Paul Donahue","Yes you\u2019re welcome. Thank you David.","Operator","We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hey guys, how are you doing?","Paul Donahue","Hey good.","Scot Ciccarelli","Great. Paul, I wanted to clarify some of your prior comments about the DIY outperforming commercial. Did that apply to the U.S.? Or was that on, just on a global basis?","Paul Donahue","That's U.S., Scot. When we get into specific segments of the business, DIY, DIFM, we are really pulling those numbers from our U.S. business. The comments I was making earlier about our global business is the mix, like the mix in Australia, DIFM to DIY, is significantly different than it is in the U.S. But when we talk specific DIY increase or DIFM increase, we're referencing U.S.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay. I just want to clarify because I think those two statements had blended into one another. So with that being said, obviously DIY performs better than commercial in the U.S. I know you talked about softer growth in fleet and major accounts. Obviously, that would act as a drag on the commercial business. But what is it that would impact, in your opinion, the commercial segment more than retail? Like if the drag is things like weather, the car park, et cetera, why wouldn't both segments be impacted about the same?","Paul Donahue","Yes. So I want to just repeat something I just said a few minutes ago to David. When we see an increase on our DIY business, as we did in the quarter, and saw a nice increase in June, I think that is more indicative of the initiatives that we've put into play, Scot, versus the overall DIY segment of the automotive aftermarket. I made that comment in a bit tongue in cheek. The bar was set fairly low for us on the retail side. So when we embark on improving the retail basics in our store, we're bound to get a bit of a lift, and that's what we're now seeing. And part of it is also due to our Retail Impact initiative that we embarked on a couple of years ago to upgrade a number of our stores.","Scot Ciccarelli","I got it. And yes, I've heard that commentary before. So you really think the reason DIY outperformed for you is the things you have done, not necessarily a change in the marketplace? Do you have any feel for a change in the marketplace? Do you think both segments performed about the same? Do you have any feel for that?","Paul Donahue","Absolutely. Hard to say, I'll be anxious to hear the other public companies when they report, Scot. But look, I think that on the DIFM side, again, if I go back to some of the comments I made earlier with consecutive mild winters, the step-down in that or as referenced, that air pocket and our sweet spot of vehicles, that's impacting, that\u2019s certainly is impacting the DIFM side. But again, I think it's transitory, and I think we'll begin to move away from that as we move into 2018 and beyond.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you. And just a housekeeping item. Was there anything else to note on the corporate expense? Was there a pension adjustment? I didn't hear that mentioned. Or is it just the labor and IT investments that were already highlighted?","Carol Yancey","Yes. there was no pension or non-recurring adjustments. What we would really point to is the investments that we're making, be it in our digital initiatives, which are global across all of our businesses, IT investments, which could be in warehouse management, productivity, inventory modeling to IT security, and then payroll and then legal and professional, which is somewhat related to acquisitions. ","So, and look, when you look at it, that's the majority of it. We gave you a little bit higher guidance in that area, but that's, we gave you a range. We hope to do better in there, but you certainly sometimes get non-recurring, onetime items in there but hopefully, we've covered that in our range.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay, thanks guys.","Paul Donahue","Alright Scot. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing or additional remarks.","Carol Yancey","We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. We appreciate your interest and support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to talking to you after our third quarter results. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation."]}}
