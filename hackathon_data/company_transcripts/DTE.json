Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Meador. Please go ahead, sir.","David E. Meador","Good morning, and thank you. And welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings call. Before we get started, as always, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.","Turning to Slide 3. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President of Finance; Dan Brudzynski, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Anastasia Minor, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me, if needed, during the Q&A session.","So let's start by turning to Slide 5. This slide describes how our business strategy has driven consistent earnings and dividend growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Gerry Anderson laid out at our May analyst meeting, our business strategy focuses on our system of priorities, and they allow us to achieve a consistent 5% to 6% earnings growth.","We have a highly engaged workforce with an ongoing focus on continuous improvement. And with those together, that enables us to continue to drive cost savings, which we have a strong track record of doing. Together, with a constructive regulatory environment, our utilities have consistently earned their authorized returns. These efforts allow us to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe are distinctive in the industry.","Our growth plans at both utilities are robust, with DTE Electric's growth driven by operational investments, mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. At DTE Gas, growth is driven by infrastructure investments and meter relocations. We also have meaningful low-risk growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses, and that provides both diversity in earnings and geography.","Maintaining our targeted 60% to 70% dividend payout and a strong BBB credit rating and focusing on our system priorities has lead to superior financial performance that we believe will be sustained over the long term.","Now if you turn to Slide 6. This is our earnings and dividend growth slide that we shared with you in the past, and I believe the story is a good one, with solid results from 2008 to present. In fact, we've exceeded our commitment of 5% to 6% earnings growth by delivering 7% annual growth from 2008 through our projected 2014 target. We're committed to the 5% -- 6% growth in the future and have achieved a plan that we believe will deliver these results.","As you know, we increased our dividend earlier this year from $2.48 to $2.62, and that's a 5.6% increase. And based on our $4.05 earnings per share midpoint for this year, that dividend level provides a 65% payout, which is in line with our target. As earnings continue to grow, we would expect to grow our dividend. And the most important point on this page for me is our overarching aspiration on the bottom, which is to earn $1 billion by 2017.","As we've described in the past, our 5% to 6% growth target is comprised of utility growth of 6% to 7% and non-utility growth of 15% to 20%. When you factor in dilution from modest equity issuances and contingency that we always plan for, we get back to our 5% to 6% overall growth target for DTE. In the next couple of slides, I'll take you through more details on that.","So turning to Slide 7. I want to cover the growth of the 2 utilities. Our electric utility will invest $6.4 billion over the next 5 years, while earning its authorized return of 10.5%. This capital is driven by mandated capital investments and ongoing transition of our generation portfolio. Additionally, our rate case deferral strategy and our ability to lower operating expenses both contribute to providing affordable services to our customers at both utilities.","At our gas utility, we expect to make just over $1 billion in new investments over the next 5 years. And like the electric utility, gas will earn its authorized return of 10.5%, while limiting additional rate increases to customers. This is enabled here by the new investment recovery mechanism, which will allow us to recover $400 million of investments.","And both utilities benefit from an improving Michigan economy, which I'll cover in a few moments.","Now turning to Slide 8. I want to cover the growth of the non-utility businesses, which comprise about 20% of our overall earnings. At our analyst meeting in May, we laid out in detail our growth story for these businesses, and we're on track to achieve those targets.","Gas Storage & Pipelines targets a 10% to 15% earnings growth over this period with a 10% to 12% return on invested capital. This business has 3 asset platforms with a number of expansion opportunities. The platforms include, first, the Storage and Vector platform. The second one is the Marcellus platform, which is comprised of the Millennium Pipeline and then the Bluestone Pipeline and Gathering system, and then the Utica platform, which is an emerging platform for us with the proposed NEXUS pipeline.","We have established solid partnerships with both pipeline and E&P players, and we manage our risk exposure through long-term contracts in this business. We're on track with our $1 billion to $1.3 billion targeted investment program for the segment over the next 5 years, and it's going to be significantly tied to the developments in the Marcellus platform. Our work here is progressing very well in the Marcellus Shale, and we're optimistic about our growth for the Bluestone Pipeline and Gathering system, where we see very positive developments.","When we talked about this in May, our previous commitment for the Bluestone investment was $500 million. The pipe and gathering system is a primary area of focus for us, and now we're increasing our capital investment in that area to $650 million. This gives us the confidence that we will reach $100 million in earnings for this segment by 2017.","The pace of the development in this region has exceeded our original expectation. And as we speak, we are in discussions with several parties that can bring even more investment opportunities, possibly a couple hundred million dollars beyond the $650 million, as we work to fill in the $20 million of white space for this segment, which will get us to $120 million of earnings by 2017. We will update you as developments unfold. And certainly, we'll provide more detail and a comprehensive update this fall at EEI.","Our Power & Industrial business targets approximately 20% earnings growth and a 10% to 15% return on invested capital. Power & Industrial consists of 3 main businesses: the industrial energy services, renewable energy and reduced emissions fuel. Each of these business lines has a focus to help us achieve our growth target. We capitalize on our strong position in industrial services to continue on that success in this business.","For our renewable business, we're going to complete construction that are in process right now, and we expect near-term earnings growth from both reduced emission fuel through incremental relocation and optimization of our existing facilities. And as a reminder, our goal here is to grow this business segment to $140 million in earnings by 2017.","Now turning to Slide 9. You can see Michigan's economy continues its turnaround story. Starting with the chart on the top left, Michigan auto production has doubled since the lows in 2009 and is projected to increase further this year as the auto industry returns to pre-recession sales levels. Moving to the right, you can see housing startups have increased significant, and unemployment trends continue in a very positive path. Michigan unemployment rates have significantly improved from the highs of 2009.","With these positive indicators of the Michigan economy, the state continues to achieve recognition on many fronts, and I've just listed a handful of these here. The National Association of Manufacturers identifies Michigan as leading the country in new manufacturing job creation. S&P rated Metro Detroit #5 in annual home price gains. Moody's upgraded Michigan's outlook to positive earlier this year. And we've talked about in the past, now that Michigan ranks #7 on the Tax Foundation's corporate income tax ranking from being one of the worst in the country to one of the best in the country now.","As the state continues its strong economic comeback, the city of Detroit is also working its way through its economic transition. We see positive signs there indicating the city is on the right track. Many of you are aware that the city has decided to exit the electric distribution business. That means 115 customers will transition to DTE within a year, and we will build out our distribution system for those customers, and that'll take us about a 5- to 7-year period to do that.","The streetlight system will not move to DTE. There's been a separate authority created, and they are designated to manage and finance the city's streetlights. And obviously, we'll help there where we can be helpful.","Regarding the financial condition of the city, it's really unfortunate how this whole bankruptcy is often characterized by the national press in the photos they use to represent Detroit. The greater Detroit metropolitan area is experiencing broad economic recovery. The city of Detroit also has very positive momentum in the downtown and midtown areas in terms of economic and real estate development and employment. As you know, the city's financial condition was built up over many years, and the business community in Detroit used the bankruptcy as the first up to a better and brighter future. We believe the bankruptcy will address the financial problems in both a meaningful and sustainable way, and we believe there will be no impact on DTE Energy.","As in the past, we will work with the governor, the mayor, the emergency financial manager to help in any way possible. And this includes the work that we've described and already committed to relative to the city's lighting and electric distribution system. The state and the greater Detroit regional economy are doing very well, and I'm confident that we will move quickly through the city's bankruptcy, and we'll come out stronger as both a city and a state.","Now turning to Slide 10. As you all know, the governor has appointed a new member to the Public Service Commission, Sally Talberg, who replaces Orji Isiogu, whose term expired on July 2. We would like to thank Orji for his years of service and support to the State of Michigan. As you know, we've developed and maintained a very constructive relationship with the commission, and we look forward to working with Commissioner Talberg as we continue to collaborate on providing Michigan with reliable and affordable utility services. A constructive regulatory environment is critical to our success. And we are fortunate that Michigan has been rated as one of the best regulatory environments in the country.","And now moving on to Slide 12 to get into an overview on the quarter. Our financial performance has been strong in 2013 with year-to-date operating earnings of $1.96 per share, which is an $0.18 increase over 2012. You'll hear more from Peter in a moment, but we're both very confident that we are on track to achieve our midpoint target of $4.05 per share.","The second quarter operating earnings were $0.62 per share compared to $0.87 last year. A good portion of this difference is due to weather that was much closer to normal this quarter compared to second quarter of last year. You may recall last year, we had one of the warmest on record, providing DTE Electric $21 million of favorability due to weather in the second quarter of 2012.","Peter will take you through this in more detail, but I wanted to set the context. We've talked about structural cost reduction as one of our major initiatives as a way to lower customer cost and also to stay out of rate cases as long as possible. We have a big one that's phasing in during the year, and it's related to retiree medical costs that we've restructured. At the same time, because that's already hardwired and it's going to be phased in, not only this year, but over the next 4 years, offsetting that is an explicit reinvestment program that we started in the second quarter of this year. Both of these are overlays to normal O&M performance and are tools for us to hit both our authorized returns in our guidance and to stay out of rate cases as long as possible. And Peter will explain some of those that are playing out this quarter and will also play out for the remainder of the year.","The balance sheet remains strong and generating approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations year to date. And with a strong credit rating from each of the rating agencies, we're on track to meet all of our goals for this year in terms of cash flow and our balance sheet.","With that background, I'll now turn it over to Peter, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'd like with Slide 13 and the second quarter earning results. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $0.62 per share. As a reminder, there's a reconciliation to the GAAP reported earnings included in the appendix.","The 2 utilities, DTE Electric contributed $0.51. DTE Gas came in at $0.05. The non-utility segments combined earned $0.14. The drivers for the non-utility second quarter results are Gas Storage & Pipelines at $0.09, Power & Industrial Projects at $0.06, and Energy Trading had a loss in the quarter of $0.01. Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.08.","Let's move on to Slide 14 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. For both our utilities, cooler weather in 2013 is the large driver of the year-over-year variances. DTE Electric contributed $38 million less year-over-year, and DTE Gas has an increase in earnings of $4 million. I'll cover more details on both DTE Electric and DTE Gas in a moment.","Our non-utility segments operating earnings in total are down $6 million, primarily driven by lower earnings at our Energy Trading segment.","In our Gas Storage & Pipelines segment for the quarter, earnings growth in our pipeline assets is offset by lower storage earnings. We expect the incremental pipeline growth to start flowing through the bottom line in the second half of the year as volumes increase on our Bluestone investment.","Power & Industrial earnings are slightly higher for the quarter, driven by growth in our waste wood renewable project earnings. The year-over-year, year-to-date growth in this segment is on track to achieve guidance levels, and we're comfortable with the guidance we have for the segment.","In Energy Trading, fewer market opportunities flow into the bottom line this quarter, driving lower earnings quarter-over-quarter. In the appendix, we have included our standard energy trading slides that show both economic and accounting performance.","Finally, our Corporate & Other segment came in favorable by $2 million from last year, primarily due to lower interest expense.","Before I move on to talk about the 2 utilities in more detail, one dynamic I want to discuss is some quarterly noise related with increased O&M spend and our benefit expense reduction efforts. Dave kind of set the table for that in his opening remarks.","Operations and maintenance expenditures are higher in the second quarter this year due to O&M reinvestment spending. This additional spending is funded through changes we made to our benefit plans, which will flow to the bottom line in the balance of the year. If you recall, in the first quarter call, we talked about structural changes we made to our retiree health care, moving to a Medicare delivery model. These changes came in 2 parts. The first was last year with our nonrepresented workforce and the second phase with our represented workforce, which occurred earlier this year.","Across both utilities, the total benefit decrease is approximately $60 million after tax this year. And it's in our revised guidance we have provided at our Analyst Day in May. About half of this decrease we're reinvesting back in the utilities this year. We will need the full amount next year to flow to the bottom line for both utilities as part of our stay out of rate case strategy. The benefit split is approximately $50 million with electric and $10 million for the gas, and the reinvestment total is approximately $30 million, split $18 million to $20 million for the electric and $7 million to $10 million for the gas.","Now with that as a backdrop, I'd like turn to Slide 15 as I walk you through some of the details. Now first with the quarterly details for DTE Electric. Operating earnings for DTE Electric are $89 million, down $38 million from the prior year. The largest driver of this reduction in earnings for 2012: abnormally hot weather that did not repeat in 2013.","The unfavorable weather of $23 million quarter-over-quarter can be broken down in 2 pieces. In 2012, favorable weather was $21 million added to a $2 million slightly unfavorable weather in the quarter this year. May was slightly hotter than normal this year, but we did not see much customer response in that month, and a relatively mild June more than offset May, resulting in a relatively temperature normal quarter.","Another dynamic in this quarter for the electric utility is the O&M reinvestment in the quarter and the timing of planned outage expenses. The reinvestment spend represents about $8 million of the $20 million of O&M increase in the quarter. The benefit plan changes I discussed earlier drives $12 million of favorability, and we have higher depreciation, property taxes and interest expense in 2013 driven by rate base growth.","Given the quarterly noise related to the benefits of O&M reinvestments, on Slide 16, I'm going to walk you from the 2012 full year earnings to the DTE Electric 2013 guidance midpoint. So when you combine the first and second quarter for the first half of the year, DTE Electric's earnings are down $19 million driven by return to normal weather, higher O&M offset by the lower benefit expense. For the remainder of the year, a return to normal weather is offset by a net year-over-year lower investment of $10 million.","And let me the break down that number. In the second half of 2012, if you recall, we invested $20 million of that year's abnormally hot weather, and our plans for 2103 second half is to reinvest approximately $10 million, which you can think about as an addition to the $10 million that we reinvested in the first half of this year. You can see on this chart the benefit expense improvement flowing through, along with the higher load and renewables growth in the second half this year.","Now the main message of this page is that the underlying earnings of the electric utility is very strong this year, and we're reinvesting incremental earnings back into the core assets of the business.","Before I leave the electric segment, just want to take a quick -- give a quick update on the electric sales front. Our electric business has experienced a 1.5% service territory temperature normal growth in the quarter with growth across all segments. The Industrial segment had the highest growth at 5% in the quarter. The load growth in the second quarter and the year to date is in line with our expectations and helps us affirm the 2% total growth for the year.","Now let's move on to the DTE Gas, starting on Slide 17. The second quarter earnings this year is higher by $4 million for 2012. I talked about the cooler weather negatively impacting the electric business in the quarter. This colder weather had a positive impact on our gas utility. Also impacting the quarter is the flow of last year's rate case settlement. Offsetting the weather and the rate order in the quarter-over-quarter earnings is the onetime revenue decoupling true-up that helped second quarter of last year. On this page, you can also see the lower benefit expense, which is the gas utilities portion of the structural plan changes I discussed earlier. Similar to the electric business, our plan is to reinvest a portion of this benefit expense reduction back in the core operations the second half of the year.","Now let me move to the total enterprise in the guidance for the year. Shown on Slide 18, we are on track to achieve our operating earnings guidance at all of our segments. Overall, utilities are on track to achieve their guidance for the year. And I've already talked about DTE Electric and how we're seeing strong earnings this year. At DTE Gas, as you can see on this page, the first half of the year was very strong, driven by favorable weather, higher weather normalized consumption and lower benefits. As I mentioned, we are also targeting O&M reinvestment in the second half of the year at our gas utility segment related to the benefit expense restructuring.","The quarterly profile for the remainder of the year for our gas utility group will be very different from last year, since last year, we were digging out of our first quarter weather hole with a lot of onetime actions and pullback to spend in the second half of the year. And this year, we will be stepping up our spending to reinvest a portion of this year's strong earnings. And this quarterly profile difference will show itself next quarter, where last year, our gas utility made a small profit driven by the onetime actions and spending pullback. And typically, we have a loss in the third quarter for our gas utility.","At our gas segment, we also will monitor for the remainder of the year weather and usage and either increase our reinvestment plans or flow those related earnings to the bottom line. In summary, our utilities are performing well, and we have the potential to earn above guidance midpoints for those segments.","As I mentioned earlier, our non-utility growth segments are on track to achieve their guidance for our Bluestone Pipeline and Gathering system ramp-up and the incremental earnings associated with our reduced emissions fuel business line flowing through the second half of the year.","Energy Trading's earnings will be back-end loaded this year, tied primarily to deliver gas and power in the fourth quarter. We are still comfortable with the current guidance for this segment.","Now that concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. I'd like to turn the discussion over to Dan Brudzynski, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures.","Daniel G. Brudzynski","Thanks, Peter, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 20 and our year-to-date cash flows. Cash from operations was slightly up for the year, supported by the positive early-year winter weather within the gas business and the timing of some of our corporate tax payments. These were slightly offset by declines in DTE Electric due to a return to relative normal weather for the quarter, as Peter mentioned earlier. Capital spending is comparable to last year, and I'll cover those details on the next slide.","Overall, net cash was slightly up halfway into the year, as Dave mentioned already. At this point in the year, we are maintaining our cash flow guidance with continued benefit plan contributions planned for the second half of the year and to gauge where the summer demand plays out over the next couple of months. But we'll give an update later this year on cash flow guidance.","Moving on to Slide 21 and a look at the our first half capital spending. Electric utility spending was similar in 2013 to 2012 with lower nuclear fuel -- refuel spending in 2013, partially offset by increased renewable investments in our Echo Wind project. Gas was similar year to date, while our non-utility investments are up due to the completion of the Bluestone Pipeline and the buildout of the gathering system in the Marcellus region surrounding Bluestone, as Dave also mentioned earlier.","Finishing up on Slide 22. Our balance sheet remains strong with leverage and FFO metrics in line with our targets. $175 million of our $300 million equity target has been issued year to date into our benefit and thrift plans. And we continue to have sufficient liquidity midway into the year.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for some concluding comments.","David E. Meador","Thanks, Dan. Let me wrap up on Slide 24. As we've laid out, we have a very strong start to the year, and we're confident that we're going to reach our 2013 guidance. Now Peter laid out some of the nuances here as we experienced the structural cost change in our reinvestment plan, and certainly if you have more questions about that in the Q&A session, we'll help you through that.","Going forward, as we've laid out in the past, laid out again this morning, if you look at our mandated investments and the low-risk non-utility growth opportunities in front of us, we are also confident about our 5% to 6% annual earnings growth and then the dividend growth over time. And the balance sheet, as Dan laid out, also remained strong, and we're happy with where we are there. So all in all, my mid-year report, we're very much on track and confident that we'll hit our year-end objectives.","And with that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Cole from Credit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess the first question on the Detroit bankruptcy. What is the timeline and path to resolution? And are there any key issues or headlines, real or not, that can weigh on the DTE story?","David E. Meador","First of all, in terms of timeline, what the emergency financial manager had laid out was a general timeline of filing -- initial filing as they did this last week. There's already a series of hearings that have started. The federal judge has already been appointed, and they started hearings already this week on a variety of technical issues. Their goal is to have the restructuring plan presented to the judge this fall, I believe in October, and then to have this wrapped up in the spring. And that's the overall timeframe. In terms to -- of issues and impact on DTE there, we anticipate no impact on us. So there's no milestones or anything to look for in terms of that. On the positive side, as we mentioned the one thing that we have already started working on, because of the city exiting the electric business, is we are already starting to work on the process to take on the customers that the city previously had laid out. We have some regulatory filings we've made with the Public Service Commission because this is going to be about a $300 million investment program for us over a 5- to 7-year period. But again, that's all on track and underway already, and I don't anticipate any issues there either.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And there are no IOUs from the city to DTE?","David E. Meador","We have normal receivables that we have. And they have been paying timely, and we expect that to continue to be paid on a timely basis. The Chapter 9 is different than an 11. So in 11, you have to go to the judge for first-day orders to decide what bills are going to be paid. In a Chapter 9, the emergency manager makes that decision. He does not go to the judge. And we have every indication that we believe that we're going to continue to be paid.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then lastly, Dave, in your scripted remarks, did you make a comment about increasing the Bluestone CapEx by $150 million? Did I catch that right?","David E. Meador","Yes, yes, I did. As we've laid out for that segment, we -- when we talked in May, we have $1 billion to $1.3 billion of the total investment that we'll be making over many years in that segment of midstream. On Bluestone specifically, this started out a much smaller project. At one time, we were talking $200 million to $300 million. By the time we got to the analyst meeting in May, it was $500 million. Right now, with additional work that we're taking on in the gathering system for Southwestern, it's $650 million. And hopefully, by the next time I talk publicly about this, which would be in September, it's going to be a higher number than that also.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What will be the timeline of that CapEx being deployed? Would it be towards like the '16, '17 timeframe?","David E. Meador","No. I think this is playing out generally the way we thought. So again, in May, what we laid out for you for this segment was -- so we said by 2017, we want to be $120 million of earnings. We had $20 million of white space. And so what we feel right now, based on what we have underway, that gives us confidence in the $100 million, and now the team is working on incremental investments to start filling in the white space that will get you to $120 million.","Peter B. Oleksiak","I think, Kevin, this is Peter, one way to think about it, we're actually -- as they're drilling the wells, we're putting the gathering in. So that will be pretty good pace over the next few years for that spend.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So this $150 million CapEx is upside to the Marcellus, to the blue or purple bar in your guidance, and so this is help filling up the white space?","Peter B. Oleksiak","That actually helps firm up that $100 million. If you remember on the Analyst Day, we were talking about how we're confident on the $85 million. We had this $100 million level with good line of sight on. It really helps firm the $100 million.","David E. Meador","And the team now is working on the remaining white space. So hopefully, when we see you in this fall, we'll report back to you that there's incremental investments over the $650 million, which will then give us certainly more confidence as we march towards our goal of $120 million by 2017.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Weisel from Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","First question is on Slide 16, when you showed the walk for DTE Electric. It looks like this return to normal weather is -- for the second half does not embed the upside from a hot July. Should we think of that as leading to maybe upside to the guidance or would any benefit from that heat be reinvested maybe after the summer is over?","Peter B. Oleksiak","That is something, Andrew, that we'll -- and I gave a range on the second half reinvestment. We're going to be monitoring the weather and storm activity. Now July, now today, it's in the 60s and maybe 70s. So we're seeing how much we kind of give back in July here in the state of Michigan given the back half of the month. And we did have a catastrophic storm in the month as well. Probably the main point there is we're going to be monitoring and adjusting that reinvestment plan based on weather and storm activity.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, fair enough. And then along those lines, there was a lot of reinvestment in the second quarter, obviously, ahead of this summer, which was usually most important. Can you maybe just walk through the strategy of the timing as to why you did that more earlier in the year as opposed to waiting to see when most of the 3Q is in the books?","David E. Meador","That's actually a great question. So as you know, weather variability in the electric business plays out predominantly in July and August. If you look at the number of cooling degree days normally in those months, our normal pattern would be to wait until the summer played out before -- even if I thought I saw some favorability before I would trigger reinvestment program. And the reason we did it is because of the remeasurement on the benefit programs. So that remeasurement there was -- Peter mentioned the salary plan we measured at the end of last year, the represented plan at the end of March. And those numbers are hardwired now. So we saw this favorability coming through our forecast relative to retiree medical. And based on that, and a good start with the gas business and other factors, we started to early on start the reinvestment program even though we had not been through the summer. So we staged our reinvestment program in multiple stages because my #1 goal is to always hit my authorized return. Now I didn't want to reinvest too early and then find ourselves short at the end of the year. But a lot of it had to do with the confidence of the way the accounting works for this retiree medical, which is not only going to come in this year, but it's going to play out over the next several years.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Great. Next question is you mentioned, I think, that in the second quarter, industrial was up 5%, weather normalized load growth in 1.5% total. Can you maybe talk about residential and commercial, how those looked? And then also, you said 2% for the year. Any thoughts on the weather-adjusted load growth in '14 and longer term?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes. For the quarter the residential, actually, was up 2%. And the commercial was 1%. Industrial, as I mentioned, was 5%. So all in, around 2% for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we are at about 1%, and we -- actually, the industrial growth will continue on. We had some larger projects here in the service territory that will play out. So we're comfortable still with the 2% for this year. In the longer term, I think we've indicated approximately 1% growth that we're anticipating.","David E. Meador","And that's after energy.","Peter B. Oleksiak","After energy efficiency.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Sounds great. And then my last question is for PIP. You talked a little bit about the near-term earnings pickup from REF and Renewables, and the first half results are a little below half for the full year guidance. Can you maybe just talk about some of the drivers that will lead to that acceleration in the second half?","David E. Meador","We described that we have multiple business lines there. So one of the business lines is Renewable business line, which are the plants that were coal plants being converted to wood. And one of those plants was already online, but it's capacity factor actually raises during the year. And then we have another plant that's coming online. And that's why the earnings profile for that business line is back-end loaded. And then as we've talked about with REF, we're trying to optimize the 9 machines. And we have some relocations that are going to actually trigger in, and that gives us higher tons produced. And again, that's back end loaded for 2013, and that's going to drive the earnings there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question. I was just curious on just revisiting the pipeline segment. You said that the extra $150 million of spend you disclosed today would help to firm up the $100 million '17 earnings target. Do you need more of the other -- the incremental stuff to further firm that up or are we -- are you kind of already now into filling the white space?","David E. Meador","We are in negotiation right now with a handful of producers in the area that I believe will lead to more gathering work in that region. We also are -- because of what we're seeing play out there, I think the pipe itself -- so we have the Bluestone pipe and then the gathering system, that pipe is going to fill up quicker than I think we thought too. So as this all plays out, I think what you're going to see is as we periodically update you, the Bluestone Pipeline and Gathering system is going to generate more earnings power. And that will basically fill up that white space. And so what we're going to do will be out publicly in September. And then we'll see you at EEI. We'll just give you updates on where we think we are on the remaining $20 million for 2017. The good news for this segment is that's a long time away and we already have line of sight here in terms of our investment profile that's going to get us to that target.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But to be more specific, next time you say announce another $100 million of spend, will that start to narrow the gap or will that still be firming up?","David E. Meador","That will narrow the gap. That will narrow the gap to $120 million.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just maybe a silly one, but on Slide 18, we have a guidance which didn't change the ranges but you have these kind of green arrows on the 2 utilities segments. I know you've used those in the past to imply guidance change, but is that -- should we take from that you feel high end or there's an output bias? Or what are those arrows implying?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes. Those arrows -- and I did mention in the prepared remarks that we believe right now that both of them are on track to achieve above the midpoint. And actually, with this benefit increase, they would be above and probably above the guidance. We are in the process of reinvesting really to kind of bring them back to the guidance level. And I think the one in particular I did call out was the DTE Gas. And you can see the strong year to date. There is, between weather, actually some increased usage in consumption that's non-weather related. We're in a period now where we have a suspension of our decoupling mechanism. It's kind of methodology of rate making process that will flow to the bottom line. So that one, that segment in particular, I'm feeling there's a potential that we're going to be increasing, at least hitting more of the upper end of that guidance range.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And you're at above the midpoint on electric is the implication then, I guess?","David E. Meador","Yes, yes. And basically what you're seeing play out here, as we've mentioned, this benefit amortization is fixed. And the bias is that you're seeing upward pressure there, and that's going to be offset with our reinvestment program, which is going to be phased in over the remainder of the year. And then the other variable is weather and how weather plays out for the remainder.","Peter B. Oleksiak","So it's something, Jonathan, we'll get through the summer here. My sense, in the third quarter call, we'll give you an update where we feel the year is coming in at.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then finally on the -- are you still feeling -- I just couldn't remember what you said about timing for sighting of these 2 remaining REF, reduced emission fuel units. Is that a year-end-type of -- by year-end objective?","Peter B. Oleksiak","For there, as you know, it involves the timing as well as the volume, and right now, it does look like it could be year end. It could go into next year, first half of next year as well. We did put in the appendix kind of the earnings profile for that, for the REF. We're still very comfortable with that earnings profile.","David E. Meador","And also comfortable for that segment on what we've already given you for '13 and '14.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just the '13, $50 million sort of implying not much benefit from the second to the last 2 units, because they would be either very late in the year or early next?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes. For this year, there'll be minimal contribution this year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So perhaps following up on Kevin's question on incremental CapEx here, I'd be curious, just from the perspective of the power and lighting opportunity you alluded to earlier, just the timing of that, how that meshes with your CapEx budget, if you could kind of walk through that a little bit more?","David E. Meador","You're asking about the city of Detroit public lighting of $300 million?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Indeed.","David E. Meador","One way to put this in perspective, our total CapEx is $2 billion a year. It's what we've laid out for the next 5 years. The electric utility is $1.5 billion per year every year. And this is $300 million over a 5- to 7-year period. So it's not that significant in the big scheme of things, not only in terms of our total CapEx over that period, which is for the electric utility is $6 billion. And it also is a minimal impact when you think about it from a customer standpoint in terms of rates. So as light goes, it sounds like a big number. But when you stand back and look at a 5- to 7-year period, it's pretty small.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then perhaps just going back to the midstream side of the equation, I mean, I know you alluded to providing updates later this year. But as it goes to Utica, I'd be curious how developments are shaping up and particularly on the dry gas. I suppose that has been more of a longer-dated development opportunity, but curious how it's been shaping up for you guys. Is it quite as strong as Marcellus?","David E. Meador","I don't think there's any significant new news right now. As you know, on the NEXUS pipeline that's been proposed. The in-service date, as we saw it, was 2016. And in the meantime, for all of us, everyone is monitoring what's happening in the Utica development. I would just say right now for us, the focus is really shifted to Susquehanna County within Pennsylvania because there's so much going on there and so much prolific drilling going on that the opportunity set is right now there in the next 3 to 5 years. That said, the project, the NEXUS project continues on its path. But the one thing that everyone continues to watch, which is the big variable, is what you mentioned, which is how does the dry gas production play out over time? And there's really not any new information on that right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon from the ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A follow-up question on the REF conversation. I'm just curious, as you look at the 2 machines that you're looking to place and as you think about optimization opportunities for the existing machines, are those potential counterparties more merchant power generators, whole merchant power generators or regulated utilities that own whole assets? And are you seeing the appetite for the types of cost savings that you generate through the REF business increase, decrease or stay about the same given how much distress some of these merchant power generators are under, and how they might be more intrigued by the opportunity to save a little money in their overheads?","David E. Meador","It's actually -- when we talk to counterparties, it's all of the above. So the people that we've talked to are pure merchants. There are utilities that -- they have deregulated, coal plants, but there's as much interest with utilities that are fully regulated with a pass-through. And the reason that they're interested is people are really trying to hit their environmental objectives. And the key thing that REF does, it takes out 40% of the mercury upfront and it gives people a much better shot at consistently hitting a 90% mercury reduction and it comes at a negative cost. I mean, in some ways, it doesn't get any better. So even if you're a regulated utility, and we have this at some of our plants, to be able to take out 40% of the mercury and then have basically a cost reduction that flows through to your customers is good. And the conversations that we're having is more about trying to get these at the largest plants possible, but also the plants that have the right boiler configuration because this has to work in line with everything else that's working and we want -- ideally, we want these at very large plants that will run for 9 years because that's how long this tax credit goes out. I could relocate them if we have to, but that's not desirable. So much of the conversations tend to be with the engineers doing their test burns to make sure this is really going to work, not only today, but it's going to work over many, many years and not impact their boiler in any way.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Last question for me on the Power & Industrial business. You guys have indicated you're extremely pleased with the financial and operating performance of the recent transaction where you acquired assets from Duke. Are there more portfolios like that out there that you could attempt to replicate that outcome given the economic environment for power generators? Is that a more robust opportunity set now than it was 6 months ago, less, the same? And if you were able to achieve something of that sort of size and scale, would it allow you to sort of exceed your current aspirations for growth in the business?","David E. Meador","Well, right now, what we laid out at the analyst meeting is our aspiration is to grow that business to $140 million. That business also had white space. So over the next several years, that group has growth embedded in what they're already doing. So as Renewable Energy plants come online, as REF gets relocated, some of their growth will play out. And then there was remaining white space. And the remaining white space, their primary area of focus is exactly what you bring up. We were already in the energy services business. And we, for example, own and operate the energy center at the Detroit Metro Airport. We own and operate the energy center at GM's headquarters. With the Duke acquisition and those projects that came online, we're one of the larger players in that space nationally. And we believe that we not only have the skills and confidence and track record, but there is some scale benefit here. So we -- it's an area of focus that we're spending a lot of time on right now as they work to fill in that white space.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Are there more eager sellers now than there were 6 months ago, given that some of them might own portfolios of merchant power assets that -- and need -- they need capital?","David E. Meador","I would just say that we have more discussions. I don't know how eager they are, but they are -- we are in more discussions with more potential parties around assets that we could acquire than we were 6 months ago, certainly more than a year ago.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shar Pourreza from Citi.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In your operating earnings aspiration of $1 billion, can you just remind us after energy efficiency what kind of load that you are assuming for that time period, on the electric side?","Peter B. Oleksiak","We are assuming a 1% load increase.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","After energy efficiency?","Peter B. Oleksiak","After energy efficiency.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And for the electric utility, can you just remind us what the lag, if any, there is and how long you anticipate staying out of a rate case?","Peter B. Oleksiak","We are targeting right now to kind of coincide, we have a securitization with our nuclear plant kind of dropping off in '15, new rates coming in there, which would mean a mid-2014 filing, with a rate increase in early '15.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then just lastly would the -- with Bluestone ramping up, is there -- is an MLP drop-down still not in the near-term strategic focus?","David E. Meador","I would describe it as not in the near term. Certainly, as we said, it's something that we will continue to evaluate. But we have so much time and energy right now focused on the investment opportunities. And not having an MLP, as we said, is not inhibiting us in any way from finding and executing on a lot of this growth. So we're more focused on finding the investment opportunities and executing on them right now.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Thank you for your commentary on the O&M timing. That was very useful. I just had an unrelated question on -- if there's any update on the discussion in Michigan about reopening the energy legislation?","David E. Meador","In terms of the energy policy area right now, as you know, there was a series of hearings and fact-finding that the commission conducted, and we expect them to submit their report to the governor later on this fall. And beyond that, there's not much else that's happened or going on right now as in Michigan. I think there's just other areas of focus that the administration is working on. Longer term, we do expect that what we eventually are going to hear, there's going to be some interest in expanded Renewable Energy program beyond the 10%, but that's not until after 2015. There seems to be a lot of energy and focus around continuing the energy efficiency program in Michigan. And in terms of dealing with the issue around choice, I think there is actually growing sentiment that having this bifurcated market, where you have 10% of the market at choice, which really represents about 1% of the customers. It probably doesn't make sense. And if this thing doesn't stay where it is, there seems to be more energy around taking that down, not up. But again, I would just say it's not an area of key focus and discussion right now. There's not a lot of noise about it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kit Konolige from BGC Financial.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","On Peter's discussion of the benefit savings, can you just go through again it's -- I have that it's $60 million after tax in '13 and half of that goes to O&M and then the full amount in '14. Do I have that correct?","Peter B. Oleksiak","That is correct. And there is a bit of a bump around $10 million for '14. As mentioned, that the union plan, we've got a remeasurement at the end of the first quarter. So we'll take up another quarter of that next year.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right. And so your discussion was that the full amount of -- none of that would be used for reinvestment in '14, but would all go to the bottom line to support the projected earnings growth?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes, to support the earnings growth and the rate base growth for both utilities.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right. And are there other benefit reduction opportunities out there?","David E. Meador","Not as large as this one. I mean, we're continuing to work on this. And we also are teeing up other, what I would describe as, structural cost opportunities that we want to work on because when we stand back and do our planning, our goal is to hit our authorized return, grow 5% to 6%. But we're also looking at the amount of capital that we're going to have to continue to spend, and then modeling rates, to say how do I keep rate increases over time as low as possible? And the way for us to make that all work over time is to continue to work on costs on 2 fronts: One is the continuous improvement work that we continue to do, but also to look for structural cost changes. And we have several of those that we're working on that we hope to be able to act on over the next several years that will allow us, even when we have to file rate cases, and we'll eventually have to start filing rate cases to make sure they are as small as possible.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to touch basically briefly, I'm sorry if I missed this, the industrial -- the Power & Industrial. There was a write-off, I think, and I'm sorry, I missed, what caused that?","David E. Meador","We had a plant that was in Michigan. It was a plant that had been converted from a coal plant to a gas plant to service General Motors' complex basically, that through the restructuring, one of the things that happened when they went bankrupt, they closed that complex and they -- the plant basically had a dedicated customer. And we worked for a couple of years to try to retool the plant. We just -- including moving it to a biomass. And then we just couldn't make it work in terms of the economics. So that plant will now close, and it was written off.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And I think there was a gain last year. I don't know if it was in Power & Industrial, but do you know what that was? I mean, I just noticed in the income statement that there was -- that you guys did have some sort of asset improvement, I think. I can follow up afterwards if you...","David E. Meador","Yes, we'll have to follow up afterwards to make sure we have that at our fingertips.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I just want to -- then the tax rate, it seems like it's been declining. And is that -- could you just elaborate as to what's causing that and sort of what the outlook again is for 2013?","David E. Meador","Probably the one thing that's flowing through there is just tax credits, including the wind tax credits that are coming through there at the income statement. But Peter, do you want to...","Peter B. Oleksiak","I think the wind and there are some -- for the REF, the tax credits that basically flow to us.","David E. Meador","Flow to us, that we're not -- in some cases, we're selling partnership interest to, because I, we're not going to take all the credits. But there's some REF credits that we're taking and then the wind credits from the electric business.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, and -- that makes sense. And then just following up on the question that Kit was asking, the O&M benefit that's associated with benefit reductions, that's -- again, is that associated with retirement benefits and the sort of NPV of the reduction of that? Is that what that is?","David E. Meador","What happened is we changed our delivery method on retiree benefits for retirees over a certain age. And they basically are getting their benefits through a Medicare exchange now. And when you have a significant change like that, the accounting rules trigger remeasurement. So we had a remeasurement, and you remeasure your liability. So we remeasured our salary liability at the end of the year and the represented liability at the end of March. And then the way the accounting works is you take that NPV benefit and you amortize it back in to your income statement over a 4-year period.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andy Levi from Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Basically all said. The only thing is in 2017, you said $1 billion in net income, right, if I heard correctly?","David E. Meador","Right.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So wouldn't that imply more of a 7-plus percent CAGR off of your '13 number, not the 5% to 6%?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes. And there is -- actually, there is a slide we actually included in our Analyst Day that describes this. Our philosophy here, we do our planning process. If you kind of have all your bottoms-up equal to your aspiration, it doesn't really give you a lot of cushion. So actually, we do put into our overall forward projections a contingency. And a lot of that is just to give more certainty to our investors around that 5% to 6% earnings growth.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue. I would now like to turn it back over to our speakers for any final or closing remarks.","David E. Meador","I just want to thank everyone for joining us again this morning, and hope you all have a great summer, and we look forward to seeing you in the fall.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Anastasia Minor. Please go ahead.","Anastasia Minor","Thank you, Dana and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we get started, I would like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on page two including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes reference to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation.","With us this morning is Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President and CFO; Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller, and Mark Rolling, our Vice President and Treasurer. We also have members of our management team with us to call on during the Q&A session.","I would like to turn it over to Peter to start our call this morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks Anastasia and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Hope everyone is enjoying the start of the spring season; this is definitely my favorite time of year. Like how the weather is gradually getting warmer, especially after going through another cold winter, but as many of you know the real reason I like this time of year is that it brings an another baseball season for my Detroit Tigers.","As on year end call, I\u2019ll provide an update and excited to report that the Tigers are starting out the season with one of the better records in baseball. We just came off a pretty tough series with the New York Yankees, so hats-off to the Yankees. There is a saying in baseball that you can\u2019t win the pennant in April but you can lose it April. The Tigers have set themselves up nicely the first month of this season. Sitting here in the middle of Hockeytown; I also have to mention that Detroit Red Wings and the 24th consecutive playoff appearance. We are hoping for a deep run in the playoffs.","Now, I\u2019d like to transition from taking about the hot sports teams in Detroit to DTE. Let me start first by saying that DTE\u2019s positioned, certainly positioned to have a good year as well. Jeff and Mark will be going through first quarter results in more detail but I\u2019ll just say that we had a very successful quarter and on track to achieve our earnings and balance sheet targets in 2015. Before we move to quarter results, I would like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlight of what\u2019s happening at DTE and in Michigan.","We can move on slide five. This slide provides an overview of our business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans for the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our electric utility growth is driven by environmental spend in the near-term and renewal of our generation fleet in the longer term, which will be the natural replacement of our aging coal fleet.","Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investment and the main line pipe replacement. Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses, which provide diversity in earnings and geography. Our two utilities are deploying capital in very constructive regulatory environment. And we\u2019re working hard to earn this constructive environment every day. Our efforts begin with the highly engaged workforce. We found out last week that we won the Gallup Great Workpace Award. We\u2019re the only utility to win that award and actually won it three years in a row.","We also have a continued focus on continuous improvement. The combination of these two, employee engagement and continuous improvement enables us to continue our cost savings track record and utilities\u2019 ability to consistently earn their authorized returns.","We also continue to focus on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe are distinctive in our industry. We have certainly seen positive results on this front as currently DTE Gas is ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for residential and business customer satisfaction. Our dividend continues to grow as we grow earnings and our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for a consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.","Slide six: You can see some highlights of progress in 2015. Let me start first with Michigan\u2019s energy policy. This is a major area of focus this year and I know that the people on this call are very interested in its status update. I feel there is positive momentum for constructive legislation. We expect this to occur by the end of the year and quite possibly by mid-year. This is the priority of the Governor and he called up publicly the need to get legislation done this year. The House lead, Aric Nesbitt has introduced legislation and the Senate lead, Mike Nofs is about too. The process is in slow motion. I\u2019ll touch more an Energy Policy in a few minutes.","Quick update on the various rate filings for our two utilities. We expect a rate order for our electric cost of service filing by June. This filing will deliver refined cost of service rates to our customers and our business customers will see sizable rate reductions. The rate case process is ongoing for electric general rate case filing that we put in December last year. This is the first rate case we have filed in four years and it\u2019s predominantly a recovery of the $3 billion of capital investment deployed since our last filing.","We expect to supplement rates in early July and receive a final order by the end of the year. For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for our expanded infrastructure recovery mechanism application that if approved will allow us to double the annual miles of our main line replacement program.","As you know, DTE Electric completed the acquisition of 700-megawatt gas-fired peaking plant earlier this year. We also received a result of our recent RFP for upto 350 megawatts of additional peaking generation are currently in late stage negotiations. We look to announce the transaction next month and close this transaction later this year.","With this purchase, full service customers\u2019 capacity requirements will be covered during the summer timeframe. We felt it was very important to secure Michigan space generation for our full service customers, given the projected capacity shortfall in the state of Michigan next summer.","On the no-utility front, we\u2019re definitely moving on all cylinders; the progress on a number of projects and our gas storage and pipeline business, we\u2019re working to the details of successful open season for the Millennium Pipeline. We\u2019ve talked about this potential expansion, given the needs of the East Coast LDCs and the critical role the Millennium Pipeline plays in delivering Marcellus gas to market. This is another major milestone for gas pipeline business and helps firm up future year growth.","Let\u2019s share the details of the expansion, once we\u2019re through finalizing commercial terms of the contracts. For our NEXUS Pipeline, we have enough commitments and additional prospects to move forward with a 1.5 BCF pipe. Currently, we\u2019re progressing through the pre-filing process quite nicely. Most recent activity is around finalizing rightaways and the final path for the pipe.","Our goal is to follow the FERC application early fourth quarter this year. We also expect the fourth quarter and service date for both the NEXUS Pipeline as well as the Millennium expansion, I touched on earlier.","In our power and industrial segment, we have a number of projects moving along including an 8-megawatt on-site cogeneration project that went into service this quarter. For our REF business, we\u2019ve signed a contract to operate a third party REF facility that begins operations in the second quarter of this year. This operating agreement will run through 2020 and has already been included in the guidance we provided. Regarding REF locations, we\u2019re continuing to work on the relocation of our ninth unit and expect this later this year as well as potential optimization opportunities with our other units.","We are off to a strong start across our portfolio of businesses and we\u2019re optimistic on having another successful year in 2015. Let me now move to update the Michigan economy and the updates of energy policy legislation.","On the road we get asked quite a bit on how the economy is progressing in Michigan and with the city of Detroit; on slide seven is a positive commercial update for both. We continue to see economic momentum in our state. Michigan\u2019s unemployment rate in March was 5.6% which is the lowest since September 2001. Year-over-year, Michigan\u2019s unemployment rate has dropped to full 2 percentage points. This is the second largest improvement in the country.","We continue to see improvement in other economic indicators including increases in residential customer and business customer accounts and our forecasts show this trend continuing. You can see on the page that Michigan is showing growth by moving up 8 spots in the state ranking of Real Gross Domestic Product. Michigan now is in the upper 50% of all states in terms of growth.","Also want to highlight the city of Detroit\u2019s economic rebirth. I believe the city has come a long way since the bankruptcy filing on many fronts. One indicator that we show on this slide is a Detroit metro area ranking number eight in the U.S. for a number of new expansion projects. The city\u2019s rebirth is largely due to the strong leadership we have in this city. Detroit Mayor, Mike Duggan is very focused on the financial and operational strength of the city. DTE as well as other city partners are working with them to help continue this momentum.","Moving on to slide eight, I am now going to turn to an update on energy policy. As I mentioned earlier, Governor Snyder has made it clear that energy policy is important legislative priority for him this year. He called off the need for new legislation in a state of the state address and provided more detail goals in his energy message in March, highlighting this significant transformation and the generation sources that our state will undertake over the next 10 to 15 years.","Michigan also has strong leadership in both the House and the Senate and Energy Policy; Representative, Aric Nesbitt, Chair of the House Energy Policy Committee. We\u2019re confident that he thoroughly understands the future energy policy needs of our state. Representative Nesbitt introduced legislation in March that\u2019s consistent with the Governor\u2019s goals of the liability and adaptability. He also recommended the elimination of the broken retail access program we have here in Michigan which we support.","Senator, Mike Nofs, Chair of the Energy and Technology Committee and is very seasoned when it comes to Energy Policy. He is one of the principal architects of the Michigan\u2019s 2008 energy legislation as a Member of the House back then. He will be introducing legislation shortly and in recent interviews has indicated that he will include design changes to the retail access program to make it more fair, and will also contain a longer-term generation integrated resource planning process, which will give us upfront review and approval of our coal plant retirement and replacement. We expect legislation to be completed this year and are confident that Michigan has the strong leaders in place that understand energy and utility dynamics and will provide this year constructive legislation for Michigan\u2019s future.","In a minute I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff and Mark to review the quarter results, before that I just want to highlight that we\u2019re on track to achieve our earnings guidance. So on slide nine, this slide shows our EPS history and our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings. The chart shows our current 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.60 with the next page showing our earnings guidance by segment.","So, you can see on slide 10 that we are holding our EPS guidance range of $4.48 to $4.72 for 2015. This slide shows 2015 year-to-date actuals compared to the full year guidance. Just like last year, weather favorability helped provide a strong quarter for utilities, particularly on the gas side as we again hit one of the coldest winters on record. Our non-utilities also had a strong first quarter. Jeff will take you through the details of our quarter results shortly.","Like last year, we will reserve this first quarter favorability as contingency for summer weather variability. The bottom-line, there are no changes in guidance at this time, but we\u2019re off to a strong start.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller to provide more details on the first quarter results.","Jeff Jewell","Thanks, Peter and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s turn to slide 12 to review the quarterly earnings performance.","For the quarter, DTE Energy\u2019s operating earnings were $1.65 per share and for reference our reported earnings were $1.53 per share. You can find a reconciliation of the first quarter reported to operating earnings on slide 24.","As you know, Michigan and the rest of the Northeast in the first quarter of both 2014 and 2015 experienced significantly below normal temperatures including setting a couple of records. For us, the majority of the weather fluctuations can be seen in our gas segment. Here are couple of data points. The first quarter of 2014 set the record for the coldest quarter in over 60 years. The first quarter of 2015 was the third coldest and February itself set the record for that month.","Now for the quarter-over-quarter results, our growth segments first quarter operating earnings in 2015 were lower by $10 million or $0.06 per share. Electric segment was equal to the first quarter of 2014. This was primarily due to fewer storms year-over-year which drove lower operating and maintenance expenses offset by increased rate base growth cost driven by increased capital investments. The gas segment was lower by $18 million, driven by the extreme weather experienced in the first quarter of 2014. The major contributor to the quarter-over-quarter decline, were the weather of $11 million and weather related storage and transport of $7 million.","Gas storage and pipelines earnings were $6 million above the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the volume growth in the Bluestone Pipeline and Susquehanna gathering assets, partially offset by weather driven storage earnings in 2014. Our Power and industrial projects segment was up $18 million versus 2014. A good portion of this variance was due to our REF business. As we saw last year, the performance in REF can vary depending on the underlying volumes and the timing of new relocations. As a result, we expect much of the REF favorability to reverse out over the balance of the year, more than offsetting underlying growth from new relocations and projects. In addition, we do expect some of the $18 million of favorability to flow through from growth in our renewables and on-site businesses related to new investments that came on line in 2014 and early 2015.","Our corporate and other segment came in unfavorable by $16 million versus last year. This variance is due largely to an effective tax rate adjustment which will reverse within the year. As a result, we remain comfortable with our earnings guidance range for this segment.","Again, the overall growth segments results for the quarter were $282 million or $1.58 per share. At energy trading, operating results for the quarter came in at $12 million with economic net income of $20 million, both the power and the gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to page 23 of the appendix to review energy trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.","That concludes the update on our earnings for the quarter. I\u2019d like to now turn the discussion over to Mark, who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics.","Mark Rolling","Thanks, Jeff and good morning to everyone on the call. Let me open by saying that our cash flow and balance sheet remain strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. I\u2019m going to begin on slide 14 with look at our cash flows for the first quarter of the year.","Cash from operations in the first quarter is $800 million which is up from the first quarter last year. The favorability we\u2019re seeing is spread across several business units and most of it is timing related. So, we\u2019re sticking with our guidance of $1.7 million of cash from operations for the full year.","Capital spending was also higher in the first quarter due to increased investments at the electric utility, partially offset by lower capital spending at our non-utility businesses. We achieved $500 million of long-term debt in the first quarter which drove a reduction in our commercial paper balance. And somewhat unceremoniously, in the first quarter, we made a final payment on the securitization bonds. Back in 2001, we issued $1.8 billion of securitization bonds to recover the costs of our Fermi 2 nuclear plant and those bonds are now paid off.","Moving to slide 15, which lays out our capital investments in a little more detail. DTE Electric CapEx is higher due to our $240 million investment in a 700 megawatt gas peaker in January of this year. And compared to last year, CapEx for our non-utility business was down in the first quarter, but that\u2019s just a result of how the investments show up across the quarters; we refer to that as the lumpy nature of our non-utility projects.","For the first quarter, our capital spending is on track to our plan and in line with your full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.","Let me wrap up on slide 16 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our plan for 2015 is to maintain our strong balance sheet and end year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. In the first quarter, we issued nearly $200 million of equity to our internal mechanisms and that fulfills the equity needs for this year. And we continue to plan for $800 million to $900 million of equity through 2017.","To fund the growth at DTE Electric, we issued $500 million of 30-year debt at very attractive rate. In fact it\u2019s a lowest rate 30-year debt, we\u2019ve issued since the Eisenhower administration.","As of the end of March, we had a healthy $1.9 billion of available liquidity and earlier this month, we successfully amended and extended our credit facilities, increasing the size to $1.9 billion and extending the term to April 2020.","And now, I\u2019ll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks Mark. Let me give you a quick summary on slide 18 and open it up -- the line for questions. You just heard, we had a very strong first quarter. We remain on track to achieve our earnings guidance for 2015; anticipate successful outcomes this year for both our utility regulatory filings as well as the Michigan\u2019s energy policy reform. Our balance sheet and cash flow metrics remain strong and our investments in our utility and non-utility businesses support our target of 5% to 6% to EPS growth going forward.","I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining our call this morning. And now I\u2019d like to open it up for any questions that you have. Dina, if you want to open up the line, I would appreciate it.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Michael Weinstein","The first question I have is how does this positive quarter affect your future lean initiatives later on in the year? I\u2019m just wondering and I know it\u2019s kind of earlier that you may have the summer to get through but just wondering if that -- how you expect that to impact mix?","Peter Oleksiak","As we\u2019ve mentioned on this call and the past, when we\u2019re on the road, we\u2019re going to the every year with three plans, the base plan; the lean plan; and the invest plan. For each of those, we wait for the different additions, to see which one we strike; weather normal would be the base plan. Where we\u2019re right now with the weather favorability is we\u2019re actually looking at investing potentially but we\u2019re going to the process right now of in our gas utility in particular, going through the list to understand what the potential investments we can make there with the idea of making those investments to help the long-term assets in operational excellence and consistently earning our authorized returns there. So, the short answer there is at least at this moment, we don\u2019t see lean plans having to strike that, our lean plans more than anything, there will be some invest in particular in our gas utility.","Michael Weinstein","And I just had one another question on NEXUS, and I am wondering how you\u2019re seeing shipper demand and also just LDC demand and other demand shaping up in the region, given the low gas prices or oil prices, lower rig counts?","Peter Oleksiak","We\u2019re continuing to see strong interest as that region\u2019s continuing to get drilled up and evolve. There is increased capital allocation, the shippers overall have dropped their level of capital that they are spending. But most of them, if they have investments in this area have reallocated more capital to this region. So, we are seeing that. So we\u2019re continuing to see interest coming through both the shippers and the LDCs.","Michael Weinstein","Is that a reflection of the regions you\u2019re in or more dry versus wet; is there an advantage that you have?","Peter Oleksiak","It is. We were on the as a Marcellus with our Bluestone Pipeline and Millennium, that\u2019s definitely a prolific shale play, low on the dispatch curve and then our NEXUS pipeline is going to Utica Shale which again is very prolific and low on the dispatch curve. There is a lot of interest to shippers as well; they can drill and the capital is getting allocated there because there gas to market.","Michael Weinstein","And actually one final question would be, do you guys expect that legislation could be finished by June or you think it\u2019s more of an August project?","Peter Oleksiak","There is some probability that it gets done by mid-year; the Governor has been pretty public and that is his goal. We\u2019re planning on it getting done by the end of the year. We want to make sure it kind of goes through the as normal process as you are kind of seeing out there; it is progressing nicely and it\u2019s going like other legislative prophecies with a lot of different proposals out there; they need to work through those and reconcile those. So, I would say there is some chance here, most likely it will be done later this year.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Eggers","Just on the last question on the legislation, I guess the Governor is talking about this fair choice concept. When you guys look at the House and Senate bills, do you see interest on those two, because they are giving a little more different opinions [indiscernible]. Are you seeing them converging toward what the Governor\u2019s laying out and as prospects we could see some new version of legislation coming sometime soon?","Peter Oleksiak","It\u2019s tough to say where this is going to end, one thing that we\u2019re actually happy to see is that the legislation is getting the most momentum and support as some sort of fix to this broken retail access program we have in Michigan. And then, there is various ways you can fix this program. Aric Nesbitt has put out there, how do we just maybe completely eliminate the flaw of retail access program. His focus is on angling the liability and capacity needs for the state. We support that plan, but we\u2019re also happy to see that both the Governor and Senators are also focused on retail access and how unfair it is. But at this point, it\u2019s kind of tough to say where we\u2019re going to end up; we\u2019re just happy that the retail access program is getting work out.","Daniel Eggers","Zone 7 wasn\u2019t a big capacity prices option, obviously the price in Illinois was pretty dramatic change. How is that affecting you? A, how you guys are looking at resource adequacy and adding capacity to be owned by DTE versus contracted and what level of attention has that gotten at the commission or down in Lansing?","Peter Oleksiak","The recent option on MISO, I know there was a bit of confusion on that or at least in terms of where did the prices come in. It came in as expected. The planning cycle that they are planning for when it goes up, all up until the summer of next year, the capacity shortfall that we\u2019re anticipating will be in the summer of next year \u201816 and that\u2019s the\u201916 and \u201817 planning cycle for MISO. So those results came in as expected. What we saw down in Zone 4 is what we\u2019re going to anticipate we\u2019re going to see in Zone 7 where year-over-year you saw a pretty dramatic change I think zone factor 10 of capacity prices with the shortfall that occurred there.","So, there could be option and we\u2019re expecting a significant increase. One other nuance that pushed this until next year is there was an extension with some retirements in our region for a few months that literally helped us get bridge the capacity all happen to the edge of next summer.","Daniel Eggers","I think I am seeing Peter with the potential for very meaningful increase in capacity prices for next year, are you guys using that or having those conversations with the Commissioner and others to say we need to be doing even more to get or have this from owned and new build resource perspective?","Peter Oleksiak","Conversations we\u2019re having with them is really highlighting the need for new generation in the eight choice program where that has not been built for them, but it\u2019s really helping us highlight its retail access issue that\u2019s more than anything. The results of that retail access program, I know we\u2019ve talked about this in the call, we\u2019ll see if we get some load coming back to us, if we do, you\u2019ll have to figure out in the short-term basis how we satisfy that low demand in longer term, we\u2019ll roll it into our integrated resource planning process.","Daniel Eggers","And last one I guess when we look at the P&I results, obviously was a really good quarter relative to plan. How much of the probably the upside in the quarter were things, were period specific, whether be better trading opportunities and how much of it is a recalibration operators? Are you guys seeing better performance than may be you thought when you put out guidance earlier?","Peter Oleksiak","The main difference remained and Jeff was highlighting this in his talking points, is our REF business. That is tied to coal plant production and the variability around that coal plant production. The variability in that coal plant production is tied to when outages are taken at the coal plants and when they\u2019re dispatched and depending where they\u2019re at on the dispatch curve. So, you do see variability that occurs during the year on those coal plants. So, we did see quarter over quarter basis more coal plant production. We are anticipating relatively normalized production for the balance of the year. So we will see that variability bleed off for the balance of the year. Underlying that, there is some growth. We do have growth in our renewal projects; we have some wood waste projects came on line; we\u2019re going to get a full year\u2019s annual growth out of them, some landfill gas projects on line as well as I was mentioning the 8-megawatt cogeneration plant as well.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matt Tucker","With respect to the intact guidance, it sounds like you had some timing issues in the quarter with corporate and the REF units and sort of offset. So assuming normal weather for the rest of the year; is it fair to say you\u2019re at least on pace to beat the midpoint of guidance with the weather benefit you have or are there some other offsets that we should be thinking about?","Peter Oleksiak","At one quarter end, one thing as you know what we like to do especially with the summer ahead of us in our electric business and the variability with the summer timeframe, we like to hold on reserve any type of contingency around that. We are starting off strong in our gas utility there in particular; we make the judgment call on how much do we want to reinvest that into the gas utility. And we are in any stay out period right now in terms of rate filings is one of the ways that we help stay out of rate filling is reinvesting, go lean when we can with a gas utility.","And then for our non-utilities, we mentioned the P&I segment; most of that was timing; we\u2019re expecting that to come back in from a guidance perspective. Our gas storage and pipeline business, we do have additional incremental volume that we did see in the quarter. So, they are off to a strong start but there is volume variability that still could remain in the balance of the year. So, we\u2019re kind of holding that favorability right now for that potential variability. So, I guess it\u2019s a long winded answer. We feel positive about the quarter. And right now we\u2019re just reserving that favorability for the balance of the year.","Matt Tucker","And then, it looks like your electric weather normal sales were down about 1% in the quarter year-over-year. Can you just give us a little color on what think is going there, in particular given what sounds like a pretty healthy and improving economy in your territory? ","Peter Oleksiak","I\u2019ll ask Jeff Jewell to answer that question.","Jeff Jewell","Overall view of the forecast is about 0.5% for the full year and that\u2019s kind of what our long-term is. So what we\u2019re seeing in the quarter is sort of one-time outages on retooling in the auto sector and also the steel. So again, we sort of characterize the timing just from when they were planning on doing those and sort of what their balance of the year production is going to be. So again, we\u2019re looking at it about 0.5% growth.","Matt Tucker","And given how weak gas prices have been so far this year and look likely to remain obviously this summer, just update us on the Bluestone system, what you\u2019re seeing there and if there is any change to your growth plans, your expectations?","Peter Oleksiak","We are not seeing any impact on the gas prices with our Bluestone Pipeline or gathering. We did sign new agreement with Southwestern; we mentioned that last year and really some northern acreage around Bluestone Pipeline; we\u2019re doing the gathering for them there. That part of the Marcellus Shale in particular is very prolific. And so they are very bullish around getting the drilling done there; volumes are coming strong as well, no impact.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel","First question on the Governor\u2019s energy speech. For retail open access, you didn\u2019t talk about re-regulation but talked about sort of this five year commitment. And I don\u2019t if there are other options that would be somewhere in between like potentially an interruptible tariff or customers switching back. If the final ends up kind of in line with the Governor\u2019s suggestions, how much of the load that has switched you think might return over the next few years?","Peter Oleksiak","Andrew, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good question, but I just don\u2019t want to answer at this point in time. We\u2019ll get into the details, it ends up being more of a design change with the capacity commitment as well as return provisions that are more fair to upholster with customers; it will be a choice by choice basis in terms of the customers currently in the program. So, I would anticipate some of that load coming back for people trying to bottom-line of that new type of structure; some could remain. So, you kind of get into the details and the economics and the decision making process with individual customers will be tough to predict.","Andrew Weisel","Then on the Governor\u2019s proposals for energy efficiency, pretty ambitious target. How do you think that might affect your weather normalized load growth outlook? And would your expectation be that you would continue to get revenue recovery and incentives or is that something being debated?","Peter Oleksiak","The energy, where energy efficiency is going is one area of focus within this legislative progress. I know we talk a lot about the retail access piece of it, but the energy efficiency will be discussed just this week. Some of the Democrats introduced some bills around energy efficiencies and wanted to increase energy efficiencies. The Governor has mentioned a big part of his focus is on energy efficiency. We like energy efficiency; it\u2019s good for customers; it lowers customers\u2019 bills. And as we\u2019re putting new generation in place, replacing fully depreciated generation, it helps from a bill and total rates perspective. From a weather load perspective, Jeff was mentioning the 0.5% growth. We\u2019re assuming some element of energy efficiency end at 0.5% growth, probably up to 1%.","So, it really would depend on the outcome of this energy efficiency program with the requirements of that and a bit more and above what we already have embedded in our long range forecast for sales growth.","Andrew Weisel","Then next is -- first quarter is any update on ownership structure and when Enbridge might make their decision?","Peter Oleksiak","The update is Enbridge is still considering ownership of the pipe. They are particularly in the pipeline their LDCs. They have expressed obviously -- they like to pipe itself; they expressed it in recent year-end call as well. So, they are still considering; it\u2019s going through this normal decision making process for them. If they are not in the pipe, we get 50% ownership of a great project. So, we\u2019re okay with either outcome.","Andrew Weisel","Then in terms of NEXUS, it pretty much seems like it\u2019s a go at this point pending all the FERC approvals and filings. How do you think about that NEXUS system holistically and what it might mean for longer term growth, once it\u2019s in service?","Peter Oleksiak","The NEXUS pipeline, when I think about the NEXUS Pipeline, I would like to refer back to the Millennium Pipeline that\u2019s a Bluestone for that. So, the NEXUS Pipeline will grow and will become a variable asset for us as the Utica Shale production grows and develops and as gas needs to get to market by those shippers. So, we\u2019re anticipating at some point, maybe in the future we can set up for future expansions on NEXUS that\u2019s going to help NEXUS as well as Vector which NEXUS ties into. We also have skills, knowledge on developing laterals and gatherings. So, we\u2019re hoping opportunities around NEXUS as well on the laterals and gathering projects. And the great thing about those projects is that the gathering project, you make money on that; it goes on to a lateral which helps make money on that; it goes on the NEXUS, helps make money on that; it goes in the Vector, help makes money on that. So it\u2019s amplification of value to that value chain. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re seeing NEXUS will progress over the next few years after it\u2019s in service.","Andrew Weisel","Then very quickly just a modeling one, the corporate taxes, there were some timing issues; any sense of over the next few quarters when those would reverse?","Peter Oleksiak","The effective tax rate, the way to think about that is we had strong income in the first quarter, we\u2019re holding our total year forecast the same. So, you\u2019re really seeing a flush of taxes, the timing of taxes on a profile in the first quarter. So, we are -- if you hold your total year forecast, the taxes will be balance out in the second, third and fourth quarter.","Andrew Weisel","Evenly though or is there, do you have any sense of when that might happen if it\u2019s lumpy?","Peter Oleksiak","It will follow the income profile for those quarters. So, my sense is it will probably maybe be a little bit back and loaded, given our gas utility, low earnings in the second and third quarter.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza","Let me ask you on ultimately what gets approved, what choice, whether it\u2019s the House, Senate or what the Governor is proposing? Is there any update on when we could potentially get some guidance around how much generation you could potentially build as a result of the 3 gigs of shortage?","Peter Oleksiak","It\u2019ll be -- once we understand the final design, then we\u2019ll have to be at that point in time some type of period to understand what customers under the total elimination of the broken program, it will be apparent, we have 900 megawatts out there on choice. There is some contract that they would have to work through, so they will all come back over a period or probably three-year period. Any other design, it really will be a case-by-case and really understanding what customers stay on choice, what customers come back to us. It would be some period of time after the legislation is passed and maybe a few months it as getting absorbed for us to. And as soon as we know that, we would give you guys an update in terms of what does this mean, in terms of additional megawatt that we\u2019re going to have to serve.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just one housekeeping on the stronger than expected results of energy trading, is there -- should we assume that\u2019s going to invert the rest of the year or should we assume stronger results the rest or some of the economic hedges that unwind?","Peter Oleksiak","They are off to a strong start, I can say that and when we look at them, we do target $20 million to $25 million of economic and income. So, what you\u2019re seeing on the accounting results is some of that stronger performance falling through. Typically there is seasonality in that business. We do have a good physical portfolio of businesses that serve and deliver gas and electricity. In the first quarter, the gas was flowing which helped out the earnings there, we\u2019re going to see that again in the fourth quarter. So there is some seasonality in that business, so the next few quarters maybe a little bit quieter. So, I can tell you that we are off to a good start there; three quarters ago that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re holding the guidance on accounting.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just one last question, Michigan State in the implementation plan under 111(d); is there any status there?","Peter Oleksiak","They\u2019ve been holding some hearings in Lansing around that. So, there is some early work being done around that. There is a new agency that\u2019s more going to be a policy courting agency that\u2019s going to be involved in that working with environmental agencies as well as the MPSC. So there is early work that\u2019s being done around coordinating and setting an overall Michigan policy that\u2019s also lining up with the EPA requirements and having the states filed in individual plans within that. The good thing is that there is discussions happening and some really early thinking around what is going to be the structure of the state compliance process.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Most of my questions have actually been answered. But if you don\u2019t me asking and perhaps this should be offline. If I go back to your year-end\/Q4 slide deck and look at the $70 million of operating earnings that you expect to come from your pipeline platform in 2019, this was noted that you include a 33% ownership of NEXUS. What percentage of that $70 million of operating earnings is the place holder for the NEXUS contribution?","Peter Oleksiak","We have not disclosed at that level detail. But we have disclosed that this could be a $700 million [ph] investment assuming that the 33% ownership interest and we have given some parameters around returns that we target.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Doran [ph] with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Most of my questions actually been answered, but just may be a little additional color on your sales growth and outlook there. It looks like it was down from a weather normalized basis just for the quarter but may be some additional color on that?","Jeff Jewell","So, what we\u2019re seeing is with the 1% that\u2019s related to timing, mainly in the auto and the steel sectors is again as they were doing some retooling there was also plant in Canada that\u2019s down as retooling. So obviously there is a little bit of flow on during the quarter. But for the balance of the year, all those plants, the anticipation that they\u2019re going to be growing for a lot of stuff. So that\u2019s what sort of brings our growth back up to our anticipated 0.5% of the full year.","Peter Oleksiak","And Michael, on the residential, we saw this last year as well. When you got this extreme weather, you have additional conservation that happens and people will dialogue a little bit differentially, a little bit lower in their house. So we did see some additional conservation that\u2019s playing through the residential segment.","Unidentified Analyst","And some off topic but to your comments on the Red Wings, it was great to see the tradition maintain with octopus. I think it was enormous too.","Peter Oleksiak","We lost in overtime last night that as always, but it\u2019s two, two.","Unidentified Analyst","I don\u2019t understand how they get them in the arena, innovative people out there in Michigan.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Just a quick one on the legislation, is it -- obviously the Governor didn\u2019t call for a specific RPF. So just curious whether you think that eventual outcome will include some sort of explicit higher RPF and if not what kind of number do you think is likely to fall out of your planning?","Peter Oleksiak","A lot of it is intertwined with the EPA requirements. There was a debate a few years ago, do we do more renewable or not in Michigan? So that Washington has determined that we will, so for us to comply with the current reductions, the EPA has outlined, we will be doing more renewables. Where the supporter momentum is going is more having flexibility around that. There will be a process we\u2019re going to be submitting in to comply with 111(d) but there is also going to be need of the state and how they want renewable to be. So renewables will be going out to file amount, determined by a combination of our 111(d) filing as well as what the state wants. I\u2019m not anticipating any type of new standard coming and it will be more on our portfolio basis what do we need to get cleaner in terms of CO2 and other emissions.","Jonathan Arnold","But either way, you anticipate obviously participating in building some of that whether it\u2019s gas or renewable; it will be incorporated in your plan; is that how we should think of it?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold","I did noticed in the prepared remarks, you mentioned potential opportunities to optimize some of the other REF units, presumably the existing ones. Is that potentially significant or more kind of tweaking at the edges?","Peter Oleksiak","More on the edge; these units are very scalable and they can handle lot of different volumes; more volumes is better. So, we\u2019re continuing to look at those units that some units that we have on coal plant and some sites have monthly units, there may be opportunities to relocate some of those units to higher volume cola plant. It\u2019s more on the edge.","Jonathan Arnold","Many of the units or is this just couple of them?","Peter Oleksiak","Just a few, a couple.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Just a follow-up on a few things, the gas storage and pipeline. You mentioned some timing and you mentioned Bluestone seems to be on track. And I was just wondering if you can just elaborate a little bit more on the timing issue that are going to be bringing down the -- just how that\u2019s going to flow over the year?","Peter Oleksiak","The timing is, our gathering business in particular is volume based from a revenue perspective. Southwestern is as mentioning is seeing really good volumes in this region and volumes around the acreage that we\u2019re tying or gathering too. So we\u2019re seeing those plus the incremental volumes come through. Now, we also see there is some variability that does occur sometimes in the balance of the year, the summer timeframe, the decision Southwestern makes around pricing and volume levels, so they may fluctuate a bit. But I would say we\u2019re off to a strong start and some of that potentially could flow to the bottom-line for that segment.","Paul Patterson","But what will drive it down I guess, I mean if you could take that $27 million and you look at what\u2019s your forecast is, what\u2019s going to be -- I am sorry if it\u2019s done, but what\u2019s driving it down over the next few, is there some seasonal situations which you\u2019re talking about or\u2026","Peter Oleksiak","There is some seasonality to that business line.","Paul Patterson","But there is no change in any of the projects outlook in terms of\u2026","Peter Oleksiak","No.","Paul Patterson","And then on the MISO capacity, I am sorry, you guys were mentioning sort of a forecast that you guys had and I want to make sure I completely understood that in your zone. You expected it to go up, how much I think in the following year?","Peter Oleksiak","We don\u2019t have a particular forecast for our zone. And what I was mentioning is that where the prices came out was where we\u2019re anticipating then. It was relatively -- we\u2019re anticipating to see a sizable price increase in Zone 7 is for the summer \u201816 which will be next year\u2019s, next planning year. But I did indicate, we did see some results in Zone 4 on a year-over-year basis that came up dramatically that was a 10-time increase that may or may not -- I mean there is some element or increase will occur in Zone 7 but it\u2019s probably good indication of what\u2019s going to happen within one planning year when there is a shortfall that occurs.","Paul Patterson","So, I mean I just want to make sure are you guys thinking that you might see similar signs like a 10-fold increase in\u2026","Peter Oleksiak","It\u2019s tough to say but we will see a sizeable increase.","Paul Patterson","And then just finally, you guys were mentioning the sales growth of 0.5%. And the Governor, it wasn\u2019t clear to me whether or not the Governor\u2019s strong emphasis on energy efficiency was part of that or whether you think that would incrementally make that lower or impacted at all, you follow them?","Peter Oleksiak","We do in our long range planning the 0.5, I did mentioned we do anticipate energy efficiency there to continue occur and it\u2019s probably a rule of thumb is probably about 1%. So we are probably at more of organic growth of 1.5%, it gets down to 0.5% through energy efficiency. What I was indicating earlier was that depending on the nature of the energy efficiency programs that are out there, they\u2019ll all be relative to our assumption of that 1%. This is more aggressive energy efficiency and potentially it could put down 0.5% of it.","Paul Patterson","So the Governor\u2019s emphasis on this may lower that, but I guess it\u2019s too early to say; is that sort of how to think about it?","Peter Oleksiak","The Governor\u2019s message really is aspirational. I mean he really wants us to focus on energy efficiency. The EPA 111(d) compliance credits energy efficiency. So, we also have reason to focus on energy efficiency. But more than anything, I believe he is setting a real good tone around energy efficiency in the state of Michigan.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question today from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisor.","Andy Levi","You can take another question; I am all set.","Peter Oleksiak","Dana, I think that\u2019s maybe it.","Operator","Yes, that is it.","Peter Oleksiak","Well, let me just conclude by saying that I appreciate everybody for joining us this morning. Once again, we are off to a good start here at DTE. Definitely appreciate your continued interest in DTE and hopefully everybody can be voting and supporting our Detroit based sports team. Have a great day.","Operator","Again this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We thank you for your participation."],"8151":["DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 24, 2019  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Barbara Tuckfield - Director, Investor Relations","Gerry Anderson - Executive Chairman","Jerry Norcia - President & Chief Executive Officer","Peter Oleksiak - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Praful Mehta \u2013 Citigroup","Constantine Lednev - Guggenheim Partners","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","David Fishman - Goldman Sachs","Gregg Orrill - UBS","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Operator","Good day. And welcome to the Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Barbara Tuckfield. Please go ahead.","Barbara Tuckfield","Thank you, Christian, and good morning everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to read the Safe Harbor statement on page 2 of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","With us this morning are Gerry Anderson, Executive Chairman; Jerry Norcia, President and CEO; and Peter Oleksiak, Senior Vice President and CFO. We also have members of our management team to call on during the Q&A.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gerry Anderson to start our call.","Gerry Anderson","Well, thank you, Barb, and good morning, everyone. So I think you're all aware that I turned over the CEO role to Jerry Norcia effective July 1st. So I have long believed that one of the most important responsibilities that I had as CEO was to at some point hand off the job to a great successor at the right time. And I'm fully confident that I'm doing that. And one of the characteristics of strong healthy companies is that they execute seamless leadership transitions, transitions that don't involve a lot of drama or sharp shifts in strategy.","We've been preparing for this transition for years literally, almost since the day I took over. And back in December of 2018, I told the Board that July 1st of this year felt right to me. So it's been a real honor to be DTE's CEO for the last nine years. I'm extremely proud of what the company accomplished for you during my tenure, but DTE now has a great new CEO, and I am confident that he will do great work for you and continue our pattern of outperformance.","Jerry and I have worked closely together for more than 15 years. He is a great business leader. He also has a big heart for the people of DTE and for the communities we serve. He brings great experience to the role. He led our Gas Storage & Pipeline business as its President. And then was President of our gas utility, our electric utility and then eventually played the role of President and COO of DTE. He is a strong businessman. I think those of you who have met him know that. He also has the right values to lead this company. And so the CEO role will be in good hands as Jerry continues executing the vision that we shared together for DTE.","That said, I'm not leaving DTE Energy. Moving forward I'm going to serve as the Company's Executive Chairman. And in that position, I'll act as an advisor to Jerry and business and strategic issues. So he and I will remain in close contact. But I'll bring a particular focus to DTE's community, state, federal and broader industry roles.","One of the most important things an energy company can have for its success is a positive context within which they operate. A context within which your community leaders and state legislators and regulators and federal players view you as a good company trying to do the right things and understand that you actually are doing that, and therefore, want to see you succeed.","And I continue to focus on that, I'll continue to be a strong advocate for DTE's success but I'm going to step back from many of the day-to-day role, as I played as CEO. That's Jerry's work now, and I'm fully confident that he will do it very well. It's been a pleasure working with and for all of you over the years, and I look forward to continuing to see many of you from time-to-time on the road IR events.","And with that, I am going to turn things over to Jerry Norcia.","Jerry Norcia","Well, thanks, Gerry, and good morning everyone. I'm very grateful for the confidence that Gerry and the Board have in me to lead this company through what I believe is such an exciting and transformative time in the energy industry. DTE's top priorities remain the same to be a great energy company, committed to foster a world-class employee engagement culture, to drive customer service excellence, to be a force for good in our communities, and to deliver distinctive shareholder returns.","Also, I want to thank Gerry for his mentorship and support since I joined DTE Energy. In his tenure, leading DTE, Gerry led the transformation of our culture, drove a highly successful growth agenda and put us on a path to reduce carbon emissions more than 80%, and a way that also supports customer liability and affordability. He readied DTE for long-term success, and I look forward to building on a strong foundation that he set.","I'm very optimistic and excited about the future of DTE, because of our best-in-class team of employees as well as the historic opportunity to reinvent the way we produce and deliver energy for our customers. I am honored to be leading this great family we call DTE now and into the future.","This morning, I'm going to give you a recap of our performance for the second quarter of 2019, as well as an update on our long-term growth plan. Then I'll turn it over to Peter, who will provide a financial review of the quarter and wrap things up.","So let me start on slide 4. We continue to make great progress on several key fronts. Our second quarter financial results are solidly on track with our plan. With one half of 2019 behind us, I'm confident that DTE is well positioned to raise our EPS guidance midpoint by $0.05. This guidance raise is mainly based on colder winter weather at the gas company and warmer late June and July weather at the electric company. This increase takes into consideration the significant storms we expected \u2013 experienced this past weekend, and in total 600,000 customers were impacted. It all should be restored by the end of the day. We've made really good progress on this front.","I want to express my gratitude to our employees, contractors and nearly 900 workers from as far as Georgia and New York leading our restoration efforts. In total, we had well over 2,000 people deployed in the fields, and many more in our operation centers working around the clock to get service restored to our customers.","Longer term, we continue to target a 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate through 2023, where 2019 original guidance is a starting point for this growth. All of our business have accomplishments to note this quarter, and I will give you a brief overview when we go into more detail on the following slides.","So back in May, DTE Electric received the constructor rate order from the Michigan Public Service Commission that supports the modernization and automation of our grid. It also supports an aggressive Tree Trim program, both of which will result in significant improvements in the service reliability to our customers. Including this order, was approval for Charging Forward, which is our new program for electric vehicles. This program will bring the benefits of EVs to more Michigan residents and businesses through incentives, customer education and charging infrastructure growth.","We also filed a new rate case in July of the electric company and we recently received approval for the purchase of three new Michigan wind parks.","At DTE Gas, we have a number of projects that are progressing nicely, including our accelerated main renewal program, and additional transmission system improvements. At our Gas Storage & Pipeline business, we acquired an additional 30% of Link, bringing our total ownership to 85%.","This additional stake in Link complements our existing midstream business, that's supported by solid underlying resources. This acquisition is organic in nature and stems from assets that we are already very familiar with. Link's performance has been better than pro forma since we acquired it in 2016. And we expect it to continue to perform well into the future.","Moving on to our Power & Industrial business, we are pleased to announce three new cogeneration projects. These are in addition to the RNG projects mentioned on the first quarter call. We are very excited about our involvement within the industrial energy services space. As you all know, our REF earnings will sunset in 2020 and 2022. The long-term plan for P&I is to replace these earnings as we move forward toward our 2023 earnings target range of $125 million to $135 million.","We are ahead of plan to originate approximately $50 million of earnings per year to reach this target. As you know, we successfully originated projects that achieved that growth target in 2017 with the Ford Motor Company project and two RNG projects in 2017. And in 2018, with two additional RNG projects. We feel great that halfway through 2019 we have secured three cogeneration and two RNG projects, which gets us to our origination target for 2019. I'll provide more details on these P&I developments on the following slides.","But first, I want to highlight several significant achievements of both utilities on slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, the electric company received a constructive rate case order in May. We continue to have very constructive working relationships with the Michigan Public Service Commission, and look forward to working with the newly appointed commissioner Tremaine Phillips.","We're approved for a total rate base of $17 billion, to continue to harden our system and make necessary improvements for our customers. We're also given the opportunity to surge our tree trim efforts, which will serve our customers well, most of our damage over the past weekend was related to trees. So I believe that the surge will certainly drive significant improvement in the performance of our system. And we're grateful for that.","In early July, DTE Electric filed a new rate case. In this filing, we requested that the MPSC approve a $1.3 billion rate base increase, driven by continued infrastructure investments to ensure generation availability and improved distribution reliability.","This continued reliability will be achieved through upgrading our circuits. The filing also requested the redesigning of substations to avoid system overload, and adding more remote operating capabilities to detect and restore outages more quickly. The rate case filing includes a 50:50 debt equity capital structure and a low income renewable pilot program that will better enable low income customers to participate in our MIGreenPower voluntary renewables program. We expect the final order on this case next May.","As Michigan's leading producer of renewable energy, we received approval for the purchase of three new Michigan wind parks, which qualify for a 100% federal tax credit, resulting in savings that will benefit our customers. Two of the projects, totaling 383 megawatts are located in mid-Michigan will be the largest clean energy projects in the state, as well as the largest renewable energy projects in DTE's portfolio.","The third project is a 72-megawatt park in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which may alternatively be used to support additional sales under the Michigan -- under the MIGreenPower program, which is our voluntary renewables program. These products will increase the company's renewable energy portfolio nearly 50%, furthering DTE's commitment to providing clean, affordable and reliable power to its customers.","Investing in the renewable energy is a key part of our commitment to reduce carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2040. Adding these new wind parks to our portfolio will help us meet the clean energy needs of our largest customers who have chosen MIGreenPower. We have aggressive plans to expand our voluntary renewable energy programs, enabling more customers to reduce our carbon footprint and meet personal or business sustainability goals. We are proud of the environmental and economic benefits these projects will bring to Michigan.","DTE's renewable projects not only benefit the environment, they are also helping drive Michigan's economy. DTE has driven investment of more than $2.8 billion in renewables since 2009 and will invest an additional $2 billion over the next five years. DTE's renewable energy projects have created or sustained more than 4,000 Michigan jobs while powering the equivalent of more than 500,000 homes with clean energy.","As I mentioned earlier, DTE Electric also launched their Charging Forward program, which is our new initiative for electric vehicles. We'll be able to provide a rebate of up to $500 to a residential customer who purchases or leases a new or used EV, installs a qualified charger, and enrolls in a special rate beneficial for EV charging.","DTE's business customers can also receive incentives on our EV charging equipment. We are thankful for the support of both, the Michigan Public Service Commission as well as our auto industry partners and environmental advocacy groups in supporting our EV program.","Also in late June, along with CMS, we renewed the license for our Ludington hydroelectric plant. The Pumped Storage Plant is the second largest in the U.S. with a capacity of over 2,000 megawatts and takes advantage of the unique geography we enjoy here in Michigan. We are investing in $800 million to upgrade Ludington, which will add 300 megawatts of capacity and prepare it for a long-term future.","The upgrades are on schedule to be completed in 2020. The plant generates hydroelectric power and supports our renewables generation, because it acts like a giant battery that can be tapped when renewable output drops. The plant pumps water from Lake Michigan uphill through a 27 billion gallon reservoir at low demand times and releases the stored water and energy downhill through the turbines to generate electricity when energy demand is higher.","Ludington can ramp up to peak output in just 30 minutes and provide sustainable, clean, reliable energy source. It also helps to keep energy bills lower, because it allows DTE Energy to avoid having to buy expensive out-of-state electricity when demand peaks.","Our new Blue Water Energy Center is also progressing on plan. We broke ground last year and received all the necessary permits. The plant is a little over 20% complete, with an expected spring 2022 in service date. A significant amount of civil work has been completed and we expect the turbines to arrive on site later this year. Six days a week, workers are representing numerous trades around the site to support the $950 million project.","Moving on to our gas company, I mentioned we are progressing on several fronts. Our accelerated distribution main renewal program is on track. We have completed 48 miles this year, and will complete 178 miles by year-end. Over the past several years, we have replaced over 650 miles, with plans to replace an additional 3,500 miles by 2035.","We're also developing plans -- invest in additional system improvements, including a transmission of renewable program following our risk-based approach to support the growth, integrity and reliability of our gas transmission system inside our utility. We are utilizing our risk model prioritize upgrading or replacing approximately 100 miles of transmission lines by 2037 and compression in the range of 81,000 horsepower by 2035. We'll be working with our regulators and demonstrate reasonableness and prudency of these programs. Together these programs showcased the great things that are going on here in Michigan.","Now I'll turn to our non-utilities on slide 6. Starting with our Gas Storage and Pipeline business, we feel great about the progress year-to-date as well as the outlook for the rest of 2019 and beyond. The second half of the year, GSP earnings will increase from the first half of the year for a number of reasons, including the acquisition of an additional 30% of Link.","Also, as you remember, we are acquiring the Generation Pipeline, which is consistent with the strategic growth plans DTE and Enbridge for NEXUS. The acquisition is progressing through regulatory proceedings as it is on track to close in the second half of this year. Additionally, replace Millennium's Eastern system lateral upgrade and service late in the first quarter of this year.","Finally, the Link expansion is progressing quite well, we're expanding the system and connecting new gathering resources. Due to all these factors, we expect GSP to have a very solid finish in 2019.","Next, I'll walk through our Power and Industrial business. This quarter a number of deals, we've had in the works came to fruition. We are finalizing three new cogeneration projects. First, we finalized a development agreement with Stelco, developed a strategic cogeneration project at their Lake Erie steel facility in Ontario.","DTE's experience in a cogeneration space will enable Stelco to reduce its energy cost by utilizing excess industrial gases and reducing exposure to peak electricity pricing. Also, we are purchasing a CHP plant that serves a commercial customer. This project provides hot and chilled water to the facility, fits well within our gross strategy to provide on-site energy for large commercial and industrial customers. Both of these investments are underpinned by long-term off-take agreements.","Finally, we will also operate a CHP plant here in Detroit at the Wayne County, Criminal Justice Center. P&I will design, build and operate county-owned central utility plant, and provide hot and chilled water and backup power. The Justice Center is on track to begin operations in 2022.","On the RNG front, we have closed on two greenfield projects, we mentioned on the first quarter call. Both projects are located in Wisconsin, where we have built a strong RNG presence, based on our extensive experience there. For competitive reasons, we don't discuss the returns on these non-utility assets, but I can tell you that they get better than utility returns and the capital investment for all the projects I just discussed is in excess of $300 million.","As I mentioned earlier, we feel great about our recent project developments and how they fit into our plan to replace our REF earnings, which will sunset in the near future.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Peter to share our financial results.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into financials, as you know, I would like to give an update on the Detroit Tigers. At this point in our rebuild process, the eye is definitely on the future in the farm system. At this one point, Casey Mize was our number one pick last year to pitch a no-hitter this year in the minors. So the present is currently dark, but the future is looking bright. And the financials are consistently bright here at DTE, let me turn your attention to the financial results, now I'll start the review on slide 7.","Total earnings for the second quarter were $183 million. This translates into $0.99 per share for the quarter. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix. Earnings for the quarter are lower than the second quarter last year, primarily due to unfavorable weather this year.","Let me start my review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $134 million for the quarter. This was lower than 2018, largely due to cooler weather and rate based growth cost, offset by the impact of new rates implemented in May.","DTE Gas at second quarter 2019, operating earnings of $4 million and this is $10 million lower than the second quarter of 2018. The earnings decrease is driven primarily by the $10 million tax timing item, I mentioned on the first quarter call that is reversing this quarter, as well as less weather favorability in 2019. And this was offset by the impact of new rates implemented late last year.","Let's move down the page to the third row to our Gas Storage and Pipeline business. Operating earnings for our GSP segment were $50 million for the quarter.","Last year, we had one-time positive earnings related to AFUDC at NEXUS and higher than planned volumes across the portfolio. This year we have normalized earnings at NEXUS and volumes are on plan. As a result, this quarter is down $10 million versus the second quarter of 2018.","GSP is performing according to plan through the second quarter, and we will see the benefit in the second half of the year from the volumes on Link that continue to ramp up. And we also see the full impact of the Millennium expansion and recent acquisitions.","On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial business segment operating earnings were $29 million. Earnings are $14 million lower than the second quarter of 2018 and this decrease is due mainly to the REF tax equity transactions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018.","And as we communicated previously, we entered into equity partnerships in our REF units to accelerate cash flows around $100 million per year for the next three years to support growth projects. This lowers earnings this year around $40 million versus 2018. Also, I would like to note that most of the new projects originated over the last few years will start adding to earnings later this year and early next year.","Our Energy Trading business had an accounting operating loss of $2 million, earnings are lower this quarter compared to the second quarter last year due to the lower gas portfolio earnings and timing of realized economic earnings. Our trading company is having another solid year.","Year-to-date economic earnings are on plan and in line with guidance. The appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation are showing both economic and accounting performance.","And finally, Corporate and Other was favorable $9 million this year compared to the second quarter of last year and this was due primarily to the timing of taxes. So, overall DTE earned $0.99 per share in the second quarter of 2019.","Now on to slide 8, given the strong start to the year for both our utilities driven by favorable winter weather at our gas company and favorable July weather at our electric company, we are increasing the 2019 operating EPS guidance midpoint by $0.05 to $6.20.","The earnings were lower than the first half of last year. This was contemplated in our original guidance. And as you know, DTE enters each year with contingency and this year was no exception. We mentioned in the first quarter call, we've built additional contingency with the winter weather at our gas utility and electric company has had a strong first half of the year with additional weather related earnings coming here in July.","The weather favorability over and above our increased guidance will be held for reinvestment and storm expenses associated with this warmer than normal weather. This sort of planning has been one of the keys to our success and providing predictable results every year.","Now I'll wrap up on slide 9 and then we'll open it up for questions. In summary, I feel confident in achieving our increased 2019 guidance, keeping us on track to beat our original guidance for the 11th consecutive year. For the past 10 years, we beat original guidance by an average of $0.25 per share. We are also well-positioned to continue our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth in the years to come. The utilities continue to focus on necessary infrastructure investments specifically for investments to improve reliability and the customer experience.","Our non-utilities continue to position us for long-term growth. Finally, I feel very good about our ability to continue to deliver the premium total shareholder returns that we have delivered over the past decade.","And with that, I'd like to thank everyone this morning for joining us and Christian, you can open up the line now for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Okay. We will now take our first question from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is\u2026","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi guys.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning","Praful Mehta","Good morning and congratulations, Jerry.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you very much, Praful.","Praful Mehta","All right. So maybe the first question on the quarter. The weather clearly impacted the electric side. Just wanted to understand when you highlighted the lower performance of Q2 2019 versus Q2 2018, you highlighted weather and rate based growth costs. Could you clarify a little bit exactly how much was weather, and what exactly is rate based growth cost and what was the impact of that part of it?","Jerry Norcia","Yeah. The weather availability that we have in the appendix as well the actual amount. We did have a cooler, its $44 million for the quarter. So, it's been relatively significant from a weather perspective. We had a hot weather last year and the second quarter; first part of June was actually relatively cold for us. So, a good portion of that decline that you're seeing there is weather related.","Now the term rate based related cost that is depreciation, interest expense, property tax related to rate base. Now that is more than offset by the new rates that were deployed in our last rate case.","Praful Mehta","I got you. Great. Helpful. Thank you. And then in terms of the increased guidance for 2019. It sounds like the benefit from what you saw in July is flowing in there as well. How much of that benefit is a part of like the $0.05 increase that you had for the 2019 guidance?","Peter Oleksiak","Yeah, we can't really -- I can't really give exactly the number yet for July, but I can tell you that July is one of the hotter July's we've had here in recent history. So I'd say a good portion of that as it relates to that. Now we did hold back some of that weather favorability here in July. Some of those is for the storm that we've experienced, Jerry mentioned that we do traditionally give back a portion and when we have the extreme weather we had in July, two storms. So we're going to be funding that as well as holding back for reinvestment. We'd like to do that as well especially with customer centric and facing that projects.","Jerry Norcia","Yeah. One of the things I'll add is that the contingency levels that we have in all our business units feels quite strong at this point in time, and that's why we felt comfortable with raising guidance at this point. So we still continue to hold a significant amount of contingency in our plans for the balance of the year.","Praful Mehta","Great. That's super helpful. And just finally in terms of the equity issuance, any clarity on timing of how we should think about the equity between 2019 and 2021?","Peter Oleksiak","Well, we did mention and we wanted the $1 billion to $1.5 billion over the next three years, $250 million of that this year. We've done already $165 million for this year. So $250 million target this year. We'll give an update at EEI for our plan for next year. And let you know, our goal would be to be at the lower end of that $1 billion range. And if we do that with continued strong performance like we're seeing this year and we do hope contingency, we don't need that contingency to be at the lower end of the range, but we'll give a fuller update here in the fall.","Praful Mehta","Got it. Very helpful, thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning, Shar.","Constantine Lednev","Hi, good morning, sorry, it's actually Constantine here. I was on mute for a second. Just a quick question on the expectations for future acquisitions and capital that's getting deployed in the GS&P segment. How is that tracking versus the prior guidance that you provided? I think it was roughly $4 billion to $5 billion over the course of the plan and just curious to see how kind of with the current acquisitions and the expansion that's going?","Jerry Norcia","Sure. So we mentioned the four organic investments that were -- are progressing quite nicely this year. The Link expansion, the Millennium expansion, which is complete. The Link expansion will be complete later this year. We completed the Link acquisition, the bolt-on acquisition, and we're also looking to complete the Generation Pipeline acquisition.","All of that feeds quite nicely into our 2019 plans and 2020 plans. So we feel like we're aligning up growth quite nicely for that platform over the next two years. We are looking at acquisitions, we always do. The market has actually become -- starting to bring a lot of opportunities forward as we see some midstream companies under severe stress from a balance sheet perspective, as well as we see producers redirecting capital toward our drill bit. We're starting to see opportunities float our way and we're being very selective and very disciplined about how we look at those. So, feeling pretty good about the prospects of that business line right now.","Constantine Lednev","Okay, perfect. And just one quick follow-up, just a housekeeping item on the -- to go for the rest of the year, the raise in the utilities guidance, the earnings contributions there is mostly going to be driven by rate cases and reinvestment, is that correct?","Jerry Norcia","That's correct.","Constantine Lednev","Okay, perfect. Perfect, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question; it comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning, Michael.","Operator","Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein","Sorry about that, I was on mute. Hey congratulations to both Jerry\u2019s.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you, Michael.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Michael Weinstein","And first question I had is about the delays in other pipelines throughout the country, such as you know Atlantic Coast Pipeline, non-volatile pipeline. I am wondering if that's -- what opportunities that may be giving you guys for long-term contracts at NEXUS, if any, are you seeing any difference there?","Jerry Norcia","We're starting to feel that for sure. I mean with these projects being delayed and uncertainty developing in those projects, certainly there is a lot more interest in some of our pipeline platforms to move the growing Appalachian basin. Just to give you a feel for the basin grew about 13% year-over-year from a production volume perspective. So we're still of the view that this basin will go short pipe capacity over the next year or two. And that's going to play in our opinion very favorably and our assets are positioned to take advantage of that, especially NEXUS.","Michael Weinstein","And also the company has a history with the fuel cell industry a long time ago, and I'm just wondering if there is any potential opportunity at P&I to maybe pursue that once again at some point in the future as the technology starts to improve?","Jerry Norcia","We haven't looked at that lately, I mean, we're really focused on our cogeneration and renewable natural gas. Those are the two primary business lines, but we have not looked at that in some time.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning, everyone. And again, just want to echo congratulations to both Jerry's outstanding work and looking forward to the next chapter.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","My first question is on the wind farm acquisitions, you gave the IRP out in March and talked about the plans to grow your renewables. My question is does this change simply the timing as far as accelerating when the wind capacity will grow? Or would this be more incremental renewables in the mix? And -- impact the timing of coal plant retirements.","Jerry Norcia","Well the renewables that we -- renewable parks that we're acquiring and building out are part of our plan and included in our current forecast. And I think that's really it. Does that answer your question?","Andrew Weisel","Yeah, I guess, so in other words, this doesn't change the outlook for the mix, it just gives better visibility. Is that a fair way say?","Jerry Norcia","Yeah. We had filed this some time ago as part of our renewables build-out program to meet the 2016 energy legislation goals would be in at 15% by 2021. So this 455 MW accomplishes that plus also gives us the opportunity to sell into the voluntary renewables markets.","Peter Oleksiak","And Andrew, this is Peter. Just to further add to Jerry. At EEI, we mentioned, we had 600 MW of voluntary renewable, so this help support that as well as our compliance with our state, state plan.","Andrew Weisel","All right, great. As good as that. Then my other question on midstream, you briefly talked about the Appalachian gross -- gas production recently though the activity has really been moving down with the commodity. The rig count is down about 20% or so since April and probably continuing to fall. Does this change your outlook at all as far as activity in the basin or utilization of your system?","Jerry Norcia","We watch activity in and around our pipelines very closely, producer activity that is. And what the producers said they were going to do this year, they are doing in terms of drilling and connecting wells to our system. So we're seeing the volumes right on top of our forecast, actually, that also plays well into next year as they drill wells this year also feeds our growth for next year. So we're seeing them do what they said they're going to do. I think the one thing we are seeing is more companies coming forward and looking to sell some of their midstream assets, which I think will make it pretty interesting for us going forward to look at some of those. So we feel really good about where we sit right now. And I did mention that the basin grew about 13% year-over-year in terms of production volumes. We're forecasting about a 5% to 6% growth rate going forward. So we are forecasting what we would call a slight slowdown, but that's built into our forward-looking view for this business line.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, very good. And lastly, you just mentioned some midstream M&A, we've seen some activity recently with the assets that have passed out. Were there any specific characteristics you didn't like or is it more a function of price discipline?","Jerry Norcia","We look at assets that won great value for us obviously and secondly that are either early or mid cycle growth. We don't like buying assets that are very mature and they will provide us with upside opportunity. And then we also look at the resource base, that's the third thing we look at it there, gathering related type assets. And we do a pretty hard scrub on resource base, because that's really what drives the opportunity for growth and value in the future. So that's the criteria that we use. So if we pass on assets, that likely doesn't meet one of those three criterias.","Andrew Weisel","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from David Fishman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Fishman","Hi, congrats to both Jerrys again.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you, David.","David Fishman","So just kind of continuing on that theme, I think you did a good job of outlining those three points. But do you guys, when you think about adding value for your system, does this -- do you usually focus more on opportunities that would connect to an existing portfolio and kind of smaller bolt-on or is this really going to be more just opportunistic for somewhere that you see growth kind of in the future? So I'm thinking about Generation Pipeline or FTG those have the potential to connect your system and grow from there?","Jerry Norcia","All of our growth in this business line has been in the Great Lakes region. So we'll continue that will be our primary focus, that continue focusing on the Great Lakes region. If an asset opportunity represent itself outside of the region that we understood, or would create value, we would be open to that, but our primary focus is in the Great Lakes region.","David Fishman","Okay, that makes sense. And then just one quick follow-up on the regulated guidance, I know you mentioned very favorable weather in July so far. Have you guys gotten a bit of a sense of what the storm impact might look like over the past weekend and just curious if you guys have insurance or how you think about some of the leverage there?","Jerry Norcia","So, these kind of storms usually come with a really, really hot weather and I can tell you that the hot weather far outstrips the expense for this storm, so we're net ahead and that's why we feel comfortable that we're actually building contingency in the electric business line even with the guidance raise, and the answer on insurance is, no, we don't carry insurance for storms.","David Fishman","Okay that makes sense. And then one last question, just on cogeneration and kind of how you think about the opportunities set there and how maybe from our standpoint, we should think about where the opportunities might lie. Do you typically -- is this something where you'd contract with more newer facilities?","Are those going through kind of transformative investment plans, kind of like Ford, Dearborn with a 10 year plan. Stelco they have two facilities but naturally you want with kind of the newer one. As we just think of the new exposure to Toledo corridor, should we be looking for new facilities, specifically as the potential opportunity sets?","Jerry Norcia","Yes, so the criteria that we use is, of course we examine the site that we're investing against in the business that we're investing against very carefully. So, we look at the long-term viability and prosperity of the site that we're going to invest against as a cogeneration investor. And so that analysis is something that we do in a great level of detail.","And once we get comfortable with that, then it's really about negotiating a return that is more attractive than our utility returns before we deploy capital. And so that's how we look at those types of investments of the site and the business on a site is really important.","In terms of the Toledo corridor, we are seeing a lot of action, mostly combined cycle plants that are building up in and around the NEXUS pipeline. So, we're excited about that and we're actively pursuing, connecting some of those assets for the NEXUS pipeline. So, that's what we're seeing in that -- in the Ohio corridor that we are most -- that we can most influence results there.","David Fishman","Okay, that's very helpful color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Gregg Orrill","Yes, thank you and congratulations.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you, Gregg.","Gregg Orrill","So, the 50 -- just to maybe reconfirm on the origination goal at the P&I business of $50 million a year, you said--","Peter Oleksiak","It's 15.","Gregg Orrill","Sorry.","Peter Oleksiak","I'm sorry I just said it's $15 million a year. That's correct.","Gregg Orrill","Okay and you reached the goal for 2019, is that what you were saying?","Peter Oleksiak","That's correct. We feel, actually, we may have exceeded it somewhat as well.","Gregg Orrill","Okay. Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","With the pilot projects.","Gregg Orrill","How much do you think a project is contribute?","Jerry Norcia","We really don't disclose how much each project contributes. But I can tell you that the -- where we that -- five projects that we're talking about will generate about $200 million of capital investment and that those returns are in excess of our utility returns. So, that might give you a feel for what kind of income is being generated.","Gregg Orrill","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Paul Patterson","Congratulations guys.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you, Paul.","Paul Patterson","It's been quite a road and well congratulations. And I guess the question I have for you is and this is a special inspection for Fermi, and I think we're going to get a report like in 30 days or something like that.","Jerry Norcia","Yes.","Paul Patterson","But I was just wondering sort of given how nuclear economics are challenged around the country and of course, the special inspection just maybe think generically, what is the long-term plan for Fermi? And are there any opportunities maybe to replace this? Or just how are you guys thinking about that?","Jerry Norcia","Well, Paul, it's a great question. I -- we view Fermi in a very positive light and let me explain why. One it is a regulated asset. So, we don't operate in the merchant market where everything trades toward variable cost.","And the price that we can produce carbon-free energy from that plant and the amount of power that we can produce from in a carbon-free way. I don't think any other renewable resource can touch it. So I feel like it's is a bit of a jewel in terms of our future and provides us great options in the future to produce highly economic and carbon-free power. So, we see a long future for Fermi","Paul Patterson","Okay.","Jerry Norcia","And then I think the issue that you referred to as a something that's existed at the plant for 30 years we've managed it well with the regulator and we're working with the regulator to move that issue to a good conclusion. And of course as you know, we will always do the right thing at a nuclear plant.","Paul Patterson","Yes. Once again, congratulations.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. As there are no further questions in the phone queue at this time, I would like to hand the call back over to you, Mr. Norcia for any additional or closing remarks.","Jerry Norcia","Well, thank you, Christian. And with that, I'll wrap up by thanking everyone for joining the call. We've had a great first half of the year as evidenced by our increased guidance and I feel really good about the position we are in to continue our solid track record of delivering premium results.","I look forward to providing you with updates as we move through the year. Thanks again for joining us. We appreciate the questions and we'll talk to you all soon. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

Meador - Chief Financial officer, Executive Vice President and Member of Internal Risk Management Committee","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman of The Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, Group President of Energy Resources and Member of Internal Risk Management Committee","Analysts","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the DTE Energy Year End 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Dave Meador. Please go ahead, sir.","David E. Meador","Thanks, Dana, and I apologize for that music while you were on hold there. We'll get a better selection next time. But good morning, everybody. This is Dave Meador, and welcome to our 2011 Year End Earnings Call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to the forward-looking statements. And with us this morning is Gerry Anderson, our Chairman, President and CEO; Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Controller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. We also have members of the management team with us to call on during the Q&A session if needed. And with that opening, I'll turn the call over to Gerry.","Gerard M. Anderson","Thank you, Dave. Good morning to all of you. Thanks for being here with us. I want to start the call by saying that I feel really good about what DTE Energy accomplished in 2011, and that's true on almost every front. As you probably already seen, our earnings for last year finished well ahead of our plan on our most recent guidance, and our cash flow and balance sheet results were strong for the year as well. ","So 2011 continued a string of solid earnings and cash flow results for the company in recent years. But our performance is about a lot more than financial results, and in fact, I believe it's only by focusing on a lot of things outside of your financial results that your earnings picture has a chance to be strong and sustainable long-term. And so I spent a lot of time with my leadership team focused on a system of interconnected priorities that I believe are the things we need to be very good at consistently in order to make our recent strong financial performance sustain long-term. There are a lot of companies who produce strong financial performance short-term or for a few years, but the trick is to make that sustain long-term and a lot of discussion here and a lot of focus on how to make that happen. And the system of priorities that we're using to do that is shown on Slide 5, and I'll start by saying I realize that Slide 5 may look like a lot of boxes and arrows to you, but it really is how we're thinking about managing DTE Energy for the long-term. So I want to take a little bit of time describing that system to you and then tell you about the progress we've made against it.","And the priorities start on the left side with what I call the kind of the kingpin or key priority, which is highly engaged employees, and the bottom line is you can't have an excellent company that outperforms if your employees' focus and engagement and energy level is average. And so we really do spend a lot of time trying to build the energy engagement and focus of our people. And if you pull that off, then you have a chance at the next 3 things, which is to deliver really good service to your customers and improve that over time to use a tool that we've spent a lot of time developing here at DTE Energy, continuous improvement, in order to manage the quality and affordability of your products and also, to have your people drive creative growth and value creation. And if you do those 3 things well, then I think you have a shot at sustaining a constructive political and regulatory context, because if your customers are well-served, they're all voters and they shape the political arena. If you don't keep your cost in line by constantly working on affordability that eventually finds its way into the political and regulatory discussion. It's also true that if you can pursue constructive productive growth and that helps from an economic development standpoint in the state it shapes the political and regulatory context. And if you combine a good regulatory context with solid growth, then you have the formula for sustainable financial performance. ","So in terms of how we are progressing against these priorities, Slide 6 steps into that. On the employee engagement front, we use something called the Gallup survey. Thousands of U.S. companies do use that. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that our Gallup score increased. We're now on the 71st percentile of U.S. companies. So that's a good thing, although we have a clear goal of wanting to take that up into the top decile or top 10%. ","We're also continuing to improve our safety performance. Another important employee outcome. Our injury rate is down 70% since the mid-2000s. We've got both of our utilities performing at top quartile level. In fact, MichCon has been at top decile level in recent years. ","Continuous improvement is something that we work every year to push deeper into the organization through education and familiarization and practice. And as a result, our O&M expense level was lower last year than in 2005. We project it'll be lower again in 2012 than it was in back in 2005. That's about $350 million on an inflation adjustment basis. But it isn't only cost, obviously. We're working to focus that CI on reliability and other important operating metrics. ","From a customer satisfaction standpoint, our MPSC complaints are down over 50% over the past 5 years. We have a target of bringing that down 10% to 15% year in, year out. 2011 also saw improvement in our J.D. Power customer satisfaction rankings at both utilities. That's the fifth year in a row that we've seen that. MichCon came in first quartile. Detroit Edison wasn't that high. They were above median but not at first quartile, but they did improve. We also put a lot of work into our work on behalf of low-income customers here in the states. ","Moving on to Slide 7 on the regulatory and political front. I think when we stepped back from it, the outcome that we had in the Detroit Edison rate case late last year was constructive. The ROE did come down and we'd hope for a little higher outcome there. But when you think the case overall, I think we've got a base that's constructed to work from. And we did continue to see solid and broad political support for the regulatory structure here in the state that was put in place about 4 years ago. ","On the growth front, we saw our first major wind project at Detroit Edison. We put about $0.25 billion into that. I'll talk about that a little bit later. We also made significant progress on 2 new Non-Utility growth platforms. Our Bluestone Project related to the Marcellus and Pennsylvania, and our Reduced Emissions Fuel business line. Again, I'll talk about those 2 items a little bit later. ","And finally, on the financial front, kind of the outcome of all of the work that I just described, our earnings were $3.73, EPS was $3.73, compared to our original guidance a year ago of $3.55, so we had a nice outperform there. Did earn our ROE at Detroit Edison for the second straight year. MichCon was off slightly on its ROE, principally due to warm weather that we and everybody else saw in November and December last year. And we did increase our dividend 5% last year to $2.35 a share. ","So I feel we made good progress last year, I also feel good about our launch point for 2012 and I feel good about our longer-term growth prospects, which is where I want to turn now. ","And I will move to Slide 9 to do that. You can see on Slide 9 that we have provided guidance for 2012 of $3.80. That's $0.05 higher than the early outlook that we provided back in November. If you compare that $3.80 to the guidance that we've provided a year ago, which was $3.55, it's up 7%. In fact, if you look at the bottom of the slide, you can see that our growth in recent years has been right at about the 7% level, and we are projecting a future growth of 5% to 6%. We often get asked 5% or 6% from what pace? And we want to be clear that the 5% or 6% is from the midpoint of our 2012 guidance, so it's from that $3.80 level. ","Now let me talk for a minute about where that growth would come from, starting with Detroit Edison on Slide 10. Detroit Edison will invest about $6.5 billion over the next 5 years, we project. About $4 billion of that, on the left side, will be put into base infrastructure, which is our investments to ensure the reliability of our generation fleet, our distribution systems. 2012 will be just under $800 million in that area. We also have significant expenditures continuing in environmental compliance. We can see that we've ranged that from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion for the next 5 years. And the range is simply because we're still finalizing our plans and, as you know, the EPA does continue to evolve regulations, and so we may see some changes in the 5-year period that we don't fully understand now. We'll put a little over $250 million into that area in 2012. And then on Renewable Energy, we project just under $1 billion of investment to meet the RPS requirements here in Michigan. We will put $235 million into that arena in 2012. ","In fact, Slide 11 provides a bit more detail on our renewable investments because this is an area that's really emerged over the past year. You see on the left hand side of Slide 11, our first large investment in wind, and that's a 212-megawatt project that will be fully operational by March. We pursue this 50-50 with Invenergy. And all of our turbines, we have 64 of the turbines on the site, are, in fact, up and operational. We invested about $250 million into that project. The right-hand side shows you the project we are currently in the midst of. This will be 110 megawatts at 3 sites in what we call the thumb area of Michigan, and we project that will be completed by the end of this year. And again, we'll put on the order of $250 million into that project. That one is -- work began on that last year and will -- little out of the market right now due to weather but we'll be back at it soon. And following that, we do have, in our sites, the next project, which is also 110-megawatt project on the order of $250 million of investment that would likely play out in the 2013 to early 2014 time frame in terms of completion. ","Moving on to Slide 12 for MichCon, we project that we'll invest about $1 billion over the next 5 years, but 2\/3 of that in base capital focused on strengthening and expanding the distribution system, pipeline integrity and so forth, which just over $150 million into that area this year. The other 2 areas that we're working are both programmatic. One of them is main renewal, our undertaking a program to replace 670 miles of main over the next 10 years, that's about $0.5 billion investment over the 10-year period. And that's really focused primarily on cast iron main that has just reached end-of-life and needs to be replaced. ","We do plan to file for a capital recovery mechanism or a surcharge mechanism in our upcoming rate case from MichCon, and we are coordinating that carefully with the Public Service Commission. We'll spend about $40 million in this area this year. ","We also are pursuing a meter move-out program. We still have meters inside homes and our older urban areas, and we are going to be moving about 27,000 meters per year out. We need to do that. Customer services impacted too much by having these inside, so we, in the commission, have agreed it's time to get them outside, and we will invest $20 million to that end this year. ","We also have some healthy growth opportunities in our Non-Utility business, and those are -- the discussion that starts in Slide 13. The 2 areas where strongest growth opportunities are focused is in our Gas Storage & Pipeline business and our Power & Industrial business. Gas Storage & Pipeline is profiled on the left. It's about a $60 million business today, but we do believe it can reach $100 million by 2016. And that expansion is driven heavily by investments that are tied to the Marcellus Shale and the Millennium Pipeline and some of the things that we're working. I'll describe more of that in a minute. ","And the right-hand side is the Power & Industrial earnings profile. It's about a $50 million business this year, that's the midpoint of our guidance for 2012. We believe it can grow to about $100 million business or actually above $100 million by 2016. Most of that growth would be driven by our reduced emissions fuel business at least in the near-term. ","Slide 14 provides more color on our Gas Storage & Pipeline opportunities. In the upper left, we have talked to you previously about the Bluestone Pipeline and the associated gathering systems. Bluestone is a lateral off of our Millennium pipe. It's really focused on taking Marcellus gas to market. For us, it will total about $280 million in investment in the pipe itself and then gathering that we're going to undertake. We are heavily in the works of making that pipe real right now, permitting it right away or well along and wrapping up. This pipe is going to be built in 2 phases, a northern phase and a southern phase. Our construction on Phase 1 will begin soon. We expect to have that in service this summer. And then Phase 2 will follow and be in service late this year. ","This activity and other developments nearby are driving expansions on the Millennium pipe described in the green -- shown on the green and in the box on the upper right. This pipe is full. It was really full at the end of last year. We saw all sorts of activity moving gas in both directions on this pipe just trying to get Marcellus production to market. We have 2 expansions of the pipe locked in. Those will result in a 50% increase in the capacity of the pipe. First expansion coming into play this year and the second next year. ","But in addition to these investments, we are working on additional future opportunities as well. The Bluestone is anchored by Southwestern Energy. But we have been approached by other producers with lease holdings that are adjacent to Bluestone, and several of those discussions we expect will continue and eventually progress into additional gas being moved on Bluestone, an additional investment for us. We also continue to work on extensions of the Millennium Pipeline, extensions and expansions, to provide greater access to the Northeast market from Marcellus production, and we are optimistic that we will make projects of that nature happen as well. ","Slide 15 provides an update on the second area of significant growth in our Non-Utility businesses. The reduced emissions fuel business within -- business line is within our Power & Industrial business. On the left-hand side of Slide 15, you see where we stood at year end 2011. We had 3 units in service at Detroit Edison plants, 2 that we have cited in other plants with utilities in the Midwest and at 4 units available for relocation inciting with other utilities. Our earnings contribution last year was under $5 million, and that's low because 3 of the units that we had an operation by end of year were only in operation for weeks. They came on line quite late in the year. And those units also had, for example, 6 months of depreciation, even though they operated for only a few weeks, so that impacted the earnings. ","If you look to this year, in the middle of the slide, our focus is on making those 5 units that we have sited and in operation operate very, very well. We're also working on relocating the remaining 4 units, and we are in discussions with a number of other utilities to that end and we expect the earnings contribution to go up to the $30 million level. ","And then looking out to 2013 and beyond, we expect to have all 9 units in operation with an average annual contribution moving forward of $50 million or so. That would be the level we'd expect in 2013 could drift up some there from -- because these tax credits do inflate over time. But that's a general feel for the level that we see right now for that business. ","And with that, I am going to turn things over to Dave Meador, who's going to give you a fuller update on our financials. Dave, over to you.","David E. Meador","Great. Thanks, Gerry. I will go through the financial updates starting on Slide 17. Operating earnings for 2011 came in strong at $3.73 per share and we'd like to reminded you that a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Starting on the left-hand side, Detroit Edison came in higher than our Fall EEI updated guidance and earned $2.60 per share. This was driven by ongoing cost control and the partial year rate increase that we had last year, and then favorability is driven by a onetime year-end tax adjustment. But second year on the row, Detroit Edison earned its authorized return on equity. ","MichCon came in at $0.65 per share. This is at the low end of the guidance and slightly below our targeted 11% return on equity levels. MichCon was on track for almost the entire year due to ongoing cost controls, but mild weather got us at the end of the year and caused a slight miss there. ","In the Non-Utility group, Gas Storage & Pipelines earned $0.34 per share. This was better than guidance. It was driven by higher volumes on the pipelines in the fourth quarter. Power & Industrial finished the year in the high-end of the guidance range. This was a transition year for the group and they add several projects to deliver higher-than-expected returns and some onetime items. Energy Trading finished up strong for the year at $0.31. And as you might recall, trading posted solid earnings through the third quarter and we saw that performance continue throughout the remainder of the year. This was aided by favorable timing from contracts that were executed at the beginning of 2011 and also success in both the Power & Gas Trading part of the business. ","As Gerry indicated, the total year was not only higher than our original guidance of $3.55, which we projected our 5% to 6% growth off of, but it was also higher than the last guidance that we provided at the Fall EEI, and I'd like to congratulate all of the employees at DTE Energy for another great year on many fronts, including the things that Gerry covered but also our financial performance. ","Turning to Slide 18. Gerry talked about our distinctive capability we're building in the continuous improvement area and it's really the way we approach our work. And while we're still building this capability in the company and we feel that we have many more opportunities ahead of us, we're actually getting some really nice results as you can see on this slide. Over the last 7 years, we've driven $350 million of cost savings to the bottom line and we do this because we owe it to our customers to keep rates as low as possible. But also, it's given us the flexibility to achieve our financial goals, and we do this without compromising on our ability to improve customer experience or our operational metrics. ","Turning to Slide 19. Although both utilities are revenue decoupled, we watched the local economy very closely. We have said that we see economic recovery in our region and that's going to be slow with the tail on it, but we are certainly seeing continued signs of positive economic health. As you know, Ford and GM and Chrysler have significantly restructured their cost profile and now they're very profitable at much lower volumes. For example, General Motors this morning announced that they earned $7.6 billion last year, and many expected that they'll earn $10 billion a year going forward. All 3 U.S. automakers are profitable and U.S. sales volumes are at about 13 million units, which is down from the 17 million annual sales levels before the 2008 recession. ","On this slide on the upper left, you can see that Michigan's employment has improved dramatically from a high of 14% 2 years ago to now under 10%. On the bottom left, you can see the Michigan auto production numbers are up 67% from the trough in 2009. And on the right-hand side is Detroit Edison LOAD which is up also since 2009. Adjusted for the impacts of energy efficiency, we're expecting LOAD to increase another 1% to 2% in 2012. ","And Slide 20 is our updated guidance for 2012. We're taking the midpoint of our guidance up from the early outlook that we've provided last year to $3.80 a share, which is a 7% increase over the 2011 guidance of $3.55 that we provided this time last year. ","Let me do a quick walk down the chart here. Detroit Edison's guidance of $438 million to $448 million, which is the same outlook we've provided at the EEI Fall conference. The key drivers of the 2012 guidance to the prior year are the lower ROE from last year's rate case and a favorable tax adjustment at the end of the year. And this is partially offset by a full year of rate increases in 2012 in continued cost control. We might file a rate case for Edison later on this year in the fall but we're going to work hard as we always do to see if we could push that forward, including all the way out into 2013. So we'll update you on our rate case strategy for Detroit Edison as we progress during the year. ","MichCon's guidance is $110 million to $115 million. With a warm start of the year, MichCon has been negatively impacted about $5 million in January and another $3 million or so in February. Although MichCon does not had a rate increase since 2009, we'll use continuous improvement to deliver targeted earnings which we outlined here, and this is about $5 million less than our fall outlook. We also plan to file a rate case for MichCon in the second quarter. ","Gas Storage & Pipelines is targeted to have a modest earnings increase from existing assets after a very strong performance in 2011. More significant growth in this business comes in 2013 from the Bluestone Pipeline that Gerry just talked about. ","Power & Industrial is projected to have significant increase in earnings this year, growing to $45 million to $55 million. That's driven primarily by the REF business line producing at higher volumes. ","At Energy Trading, we're targeting an earnings at a traditional level, and we've set our guidance here at $30 million to $50 million, which is lower than our actual earnings in 2011. And the holding company will improve year-over-year due to lower interest rates. So the total 2012 guidance is $650 million at midpoint. ","Slide 21 provides our cash flow guidance. Cash from operations is projected at $1.9 billion, it's slightly lower than 2011 due to VEBA contributions and some tax payments in 2012. Capital has increased to $1.9 billion and I'll cover that on the next slide. ","We're projecting that we will issue $300 million of equity through our DRIP program and pension plans, and we're also assuming here that we monetize our net properties for approximately our book value of $300 million. ","On Slide 22 is our capital spending summary. We expect to spend $1.9 billion this year with about $1.3 billion of that being spent at Detroit Edison. Operational CapEx is higher at Edison as we continue to focus on both power plant and distribution reliability. In addition to the increase in operational capital, environmental spending will increase to $255 million as Gerry outlined, and also the renewable energy investments will continue to be strong at $235 million as we continue to build out our wind portfolio. ","MichCon have higher CapEx as infrastructure related as we replaced both cast iron mains and we move meters out of folks homes from the inside to the outside. The Non-Utility spending will increase to $430 million, again, driven by the Bluestone Pipeline and projects with Power & Industrial. ","As we spend this level of capital, we are also focused on driving economic growth in Michigan. Last year, we announced with the Governor that we would increase our Michigan spend by $750 million over the next 5 years. Last year, we increased our procurement spend in Michigan by $125 million to close to $600 million, and will continue to increase the Michigan spend as we fulfill our commitment to take our Michigan spend from 41% to 60% by 2016. ","The Slide 23 is an update on our balance sheet. As we grow our earnings, we'll remain focused on our balance sheet as we always have. Our leverage and cash flow metrics are within our targeted ranges. In January, the 2 utilities were upgraded by Fitch to reflect the continued financial performance that you see there, and the improvement also has been recognized in the Michigan economy. Last year, we financed over $1 billion in debt and that's going to save $25 million in interest per year. We also renewed and extended our credit facility for 5 years. Now the total facility is $1.8 billion and we have $1.4 billion of that available at this time. ","On Slide 24, our dividend is $2.35 and it's well supported. Since 2009, we have grown our dividend by over 5% annually, in line with our long-term earnings growth target. The current yield is about 4.4% and our targeted payout ratio is 60% to 70% and future increases will be supported by our projected earnings growth. ","Let me wrap up on Slide 25 and then we can take your questions. We will continue to execute on our plan, which has delivered and will deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth going forward. And when you put that together with our dividend, this provides a targeted 9% to 10% total shareholder return. Our Utility growth is set in a constructive environment. We continue to make significant investment in the Utilities that we've outlined for you, driven by mandated investments and also infrastructure investments. And over the next 5 years, we will invest $7.5 billion in the 2 utilities. ","We continue to focus on maintaining constructive regulatory environment and we understand that's something that we have to earn every day. We also have a highly engaged workforce. And as Gerry outlined, they are committed to using continuous improvement tools, and on both of those fronts, both employee engagement and continuous improvement, we're going to continue to focus our efforts as we look to improve customer service and drive efficiencies in the business. ","We also have substantial growth ahead of us in our Non-Utility businesses, driven by the Bluestone and REF projects. And our goal is to have our Gas Midstream and Power & Industrial businesses earn a combined $225 million by 2016. ","And thank you for joining us. And Dana, now, we'd be happy to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Kevin Cole with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's actually Dan. First question, I guess, just kind of on the REF business and the timing of getting the earnings contributions in. To hit the $30 million for '12, when do you have to have those additional units placed? And where are you in the contracting process and our ability to kind of see that turn from discussions into something tangible?","Gerard M. Anderson","We have some of the placements targeted in the summer like time frame and some late in the year. And in terms of where we are, we have quite serious discussions underway with a number of utilities. So we're feeling like we'll continue to make progress in place of those. Did that answer the question?","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I guess, when you're looking at those projects, is there some variability potential base in the size of the plants you're looking? I know this is a volumetric business but are you seeing when you might be able to do better based on -- kind of the size of plants you're discussing with right now?","Gerard M. Anderson","Yes, we are talking to a range of plant sizes, so you could be talking to plants that are in the 3 million to 4 million ton range. There are also plants that are up in the 8 million to 10 million ton range. And to your point, depending on where you end up placing them, if you ended up with a collection of them that were toward the high-end, you'd strengthen the outcome and they all end up at the low-end, it would weaken it, which we don't expect. And what we've got in our projection here is a mix of those. We end up with something in between the high and the low-end.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, my other question is kind of on the Barnett sale. In the slides, I noticed you gave a little more detail about the breakdown of reserve base between liquids and gas. When you look at monetizing those assets, are you having a better conversation because they're probably more liquids-rich for the Barnett versus what you'd normally expect?","Gerard M. Anderson","Yes, the whole premise of this monetization has been that there's an oil-rich zone at Marble Falls beneath our properties. The wells that we're drilling, the oil wells are producing very good results, really attractive returns and we're able to hedge in prices at the wellhead now at about $100. As you can see, a lot of the revenue does come from oil and the vast majority of it -- the rest is from NGL. So anybody looking at this -- in this environment in particular is going to be focused on oil and NGLs. And that's a good environment for that.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, I guess if I look at the reserves on 31, there really wasn't a big change in proved or probable on a cumulative basis. Were there some gas write-downs to the move in gas prices that lowered that number relative to activity there, or is that just kind of based on your joint activity was a pretty static outlook?","David E. Meador","No, I'm not sure I would read that into this. We are -- have been shifting acreage at the same time as part of what happened here, so the focus is really just been on the oil in particular, so we actually have been drilling in different places. And also, these reserve numbers are a 5-year projected number under the SEC calculations. So I would not look at that as much as I would be more inclined to look at Slide 32 and just see where the revenue and reserves are by oil and NGL.","Operator","Then we'll go next with Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Dave, did you say that you'd kind of baked in the weather to date in your MichCon number?","David E. Meador","We have. So as I've said, year-to-date, we're with this mild winter. We were off about $8 million, and that's baked in on our guidance, it's assumed in our guidance right now. As you saw, we took our guidance down from the EEI 5 million and we're going to work offset the remainder.","Gerard M. Anderson","Yes, we saw 5 million in January, we're projecting 3 million in February. We aren't through February yet, but it's warm, has been everywhere. So that's what we think the impact will be. And as Dave said, we're going to work some of that off and some of it shows up in a bit lower guidance.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just in Michigan, if there's any lapse in the PTC, what -- how do you react to that? How does the state react to that? And then just any update on choice legislation.","Gerard M. Anderson","On the PTC, we have a requirement at 10% by 2015, so we will continue to invest and make that happen. We're right on track to make that happen. So what it really raises is what's the ultimate cost to the customers. And the most recent round of investments that we saw when you're able to internalize PTC, we have projected wind cost in the $0.0625 range. But if you lose a PTC, it takes us up a couple of cents. So you're going to be more like $0.08 to $0.085. So that's the real question, the investment will happen but PTC lower the cost of customers. And then on choice legislation, we had some discussions of that last year. It really played out late in the year with the review in the Senate Energy Committee, where they took a broad look at the laws that were passed in 2008 and how they felt about them. And if you go and look at the findings of that committee, what they essentially said was done a full review. We like the way they're working and we're going to stand firm. And if you go into the administration with the Governor and his key aides, I think not only is their focus elsewhere, they don't see any modification to the regulatory constructing Michigan as a priority either. So I feel good about the political climate for that.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is there a time frame in '12 when you'd like to have the monetization done at the Barnett?","Gerard M. Anderson","Well, we're looking towards moving into that midyear and would try to wrap up by year end. Sometime this summer, we'd kick it off and try to wrap up by year end.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question is I think you've said the EEI that you would anticipate being done with your testing of DSI by the end of the year. I apologize if I missed comments on this earlier, but did you provide an update on that on this call?","Gerard M. Anderson","We didn't. but I will provide a quick one. We continue to be encouraged by the DSI testing results. We are a little bit delayed. A couple of units that we were using for DSI testing ran into operational issues. We have one of the units down per period that delayed our testing. So we are a couple of months behind where we hope to be at this point with the testing. But everything we're seeing suggests that we're going to have good success with that. Were trying to. But we do need to finalize the testing on the remaining units to determine that, that, in fact, is the case. So instead of being done by early this year, we're probably going to play this out through the first quarter, early into the second quarter before we have a clear read on it.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you think maybe by the next quarterly call, you'll be telling us what your plan is based on...","Gerard M. Anderson","I think we will have a much better idea, yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Chin with Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I may have missed this a little bit earlier but I think you had commented on the decoupler and then you jumped straight into commentary on the Michigan economy. Just to be absolutely clear on this, when you got your new decoupler at Detroit Edison, that's only for energy efficiencies, so there is upside in case the Michigan economy continues to improve here, right?","Gerard M. Anderson","Well, a couple of things. The decoupler is weather adjusted, so if weather were strong, there's upside. If weather is weak, you're exposed to that. In addition, there's a dead band around your sales levels of 1.5% in the first year and then 3%. So you actually are decoupled from weather-adjusted LOAD movements within that band. If you get outside of the band, if you have a particularly strong or weak year, then you are protected, or you get the upside either, depending on which direction it goes. Did that answer the question?","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, that does.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just to go back to the REF stuff, at EEI, you guys sort of saw some significant upside potentially. I mean, I think your base numbers look similar for 2015 -- I'm sorry, 2013 through 2016. But I'm just wondering, the upside that you guys saw as a potential, how does that look now, now that you're further along in the process?","Gerard M. Anderson","Well, there still is a bond around these earnings and it's driven by the plants that you end up siting them at. So as I was saying earlier, if you'll site the plants at larger -- resite the units at larger power plants, you play into the upside and the opposite is true if you end up with a string of smaller plants. So I think we're going to -- we'll have a better feel for that as this year plays out, and we'll be able to get people clarity as we start to actually firm up where we're going to relocate these units. The other thing you saw on those charts and for earnings and cash flow is projected as they drift it up over time, and the reason for that is that the tax credits inflate over time. So that continues to be true. What we're giving you here is you can probably see is kind of the middle of that band as we enter it. But we'll know a lot more about precisely where we're going to land within the band as we get these units sited.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So stay tuned, I guess.","Gerard M. Anderson","I would say so.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Now the PTC wind tax expiration, I know you guys are renewable portfolio standard, but do you see that as potentially impacting the amount of renewable investment that might happen in the state and affect you guys in any way? Or how should we think about that?","Gerard M. Anderson","No, no. We do have an off-ramp that's cost related for our renewable investments. That was one of the provisions of the RPS when it was put in place. If it got too expensive, you just stop spending. But we do not see that happening with the investments to date and our projected cost of future investments suggest we will be able to invest -- to hit the 10% without the production tax credits. Actually it makes it more expensive. But our experience with the production tax credits, we had a small amount of wind going into production in the state. Early on, that was about $0.11, then it went to $0.09, then it went to $0.06, and this was all due to technology evolution. The turbines went up higher, the blade profiles were changed. And so we've gone from capacity factors on these turbines that were in the low 30s now to the low to mid 40s. And so -- and that, as you may know, capacity factor is a really big impact on the -- that's for kilowatt hour delivered out of these units. So even with the production tax credit potentially going away, we think we'll be able to think we have a high degree of certainty that we will play out the investments and the technology evolution has been helpful to make that happen.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally, what is sort of your long-term planning for megawatt hour or kilowatt hour sales growth on a retail basis in your service territory?","Gerard M. Anderson","We're looking at -- for one thing, we're investing $100 million a year in energy efficiency, and so that's peeling out part of the growth. It's a good thing. We're supportive of that. It's helping manage affordability for customers, but it's probably 1% to 2% a year over and above that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So is that including -- I'm sorry, is that including the energy efficiency or is that before it?","Gerard M. Anderson","That would be beyond it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So with energy efficiency what would it be? Would it be less?","David E. Meador","Yes, there's a slight amount that you would take it down to. So it might, over time, push it down to 1%, all in, 1% to 1.5%. We also would expect as the Michigan economy continues to recover here, you're going to see it's -- just more natural low growth.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andy Levi with Caris.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, no, no, I'm sorry. I thought you heard me. I'm all set.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue at this time.","Gerard M. Anderson","Well, great. As we said earlier, we really appreciate you being with us this morning. Look forward to giving you updates as the year progresses on the plan, but we do feel good about what lies ahead this year. Look forward to talking to all of you soon. Thanks.","Operator","Again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation."],"8152":["DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 28, 2019  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Barbara Tuckfield - Director of Investor Relations","Jerry Norcia - President and Chief Executive Officer","Peter Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Praful Mehta - Citigroup","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Michael Sullivan - Wolfe Research, LLC","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Group","Sophie Karp - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","David Fishman - Goldman Sachs","Anthony Crowdell - Mizuho Financial Group, Inc.","Gregg Orrill - UBS Warburg LLC","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","Operator","Good day and welcome to the DTE Energy Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Barbara Tuckfield. Please go ahead, madam.","Barbara Tuckfield","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation.","With us this morning are Jerry Norcia, President and CEO; and Peter Oleksiak, Senior Vice President and CFO.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jerry, to start the call this morning.","Jerry Norcia","Thanks, Barb, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. This morning, I\u2019m going to give you a recap of our performance for the third quarter of 2019, a business unit update, and provide the overview for the 2020 early outlook and early thoughts on our long-term growth.","At EEI, we\u2019ll provide a deeper review of our long-term growth plans and strategies. Then finally, I\u2019ll turn it over to Peter who will provide a financial review of the quarter, updates to cash, capital, and equity, and the details on our 2019 guidance and 2020 early outlook. Then I\u2019ll wrap things up before we take your questions.","So let\u2019s start on Slide 4. We continue to make great progress on a number of key fronts. Our third quarter financial results are solidly on track with our plan. Given the strength we have experienced in the first three quarters of the year, I\u2019m announcing an increase to our 2019 operating EPS guidance.","We are increasing our 2019 guidance midpoint $0.03 to $6.23. This represents EPS growth from original guidance in 2018 to 2019 of 8%, which was quite impressive at this point. This increase is due to the strong performance at all of our business segments and the fact that we will have continued to build contingency that will carry us through the fourth quarter. Peter will provide more details on that front in a few minutes.","Today, we are also providing the 2020 early outlook for operating EPS guidance with a range of $6.47 to $6.75. I\u2019m pleased to say that this is a 7.5% increase over our 2019 original guidance and includes the impact of the recent midstream acquisition we announced earlier this month.","Longer-term through 2024, we are using the higher 2020 early outlook as a new base for our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate. I\u2019m also pleased to announce a 7% dividend increase that was just approved by our Board. The new annualized dividend per share is $4.05, up from $3.78. This continues DTE Energy\u2019s consistent dividend history, having issued a cash dividend for more than 100 years.","This increase reflects the company\u2019s strong performance and ability to consistently achieve our goals. The Board\u2019s approval of the increase signals confidence in the company\u2019s performance and long-term strategic plan.","Turning over to the business update, all of our businesses have accomplishments to note this quarter. DTE Electric recently announced our goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This bold new goal sets the framework to go beyond our existing commitment to reduce carbon emissions 50% by 2030 and 80% by 2040.","DTE Electric\u2019s medium- and long-term plans are aligned with the scientific consensus around the importance of achieving carbon emission reductions. We are fully committed to dramatically reduce carbon emissions. This is the right thing to do for our customers, our business, and the environment. We are doing as much as we can, as fast as we can to provide our customers and the State of Michigan with clean energy that is affordable and reliable.","Additionally, DTE Electric is progressing on its voluntary renewable energy program. Over 400 megawatts have been committed by commercial customers, including Ford, General Motors, University of Michigan, and most recently the Detroit Zoo. Additionally, nearly 10,000 residential customers have committed to a portion of their monthly bills to renewable power.","Along with our carbon reduction plan, our natural gas plant, Blue Water Energy Center is also progressing on plan. We broke ground last year and received all the necessary permits. The plant is a little over 30% complete with the turbines already on site and an expected in-service date of the spring of 2022.","Moving on to our gas company, we are continuing to progress with our accelerated main renewal program. We\u2019ve already renewed a significant number of miles this year and we will complete 180 miles by yearend. We are also continuing to develop plans to invest in additional system improvements, including a transmission renewal program to support the growth, integrity, and reliability of our system.","This new program, along with our main renewal program showcases DTE Gas\u2019 commitment to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. These projects will be described in more detail on our rate case filings later this fall.","Now, I\u2019ll turn over to our non-utilities. At our gas storage and pipeline business, we recently announced the acquisition of midstream assets in the Haynesville Basin. These assets include an existing gathering system and 150 mile gathering pipeline that is currently under construction. This set of assets complements our GSP portfolio and provides a new platform for value creation, which will enable strong growth opportunities for years to come. It has a strong strategic and financial rationale, delivering compelling value to our shareholders.","It is underpinned by high quality resource that is well positioned on a North American gas supply stack. We believe that natural gas will play an increasingly important role in meeting energy demand as we all seek to mitigate climate change in the coming years. The economics are sound and the transaction is EPS accretive, accelerating achievement of our 5-year growth plan, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit profile.","And this transaction is one of the drivers of the 7.5% increase in our 2020 outlook. As we mentioned on the call, we are committed to maintaining a 70% to 75% utility mix. At EEI, we will provide the details on how this fits into our 5-year plan.","Now, let me turn over to Power and Industrial. We also had some major milestones this quarter. In September our P&I business announced the opening of its first combined dairy RNG processing and interstate injection facility. The site processes raw biogas from nearby partner farms into renewable natural gas. Pipeline-quality is then injected directly into an interstate pipeline. Converting raw biogas into RNG is a win-win both for dairy farms and the environment. ","Capturing this gas reduces the overall greenhouse gas footprint, provides the farms with another revenue stream and help create a clean, sustainable, vehicle fuel that displaces fossil-based gasoline or diesel-fuel. We\u2019ve made great progress in the energy space over the past few years, which will enable P&I to achieve its long-term goals.","So I\u2019m feeling really good about the progress we\u2019re making in all of our business lines. Now, moving on to Slide 5, I will discuss our 2020 early outlook and long-term plan.","Today, we are providing the 2020 early outlook for operating EPS guidance with a range of $6.47 and $6.75. This is 7.5% increase over our 2019 original guidance, and includes the, as I mentioned, the impact of the recent midstream acquisition we announced earlier this month; longer term, we are increasing our base, and growing from the higher 2020 early outlook through 2024. This will be the new base for our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate.","We believe growing off the new base, provides shareholders with incremental near- and long-term value. We\u2019ll provide additional details by segment when we see you at EEI.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Peter, to share our financial results and give you more details on our 2020 early outlook.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the financials, I always like to give an update on the Detroit Tigers. Yeah, Tigers did come into last \u2013 in the last place this year. But the good news with that last place finish is they get a first draft pick next year. And I\u2019m hoping they find another Justin Verlander. So overall, I\u2019m looking to the future and feeling pretty good about it. And like my Tigers, the financials are as consistently strong here for DTE.","Now let me turn your attention to the financial results, and I will start to review on Slide 6. Total earnings for the third quarter were $351 million. This translates into $1.91 per share for the quarter. And you can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix.","Let me start my review at the top of the page with our utilities, DTE Electric earnings were $307 million for the quarter. This was $3 million higher than 2018 largely due to the impact of new rates implemented in May, offset by rate base growth costs and cooler weather in 2019. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2018 was one of the hottest quarters on record in our region.","DTE Gas operating earnings were $10 million lower than last year. The earnings change is driven primarily by rate base growth and higher O&M expenses. This was partially offset by rate implementation. But keep in mind, only a small portion of this new rate was attributed to third quarter as a result of typically low volumes in the third quarter.","Let\u2019s move down the page to our Gas Storage and Pipeline business on the third row. Operating earnings for our GSP segment were $60 million for the quarter, last year GSP experienced higher earnings related to AFUDC at NEXUS and higher than planned volumes across the portfolio. This year we have normalized earnings at NEXUS and volumes are on plan.","As a result, this quarter is $4 million lower versus the third quarter of 2018. GSP is performing according to plan through the third quarter, and we will continue to see the benefit in the remainder of the year from the volumes on Link that continue to ramp-up, and the impact of the recent expansions and acquisitions.","On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial business segment, operating earnings were $49 million. Earnings are $14 million lower than the third quarter of 2018 and this decrease is due mainly to the REF tax equity transactions that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. As we communicated previously, we entered into equity partnerships in our REF units and accelerated cash flows around $100 million per year for 3 years to support our growth projects. This lowers earnings this year around $40 million versus 2018.","Our Energy Trading business had a strong quarter with operating earnings of $18 million. Earnings are higher this quarter compared to the third quarter last year due to the higher power portfolio earnings. Our trading company is having another solid year. Year-to-date economic earnings are on plan and in line with guidance. The appendix contains our standard energy trading reconciliations, showing both economic and accounting performance.","And finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable $15 million this year compared to the third quarter last year and this was due primarily to the timing of taxes. So overall, DTE earned $1.91 per share in the third quarter of 2019.","Let\u2019s move on to Slide 7. Jerry mentioned, we are increasing our 2019 earnings guidance. As you remember, we increased guidance at both DTE Electric and DTE Gas on the second quarter call, so this is the second increase we provided this year. We\u2019re experiencing favorability in all the segments with particular strength in the Electric segment, Power and Industrial, and Energy Trading. DTE Electric is benefitting from warmer than normal weather, P&I is favorable due to the optimization of REF units and Energy Trading earnings came in strong in the third quarter. We feel really good about how strong 2019 is coming in, so we are confident in achieving the increased guidance range.","Now I\u2019ll transition to 2020 to discuss our early outlook. On the right side of that slide, we are providing 2020 EPS early outlook midpoint of $6.61 per share. The midpoint of this early outlook provides 7.5% EPS growth from the 2019 original guidance.","On the next 2 slides, I\u2019ll be going over the early outlook for our 4 largest business units, but if I move on to those slides to discuss the year-over-year drivers, I\u2019ll mention that Energy Trading\u2019s 2020 operating earnings range of $15 million to $25 million, which is the economic contribution range we typically target for this business. Also, our Corporate and Other segment grows in 2020 with the interest on the equity converts and this returns to a lower steady state when they are converted to equity.","So now let\u2019s \u2013 let me move on to Slide 9. And I\u2019ll start on the left hand side of the page. Our 2020 early outlook midpoint for DTE Electric segment is $766 million. This provides earnings growth of 8.7% over 2019 original guidance. The early outlook includes distribution and generation investment growth. Longer term, the Electric segment will continue to grow by 7% to 8%.","Moving to the right hand side of the page at our DTE Gas segment of the 2020 early outlook midpoint is $189 million, the 2019 original guidance midpoint was $175 million, the early outlook provides earnings growth of 8% of the 2019 original guidance. So this year-over-year increase is in line with our long-term growth target for DTE Gas and is driven by the continuation of our accelerated main renewal program. Longer term, we expect the Gas segment to grow at the higher end of our 8% to 9% growth rate.","Now move on to Slide 10 to review our early outlook for our non-utilities. Again, starting on the left hand side of the page on the Gas Storage and Pipeline business, our original guidance for 2019 for this segment was $213 million and increases to $285 million in 2020. Now this represents an increase of 34%. That increase is mainly due to the acquisition of the midstream assets in the prolific Haynesville Basin. And previously, we said the annual increase to our GSP segment earnings would be approximately 12%, so we\u2019ve essentially accelerated growth into 2020.","Now GSP had an active year in 2019, acquiring Generation Pipeline, an additional 30% stake in the Link SGG, and of course, the Blue Union and LEAP assets. All these will contribute to what we expect to be another strong year at GSP in 2020. We\u2019ve been planning carefully in 2020 given the market conditions we\u2019re seeing, and these new platforms will allow us to build growth objectives and rebase the whole company at a higher growth rate.","Now moving into right side of the page. Our P&I segment is $14 million higher in 2020 versus 2019. This segment continues to drive earnings and value for the company. This earnings increase is from the work we\u2019ve been doing over the last few years as we originate new projects and income to replace REF when it fully sunsets. We\u2019ve secured additional REF units that will generate strong cash flows for the next 2 years, reducing equity needs.","As you look out to when REF sunsets to the end of 2021, we remain confident that the backfill of REF will occur between these 2 non-utilities segment and the total portfolio, and we\u2019ll be well within our targeted 70% to 75% utility mix. As you can see these 2 non-utilities are bringing a build lift of earnings here in 2020. We will be providing a detailed update at EEI in a few weeks.","Now on to Slide 11 to cover the balance sheet. We expect to issue a total of $500 million of \u2013 in equity here in 2019, including $300 million of acquisition equity financing, and $200 million has already been issued through internal mechanisms. For the 3 years 2020 to 2022, we will be issuing $1.5 billion to $2 billion of equity, including convertible equity units related to the acquisition. And in 2020, we will be issuing $300 million of equity using internal mechanism.","For 2019, we are increasing our cash and capital guidance for this \u2013 for the year due to the investment in our new midstream assets, and you can find the updated cash and capital guidance in the appendix. We have a strong credit rating at all 3 agencies, which is very important to us. S&P is a strong BBB with an excellent business risk profile, and Moody\u2019s and Fitch are one notch above S&P. We have reviewed our recent midstream transaction with all agencies and expect to maintain a strong credit rating.","S&P has indicated that we will hold a strong BBB and also our excellent business risk profile, so a great outcome there. Fitch and Moody\u2019s did take some action on their current rating. Moody\u2019s has revised the rating to a Baa2, which falls in line with S&P. We will have plenty of balance sheet cushion with the ratings of both agencies. Our goal is to continue to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating. That wraps up my section on 2019 earnings guidance and the 2020 early outlook.","Now I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Jerry to wrap things up.","Jerry Norcia","Thanks, Peter. I\u2019ll wrap up on Slide 12 and then open up the line for questions. 2019 is shaping up to be a strong year as evidenced by our guidance increase, so we expect and continue our pattern of exceeding original guidance for over a decade. You can tell from our 2020 early outlook that we are planning for another strong year next year. The 2020 operating EPS midpoint of $6.61 provides 7.5% growth from our 2019 original guidance. The side\u2019s growth rate is driven by a strong performance at all of our business units, with healthy growth at our 2 utilities, continued business development at P&I and the near-term EPS accretion from our recent GSP midstream acquisition. For 2020, GSP\u2019s growth is more than double what we had anticipated.","Going forward, we will continue to target a 5% to 7% EPS growth with 2020 outlook as the base of that growth. Our 7% dividend increase for 2020 demonstrates our confidence in the company\u2019s performance and long-term strategic plan.","Our utilities continue to focus on necessary infrastructure investments, specifically for investments to improve reliability and the customer experience. Our non-utilities continue to position us for long-term growth.","Finally, I feel great about our ability to continue to deliver the premium total shareholder returns we have delivered over the past decade.","And with that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And, Sergey, you can open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citi. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning.","Praful Mehta","Good morning. So maybe just first, starting with the equity that you pointed out on Slide 11, the $1.5 billion to $2 billion in 2020 to 2022, I\u2019m assuming in 2022 you\u2019re including approximately what $825 million of mandatory converts?","Peter Oleksiak","They do include the mandatory converts. It will be approximately $1 billion related to the acquisition, but the $1.5 billion to $2 billion does include those converts.","Praful Mehta","Okay. Got you. That\u2019s helpful. And the 2020 guidance that you provide, all that includes is an additional $300 million of equity in 2020. So, I just wanted to understand the share count that you\u2019re using for that 2020 guide.","Jerry Norcia","Yes, we have $300 million that we will be issuing next year in 2020. And here in 2019, we will be issuing the $500 million that we previously disclosed.","Praful Mehta","Got you. And just finally, I just want to stay on the credit theme, I guess. You mentioned that a couple of the agencies clearly expressed some concern. Do you see any scenario where there is additional need to issue equity in a particular business? I guess, how the business kind of moves forward from here? Do you expect any need to issue additional equity to kind of satisfy the rating agency concerns?","Jerry Norcia","No, I do not. The S&P rating, in particular, our strong BBB and excellent business risk profile, we were really targeting that. So we are very happy with that outcome. It gives us \u2013 actually, we have a lot of cushion even within that current rating and profile.","Moody\u2019s did fall in line with S&P. A part of the issue with Moody\u2019s is they do not recognize the converts as equity. So that was one of the reasons behind the action they took, but with their new rating, we have a lot of cushion as well. So, we\u2019re feeling really good where we\u2019re at with the rating agencies at this point.","Praful Mehta","All right, great. Thanks so much guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning team.","Jerry Norcia","Hey, Julien.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Howdy. Perhaps, if I can come back to just the transaction last week, help clarify just a quick follow-up here. I mean, as you think about that $0.45 in the organic growth of that business, just again, to come back to off of the run rate 2021, 2022, 10 times multiple, how do you think about that? That\u2019s a \u2013 how do you think about the growth to the 5-year outlook first-off just to reconcile that, and I\u2019ve got a follow.","Jerry Norcia","Well, I think, Julien, the first thing is that the transaction supports the 7.5% growth, 2019 over 2020. And then as we\u2019ve mentioned, we reestablished 2020 as the base for the 5% to 7% growth going forward long-term. So, we view the transaction not only as providing a lift, 2019 over 2020, but certainly provided an uplift long term as well in the plan and filled all the growth needs that we have at GSP.","Peter Oleksiak","I think just to add on as well in this segment in particular, we\u2019re feeling really good with the growth rate going forward. We will be talking in more detail at EEI about this. I can tell you though that we have a previous disclosure out there of 2023, and we\u2019re going to be more than achieving that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, okay. But just from a planning perspective, as you think about the other investments that have been talked about before, the NEXUS laterals, Link expansion capital, perhaps generator and connections. What are you thinking about it? And I know we\u2019re getting ahead of the GSP disclosures perhaps coming up here in a couple weeks. But I just want to clarify, what else are you thinking about out there on GSP?","Jerry Norcia","Well, Julien, again I\u2019ll repeat that. It certainly supports the 7.5% growth, 2019 over 2020. And if you lock in that growth and then grow 5% to 7% from there, this transaction as well as the other investments in GSP, and let\u2019s not forget that the bulk of our investment is going into our 2 utilities, those high growth rates from our utilities, high growth rate from GSP, as well as the strong growth off the P&I base will support 5% to 7% growth over the new 2020 base, and we\u2019ll provide a lot more detail by business segment at EEI.","Peter Oleksiak","Yeah, we will, and in this segment in particular, we have some great growth platforms now, so we\u2019re not looking for any big new acquisitions. So, we have a lot of opportunities. You mentioned a few just in your question there. So between Link and NEXUS, and now this new Blue Union and LEAP asset, we\u2019re going to have a lot of organic growth opportunities, but we\u2019ll give more updates here at EEI.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. If I can clarify quickly the early 2020 outlook, I mean it looks like it implies even ex the latest transaction, a pretty healthy degree of growth off the 2019 base for GSP. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that? I mean, as you say, it seems like a 12% type growth number?","Jerry Norcia","Well, two things, the transaction, as we mentioned, is providing significant accretion next year. So, it is filling a portion of the growth objective of GSP, but I can tell you we\u2019re also planning very carefully for the balance of the platform at GSP in light of market conditions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Nothing specific though, and that\u2019s for next year.","Jerry Norcia","That\u2019s for next year.","Peter Oleksiak","That\u2019s for next year, correct.","Jerry Norcia","So we\u2019re working very closely with all the producers. So our plans reflect that. It will be in \u2013 be very careful.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. All right. Well, I look forward to see you guys and hear more in a couple of weeks. Cheers.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Sullivan","Hey, good morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning.","Michael Sullivan","Yeah. So first, I just wanted to follow-up on that last question. So is there any more detail that you can give us as to how the base midstream business is growing sort of ex the transaction you just did. And then I think also the \u2013 upping the stake in Link and the Generation Pipe, just kind of, what the base business is doing? And how that stacks up to what you were previously anticipating?","Jerry Norcia","Well, what we can say is that if you look at all those investments and that drives a 30% \u2013 34% growth year-over-year in the GSP segment, and overall, allowed us to lift our corporate growth of 7.5% year-over-year, and sets us up really nicely long-term that meet our 5% to 7% growth corporately, along with our growth at our utility. So we typically don\u2019t describe each platform, but what I can tell you, I\u2019ll repeat is that the balance of our platforms, we are planning for it very carefully next year in light of the market conditions. So the 34% reflects that and supports our 7.5% growth year-over-year.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, thanks. And then switching over to P&I. Can you just give any color around the recently acquired REF units that you mentioned? How much of a contribution that was towards 2020 and when those will roll off?","Jerry Norcia","Yeah, we did acquire some new units that here in the late summer, and we did redeploy those at existing sites, where with it some units were sunsetting. So REF is flat. The way to think about is, REF is flat year-over-year. So the growth we\u2019re seeing is really around the origination that we\u2019ve been doing over the last few years. These additional units in REF will contribute about $30 million over the next couple of years, which is a really nice chunk of cash and it really helps reduce equity needs over the next 3 years.","Michael Sullivan","Okay. And when do those roll off, the new ones that you just acquired?","Jerry Norcia","Yeah. The new ones as well as all the existing is the end of 2021. They all sunset at that point in time.","Michael Sullivan","Great. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Just one quick one. Obviously, a nice dividend increase today. My question is going forward, is there any change to the dividend policy, given the mix shift with about 35% of next year\u2019s earnings come from \u2013 coming from the non-utilities, and all the credit updates that you talked about earlier? How do we think about the dividend policy going forward?","Jerry Norcia","Well, typically, we have said and continue to maintain that will grow dividends in line with our earnings growth, but we\u2019ll be able to provide a little more color in detail on that at EEI as to how will it look going forward. But certainly it will be in line with earnings growth.","Peter Oleksiak","With earnings growth. Yeah, we haven\u2019t really changed that philosophy, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. So the same policy will continue going forward then?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. That\u2019s correct.","Jerry Norcia","That\u2019s correct.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey, guys.","Jerry Norcia","Hey, good morning, Shahriar.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza","I apologize, I jumped on a second late. The comment that you made just around planning in light of market conditions, so like the 33.8% includes that. Is that \u2013 can you just elaborate what you mean by that? And is that tied to a specific asset in the producer. So I\u2019m kind of curious if you can just touch a little bit on what you mean by that?","Jerry Norcia","Well, we\u2019re looking at all our platform, Shahriar. And certainly, we\u2019re operating in a low price environment. So as we continue our conversations and discussions with our partners, we are forecasting earnings growth of 34% in this business line in light of these market conditions. If the market conditions improve, things could change. But certainly, we\u2019re planning carefully for this business segment at this point in time. In addition to the balance of our portfolio, which we feel very comfortable will help us deliver a 7.5% growth year-over-year.","Shahriar Pourreza","So this isn\u2019t really tied to credit quality or financial conditions of the actual producers, but more of a pricing environment, which\u2026","Jerry Norcia","Both pricing and production. Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay. Got it. And then just as you guys look at the contracts, what remains at NEXUS. There is a portion of it, obviously, that\u2019s still under short-term contracts. Is that \u2013 are these market conditions, do they continue to dictate that you\u2019ll remain within that kind of a tenure of these contracts? Or is there an opportunity to actually contract longer term?","Jerry Norcia","Sure. We have started to see interest in and terming out longer than we\u2019ve seen in the past. So we find that as an encouraging signal from the market that there is desire to contract somewhat slightly longer-term. And so we continue to move our contract portfolio in excess in that direction. So we are seeing positive signal there.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. Got it. And let me just ask you one last one. Is the signals that you are seeing as far as longer-term contracts, is that predicated on the delay of 2 existing pipe projects?","Jerry Norcia","Certainly, we think that could be having an impact. And, of course, production continues to grow in the Appalachia at this point in time. So we believe that it\u2019s a combination of those factors was creating more interest.","Shahriar Pourreza","Perfect. Thanks, guys. Congrats.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I have a question about your renewable natural gas type of plans and investments. I mean, we\u2019ve seen this sharp decline in RIN prices. And I\u2019m just wondering, if you guys have a view where those prices will go and how it\u2019s being depicted in your 2020 guidance?","Peter Oleksiak","So thank you for that question. The bulk of our returns from RNG asset investments are in the dairy sector, and most of the value from that comes from the low carbon fuel standard that exists in California to displace essentially diesel and gasoline in the CNG markets. We have seen a decline in the RIN pricings, but we have seen it also start to recover recently. But it forms a small portion of our forecast for these assets and these investments, which with the LCFS they still remain very attractive assets and very attractive returns.","Our outlook, you asked, how do we feel about how it\u2019s looking. Feel that the EPA will issue a volume obligation. They\u2019ll be more in line with the supply that\u2019s available. And I believe that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting to see somewhat of whatever recovery in the pricing for the RINs.","Angie Storozynski","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Sophie Karp","Hi, good morning.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning, Sophie.","Sophie Karp","[Technical Difficulty] question, so just wanted to come back real quick to the midstream segment, the $0.15 accretion that you talked about on the call earlier, when you announced the deal? Is this fair to think about the 2020 as $0.15 of the growth comes from that and the rest from other organic opportunities at this time?","Jerry Norcia","Yeah. Actually that\u2019s a good way of thinking about it. Yeah, the 15%. Part of that 7.5% includes that 15% for sure.","Sophie Karp","$0.15 you mean?","Jerry Norcia","Yeah, $0.15. Yeah.","Sophie Karp","Okay. Thank you. And then, I wanted to dig a little more into utility earnings. So being roughly flat year-over-year in the DTE Electric rate. And I understand there\u2019s been a weather volatility last year and this year. But sort of the way you describe it, if we stripped away the weather impacts completely, would that have grown in line with your, kind of, long-term rate that you\u2019re projecting? And is there something within the rate implementation growth, of course, that is unusual this year?","Jerry Norcia","Yeah, that\u2019s correct. We had \u2013 last year was one of the hottest we\u2019ve had here \u2013 on record here in Michigan in the region. So you take that away and normalize weather this year, we had positive weather this year of $27 million, but last year was much higher. That was over $60 million, that when you take that away, kind of, look at the rate base growth, it will be in line with the 7% to 8% that we expect from this segment.","Sophie Karp","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Fishman","Hey, good morning.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning.","David Fishman","Just going back to the Haynesville acquisition and thinking about the $600 million of growth CapEx. I was just wondering, and I apologize if you said this on the call a couple weeks ago. But when you think about the $600 million, I know part of its related to the LEAP growth. But is there something that effectively guarantees that growth happening? Or is that just based on your expectation for expansions based on Blue Union and where you think demand will be?","Jerry Norcia","Actually, all of the growth is fully contracted with Indigo. And so the $600 million plus the other $400 million that we talked about approximately about $1 billion is fully contracted growth over the next 18 to 24 months.","David Fishman","Okay. So that\u2019s something you already have the contracts in place for and that will be achieved?","Jerry Norcia","Yes. That\u2019s correct.","David Fishman","Okay. And then going back to the equity guidance. So I think you discussed this a little bit, but its $1.5 billion to $2 billion, and then $1 billion of that is the convert? And then it says you can do about $300 million internally. Is that \u2013 are you able to do that kind of level every year of $200 million to $300 million of equity internally to getting you to around the midpoint or higher end if needed?","Jerry Norcia","Yes, David for the next few years, we should be able to do up $200 million to $300 million, a lot of that is going into funding our pension, which were a few years away from doing that.","David Fishman","Okay. And then my last question, I think, you\u2019re alluding a little bit to, I mean, NEXUS, maybe there are some other parties, who are looking to potentially kind of term out those contracts, which is good. But also just thinking about the generation pipeline and connecting there, could you remind us what those contracts, kind of look like or if they\u2019re \u2013 are they 5 years or are they in the double-digits? And then, also if you were to contract with them, would it likely be the off-taker side or would it be a producer looking into contract on NEXUS?","Jerry Norcia","Well, the generation pipeline, just to remind everyone, is very proximal to the NEXUS pipeline. And it stands on its own, with its own long-term contracts. And it gives us a nice return and nice accretion. The plan is to connect that asset with several miles of pipe to NEXUS. And that will provide approximately 400 million to 500 million a day outlet for that pipeline. But again, just to repeat, we do have long-term contracts, they are about 13 years in length, so very nicely contracted piece of pipe with demand charges.","David Fishman","Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate it and congrats again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Fremont of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Anthony Crowdell","Hey, good morning guys. It\u2019s Anthony Crowdell.","Jerry Norcia","Hey, Anthony.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Crowdell","Hi. You may have addressed this on the actual call maybe two weeks ago. But one is just if you \u2013 what makes you confident on the competitiveness of the Haynesville? And then second, just if you could help me understand the difference between minimum volume commitment charges and also with demand charge.","Peter Oleksiak","So let\u2019s start with the competitiveness of the Haynesville. We had the opportunity through this transaction to review all 1,700 of their proposed drilling locations. And we did that ourselves along with 2 reserve consultants. And we can tell you, after that analysis, we felt that the resource is extremely strong, whereby there are at least 10 years of drilling available at sub $2 prices. So that\u2019s one.","Number two, the pipeline is being constructed, creates great interconnectivity with the Gulf Coast markets, including industrial, power and the emerging LNG markets. And the proximity to those markets provides a very large basis advantage that other resource basins don\u2019t enjoy. So we felt that the quality of the resource, the interconnectivity of the resource with growing markets, and three, the positioning of the resource, which provides it with basis advantage, create a really nice package of high returns and strong cash flows.","In terms of MVCs and demand charges they are essentially the same thing. MVCs are monthly demand charges, just that in the gathering business they call it a minimum volume commitment. And in our pipeline businesses, including the pipeline that we\u2019re building for this asset, they call it a demand charge. But they are essentially equivalent in nature.","Anthony Crowdell","Great, thanks. Thanks for taking my question.","Peter Oleksiak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill of UBS. Please go ahead.","Gregg Orrill","Yes, thank you. Apologize if you\u2019ve said this already, but how much are you issuing in new converts related to the acquisition and when?","Peter Oleksiak","Yeah, we\u2019ll be issuing approximately $1 billion. And we\u2019re going to finalize the exact dollar amount here shortly, but it will be about $1 billion.","Gregg Orrill","And when would that be?","Peter Oleksiak","It will be here in the fourth quarter. We want to close this transaction early December. So we\u2019re going to be looking at the market and working conditions, but it will be between now and then.","Gregg Orrill","Thank you, Peter.","Peter Oleksiak","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman of Morningstar Research. Please go ahead.","Charles Fishman","Good morning. I only have one left. On the P&I segment, I didn\u2019t hear you talk or give any update on any industrial projects. I think with the last one you had was the Ford complex? Or is that something you want to wait the EEI for or anything you can talk about now?","Jerry Norcia","We essentially have secured 3 co-gens this year. One we were \u2013 two we were public about, Stelco, in Ontario with their Lake Erie Works facility. We signed a long-term arrangement with them to develop a co-gen Facility. And then we also have a commercial customer that we haven\u2019t yet disclosed that we signed a purchase agreement with, the purchase at co-gen facility.","And lastly, we signed an operating agreement with Wayne County for their correctional facility to operate their industrial services assets. In addition to that, we also closed two RNG projects in Wisconsin this year. So, three co-gens and two RNG projects, which gives us to be approximately the $15 million origination target that we are pursuing this year.","Charles Fishman","So, I guess, gas price somewhat bearish outlook that people have, that is a little bit of a tailwind for these co-gen projects, correct?","Jerry Norcia","Yeah, there are really two factors. One is the fact that gas prices continue to be at low levels. And secondly, electric rates continue to rise, so the spread between gas and electric to produce power continues to widen and that creates an attractive opportunity for customers that have won a large electric need. And two are usually typically have steam host as well.","Charles Fishman","So it\u2019s when a customer has that thermal need is where you see the opportunities?","Jerry Norcia","Yes.","Charles Fishman","Got it. Okay.","Jerry Norcia","There is a high thermal need and a large electricity need. Those two factors make co-gens very attractive.","Charles Fishman","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Jerry Norcia for any additional or closing remarks.","Jerry Norcia","Well, I\u2019ll wrap up by thanking everyone for joining the call. 2019 again is shaping up to be another very successful year. We look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in a few weeks, where we will describe in more detail our growth strategies and our 5-year outlook for each business line.","We\u2019ll also describe our financing and dividend strategies in more detail. DTE story will continue to be a strong one into the future that will deliver premium shareholder returns. So thanks again for joining us and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. That will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect."],"8022":["DTE Energy Co.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Barbara Tuckfield. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Barbara Tuckfield","Thank you, Alicia, and good morning everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to read the Safe Harbor statement on page two of the presentation. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","With us are Gerry Anderson, Chairman and CEO; Jerry Norcia, President and COO; and Peter Oleksiak, Senior Vice President and CFO. We also have members of the management team to call on during the Q&A.","Now I'll turn the call over to Gerry.","Gerry Anderson","All right. Well thank you, Barb, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. So this morning, I am going to give you a quick recap of our performance in 2017, as well as an updated preview of our performance in 2018, updated versus EEI last year. I will also describe how tax reform impacts DTE and our customers, and then I will turn it over to Peter, who will review our financial highlights and provide a bit more detail on the impact of tax reform on our 2018 guidance, and then finally, Jerry Norcia will provide an update on our long term growth plan, and he will wrap things up before Q&A.","So we have a lot to be proud of, as we look back on 2017, not only financially, but on many other fronts as well; and as I think will become clear to you, my confidence is high that we are very well positioned for success in 2018.","So I will start with a quick recap of our accomplishments in 2017, beginning on slide 5. I think that those of you who have talked with me over the years, know that I strongly believe that the company's success is ultimately determined by the strength of its culture.","Well, the culture at DTE is very healthy, and that bodes well for the future. In 2017, our employee engagement was in the top 4% of Gallup's worldwide database, and that's the highest employee engagement score we have ever achieved in our 20 years of tracking engagement here at the company through Gallup. Early in 2017 we earned our fifth consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. We remain the only utility ever to receive it, and we hope we are positioned to receive our sixth consecutive award, early this year.","We also hit one of the safest years in the company's history. We received the American Gas Association Safety Achievement Award for the second year in a row. Safety is a priority for obvious reasons, but it's also a great indicator of your employee's level of focus and their discipline.","We produced some very strong results for our customers in 2017 as well. Both, our Electric and Gas companies were ranked highest in customer satisfaction with business customers in the Midwest, in JD Power's 2017 study. This is the first time in our history that we have held down two JD Power number one trophies simultaneously.","Additionally, we ranked second in overall satisfaction with Electric and Gas residential customers in the Midwest, and our combined ranking of number one, one, two, two is the best overall customer satisfaction outcome in DTE's history.","We continue to target improvements in these results, in the customer satisfaction results, and as we have said before, biggest lever for achieving those improvements remains modernizing our grid and improving Electric liability. And with that in mind, we have made significant investments in recent years, including last year, to improve reliability, and we really feel those investments are paying off. And during 2017, our grid reliability was tested by the most damaging windstorm in our history, with near hurricane force winds gusting to 70 miles an hour, leaving nearly 40% of our Electric customers without Power.","And during a massive restoration effort, we restored about 70% of our customers in two days and over 95% in four days, and that storm restoration effort earned us EEI's Emergency Recovery Award. And as I look back on last year, this storm restoration effort is one of the things of which I am proudest. I think you know, that historic storms can bring companies in our industry to their knees, and put them in the penalty box with regulators and customers, and we had the opposite experience last year. We achieved the highest customer satisfaction ratings in our history, in the wake of this event, and that is the product of tireless effort of our employees to restore our communities as quickly as possible.","Storm was also a testament to our continuous improvement practices. We have put a lot of effort into revamping our storm restoration processes, and it made a difference. We are focusing those same CI disciplines and productivity and cost containment and efficiency, and the results of those efforts is our ability to have O&M growth, that is among the lowest in the industry, which is helping to keep customer bills at levels that work.","I'm also proud, moving on to slide 6, of our efforts to be a force for growth in the communities we serve. So these efforts earned us the number one ranking in the Midwest for corporate citizenship by JD Power, and we are making significant investments in Michigan. We spent $1.7 billion with Michigan based companies in 2017, which exceeded our commitment to the pure Michigan business connect, local supplier initiative. You know, as I look back to 2010 when we started all of this, we were spending less than $0.5 billion a year with Michigan suppliers. So it has been a great effort, and our seven year effort to increase spending with those suppliers has created nearly 16,000 jobs in our state.","We also announced a broad sustainability initiative in 2017, that will reduce the company's carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2015, setting in the process, the long term strategic direction for our Power generation fleet, and providing leadership on what I consider to be a vital public policy issue.","But we have always said that if you serve your customers well and if you manage our costs and rates well, and if you are a positive force in your community, your odds of having constructive regulation are a lot higher, and Michigan's regulatory environment continues to be constructive.","That said, I will say our commission has a lot on its plate right now. In 2017, Michigan began implementing the energy legislation that passed in 2016, which has significantly added to the workload of our commission. It has essentially added a second job on top of the many cases and issues that they normally work through, and our job is to keep working constructively with them to define group policy outcomes for Michigan.","And in that vein, in 2018, we have a few key priorities on the regulatory front; the first is working through how our customers will get a break on their bills from tax reform, which will provide a significant boost to our efforts to maintain customer affordability, as we continue to invest heavily in modernizing ageing infrastructure. Those tax reductions to bills are priority one. The second, is that we need to finalize the certificate and necessity for our 1,100 megawatt new combined cycle plant. So this plant, along with our renewable Power investments is the way that we will backfill the retirement of three end-of-life coal plants, totaling over 2,000 megawatts, that will come offline in the early 2020s. And this Gas plant is also an essential step in the carbon reduction plan that I just mentioned a minute ago.","And then finally, we need to achieve reasonable rate case outcomes. Outcomes that allow us to continue to upgrade and modernize our infrastructure and invest in the cleaner generation I have just described and improve reliability for our customers.","So I know you all follow our rate case proceedings closely, and as is often the case, there are other filed positions out there, but we do remain confident that we are in a position to get good constructive outcomes in these cases that are consistent with our plan.","Now moving on to growth and value creation; as I already mentioned, we continued to invest in renewing our utility infrastructure in 2017, and that will continue this year. Our non-utility businesses had a number of big wins in 2017. So on our Gas, Storage, and Pipelines business, our Bluestone pipeline achieved a 1 BCF per day delivery milestone, with additional expansions on the horizon.","We made significant progress on the Nexus pipeline and it's construction, and we remain on track for in-service late in the third quarter this year. We also initiated three new projects in our Power and Industrial business, including a sizable energy service project with Ford Motor Company, where we will build on and operate a host of advanced energy systems to Power Ford's research and engineering center, helping them to achieve a nearly 50% energy use reduction.","Power and Industrial also closed two RNG or renewable natural gas acquisitions in 2017, which will produce renewable gas to be used in vehicle fleets to meet carbon reduction goals.","In 2018 at P&I, we have a number of promising initiatives underway, and the same is true for GSP and Jerry will touch on those a bit more later.","So now let's turn over to slide 7 to talk about our 2017 financial results, and our guidance for 2018. So operating earnings per share in 2017 were $5.59, marking the ninth consecutive year that we have exceeded our original guidance. And for the first time in company history, we exceeded $1 billion in operating earnings.","In 2018, tax reform is allowing us to reduce customer rates, which I will detail a bit further in a minute. Tax reform will also benefit our shareholders. So we have increased our 2018 guidance by $0.10 per share versus the EPS guidance that we provided at the EEI conference last November. This increased guidance to $5.78 is also the new base for our 5% to 7% earnings per share growth projections, and it is a 9% increase from the original 2017 EPS guidance that we provided a year ago.","So we will provide additional color on how the tax bills affect individual business units down the road. But that said, the $0.10 per share increase in our guidance is wholly tied to the non-utility businesses in the early years of the plan. The utilities will begin to contribute to the increase in the latter part of the five year plan, as the rate base funding of the utilities transitions from deferred taxes to a higher mix of equity and debt. And so in the latter portion of our five year plan, EPS accretion from tax reform [indiscernible] actually grows to -- in the range of $0.13 per share.","Then finally as we mentioned, at EEI, we will continue to target dividend increases of 7% through 2020, and the goal there is to get our payout ratio in line with our peer average, and then we will continue to grow dividends in line with earnings after that.","So before I talk about the impacts of tax reform further, I want to highlight our efforts to maintain customer affordability, and I do that on slide 8. So as mentioned earlier, we are well positioned among our peers in our cost control efforts, and this is evidenced by our ability to continue to lower customer bills and business rates over the past five years. So average annual residential Electric bills have decreased by 5% over the last five years. Gas bills, down 9% over the same period. Industrial Electric rates have declined by 14% through 2017, while Gas rates have decreased by 17%.","So we have used our CI disciplines to drive these productivity increases, but we are also increasingly doing this work through technology deployment and the modernization of aging infrastructure, and then add into those, declining Gas prices have certainly helped on the affordability front as well.","So this focus, along with substantial savings from tax reform that will accrue to customers, will go a long way toward maintaining the customer affordability we want. ","And speaking of tax reform, I am going to move on to slide 9, to provide a little more color on that topic. So plain and simple, tax reform is good for our customers and good for our shareholders. So let me frame up how it affects each.","First, this is a good thing for our utility customers. We plan to pass $190 million in savings on to our customers, tied to the reduction in current tax expense, and then additionally, we anticipate refunding on the order of $70 million annually, as a result of the remeasurement of deferred taxes at the two utilities in future rate proceedings. We are working closely with our regulators right now to determine how we will flow these tax savings back to our customers.","So the second point I will make in tax reform, is that it is good for our shareholders. As I mentioned earlier, it's $0.10 accretive, beginning immediately in 2018 and our 5% to 7% growth builds from this higher 2018 guidance. Operating earnings grow at our utilities over time. For our non-utility businesses, the tax benefit will accrue immediately to us on existing contracts, and I might mention, that our existing contracts at GSP have very little exposure to lower FERC recourse rates, the exposure is on the order of $1 million, maybe $2 million.","With respect to future non-utility business contracts, every project and every negotiation has its own dynamics, and includes a lot of variables. And depending on the nature of the competition, the tax benefit may accrue to us, if there is higher competition, may accrue to our customer, or as I expect, will often be the case we may share the upside the tax changes have created.","With respect to the impact to tax reform on our balance sheet, we rolled out a plan at EEI last fall, that called for an incremental $3 billion in capital, and that plan called for $500 million of equity over the next three years. So as a result of tax reform, we see the need for a modest additional $300 million, so when we put the two together, $800 million over the next three years. We are doing that, because we are committed to maintaining balance sheet metrics that support our current credit ratings and maintaining balance sheet flexibility.","That said, you know we always look for ways to minimize equity issuances by strengthening cash flows, and we have often been successful in doing just that in the past.","Now I am going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to talk a bit more about our financial results. Peter, over to you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks Gerry. Just looking at the financials, just one comment on my Detroit Tigers. Never really an off season in baseball, even though there is snow on the ground here in Detroit, spring training is in full motion, down in Florida, and there is -- hope springs eternal for the Tigers to beat the odds in 2018.","With the financials, I will start on slide 11; as Gerry mentioned, 2017 came in strong, with earnings of $1 billion or $5.59 per share. For reference, our reported earnings were $1.1 billion or $6.32 per share, and you can find the detailed breakdown of the earnings by segment, including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix. Overall, our growth segment's operating earnings were $981 million or $5.48 per share.","Now let me touch on each segments in detail, starting at the top with our Electric utility. DTE Electric operating earnings for the year were $617 million or $5 million lower than 2016, primarily driven by the cooler weather and higher storm expenses offset by the implementation of new rates. For more detailed year-over-year earnings variance for our DTE Electric segment, you can find that in our appendix.","DTE Gas operating earnings were $149 million or $11 million higher than 2016. Now this increase was driven primarily by new rate implementation, offset by higher depreciation expenses and property taxes related to capital.","For our Gas, Storage and Pipeline business, operating earnings were $160 million or $2 million to $3 million higher than 2016. This increase was due to a full year of Link earnings pipeline and gathering growth. Operating earnings for the Power and Industrial businesses were $124 million or $29 million higher than 2016. This is primarily due to both incremental REF sites and volumes and higher steel related earnings in 2017.","Rounding out our growth segment is the corporate and other segment, which was $10 million unfavorable, compared to 2016, and is due to higher interest expense. Energy trading had operating earnings of $20 million in 2017, down $5 million. Our trading company contributed $29 million of economic income in 2017, which is in line with target levels. The appendix contains our standard energy trading reconciliations, showing both economic and accounting performance. Overall, DTE earned $5.59 per share, $0.31 higher per share than 2016 EPS.","Now I will switch over to 2018 guidance on slide 12; Gerry mentioned, due to tax reform, we are increasing our operating earnings guidance from the early outlook we provided to you at EEI. There is no change in 2018 to the guidance for the two utilities. But over time, changes in our capital structure will increase earnings, as more utility rate bases blended with equity instead of deferred taxes. Also utility equity will grow faster than rate base growth.","The EPS guidance range is now $5.57 to $5.99, up from a range of $5.48 to $5.88. The $0.10 per share increase from the early outlook guidance, this point is driven by our non-utility businesses. The GSP and P&I businesses see immediate earnings benefits from the lower tax rate from 35% to 21%, contributing an incremental $30 million at GSP and $15 million at P&I. Corporate and other earnings will decrease by $26 million due to the lower tax yield on interest expense. Energy trading will also benefit tax reforms, but we left the low end of guidance the same, due to how we conservatively plan and forecast eh earnings for energy trading.","Gerry mentioned earlier, the $0.10 EPS accretion we see here in 2018, will grow to $0.13 by 2022, driven by utility earnings growth. For the non-utilities, a $0.13 assumes tax benefits on existing contracts only. So we share some of the tax benefits going forward on new deals that could help achieve our long term non-utility growth targets or potentially provide upside. Our cash and capital guidance for 2018 can be found in the appendix.","Now I'd like to move to balance sheet metrics on slide 13; we have been consistent in our messaging over the years, that maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority. As one of the companies or industry that benefits from tax reform, we are able to deliver EPS accretion, at the same time maintaining strong balance sheet metrics. One item that is benefitting cash in near term, is the way that the AMT credits will work. Looking at cash refund of $300 million over four years, which partially offsets lower cash flows of the utilities.","At EEI, we announced $500 million of equity needs through 2020, to fund the increase in our investment plan. As Gerry described, as a result of tax reform, we will be issuing an additional $300 million over the next three years.","For the calendar year 2018, our plan is to issue $300 million of equity using a trail mechanism. One way to think about it, is the additional $100 million that is due to the tax reform, embedded within that $300 million. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, and we will target FFO to debt of 18% to 19%, which is in line with metrics needed to support our growing credit ratings.","For the next several years, our pension will be fully funded, which creates some additional flexibility in our FFO to debt targets, and keeps us well within the range of our current ratings. We will look for ways to limit the amount of equity needed over the next three years, but under any outcome, tax reform is good for utility customers and good for shareholders.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Jerry Norcia, who will go over the long term plan for producing this earnings and dividend growth.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you, Peter. Those of you who have listened to our calls in the past, heard us talk about the transformation of our utility assets over time. A transformation that aims to produce excellent customer outcomes, while also achieving substantially higher productivity levels.","This will occur over the next 10 years and will be driven by significant investments and infrastructure for our customers. We are defining customer operational productivity goals to guide this transformation, and as Gerry mentioned earlier, we filed a Certificate of Necessity with the MPSC to build an 1,100 megawatt natural Gas fired Power plant. That plant along with renewable investments will backfill the retirement of the three coals in the early 2020s.","The nearly $1 billion project is scheduled to break ground in 2019 and will create hundreds of Michigan jobs during construction. Natural Gas fired plans will be an important complement to our renewable Power investments in the decades ahead, as natural Gas offers an affordable, abundant, low carbon, domestic fuel source, and is a reliable 24 by 7 Power source for our Electric customers.","We are also planning to construct up to 4,000 megawatts of additional renewable energy capacity over time. The next major renewable investment for both wind farms will occur in 2018 and 2020. In fact, we have just finalized our plans for a $260 million wind investment this year.","Our Electric company will also continue to invest heavily in grid hardening and grid automation. As the infrastructure ages, there is an ongoing need to invest in modernizing the system. As we invest in the distribution system, we will be very focused on ensuring affordability for our customers, and we will do this through substantial productivity increases over the next decade.","At DTE Gas, we continue to focus on accelerating the replacement of our aging cast iron and unprotected steel pipe. In our last Gas rate case, we proposed accelerating from a 25 year main renewal cycle to a 15 year cycle. At the same time, we continue to work to automate our Gas meters and move them outside to reduced costs. Finally, we will continue to invest in pipeline integrity to harden the system and ensure a very high standard of public safety.","Now I will move on to the non-utility businesses on slide 16. As Gerry mentioned, we had many accomplishments for our non-utility business last year. Our Gas Storage and Pipelines, much of our focus over the next few years will center on expanding our two newest growth platforms, Nexus and the Link pipeline. In 2017, we saw Nexus pipeline construction advancing, and are on track for a late third quarter in service date. We are progressing on pipe construction, right-of-way clearing, compressor station work and some horizontal directional drills this winter.","In 2018, we are seeing continued progress of both Nexus and Link. Nexus is finalizing agreements to construct laterals to new large Industrial customers. We also told you late last year, that we are in discussions with some of the producers about Nexus' capacity. The discussions continue to advance, and we are now exchanging proposals with producers to fill additional open capacity, giving us great confidence on our plan for this asset. We continue to be pleased with the interest in Nexus, as well as the construction milestones we are achieving.","We have consistently said, that the intensity of discussions among our remaining Nexus capacity ratcheted up as the pipe moved into construction, and that's what we are seeing play out.","Since we are under strict confidentiality agreements on these deals, we won't be able to provide any additional details at this point, as the deals become final, we will provide more information.","So moving on to our Linked asset, we recently doubled capacity, with an existing customer at an attractive rate. At our Bluestone asset in Pennsylvania, we achieved a 1 BCF per day delivery capacity milestone in 2017. This is pretty exciting, given that this pipeline started with 0.3 BCF per day capacity. We are expanding by an additional 0.1 BCF per day in 2018.","We also have a newly signed precedent agreement with APV Renaissance, the new lateral pipeline to connect to their Power plant. So all in all, I feel very good about the progress we have made at our GSP business, and I continue to feel we are on track to achieve our future goals.","Now I will talk about progress at our Power and Industrial business, on slide 17; we have already talked about the new projects that we originated in 2017. In November at EEI, we told you that we needed to originate $45 million of new growth by 2022, and that was to achieve an income target of $65 million in 2022. $15 million or one-third of that growth was originated last year, including a state of the art central energy plant and two renewable natural Gas projects that Gerry mentioned.","We also feel we have a good line of sight on the next $15 million in 2018, and we are well advanced with that, with projects in late stage discussions. So we could have two thirds of that 2022 growth target originated by the end of this year.","Tax reform may also help with this P&I growth, given that we may share the benefit with our customers on future projects. Back in November, we also told you about five co-generation sites we are in advanced discussions with, as well as four renewable natural Gas projects that we are pursuing. While I am pleased to tell you, that we are finalizing negotiations along those new RNG projects, we are also firming up agreements for our new large scale energy project. Given this start to 2018 and the fact that we have additional projects, we feel good about how P&I is positioned for the future growth.","Now I will turn over to slide 18 to wrap up. Once again, our strong 2017 extended a track record of exceeding original guidance. We are one of the companies in our industry, for whom tax reform provides benefits for our customers, while also benefitting investors. We increased our 2018 operating EPS guidance by midpoint by $0.10 per share, which will serve as a new base for our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth target through 2022.","Strength of our utilities and the growth of our non-utility businesses and a strong balance sheet, along with an annualized dividend growth target of 7%, gives me confidence that we will continue to deliver premium shareholder returns.","And with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So Alicia, you could open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go first to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Josephine Moore","Good morning everyone. It's Josephine here. How are you all?","Gerry Anderson","Good.","Josephine Moore","Just a few questions here this morning. First on the utilities side. As you were thinking about the upcoming IRP and the five year distribution plan, are there any additional CapEx opportunities that could develop from that? And then secondly on either any regulatory mechanisms that you are looking for, under that plan, to ensure more concurrent recovery of the spend?","Gerry Anderson","So I will start with the distribution plan. We are working very closely with the Public Service Commission staff right now. In fact, we are ramping up a process, where we have been laying out the distribution system needs over the next five years. It has been a really healthy open process, and I think what that is going to do, is essentially lay the logic for the capital expenditures that we have in the plan that we have laid out for you.","And then on the IRP front, I think the IRP is consistent with what we have said before, that we are going to retire -- if you look over the next five years or so, retire those two coal plants. We need this Gas plant to backfill those. We will continue to add renewables, both up through 2021, when the state target is 15%, but really beyond that as well. I fully expect that we will continue to add additional renewables, as the price on those continues to go down, and something our customers want us to do.","So as far as additional CapEx, to be honest, I think the plan we have laid out is one, it has got a healthy amount of work to renew our utility infrastructure, and that's what we are focused on executing.","Peter Oleksiak","This is Peter, Josephine, I think you are also asking about the recovery mechanism. This definitely will lay the potential groundwork for that, and that we are in early discussions with the staff and the commission on that.","Josephine Moore","Great. And then, on the P&I side, curious if you could just give a little bit more color on the guidance increase? Is that just tax reform, or does that also include volumetric and efficiency improvements?","Peter Oleksiak","That is just tax reforms.","Josephine Moore","Just tax reforms? Okay. Awesome. And then just one last question for GSP; as you are earning AFUDC on Nexus right now, and then the project moves into service, how are you thinking about the return profile on the project? Is there going to be any shift there in the earnings from Nexus?","Peter Oleksiak","The AFUDC is earned over time, as you are doing your capital spend. So when you look at it year-over-year, there is not going to be material change between the two. And as we put it in service, it gets them to the negotiated rates we have and it's a healthy targeted cost of capital we have on the project right now. But if anything, it really lays the ground work for additional expansions and investments around that platform.","Josephine Moore","Awesome. That's all on my end. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will go next to Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, good morning.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Hey, could you just remind us, the extra equity, the $300 million of incremental equity in addition to the $500 million at EEI, what's the method for that? Is it a secondary, or is it ATM?","Gerry Anderson","So we expect that this year, that it will be internal mechanisms. We have capacity for about $300 million in internal mechanisms. That varies year-by-year due to pension contributions and other things. But I think for the foreseeable future, we expect the vast majority would play out that way.","Michael Weinstein","Even the incremental amount?","Gerry Anderson","Yes.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, got you. And on the P&I side, I think you said that it'd be two thirds by the end of this year, towards the goal?","Jerry Norcia","That's what we are expecting.","Michael Weinstein","How long do you think it will be, before you actually finish completely?","Jerry Norcia","Well our forecast is to originate the $45 million by 2022. So I would say we are well in progress, with having two thirds completed this year in. We will have to revisit our target at the end of this year to see if there is any potential upside to that.","Gerry Anderson","Yeah, we have gotten a fast start on it. So we said last year, $45 million incremental needed. But we really think at the end of this year, it will be about $30 million into the $45 million, two years into the five years. And we will just keep evaluating, if the market keeps offering us opportunities at that pace as Jerry said, there could be some upside to what we talked about.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And maybe you could just remind everybody like what your thoughts are on M&A these day? There is a lot of activity going on in your region, lot of speculation. I am just wondering, what your thoughts are on M&A and the industry as a whole right now, based on -- especially now and with rates starting to rise, and the valuation of the Group as a whole, how do you view things?","Gerry Anderson","I view it pretty much the same way we always have. So we, with a high bar out there, for something that we think would actually be added to what we think is a good strong plan that we have. And so, we look -- but I think, the characteristics you need are something that actually genuinely brings efficiency and cost reduction, and maybe a handful that could do that. But as you know, you can't pay some of these really high premiums for that or all of that is given away and more.","So if we ever found one that was great for our customers through efficiency and could be done at low premium, maybe. But just say, we put a high bar out there for it, and don't see it at the forefront of our strategy right now.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza","Good morning guys. How are you doing? So you guys have never been capital constrained? Rates have always sort of been the governor. 3% reduction in rates from tax reform is somewhat material. So does this sort of provide an opportunity for you guys to accelerate some spending opportunities, or asked differently, many utilities seem to be submitting plans, to give back the tax savings through time and seem to be getting some preliminary support from the various commissioners, so why not retain some more of the savings and redeploy into sort of infrastructure needs, since you sort of have the opportunity to do so.","Gerry Anderson","When you say retain some of the savings, what do you mean Shahriar? Just so I am clear on the question you are asking?","Shahriar Pourreza","Well, sort of subsidized additional opportunities to accelerate some of the infrastructure needs that you have?","Gerry Anderson","I guess our reaction to this is that, we are actually very happy to have this reduction go back to customers, and to have it go back quickly. Because as you said, the thing that we worry most about, as we go through this, having infrastructure renewal cycle, is keeping it affordable. I think the one thing that differentiates, and actually if you look back over time, companies that do well, as you go through a heavy investment cycle versus those that don't, is how they manage it for the customers, whether their customers and regulators remain supportive. And a lot of that is tied to how affordable it remains. And so when we saw this, our reaction was good, it helps us achieve our targets for rates and rate levels.","Now I think what in the end that's going to do, is make feasible in a way that works for everybody, the capital plan that we have laid out here over the next five years, which is we have been saying, that's some very heavy infrastructure investments embedded in it. So that's the way we are thinking about it, and when we generally get asked, about upside as a result of this, we are trying to retain some of the tax savings for upside. That's not the way we are thinking about it, we are really thinking that it's a really helpful aid to the plan we have laid out, in terms of keeping things affordable.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. So supportive of the plan, but not anyway to accelerate the plan. Got it. And then just on Nexus, Gerry, appreciate the sensitivity of the discussions. But on sort of the conversations you are having on the demand pull and supply push sides. Can you at least sort of disclose if these opportunities are enough to finally fully subscribe the pipe?","Jerry Norcia","They certainly are. The size of the volumes that we are discussing would fill the pipe.","Shahriar Pourreza","Oversubscribe the pipe or just fill the pipe?","Jerry Norcia","We will start with fill at first.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning guys. You just answered my first question, so moving to some of the P&I tax uplifts. Could you just unpack the mechanics behind that a little bit, given the proportion of the earnings come out of REFs, just how we get -- where the uplift is coming from?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes, Jonathan, this is Peter. A portion of our facilities we have there, we essentially have sold down from a partnership perspective. So we have current cash and earnings related to that, that's where the uplift is coming from.","Now we mentioned, the $0.10 accretion here will go to $0.13 to essentially, that managed utility, and that REF will be replaced by utility accretion at the back end of the plan.","Jonathan Arnold","So it is effectively the incremental coming, because you have to make up once the REF piece steps down?","Peter Oleksiak","There is some tax benefit from REF, just because -- with those facilities that we have partners with.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. But that's what's driving the uplift in 2018, it's in the accounting in the partnership?","Peter Oleksiak","One way to think about it, by 2022, that is gone, but that will be replaced and then some by utilities.","Jonathan Arnold","Right. That is being $0.03 incremental, it's actually more than that.","Gerry Anderson","So just to add there, obviously on the partnership positions, there is some tax savings. We also have other projects that aren't already up, where there's obviously tax benefits as well on current contracts. And then the point Peter is making is, you go through the transition Jerry Norcia was describing, is we had R&D projects and Industrial projects and so forth. And current projects of that type, we have benefit on future projects. I expect it will be a shared benefit, where some of that goes through the customer and some of that comes to us.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. Thank you. And then just another tax detail, I think you mentioned that you have assumed, it's $190 million upfront for the reduced tax charge, and then an assumption at $70 million a year on deferred excess flowing back. Can you just unpack that between protected and unprotected, and then what sort of timeframe you have assumed on each?","Peter Oleksiak","Maybe I will give you the broad context; there is going to be three different proceedings, one is going to be on the current, which is the $190 million you mentioned. So that'd be proceedings in terms of how do we give that back to customers. So maybe a little bit different for each of our utilities, because of where they are at in terms of the rate case cycles. There will also be a portion on that current, that will catch up from January 1, and then on the deferred, as you are talking about, there is going to be a separate proceeding for the second half of the year. There is -- a good majority of it is to protect the depreciation. Probably two-thirds of it, some of it isn't. But we have history and precedents around all of that being normalized. We expect all of that could play it out in the proceeding in the back half of this year.","Jonathan Arnold","And then, in your $70 million, what do you assume about the one-third that's not protected?","Peter Oleksiak","It will be normalized. Despite the $70 million, we have $1.4 billion roughly Electric company, $300 million at the Gas, so combined $1.7 billion that we are going to need to give back to customers over time, that includes both protected and unprotected.","Jonathan Arnold","A third of which is unprotected and for the time being, you are assuming that that has also normalized. Am I getting that right?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. And there is precedents around that back in 1986, when we did this with the Commission.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. Okay. Thanks guys.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning Paul.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning. I think you just answered my question, but the $0.13 is inclusive of the $0.10 at unreg, is that correct?","Gerry Anderson","Correct.","Paul Ridzon","Okay.","Gerry Anderson","Yeah, that's correct. Should we get an immediate $0.10 and then a slow build to $0.13, as we play through the five years.","Paul Ridzon","Slow build from $0.10 to $0.13?","Gerry Anderson","Correct.","Paul Ridzon","And then, looking forward, when you report first quarter earnings, there is no resolution of tax issues at the commission. How should we think about you know, just -- at the utilities, just strip that out like kind of reserved revenues?","Peter Oleksiak","That is correct. It's a regulatory liability, from an accounting perspective. So we will be putting that on the balance sheet to get back to our customers through these various proceedings that I described earlier.","Paul Ridzon","Congratulations on a solid year and rating guidance, and that's all I have. Thanks.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Gerry Anderson","Hey Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Hey Gerry, everyone, good morning. So first question, just in clarifying the growth rate guidance. The 5% to 7% off of the 5.78% in 2018, so that number obviously includes trading. So I assume you are kind of giving -- when you are giving that, you are including trading kind of throughout the period. And if you want to exclude that, we just take that out and quote 5% to 7%.","Gerry Anderson","But we do include. So we are growing up the total number, trading for a couple of percent of our total.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. So I guess, it's a small thing, but in theory, it's in fact -- you are probably not assuming that growth and the businesses ex-trading are probably growing a little quicker?","Gerry Anderson","Could be, we might see a little growth in trading. I mean, when do you do the math, it's a few million dollars, so it just doesn't swing much in the growth.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. ","Gerry Anderson","So we are looking for them -- what they have done. It's $25 million to $30 million of cash a year that we can use to reduce equity, that's their role.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then just to clarify, the bullet in the slide on tax on the improvement in the economics, future non-utility projects may be shared with customers. Is this mainly in the P&I segment?","Gerry Anderson","I think it's both. If you think logically about it, every project has lots of variables that come into determining your return on capitals. But one of them is competitive dynamics, and how many opportunities -- they are competing for the opportunity. So if there is low competition presumably, and you really are the one best suited to serve the need, you might have a higher share. At high competition, the share might be lower, and I think in a lot of cases that we play out in, will see a split at that value. So we try to be conservative and not play a lot of that future tax value on future projects into our projections. But I think we will see it, and will help us in our achievement.","Steve Fleishman","But you are not talking to an impact on kind of current non-utility projects, where you'd share some?","Gerry Anderson","The ones that are already existing and are in hand with negotiated contracts in place, will obviously get the benefit of that.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then, can you just talk a little bit to the ALJ in your Electric case, and I think they came out with like a 9\/6 ROE, which was not only down a decent amount from where you have been, but also lower than CMS. What is the explanation for that, and how are you feeling about the outcome?","Gerry Anderson","We are in an active case, Steve, so I am probably going to leave most of our commentary for that venue. But that said, if you have watched our ROE proceedings and our rate proceedings over the year, it's not unusual to see positions out there that are lower than what we have or what we have filed for. But when you set back from all of that, I feel we are going to get a constructive set of outcomes in our Electric and Gas cases, and constructive on the ROE front that will support the plan we put out for the year.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then last question, just in the Midstream business, just high level, maybe you could talk to trends that you are seeing? Obviously we have a lot more Gas production, we have demand increasing, but bottlenecks starting to slowly get resolved. Just what are you thinking strategically next to the business? Are you worried about pricing and too much supply, or do you still see like a lot of opportunity to grow the business?","Jerry Norcia","Certainly, with our current slate of assets tied to the Marcellus and the Utica, we kind of see a world class resource connected to very proximal markets on the East Coast as well as Midwest, and markets in Midwest, which is what our Nexus pipeline is pointed to, you are going to see a fundamental shift from coal use to natural Gas use over time, as these plants age out, as you can see from our sort of plants for generation.","So I see very strong supply growth as well as strong demand growth in the regions that we are going to serve with Nexus. And I think that will bode well for additional bolt-on projects for Nexus, as well as our Link asset, which is already connected to the Nexus. So I see a really strong story in our future. I think also, the evolution of the export market in the natural Gas industry, I think will be an outlet for what continues to be a growing supply of natural Gas in North America.","So overall, I feel our Midstream business, with its suite of influence if you will, in the Great Lakes region, is well positioned to capture that growth, both supply and demand.","Gerry Anderson","Steve, just to add on to that; you go there, our position in Pennsylvania, Bluestone and Millennium, we hit a record production level last year, and as we mentioned, we got pulled for more there, down on our Link assets. We just had a producer there double their position with us.","And if you come up to Nexus, one of the interesting things there is to, I think in a region where output is growing rapidly, the producers are definitely scaling up operations there. Nexus is, for the next couple of years, likely to be the only path out with any capacity. We are working to make sure that capacity doesn't exist for very long, as we fill up the pipe. But we are in option, out of the region, or out of that zone right now, as it scales up production.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. I actually wanted to follow-up on Nexus. So I heard your explanations, thank you. Now the contracts with Industrial customers are for the facility existing capacity or for expansions of Nexus?","Peter Oleksiak","They will be both.","Angie Storozynski","And can you give me a sense what type of industry this is, that would be willing to sign contracts -- from [indiscernible] Gas?","Peter Oleksiak","Angie, once we execute the agreements, I'd be happy to disclose that. But at this moment, we can't.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And separately for the drillers' demand for capacity on your pipe. It seems like Rover is still not fully subscribed, and again, it seems like Rover's pricing is a little bit lower than yours. So what would be the advantage for a driller to choose your pipe versus Rover?","Jerry Norcia","Well let me be clear, Rover's rates are not lower than ours. And I think you and I have had this conversation before that, our rates are very competitive with Rover. So we are happy with our position in the market that way. And in addition to that, we have got much greater significant -- or much more significant market access along the pipeline. We have got 13 interconnects that we are building immediately, and all of those interconnects, with large demand centers, are already starting to play into some of the discussions that we are having with counterparties.","So we feel very good about filling this pipe.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And then lastly, when you show us the net income range for 2018 for the GSP segment, does it account for the incremental long term contract, or is basically the delta year-over-year largely filled by short term contracts?","Gerry Anderson","Are you asking about long term contracts on Nexus or other pipes?","Angie Storozynski","I mean, other pipes as well. I mean, will they materialize between now and the end of the year, and to contribute to 2018 net income?","Gerry Anderson","Nexus not materially, since it goes into service so late in the year. So it's really not relevant for 2018. And the other pipes do have growing positions. For example, we mentioned Link in a growing position there. Now that will take a little time to come into, but could contribute some, are going to be growing over Bluestone. So the projections we have for both 2018 and future years, are taking that sort of growth and those sorts of contracts into account. But the contracts on Nexus, just isn't enough time in 2018 for those to really be material.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Charles Fishman of Morningstar.","Charles Fishman","Good morning. I am assuming that, since I didn't hear any comments towards this, the timing of the REF phase-outs has not changed with tax reform?","Peter Oleksiak","It has not.","Charles Fishman","Okay, that is what I was assuming. And then second question on the P&I, getting to two thirds of the way to your goal by the end of the year, did you say that's an expansion of the forward agreement or is that a new project you intend to announce?","Jerry Norcia","Well these are -- the one project that we are looking to finalize agreement with -- very close to finalize agreements with an R&D project currently, and we are looking at other Industrial energy projects in the region.","Gerry Anderson","We have a number of cogen projects for example, and one of the discussions with an Industrial counterparty, is -- I guess we'd just say very late stage development. So I think that's like -- the likelihood of them going forward is high. I mean, we were a year ago went forward at this point, it's the way that project [indiscernible]. So we have got one of those, we have got an RNG that we think about finalized. And then more of each of those behind those new projects.","Charles Fishman","So there is a project in the mix, and there are still these projects coming out that are similar to Ford, where you build a co-generation facility for a big Industrial complex?","Gerry Anderson","That's correct.","Charles Fishman","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.","Gerry Anderson","Well look, thanks very much for joining us this morning. Hope you feel that the way we wrapped up 2017 was positive, and as I said at the outset, I feel great about our position at 2018. I think we are lined up for another really good year this year, and we look forward to describing all of that to you in future discussions. Thanks for joining us.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation."],"7864":["DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2014  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Peter Oleksiak - SVP and CFO","Jeff Jewell - VP and Controller","Mark Rolling - VP and Treasurer","Anastasia Minor - Executive Director, IR","Analysts","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Andy Weisel - Macquarie Capital Securities","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Financial","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Research","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the DTE Energy hosted Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Anastasia Minor. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Anastasia Minor","Thank you, Kyle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.","Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. So please reference and refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","With us this morning is Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President and CFO; Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller; and Mark Rolling, our Vice President and Treasurer. We also have members of our management team with us to call on during the Q&A session.","For this earnings call, we will be focusing on the quarter and impacts to 2014 during the presentation and the Q&A. Gerry Anderson will be presenting at the EEI Conference in a couple of weeks where he\u2019s be providing a more detailed business update including our future growth plans.","With that, I will turn it over to Peter for the update.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Anastasia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Well, here in Detroit we have officially lowered the Tigers flags and raised the Red Wings flags. There\u2019s a debate going on at DTE whether I changed the Tigers on the last earnings call by indicating I\u2019ll be giving a World Series update on the call. I claim I didn\u2019t since they won the Division. Others say I did since they were swept in the first round of the Playoffs. Either way, I vowed not to make any more predictions on this call.","In a few minutes, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jeff and Mark who will take you through earnings and cash flow for the quarter and year-to-date. Before that, I\u2019ll be providing a brief business update.","Moving to Slide 5. This is an overview of our business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans for the next 10 years at both utilities are robust. Our electric utility\u2019s growth is driven by environmental spend in the near term and renewal of our generation fleet is in the longer term, which is a natural replacement of our aging coal fleet.","There is more certainty now on the coal retirements given the recent EPA actions. Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments and main replacement. Complementing our utility growth are meaningful, low risk growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses, which provide diversity in earnings and geography.","As Anastasia mentioned, I\u2019ll be providing detail on our overall growth plans at EEI. Two utilities are deploying capital and they\u2019re very constructive regulatory environment and we work hard to earn this every day. Our effort begins with highly engaged workforce and ongoing focus on continuous improvement. This enables us to continue our cost savings track record and our utility\u2019s ability to consistently earn their authorized returns.","We also continue to focus on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe are distinctive in our industry. Just last month, we were ranked number one in the latest J.D. Power Gas Residential Customer study against like peers. Our dividend payout continues to grow on line with earnings and we targeted strong BBB credit rating. Our strategy provides for consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth and attractive and increasing dividends and a strong balance sheet.","On the next page, you see a short list of key activities and projects that are in motion. First, starting with DTE Electric. We are recently filed a proposal for new costs of service rates related to the new PA169 state legislation, which was passed earlier this year. If you recall, this legislation came out of a cross-functional work group chartered by the governor to look at large industrial customer rate design. Our proposal is to implement these new rates in the second quarter of next year.","Sticking with Electric Utility, as previously disclosed, we issued an RFP for natural gas generation capacity early this summer. The process is proceeding very well. The RFP timeline is close to coming to a conclusion and it\u2019s designed for closing in 2015 and capacity available for the 2015-'16 planning year.","As far as finalizing our decision, we expect to make a determination in the next few weeks. This RFP is in the early step and our goal of securing capacity for our full service customers in a tightening region of the MISO markets.","Next, I have a few updates that I want to provide regarding projects in our gas storage and pipeline segments. In the quarter, the Vector Pipeline issued an open season to assess shippers\u2019 interest and capacity expansion of the pipeline. This binding open season ends November 4, and we can provide more of an update on the results after its conclusion.","We have mentioned that many of our prior updates at our Vector Pipeline is well situated to provide a path to Ontario, Michigan and Chicago markets for the emerging shale gas in the regions that needs to head north and the west. The project we are most excited about is our NEXUS pipeline and since our last earnings call, the binding open season concluded and the pipe is now sized at 1.5 BCF a day expandable to 2.","We\u2019re finalizing producer agreements and doing early preparatory activities. We\u2019re on track for the FERC pre-filing in the end of the year timeframe. We expect to give you another update on all these projects at our upcoming EEI in November.","Slide 7 talks about the Michigan economy. We get a lot of questions when we\u2019re on the road about the growing Michigan economy, so here on Slide 7 you can see some real indicators on this continued economic expansion, which is based on strong fundamentals.","On the left-hand side of the page, you can see that Site Selection magazine now ranks Michigan as the sixth most competitive state for business location, up from 16th in 2011. On the right-hand side of the page, some more indicators of a strengthening economy as Michigan currently leads the nation in manufacturing job growth. Similarly, the American Economic Development Institute named Michigan the most improved pro-business state. So we continue to see positive momentum on the economic front.","If we turn to Slide 8, this is our earnings and dividend growth slide we shared with you in the past. We remain confident that our growth plans will deliver 5% to 6% EPS growth target. In fact, we\u2019re tightening our EPS 2014 operating EPS guidance to a range of $4.28 to $4.42, which raises guidance midpoint $0.05 to $4.35 per share.","The increase in guidance midpoint is primarily driven by increased weather revenue at our gas utility and increased earnings at our Power & Industrial Projects segment. Jeff will take you through shortly the details of the guidance change. As you can see on the chart on this page, with the growth contemplating in our utilities and non-utilities over the next five years, we\u2019re approaching $1 billion of income.","I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Jeff who will walk you through the details and the earnings for the quarter and impacts to the full year.","Jeff Jewell","Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 10 and discuss our quarter-over-quarter earnings performance by segment. For the quarter, DTE Energy\u2019s operating earnings are $1.02 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, please refer to the appendix, Slide 21. I would also like to point out that there is a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix.","Now for our growth segments, operating earnings were down 26 million or $0.16 per share for the quarter. DTE Electric was down 44 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by cooler weather and higher storm activity in 2014. This was partially offset by lean initiatives. These initiatives have been implemented to achieve one-time cost savings.","DTE Gas\u2019 performance was in line with normal third quarter activity and financial results for the addition of targeted reinvestment activity. The results quarter-over-quarter were 3 million lower. Gas storage and pipeline earnings were 4 million higher for the quarter over last year. This increase was driven by higher pipeline and gathering earnings which were partially offset by the ongoing impact of the accounting change related to one of our pipeline investments.","Our Power & Industrial Projects segment was up 11 million from 2013. This increase was driven by renewable power generating units, beginning commercial operations in 2014 and also increased reduced emissions fuel earnings. Our corporate and other segment came in $6 million favorable over last year, primarily due to tax-related timing differences. In total, results for the growth segment were 26 million lower quarter-over-quarter.","At energy trading, operating results for the quarter were 3 million, which is 9 million higher than last year due to improved performance in the power portfolio. Year-to-date, energy trading has reduced 1 million of operating earnings. Slide 23 and 24 of the appendix contain our standard energy trading reconciliation pages, which show both economic and accounting performance.","I\u2019d like to now turn to Slide 11 and walk through some quarterly details for DTE Electric. The Electric segment was lower quarter-over-quarter by 44 million. The major contributors to this unfavorability were weather of 33 million and 20 million related to storm expenses. Regarding the weather, the third quarter and 2014 saw roughly 30% fewer cooling degree days than normal. In contrast, 2013 experienced normal weather.","In regards to the storm expenses, both 2013 and 2014 saw elevated storm activity versus normal but the number in severity of storms in 2014 was even greater including a September storm, which was one of the largest in our history affecting more than 400,000 customers. Offsetting the impacts of the weather and storm are lean initiatives that began in the third quarter of 2014 compared to reinvest initiatives that were taking place in the same period last year.","Moving on to Slide 12, I\u2019ll discuss our 2014 revised guidance and key drivers. As Peter stated earlier, DTE Energy is increasing EPS guidance from a midpoint of $4.30 to $4.35 per share. The strong results at DTE Gas and our Power & Industrial business have more than offset the weather impacts at DTE Electric.","Along with increasing the midpoint of guidance by $0.05, we are also narrowing the range as we head into the final quarter of the year. This revised guidance includes contingency and they provide us flexibility to implement reinvestment strategies depending on business results and conditions for the balance of the year.","We are revising DTE Electric\u2019s earnings guidance downward but by only 15 million, despite facing enormous unfavorable pressure from both summer weather and increased storm activities. We\u2019ve talked to you before about our flexible planning approach of creating three financial plans each year; a base plan, a lean plan and an invest plan and we are prepared to implement each as needed.","Implementing our lean plan has allowed the company to mitigate a large portion of the earnings pressure and minimize our downward earnings revision for the Electric segment. On a weather normalized basis, electric sales are down approximately 1% through the first nine months of the year, due primarily to customers taking steps to conserve energy after the unusually cold winter. Long-term, however, we continue to expect load growth to be up 0.5% per year, which is in line with our Midwest peers.","For DTE Gas, we are revising guidance upward. This is mainly due to the significantly colder than normal winter that we experienced but we are also holding some of that favorability back for firm life contingency or reinvestment opportunities. We are narrowing gas storage and pipelines guidance. The primary drivers of this change are strong performance in the pipeline and gathering businesses and one-time weather-driven favorability in the storage business. This favorability is offset by the ongoing impact of the accounting change at one of our pipeline investments.","As we mentioned on previous earnings calls, we began deferring revenue collected in FERC approved rates in excess of depreciation expense. This deferral is entirely timing related and will reverse and therefore has no impact on the long-term growth prospects for this segment. So far this year we have deferred approximately 10 million of revenue after tax and we will defer a like amount in 2015 and a much smaller amount in 2016 before the deferral begins to reverse.","For the Power & Industrial Projects, we are revising guidance upwards. The primary driver of the guidance increase is better performance at our reduced emission fuels business.","That concludes my update on our earnings. I\u2019d like to now turn the discussion over to Mark who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics.","Mark Rolling","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone on the call. I\u2019ll open by saying that our cash flow and balance sheet remains strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans.","So beginning on Slide 14 with a look at our cash flows through the first three quarters of the year, September year-to-date cash from operations is $1.2 billion. This is down a little compared to 2013 but it\u2019s in line with our plan for the full year.","Compared to the same period last year, DTE Electric had lower surcharge collections and higher fuel and purchase power costs. This is driven mostly by the colder weather we had early in the year. And similarly, DTE Gas has high weather-related gas purchases.","Capital spending is up this year due to increased investments at the electric utility partially offset by lower capital spending at our non-utility businesses, which is really just a timing of our gathering related spend at GSP. We\u2019ve included a more detailed breakdown of year-over-year CapEx on Page 22 in the appendix. So overall, net cash is down year-over-year which is consistent with our plan.","Moving now to Slide 15, which shows our revised cash and capital guidance for 2014. On the left side of the page, cash from operations is still expected to come in at $1.6 billion while capital spending will be about $100 million lower than the original guidance, resulting in a $100 million improvement to free cash flow and net cash. We\u2019re taking advantage of the low interest rate environment by refinancing more long-term debt than we had originally planned.","On the right side of the page, you can see the breakout of capital spending by business units. Our projection for total CapEx is almost $2.2 billion. That\u2019s down a little from our original guidance, but it\u2019s up nearly 15% from last year. We still expect to spend 1.6 billion in Electric with a small change to the mix. And our non-utility investments will be about $160 million lower than planned. Now as you know, the capital spending in the non-utility businesses is driven by the timing of projects and it can be lumpy from year-to-year and that\u2019s the case here today.","Let me wrap up on Slide 16 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end the year within the targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt, and we\u2019re nearly complete with our 2014 funding requirements with no plan to issue equity this year. We have a healthy $1.2 billion of liquidity at the end of September and lastly, we refinanced over $1 billion of long-term debt at very attractive rates, which will give us almost $25 million in annualized interest savings.","Now, I\u2019ll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Mark. I\u2019d like to move us to Slide 18 for a wrap up of the quarter. The quarter was impacted by a pretty unusual combination of cool summer, weather and increased storms, which were partially offset by strong performance in our non-utility businesses. We are confident in the remainder of the year as we are raising and narrowing our 2014 EPS guidance. Our balance sheet and cash flow metrics remain strong and we are reiterating our commitment to the 5% to 6% earnings growth and providing attractive dividends.","As I mentioned, we\u2019ll be at EEI in a couple of weeks. We hope to see many of you there. Gerry Anderson will be providing a detailed business update for each of our business segments. The presentation that Gerry will provide will begin at 11.15 Central Standard Time on Thursday, November 13. For those of you not going to EEI, you\u2019ll be able to join that webcast through our Investor Relations website.","I\u2019d like to thank you for listening to our call this morning. Now, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions that you may have. As Anastasia mentioned, really a preference to focus on the quarter and the full year of 2014 saving the longer-term strategic dialogue for the November EEI meetings.","So with that, Kyle, we\u2019ll be open for the Q&A","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question from Matt Tucker from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Nice work in a tough quarter.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","First question on NEXUS, could you talk about the partnership structure there and what remains to be done before pre-filing? And if you could give us any more color on kind of timings of that between now and year-end?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. As you know, we\u2019re very excited about the project. Since our last earnings call we completed a really key milestone, the binding open season. The pipe right now is sized at the 1.5 BCF per day, originally going into the open season thinking we may be a 1B pipe. And we do have an enough commitments for the producers and end-used customers to move forward that project. The work that\u2019s been done right now we have some right-away activity of the project. That\u2019s in full motion. We also have environmental land studies going on. Our target is to make a FERC filing at the end of the year timeframe. On the ownership issue, we are still in discussions with Enbridge. That\u2019s really the kind of remaining area or swing factor in terms of our ownership levels. I would anticipate that these conversations will probably go forward maybe into the end of the year timeframe. Either way we liked Enbridge to be in the pipe. It does make sense from a long-term strategic standpoint to have Enbridge in. If not, we\u2019ll have a larger ownership of a really great project. But I\u2019ll say really more than the year timeframe to finalize ownership levels.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks. Is there any more color you can give us on kind of the nature of those discussions with Enbridge? I guess from the outside, it\u2019s a little bit difficult to understand I guess why they wouldn\u2019t potentially want to join the partnership as well as why you wouldn\u2019t prefer just to take a larger stake in the project?","Peter Oleksiak","For them \u2013 they are mainly an oil-based company with oil pipelines and really is around the capital allocation and resource allocation decision for them. I\u2019m anticipating at the end they will be in this project. It\u2019s a great project. They obviously feel so as well with even the end use coming from them as well in terms of some of the LDC support. If it really is around the capital allocation decision, I think at the end of day they\u2019ll be part of the project. We like them part of it just from a strategic perspective to have their ownership interest in there as well as LDC support definitely helps the longer term on the overall viability and success of the pipe.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great, thanks. And then just on the Vector proposed expansion, any more details you can give us there on the potential CapEx or how much uplift that could create relative to the current earnings stream from Vector?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes, I think it\u2019s a great question and let me take a step back on Vector. We\u2019ve indicated in recent years that we felt Vector was really well situated with the emerging shale gas in the region, especially the Utica shale. We had on the list and somewhere disclosures around potential pipeline projects we had to Vector expansion and we have that labeled as a TBD. This open season was prompt just by the number of proposed projects in the area. And so Vector really is now putting out an open season to see what\u2019s the level of interest, what potentially could be the size of the expansion if there is going to be one. This would be a fourth quarter 2017 in service if there was an expansion. So through this open season, Vector is going to understand the total demand from the new projects as well as understand demand from existing shippers beyond the 2017 timeframe. So it is a bit early right now to really indicate what the potential expansion could be if there is going to be one. But I can say that this is definitely a very positive sign and the first step in the process around Vector.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","All right, great. Thanks a lot, Peter.","Operator","We will take our next question from Andy Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Andrew.","Andy Weisel - Macquarie Capital Securities","Good morning, guys. My first question is just a question on customer rates. You filed the new cost of service but can you walk us through maybe a little more detail on the numbers of what the changes by customer class look like for that, for the surcharge reductions and then with the upcoming general rate case, how that all sort of nets out over the next 12 months?","Peter Oleksiak","With the customer rates, that\u2019s just the PA169, we did make the filing there. We have indicated and it really was driven \u2013 as you know, there was a work group put together looking at large industrial (indiscernible) energy intensive customers. But those customers will experience an average rate deduction around 8%. The higher use will be probably more \u2013 maybe north of 10%. There will be reductions as well for some of the larger commercial customers. It is a rate neutral, so there will be some balancing across the remaining customer classes. We do have headroom, as you\u2019ve indicated. This year we had surcharge reductions coming off. A big one Steven called out was a renewable program, the surcharge related to that. That was close to $100 million. All-in, the surcharge reductions this year was about a 6% headroom. Next year, we have our Nuclear Power payment related to Fermi that\u2019s going to be around 6% as well. So we have enough debt. We do have a filing coming up around our rate case for Electric. It\u2019s been a four-year stay out. It really is a capital driven, rate base driven case. It\u2019s too early to really call what the size of that case will be, but we\u2019ll have headroom between the surcharge reductions as well as our Nuclear Power payment to more than cover in that case.","Andy Weisel - Macquarie Capital Securities","You said more than cover, okay, terrific. Next, just two quick ones on financing. Equity needs, you mentioned nothing this year but there was \u2013 you didn\u2019t mention in the slides what will happen for next year and the year after. Should we still think about that as 200 million to 300 million per year or how much will that depend on the pipeline CapEx needs?","Mark Rolling","This is Mark. We\u2019ve previously said we\u2019d be doing 200 million to 300 million per year in '15 and '16. When we go to EEI, we\u2019re going to provide a refreshed outlook that will take you out through '17. And the equity plans we do won\u2019t be dramatically different than what we\u2019ve talked about and we\u2019ll contemplate all the capital growth, that is our plans.","Andy Weisel - Macquarie Capital Securities","Okay, great. And then lastly, the refinancing of debt continues to come in up to 1 billion long-term debt refinance. Is there much opportunity for more or should we think that is sort of it in this rate environment?","Mark Rolling","Well, we\u2019ve refinanced everything that came due and there was some callable debt that we pull forward to take advantage of the rates. We may have a little more yet this year, but you\u2019ve probably seen the lion\u2019s share of us refinancing long-term debt here over the last two years in fact.","Andy Weisel - Macquarie Capital Securities","Very good. Thanks a lot, guys.","Peter Oleksiak","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Hi. Good morning, guys. I\u2019m not going to try and go too far into the future but I\u2019m going to do it anyway. Yesterday, your other Michigan peer was talking about kind of some of the opportunities that could come if customer choice goes away as far as load coming back on their system as well as kind of starting to address the short MISO Zone 7 capacity situation. Can you just talk about how you guys are accessing that opportunity and when we could prospectively hear kind of thoughts on places where you might start filling in generation capacity?","Peter Oleksiak","Dan, that\u2019s a really good question. Even the time we first started talking about the MISO (indiscernible) for 2016-'17 is now estimated at 3 gigawatt hours and that\u2019s been a pretty recent disclosure from them, and it was up from 2 gigawatt hours which was the previous level. We mentioned on the call here, we have this current RFP for electric capacity. This really is intended to secure capacity for our full service customers in this tightening region of MISO. We have a natural summer short, but there\u2019s capacity with tightness always as we\u2019re looking at the end of the tightening market, we felt it really is prudent to cover that short really to secure capacity as well as more price certainly for our customers. We are developing plans to address our full service customers\u2019 overall capacity needs in the 2016-'17 timeframe. This emerging capacity shortfall in part is really a reflection of the flawed retail access program here in Michigan and I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably really distributed to the lack of capacity planning from the choice providers. They were really taking advantage of the long market to-date. So I know a lot of your question is around the choice returns, what is the implications for us. Choice does return and we do believe that choice will be addressed up here coming in legislation and that there is a possibility of choice returning to us. We will have plans to serve them. That could mean additional capital, most likely not immediate but longer term for us.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","I guess when you guys are laid up in the pipeline side, the box of future earnings contribution, is this Vector project going through open season, is that part of that box or does that stack on top of a (indiscernible)?","Peter Oleksiak","We have indicated if you go back to even some of our disclosures, we did have there a Vector expansion as a TBD. So as we were contemplating NEXUS and sizing up NEXUS, there was a Vector expansion contemplated as well.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay, so the classic white box in the last presentation had NEXUS --","Peter Oleksiak","I\u2019d say a portion of that, but it will be interesting the number of projects in the area as well as understanding existing shippers what their interest is beyond the 2017 timeframe. So there is a place all the way now, but that could vary depending what happens on this open season.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","I\u2019ll be simple about this, but that $20 million of that box has some combination of different projects that you probability weigh in there. So if you had NEXUS and Vector both get done, would that be bigger than the 20 box effect. Is that\u2019s the right way to think about it?","Peter Oleksiak","Well, I guess I can \u2013 not until mid November the EEI, but some of that will be \u2013 we will be going over in more detail and Gerry will obviously in a few weeks around how we\u2019re thinking around our gas storage pipeline segment overall, what we think about future earnings, how do we feel about that white space. NEXUS, that was sized as a 1B pipe with one-third ownership. That\u2019s coming in at 1.5B pipe with ownership as a TBD right now. So there is possibility for larger capital and earnings from NEXUS depending on where we end up with the ownership levels there. And there was a contemplation of the Vector expansion, so we\u2019ll see coming out of this open season could it be larger potentially, could it be smaller, that may be a possibility as well, but more likely there will be an expansion. We won\u2019t have completely nailed down for the EEI because that ends on November 4. That will take some time for us to really access what we think that is going to be.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Peter, should we expect that \u2013 that chart goes to 2019, the EEI?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes, we will update you through 2019.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS Financial.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Financial","Hi. Good morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Financial","So I\u2019ll stick with this year for the time being and firstly, just with regards to the non-utility CapEx, could you talk a little bit about the shift that you\u2019re showing there for '14? And then separately at the same time, could you talk a little bit about what the lean initiative means in terms of EPS shift versus call it your base case? And specifically, I know it\u2019s a little out of bounds, but how does that impact next year as you think about having to reinvest?","Peter Oleksiak","Okay, I\u2019ll handle the non-utility question and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff Jewell to talk about the lean implications of that. In the non-utility, it is timing. It\u2019s a combination. There is some gathering investment. We\u2019re doing the gathering right now for Southwest Energy. That really is timing in between here, so that\u2019s what that is. A portion of it is also our Power & Industrial segment. We\u2019ve indicated there is opportunistic investments there that won\u2019t be in nature. There is no implications on our longer-term growth plans. It is timing for that. And then, Jeff, you want to handle the lean.","Jeff Jewell","Sure. Hi, Julien, this is Jeff. So I think your question around the lean and what does that mean for this year related to EPS, did that sort of have a size there?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Financial","Yes, versus call it your base case. And also to what extent that impacts next year, as you think about having to reinvest after having spent a lean year here?","Jeff Jewell","So let me answer the second one first. So the way we start each year as we\u2019ve talked about, we have the three plan. And each one of those plans is sort of one-time based off of that year. So when we talk about lean or reinvest, we\u2019re doing those as sort of one-time events. And so when you think about next year, we\u2019re not anticipating there being an impact by doing lean or reinvest this year and then having an impact on the next year. Again, that\u2019s how we sort of manage our business. So then you talk about the sizing for this year; as you saw on the slide, we spent at the Electric company about 7 million of lean and we\u2019re looking at about 10 million to 15 million after tax is what we\u2019re looking at for the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s roughly a little less than $0.10 a share for the balance of the year is what we\u2019re looking at there.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Financial","Excellent. Thank you. And then just a clarification from Dan\u2019s last question there on the situation with MISO. As you think about the RFP that\u2019s pending, just curious, is there any acquisition opportunity here that stands as well as I suppose self-build? Could you clarify what\u2019s on the table and also to what extent would the state prefer to see new builds rather than an acquisition from you all?","Peter Oleksiak","The RFP is an acquisition and we believe there are a few merchant plants that are in the state of Michigan. We believe we can secure them at a price that\u2019s good for our customers and most likely will be less than the new build on that. For the near term, our solution for our full service customers is an acquisition. The longer term is if we do have a shortfall here in the MISO, especially with Zone 7, what is the pace and timing of new capital to cover that. We will be obviously spending capital. We\u2019ve indicated that with the coal-plant retirements, but that\u2019s more of a TBD at this point in time. And while that is also for us personally, DTE is what happens with choice.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Financial","Got you. So what\u2019s the timeline then in terms of thinking about next steps on resource adequacy if you could kind of rehash that?","Peter Oleksiak","The RFP that we have in motion right now will close in 2015 for the 2015-'16 timeframe. For the 2016 timeframe, we\u2019re in plans right now developing plans for our full customers. Our actual filing around that is early in '16, but obviously we\u2019re getting ahead of that and understanding the implications for our bundle of full service customers. We\u2019re also monitoring the overall market and then trying to think through what happens if choice does return. So we are really kind of in the early stages of thinking about that as a company.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Financial","Great. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Research","Good morning, guys. I\u2019m just curious on Power & Industrial, the performance in the quarter. You attributed it and I think the guidance raise primarily to reduced emission fuels performing the plan. So is that something that happened this quarter that likely won\u2019t recur or is this just that business moving to a higher base?","Peter Oleksiak","We are seeing strong performance and income from our reduced emissions fuel projects. A good portion of this is tied to additional volume that\u2019s non-repeating related to some plant capacity factors and availability factors. So I\u2019d say really and most of it will be non-repeating. We are just seeing growth from a segment overall for next year and we will be providing a fuller update on this segment at next month\u2019s EEI conference.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Research","What we got this quarter and what we\u2019re getting this year is some of this year\u2019s cap effect?","Peter Oleksiak","It will be this year and we\u2019ll provide an update on '15 at the EEI Conference.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Research","Great. My other stuff was answered. Thank you, guys.","Peter Oleksiak","All right. Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","That was pretty much my question too, but just to sort of follow up on it, if we were to think of a normalized number just to clarify, it would basically be what your prior guidance was?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. That would be a fair assumption.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then just on the trading, the net fair value, it seems to have been pretty good not only in the quarter but year-to-date. And I\u2019m just wondering, has there been any change there or anything you want to discuss in terms of how you see the trading basis performing going forward?","Peter Oleksiak","No, the trading is and as you\u2019ve indicated are having a really good year. We have indicated \u2013 we target or at least anticipate 20 million to 25 million of economic contribution per year from our trading company. This economic value will be coming over time into our accounting earnings. There is some noise and variability when it flows in. But when it does flow it, it is as we\u2019ve indicated, over and above our 5% to 6% growth objective. So in the appendix page you will see there the $36 million year-to-date, so they\u2019re having a strong performance but that doesn\u2019t change our longer term basically expectations of the 20 million to 25 million.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Excellent. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our moderator for any additional or closing remarks.","Peter Oleksiak","I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today and hopefully we\u2019ll see many of you next month in Dallas at the EEI Conference.

We have a lot to be proud of this as we look back on 2018 at DTE. We logged another strong financial year at DTE, and made great progress on many other fronts as well. Our operating EPS was $6.30, that\u2019s 13% higher than 2017. And it\u2019s 9% higher than our original 2018 guidance. This is the 10th consecutive year that we\u2019ve exceeded our earnings guidance. Our cash flow came in $500 million above our plan, which sets us up nicely for 2019, providing a lot of balance sheet flexibility.","We also increased the dividend by 7% coming into this year, and we\u2019ll target 7% dividend growth through 2020. We certainly recognize the importance of that sort of dividend growth in delivering premium shareholder returns to you.","Our employee and customer and community initiatives also achieved strong results in 2018, and I\u2019ll touch on those in a bit more detail in a few minutes. With the New Year under way, I\u2019m also confident that we are set up well for success in 2019. I feel really good about the plan that we put together for the year. And a month then, I feel good about how 2019 is starting for us.","For example, NEXUS announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire generation pipeline, which is a 355 million cubic feet a day pipeline that provides future growth opportunities for NEXUS in the area around Toledo in Northern Ohio. This is a great fit for our GSP business, and it\u2019s representative of the bolt-on asset acquisitions that are available to NEXUS, and Jerry Norcia will provide more details on that transaction in few minutes.","Another accomplishment to kick-off 2019 is the signing of definitive agreements for voluntary renewables with two large industrial customers, totaling 280 megawatts. And there\u2019s likely a third large contract that will follow in the near future. At the last fall we told you that voluntary renewables would become an important new area of investment for us, and these transactions are our first concrete moves in that direction.","Another item I\u2019d like to mention is the recent severe cold snap that we experienced here in Michigan. In January we saw record breaking temperatures in our state. And our gas and electric teams did a great job, and our assets performed well. And of course the weather produced strong demand which will give our two utilities a solid start to the year.","So let\u2019s move on to Slide 5 now to discuss some of the employee and customer and community successes from 2018. And I\u2019m really proud of these accomplishments. So for those of you who\u2019ve listened to our calls in the past, you know how strongly I believe that if you want to be a great company and continue to achieve great results for your customers, your communities and your investors, your people need to bring great energy and focus to their work, it\u2019s that simple. And based on the results of our Gallup engagement survey in the fall of 2018, I certainly feel good about our employees\u2019 energy. We scored in the top 3% of all companies in Gallup\u2019s worldwide database, it\u2019s the highest level we\u2019ve ever achieved at DTE, which is a great way to enter 2019.","Earlier in 2018, we earned our 6th consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. We remain the only utility company ever to receive that award. And we hope we are on track to our seventh consecutive award here in 2019.","Now onto one of the most important areas we focus on at DTE, and that\u2019s employee safety. And I\u2019m proud to say that 2018 was one of our maybe the safest years in our Company\u2019s history. So we placed in the top 2% of the National Safety Council\u2019s safety culture survey, and we ranked at the top of our industry on key metrics.","In fact what\u2019s known as our DART rate, that\u2019s a measure of injuries that have some severity, that rate was the lowest in our industry. So our Company had the best performance on that of all companies in our industry.","Safety is a big deal in our culture but it\u2019s also a great indicator of employees\u2019 level of focus and level of discipline. By having highly engaged and safe employees usually translates into serving your customers well. And because of the customer focus, our gas company ranked highest in customer satisfaction with business customers in the Midwest in J.D. Power study for 2018. Additionally, our electric and gas companies both ranked second in the Midwest for overall residential customer satisfaction.","So we continue to target improvements in customer satisfaction results. I think our biggest lever for achieving that goal remains continued modernization of our grid and improvements in electric reliability that will come with that. And since we had one of the warmest years on record in 2018, we had the opportunity to reinvest significant revenue in the system to that end.","Moving onto Slide 6. We\u2019re also very explicit at DTE about our desire to be a force for good in the communities where we live and serve. And we don\u2019t take that as the slogan or something that we take lightly. Our work in this area receives the same focus and the same discipline that our other key priorities get.","So for example, we pushed our employee volunteerism to new heights in 2018 with over 50% of our employees involved in company volunteerism efforts. We also invested $1.7 billion in Michigan based and Detroit based business since last year. And it\u2019s been a huge initiative for us.","Since we made our original pledge to this effort in 2010, we\u2019ve increased our annual spend with Michigan companies from $450 million per year to $1.7 billion per year, and we\u2019ve invested over $9 billion with state owned companies over that time frame, which has helped to create support an estimated 16,000 sustainable jobs, more jobs than we have at DTE actually.","The significant investments we\u2019re making in Michigan businesses are paralleled by the investments we\u2019re making in our communities. And this work in our communities is getting noticed. So Points of Light named DTE one of its Civic 50, the top 50 most civic minded companies in the nation, recognizing the community and customer focused approach that we take to our work. DTE was the only Michigan Company to be named and was acknowledged as the leading energy company nationally. J.D. Power also has chosen DTE as the number one energy company in corporate citizenship.","Now the work I\u2019ve just described on behalf of our customers and our communities helps to shape the broader context in which we operate in Michigan. And that\u2019s really important work, and part of that context is our regulatory and political environment.","And you all know how important turning a constructive regulatory environment is for a company like ours, especially when you\u2019re investing heavily in the transformation of your utility infrastructure, which we are. We\u2019ve always said that if you serve your customers well, manage your costs and rates well, and if you\u2019re positive force in your communities, your odds of having effective regulation are a lot higher.","Michigan currently earns a tier one ranking of regulatory environments. And that regulatory construct in Michigan has an important feature as we work our way through a period of heavy investment, including a special recovery mechanism for renewables, which allows for timely recovery of those investments, and an infrastructure recovery mechanism at our gas utility, which leads to timely recovery of gas investments and decrease rate case frequency. And there\u2019s a similar mechanism under discussion for our electric business.","Along with our constructive regulatory environment, we also have a new governor. And she will have the opportunity to appoint two new commissioners this year. We congratulate Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and look forward to working with her and the new commissioners.","Finally, I\u2019d like to highlight some of the 2018 accomplishments in the area of growth and value creation. The NEXUS pipeline was placed in service in the fourth quarter, on schedule and on budget. I don\u2019t have to tell you that in the current environment this is no small feat. We also completed expansions of both Link and Millennium in 2018. Last year our P&I team acquired two new RNG projects and positioned us for further growth in this area this year. They also broke ground on the central energy plant at Ford Motor Company, which is a significant project for us. So along with the significant investments under way at our two utilities, these non-utility successes under gird our 5% to 7% long-term earnings per share growth rate.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Peter to talk about our 2018 financial results and our guidance for 2019. Peter, over to you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks Jerry, and good morning everyone.","Before I get into financials, I always like to give an update on my Detroit Tigers. Even though it\u2019s cold here in Michigan, it\u2019s warmer Florida. Spring training will be in full swing in less than two weeks and I feel really good about the Tigers in 2019 and beyond. We\u2019re rebuilding the right way, we have some the best pitching prospects in the game, actually four of our pitchers in the top 100 prospects of Major League Baseball.","Back to the business at hand, turning on to the financial results, I will start on Slide 7. DTE had a great year in 2018 across all of our business lines. DTE had operating earnings of $1.14 billion. This translates to $6.30 per share, a new high for the Company. EPS performance is a strong beat to our original guidance and you can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix.","Let me start my review at the top of the page with our utilities. Our utility is great. Financial performance was driven by an extremely hot summer and a colder than normal winter. DTE Electric earnings were $669 million for the year, and this is $52 million higher than 2017. This increase was driven largely by a hot summer as well as new rates implemented. We reinvested a good portion of this favorable weather back into the operations to improve customer reliability. And more detailed year-over-year earnings variance walk for DTE Electric can be found in appendix.","DTE Gas operating earnings were $159 million, and this is increase of $10 million versus 2017. The earnings increase is driven primarily by cooler winter weather offset by increased O&M expenses.","Now let\u2019s move down the Page to the third row to our Gas Storage and Pipeline business. GSP operating earnings were $233 million for the year, this is $73 million higher than prior year. The increase is due to lower corporate tax rate and favorability across all platforms. In the next row you can see that our Power and Industrial business operating earnings were $163 million. Earnings are $39 million higher than in 2017. This increase is due mainly to higher REF volumes and steel related earnings.","Our Energy Trading business also had a strong year, producing $40 million of operating earnings. Earnings are up $20 million versus 2017. Our Trading segment had a particularly strong economic year as Gas portfolio. The $40 million in operating earnings this year is consistent with our average economic income over the past 5 years and is also consistent with our EEI disclosures or expectations from the segment in our 5 year outlook.","And finally our Corporate and Other was $53 million unfavorable compared to last year due to the lower tax rate, higher interest expense, and a significant one time item in 2018. Inside the $122 million loss for the segment in 2018 is a sizeable contribution to our foundation and other charitable causes. This will enable us to continue to be a force for growth in communities for years to come. Overall, DTE had a great 2018, earning $6.30 per share.","Let\u2019s move to our 2019 guidance on Slide 8. Jerry mentioned in his opening remarks, we are reaffirming our 2019 operating earnings guidance from the early outlook we provided on the third quarter call. Our 2019 operating EPS guidance range is $5.97 to $6.33, with a midpoint of the range at $6.15. This is 6.4% higher than our 2018 original guidance. We\u2019re also reiterating our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate from the 2019 guidance.","We\u2019re projecting another strong year for cash flows in 2019, which will help fund our robust capital investment plan. The details of our cash and capital guidance for 2019 are included in the appendix.","Before I turn the presentation over to Jerry Norcia, I\u2019d like to mention that our 1 and 3 year equity issuance plan has not changed for the one we provided you at EEI. This year we plan on issuing up to $250 million using internal mechanisms. We plan to issue $1 billion to $1.5 billion of equity from 2019 to 2021.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jerry Norcia to discuss the growth and investment opportunities and our business plan.","Jerry Norcia","Thanks Peter.","As Gerry mentioned, we made a lot of progress in 2018, which gives us the positive momentum going into 2019 at our utilities as well as our non-utilities. I\u2019ll start on Slide 9 with our utility businesses. And I\u2019ll begin with the Electric Company. In 2019, we will continue to move along the path to deliver 50% clean energy by 2030 and reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2015.","We\u2019re on track to achieve our interim goal of a 30% reduction by the early 2020s. Wind energy will be instrumental in achieving this interim goal. Our wind fleet wrapped up 2018 with its best operating year ever, generating 1.4 million megawatt hours of clean energy. They\u2019re finishing up in the top quartile for fleet availability in North America. When the fleet performs well, it plays a key role in providing cleaner energy to our customers while helping us maintain reliability and affordability.","We expect our megawatt hours to increase significantly in 2019, as we expect to commission Pine River Wind Park in first quarter of this year. Pine River is the largest energy producing wind park in Michigan and is the most cost effective wind park in DTEs fleet. Our Electric Company also received Michigan Public Service Commission approval for our voluntary renewable energy plan. This plan includes adding 300 megawatts of new wind capacity to supply a voluntary renewable energy program for large industrial customers. We\u2019re looking to reduce carbon emissions.","As Gerry mentioned, we have already signed up two large industrial customers for 280 megawatts. Our third large contract is pending and based on current levels of interest we believe we can expand this voluntary renewable plan by additional 300 megawatts in the future. Last year we received a Certificate of Need to build a new gas combined cycle plant, we broke ground in August and we expect operations to begin in 2022. Along with renewable energy, natural gas will be a critical part of our power generation capacity in the decades ahead.","In March, we will be filing our Integrated Resource Plan or IRP. with the MPSC, covering the next 20 years with very specific plans for the first 5 years. The IRP will help guide energy resource mix decisions which are necessary to meet future demand for clean, reliable, and affordable electricity.","We use an integrated cost based system planning process that accounts for demand, reliability, resource diversity and our environmental goals. As markets of technologist continue to evolve rapidly, we expect our IRP recommendations to be quite specific in the early years or present a range of options for the later years of our plan as we continue to retire coal plants and understand market dynamics more deeply.","Moving on to our Gas utility, DTE Gas received a constructive rate order in September, accelerating over $450 million of main renewable capital over the next 5 years, allowing us to shorten the pace of this renewal program from 25 years to 18 years. I\u2019m very pleased with the progress of this program.","Additionally, we announced our plans to reduce methane emissions by more than 80% by 2040. Made good progress on these efforts so far, and our accelerated gas main replacement plan will help this initiative as well.","Now I\u2019d like to move on to our non-utility businesses. Turning to Slide 10. I\u2019ll start with an update on the growth opportunities at our Gas Storage and Pipeline business. The left side of the slide lays out the core geography of which GSP is active in pursuing growth. We\u2019re always on a lookout for potential organic build outs or acquisitions that would support our position in this geography as our assets are strategically positioned to connect high quality markets to world class geology.","In the third quarter call we told you that NEXUS was placed in service, which was a huge milestone for our Company. In completion of NEXUS along with the progress at our other platforms is setting us up nicely for growth in this segment. Told you that NEXUS provides us with additional opportunities to expand our footprint, and one opportunity is the NEXUS acquisition of Generation Pipelines owned in a 50-50 partnership with Enbridge. Generation Pipeline is in the core of the northern industrial route in Ohio and will likely present additional opportunities for supplying natural gas to power industrial customers in that area.","The 23 mile 24-inch pipe is fully contracted, has a purchase price between $150 million to $200 million, and is located four miles North of NEXUS and interconnects with ANR and Panhandle Eastern pipelines as well. With potential future interconnections with NEXUS, this acquisition provides direct access to the Toledo industrial corridor. We expect both NEXUS and Link respond in array of organic and bolt-on acquisition opportunities of this sort.","Growth plans in our other assets are on track. We completed expansions on our Link and Millennium assets as Jerry mentioned, and our assets are performing extremely well. During this polar vortex, Vector was flowing both -- was flowing full in both directions to Canada and into Chicago. And we expect Vector to see increasing opportunities serving markets in Chicago and Wisconsin. So I feel very good about the position we are in at GSP, giving me confidence that we\u2019ll continue to execute on opportunities that support our growth targets.","Now I\u2019d like to move on to Slide 11, for a look at our Power & Industrial business. Our P&I business continues to see progress in the development of both industrial energy projects and renewable natural gas or RNG. As we discussed at EEI, the RNG market is the one that we have done business in for over 15 years. But in recent years demand for RNG has surged and we feel the market is poised for strong growth trajectory in the future. We now have five operating RNG sites and three under construction. We\u2019re also finalizing agreements on two new RNG projects and we continue to advance discussions to secure additional RNG projects in 2019.","On the industrial energy side, we\u2019re focusing on our cogeneration business. Cogeneration projects enable our customers to improve their environmental footprint and lower their energy costs. We continue to construct our most recent project at Ford, and it will go into operations later this year. And we expect to add series of similar cogeneration projects over the next five years. I mentioned at EEI our P&I queue of development opportunities was very strong and that certainly continues to be the case.","Now I\u2019ll wrap on Slide 12, then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. All in all I feel great of our 2018 results and are positioning for continued growth in the years to come. We exceeded our original operating EPS guidance for fifth consecutive year in 2018. Additionally, our annualized total shareholder return has consistently beat the S&P 500 Utility Index by a large margin over a decade. Our utilities continue to focus on necessary infrastructure investments tied to clean generation, improved reliability and enhanced customer experience.","NEXUS is now in service on flowing gas to customers and is acquiring the Generation Pipeline. And our P&I business unit is working to secure additional RNG in cogen projects. This sets us up well to continue to deliver strong EPS and dividend growth. We increased our dividend by 7% for 2019 and anticipate the same increase in 2020. Our goal is to use our disciplined approach to operations and investment to continue to deliver premium total shareholder returns in the future.","With that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And now, Tracy, you can open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shar Pourreza","So just real quick on the Generation Pipeline, could we talk a little bit on returns even in general terms and what sort of accretion we can expect sort of from the steel? How should we think about it relative to your plan and kind of more important when do you sort of expect to decide on the lateral off of NEXUS? And could this sort of change your current assumption on the mix of short-term versus long-term contracts?","Gerry Anderson","We\u2019ll have Jerry Norcia dive into that one for you Shar.","Jerry Norcia","So, we expect NEXUS certainly to be accretive, it does meet our returns thresholds for this business. So we\u2019re happy with the returns. In terms of strategic value, it is four miles off to NEXUS pipeline, and our plan is to interconnect NEXUS to this pipeline. And that will provide significant market access for the NEXUS pipeline of over $300 million a day and growing as we attach new customers on that line. And we\u2019ll create value for our shippers in the future.","Gerry Anderson","I\u2019d say $350 million with the potential to expand that, is a really nice interconnection of market area load for this pipe. We\u2019ve always said that that route across Northern Ohio which a line we had interconnection points all along that pipe. And from early on that we expected those to play out over time with load addition opportunities and we had struck a couple of those earlier, but this is one we really like instead of the as Jerry mentioned the deal itself which is fully contracted is accretive, but we think there is upside opportunity to this as we pursue growth in that area and it also adds opportunity for NEXUS clearly as we interconnect it.","Shar Pourreza","Do you think you\u2019ll be in a position to sort of update around that incremental growth opportunities as we head into EEI?","Gerry Anderson","In the fall?","Shar Pourreza","Yes.","Gerry Anderson","Yes, I think we could - we\u2019ll probably have the acquisition obviously clearly in hand and we will probably have our thinking advanced about potential timing of interconnection and things like that. So we\u2019ll give you what we can additional at EII.","Shar Pourreza","And then just lastly on the RNG deals that were just announced. Can you just, what\u2019s the structure of the deals sort of the tenor of the contracts, the returns? And should we just for modeling purposes assume they start to contribute in the second half of this year?","Jerry Norcia","Yes. The deals that we closed just in the recent past will be tied to - we use various contracting methods to secure revenues. There is ability to hedge the product, there\u2019s also ability to have long-term contracts. So we\u2019re in a process of making all that happen right now.","Gerry Anderson","So without getting into not wanting to reveal stuff that\u2019s confidential as a business, I\u2019d say that we always have the offtake of these locked up. And then you can do fixed price contracts, sometimes fixed price contracts if you do or may not have the return that you get when you hedge them, so we\u2019ve got some that are fixed price some that are hedged and you could take some of these open in the short term too if you feel like the short-term price dynamics and then hedge them later.","So I think we\u2019ll end up with, Shar, is a portfolio that we manage in that way with offtakes clearly locked down and then prices managed through contracts and in hedging to make sure that we like the predictability of it.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So just to follow-up a little bit on Shar\u2019s question if you can, obviously $150 million to $200 million for this first transaction, can you elaborate a little bit further on how you\u2019re thinking about filling up the remainder of potential even whitespace for acquisitions here on the GSP side? I suppose that there is ample latitude in the capital budget for further such deals. And to the extent which you are looking at them, are we looking at sort of more platforms or are we looking at more simple bolt-ons in Link and NEXUS more narrowly?","Jerry Norcia","So Julien I would say our first-order dispatch we have a series of organic development opportunities that we\u2019re pursuing. So that\u2019ll be our first-order dispatch for capital. And yes, we do have additional flexibility in our capital plan to accommodate the organic developments.","In addition, we\u2019re always surveying the market for potential bolt-ons in and around our platform. We\u2019d like for them to be contiguous just like the most recent one will become contiguous over time. So the order dispatches organic development, which we see the highest return potential from. And then acquisitions that have growth potential in them.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. But you aren\u2019t necessarily saying whether you\u2019d be more bolt-ons versus larger platform acquisition at this point?","Jerry Norcia","We judge all it by the merits of the returns in economics. So I think we told investors last year that we were looking hard at an acquisition and eventually concluded, didn\u2019t meet our return requirements, didn\u2019t create value for us. So we walked away from it. This one we liked.","And we liked the future growth potential. So this one will probably turn out to be an acquisition that\u2019s been followed by organic growth, which usually release a really good result and dollars spent on acquisitions is not nearly as good a measure as value created through often organic upside which is sort of high value EPS growth. And we love that sort of stuff. So we can do more like the one we just did, we love to. There are good opportunities, the scale is comfortable with upside. Those produce really good value.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then if I can just quickly complimenting that speaking of organic growth, what is reflected in your current plan with respect to the voluntary renewable expansion? So you talked about 280 megawatts is being signed up, a third one on the way and then an additional 300 megawatt in total. So out of that almost 600 megawatt what\u2019s reflected in your outlook in advance?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, we have 300 in the plan that we laid out for EEI. But we did talk at that time about the potential to go up. So I think with 280 signed up with another contract waiting in the queue, we\u2019re sort of through the first 300 and working our way into the next 300. And this is an area we like, it\u2019s obviously fulfilling a need for our customers, they want it.","But it also is a way to move the State forward in terms of additions of renewable capacity, but do it in a way that isn\u2019t rate based, it doesn\u2019t work its way through rate cases, it works its way through this approved tariff. And so we really like this area and we\u2019re going to continue to work with customers who have the goal to help accelerate things here in Michigan and to - there\u2019s obvious value for these customers in terms of their own profile and what they can communicate to their customer bases.","So it\u2019s good area for us to work and we\u2019re into the second 300 now. And as look forward I think there maybe upside of that as we continue to -- we\u2019re working with our very largest customers but we have lot of customers. So we\u2019re thinking now about how to make more of this.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","I just wanted to find out about the equity issuance. Recently, the $250 million of internal funding at what point do you think you\u2019ll have to complete the complete plan with block issuance at some point?","Peter Oleksiak","We\u2019re in early stages of looking at that right now. We still do have some room in our pension plan. To get equity we\u2019re at about 85% funded level in our pension plan. I\u2019d say within the three year window, probably the back half of the year. And we\u2019re finally looking at more ATMs attributables versus a big block equity issuance.","Michael Weinstein","And you know on the generation pipeline, one question I had is are you anticipating expansion through compression in addition to the lateral as part of the value proposition to that?","Peter Oleksiak","Right now our first order of business is to look to connect that pipeline to NEXUS. It does have the fact that NEXUS carries a very high pressure as it helps create some potential.","Gerry Anderson","So that\u2019s one of the values NEXUS can bring to this pipe is that it itself is very high pressure and that can create expansion capability and growth capability for this pipe alone.","Michael Weinstein","And I\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions about the Link asset and what is the contracted status there and then also what are the expansion opportunities you\u2019re looking at, what\u2019s the plan for expansion down there?","Gerry Anderson","We had planned expansions and those are progressing as scheduled. So those will continue into this year for one of our large clients on that pipeline. The status of the pipe is that it\u2019s performing better than a performer that we had described to our investors. So we\u2019re feeling really good about that asset and it\u2019s dynamics.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Just finishing the M&A topic and the GSP sector. So last year you guys were preparing us in a sense for some acquisitions seemingly in that sector. At least for 2019, do you think that you\u2019re done with this generation pipeline deal?","Gerry Anderson","You know, Angie, it\u2019s - I think in M&A to say you\u2019re done or not done probably wouldn\u2019t be smart on our part because totally depends upon whether there\u2019s an opportunity with really good value. And if we look at handful of them this year and there\u2019s no value, we don\u2019t do any. And if we look at them, which we do continue to scan the environment and we find one that we really like, we could do one this year. So it\u2019s completely I\u2019d say market an opportunity dependent.","Angie Storozynski","And changing topics on your regulated electric utility, so last year we were hoping to see a CapEx rider on the electric side we saw the CMS rate case, they didn\u2019t get the rider. Could you give us an update what are your thoughts about that and when such a rider would be achievable?","Gerry Anderson","In our case it\u2019s in our rate case that that discussion is playing out. So last year we did introduce the idea of it because we were filing the case. And if you look at the staff reactions to our case I think you\u2019ll find the commentary around the infrastructure recovery mechanism is positive although they suggest that perhaps finalizing it should be done outside of a rate case.","So with the opportunity for more definition of the details I guess should say that that could be the case. It\u2019s possible that the commissioners will feel they have enough information on record to establish it, so that really - we will see through the finalization of the case. But if you\u2019re asking how do we feel about continued quality of discussions around this at the commission? We feel good. We feel that there\u2019s been constructive engagement with the staff and prior to the case with the commissioners on this. And that it\u2019s set up for continued discussion. I think they just want to get it right.","We have one at our Gas company, it\u2019s operated very well. So that shows that a well designed mechanism can work well here in Michigan. And so I think the process we\u2019re in now is getting the design right and getting both sides comfortable that we\u2019re ready to move forward with this.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Praful Mehta from Citi. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","So just following up on Angie\u2019s question on the regulation and the rate case. Given the new governor and new commissioners, how do you see that playing out? Do you see that impacting the process and what kind of regulatory kind of sentiment or mood do you see going forward with the environment in Michigan?","Gerry Anderson","So we have - we do have two sitting commissioners that we worked with for quite some time now. And they obviously can keep the commission flowing and active in the near term. That said, we do expect one appointment to play out shorter term and then the other would come after July when - I\u2019m sorry will retire. And wouldn\u2019t make any sense to be speculating or commenting on specific commissioners but I would just say that we\u2019ve had inflow and outflow of commissioners and governors across many years here at DTE including the 10 that we mentioned earlier where our financial performance has been strong and steady and our job is to work really well with the commissioners that the governor appoints.","We know the governor well, worked with her through her long career in the Michigan legislature, and since then, and we work closely with her on the agenda that she has for the state moving forward and I think she understands that the appointments to this sector, it\u2019s big sector with heavy investment in the state, I think she understands how important these appointments are. So, I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get a competent person.","Praful Mehta","And then maybe just a specific question on the results and on the Corporate and other segment, the 122 negative versus the 100 to 110 range you said there was a specific one time item that kind of drove that. Could you provide any little bit more color around what kind of drove that Corporate and other segment impact?","Peter Oleksiak","We had a contribution to our DTE foundation and other charitable causes. This is part of our strategy to be a force for growth and good on our communities that really sets us up nicely and as we have strong results for the year we like to do that. So this year we did and 2018 we did roughly about $20 million after tax.","Praful Mehta","And that was incremental to the plan, so that was something you planed to - you hadn\u2019t planned for but then kind of did it at the very end in 2018?","Peter Oleksiak","It was incremental to plans, if you adjust 2018 results for that, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s in line with our 2019 guidance for that segment.","Praful Mehta","And then finally quickly just back to Generation Pipeline acquisition, just wanted to understand why the range of 150 to 200? If you have a deal, is that range to kind of not provide more specifics so that you kind of keep the economic a little vague or is there anything specific around the range of the price?","Peter Oleksiak","We\u2019re - the deal is finalized and we do have confidentiality agreements in place and this is what our counterparty is comfortable with at this point in time.","Praful Mehta","We did ask about revealing the specific number and they just didn\u2019t want to do that. And you can understand that as they are active in the marketplace maybe in other positions, they want to keep their hand a little vague. So this was the agreement we reached with them.","Praful Mehta","But there\u2019s no specific term in the contract that would change the price. The price is fixed, there isn\u2019t earn out or anything else that kind of drives the price - drives any change in the price going forward?","Peter Oleksiak","The price is fixed.","Gerry Anderson","Price is fixed, we still want to be clear about it. We\u2019re happy to be clear, they weren\u2019t. So it is what it is.","Praful Mehta","Understood. You\u2019ve seen that in the past and understandable from their perspective. So appreciate the color guys, thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","I think you pretty much just answered my question. So at some point in the future we\u2019ll get more specific purchase price financing and expected EBITDA contribution occupied but for now you\u2019re just limited in what you can say, fair?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, I think certainly we\u2019re limited in what we can say and we may find that the seller is okay with us down the road being more specific. And if that\u2019s the case, we will be.","Greg Gordon","I see that the owner, this Generation Pipeline LLC, do we know - can you disclose to us who owns Generation Pipeline LLC?","Gerry Anderson","No, it\u2019s under CAL so.","Greg Gordon","And then one other - but you did say that going in day one the investment hits your traditional cost to capital hurdles for a pipeline investment and that over time as you integrated into the NEXUS system you expect that to expand?","Gerry Anderson","Yes. I mean I\u2019ll be honest with you. If we never improve the pipe a bit, we\u2019re happy with the returns, but value we always say the value in heat in these sorts of investments is what you can do with them once they become part of your portfolio. So, yes, happy with the returns from the contracts that are in place for the pipe where the belief that there is good value to create beyond that.","Greg Gordon"," I was able to find a detailed map of the pipelines route online and it does looks like it goes through some pretty dense industrial areas. So the assumption being once you build that lateral that you\u2019ll be able to goose the volumes and maybe goose the contracted volumes on NEXUS by serving those customers. Is that the obvious synergy from this?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes, absolutely. I think that\u2019s exactly our plan. That part of the [inaudible] is where every industry plays out. So it\u2019s an area where I think there\u2019s an opportunity for our producers tied to NEXUS to be able to deliver into that base over time through this pipeline. So it will be good for that industrial community and good for us too.","Greg Gordon","One final question and maybe it\u2019s semantics. But on the - in the EEI deck you said very specifically you\u2019re targeting 5% to 7% operating EPS growth through 2023. I think your language was slightly different in your script today, but is that still your commitment?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes, it was slightly different. It wasn\u2019t meant to be. It\u2019s exactly what we said at EEI.","Greg Gordon","Okay, I just wanted to make sure that that was on the record guys. Thanks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon","Just on the returns on the generation pipeline, how do we think about your hurdle rates for that segment kind of little bit north of utility hurdle rates?","Gerry Anderson","Yes. That\u2019s where we like to start. But you know I think what\u2019s proved out over time is if you can buy and start there either construct and start there or buy and start there, the value comes from the options that it presents down the road.","Paul Ridzon","I think you\u2019ve already said this but you\u2019re already there, correct?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, correct.","Paul Ridzon","And what kind of capital structure should we assume on that accretive analysis?","Gerry Anderson","It\u2019s 50-50.","Paul Ridzon","And then getting an IRM on the electric side is not legislative that\u2019s all before the commission I think you said earlier?","Peter Oleksiak","That\u2019s correct. Very positive thing in our current regular rate cases that the commission has been very supportive of the capital that we\u2019re planning on investing in the electric utility.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","First question is also similar to Greg\u2019s, might just be semantics but I want to clarify. The EEI slide deck you said you were targeting strong investment grade credit ratings. Now it looks like targeting change to maintaining, is there anything to that? I mean are the metrics where you want them to be in particularly after this acquisition?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, there\u2019s nothing meant through that. Peter if you want to say more?","Peter Oleksiak","No, we definitely are committed to our ratings and we\u2019re targeting to have a strong credit ratings that we have today. It gives us a lot of flexibility to have a strong balance sheet and it\u2019s been proven out over the years.","Gerry Anderson","Our FFO results for last year played out stronger because of the cash flow and earnings. So we have a good strong FFO to debt and when you do that it builds in some strength and flexibility forward. So we\u2019re probably in a better position than we were when we talked to you at EEI.","Andrew Weisel","Just wanted to make sure you weren\u2019t changing the messaging. Next question is relative to the last week\u2019s cold snap, how would you describe the utility natural gas supplies going into the snap and how are you positioned for the rest of the winter?","Peter Oleksiak","Well, we are positioned really well going into it. I just described the day for you. We did hit design commissions during those peak conditions and we moved about 4.5 billion cubic feet of gas through the gas utility that day, of which 2.5 billion cubic feet was destined for in franchise customers and 2 billion cubic feet we\u2019re exporting to other interstate pipelines that serve markets as far as New York, Wisconsin, Chicago. So we were extremely well positioned to move gas on that day.","Gerry Anderson","Does that answer the question or\u2026?","Andrew Weisel","Yes. Just wondering how are you positioning going forward, if we have another cold stretch, is that going to be trouble?","Peter Oleksiak","We welcome it. We\u2019re well positioned for it.","Andrew Weisel","Next question on the electric side. The weather normalized sales were flat for the year obviously, given the extreme weather this past summer, it\u2019s hard to do math on that. But my question is, what\u2019s your estimate of the impact of energy efficiency these days and what\u2019s embedded in your guidance for 2019 and beyond?","Peter Oleksiak","Andrew we did have flat sales 2018 versus 2017 when you look at the residential such in particular we had flat usage but we had customer count at very healthy 0.7% increase in our customer counts and so really there\u2019s often energy efficiency, energy efficiencies definitely helping our customers. We do have targeted energy efficiency programs there.","Gerry Anderson","And so we\u2019re building and forward plans is very flat and it just isn\u2019t growth we are counting out frankly we don\u2019t want to sell the wrong label, we don\u2019t want it. We want these energy efficiency programs to really bite for our customers because it helps manage their bills and their affordability to time when we\u2019re making significant investments to capital.","And that\u2019s the whole trick here is to help customers keep their energy costs affordable while we really fundamentally reinvest in the assets and in our businesses. And so we\u2019re driving that efficiency side hard. Now there are things that are growing and as Peter said getting customer count additions we got a lot of construction in the city of Detroit and so on and so forth. So they\u2019re healthy signs but we are working the efficiency side of it hard.","Andrew Weisel","I like the strategy maybe one last one if I could squeeze it in here. And update on the volumes flowing to NEXUS and if NEXUS does connect to generation, how much capacity is there on NEXUS to add that 355 and potentially more.","Jerry Norcia","First I\u2019ll say that NEXUS is flowing at its current capacity and that will also increase over time as we bring more assets online as it relates to the upstream portion of NEXUS. In terms of connecting generation pipeline, it will provide a significant market outlet and demand source for the pipeline. So we expect that as we make those connections two things will happen one is, it will make the pipeline much more attractive for current shippers and also for our future shippers. And the question of could we accept all of that on the NEXUS the answer is yes.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead","Steve Fleishman","So just first on the curious kind of your view on Northeast Gas so we had some of the producers come out and I think the production expectations for this year come in a little bit lower than people expected. So just how are they coming in with kind of what you\u2019re planning for this year on your system?","Jerry Norcia","Good question, Steve. Obviously we\u2019ve been watching that very closely on our platforms and all of the projections of the producers that we do business with are in line with our current guidance and our current forecast so we\u2019re feeling really good about it at this point.","Also I think we kind of see this discipline its entering the market as positive for the long-term with producers and in addition to that, we see there is a short-term phenomenon because the demand for the product is there. And I think as producers get healthier it will help to improve the I think the price complex for the producers as this has been - sets in.","Gerry Anderson","So Steve just to add to that as Jerry I think there\u2019s producers are being encouraged by investors to show capital discipline and there has been this flip in the market from investors really looking for how fast can you grow production to show me cash flow, show me the healthy cash flow.","And so they\u2019re all being encouraged to show capital discipline. And that can that can wiggle things in the short run as Jerry just said we don\u2019t see it for us it\u2019s in line with our plan, but when you think about this longer term, the production is what it is. I mean the demand will be what it is from the power and industrial and LDC sectors and declines in well productivity happen every year and those need to be fulfilled. Those need to be backfilled the declines and the demand growth needs to be met.","And so even though there\u2019s capital discipline it\u2019s really a short run phenomenon to get into the medium and long term and just dictate it by the realities of supply and demand. And so we continue to see the region that we are serving very well-positioned to continue to meet and grow as that plays out.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Great. And then just one question high level on the equity issuance that you\u2019re planning the $1 billion to $1.5 billion, so just to clarify, and I guess, this really goes back to EEI. The --does that include an assumption of more acquisitions beyond what you said or not so, if you announced a larger one would that potentially already be embedded in their?","Gerry Anderson","We -- it assume we have into the segments we provided this disclosure around the level of capital spend, so it does some capital plan on each of those platforms and subsidiaries. And Jerry mentioned our first order business is Greenfield, but many cases instead of greenfield will do acquisitions occasionally out to all\u2026","Steve Fleishman","Okay.","Gerry Anderson","\u2026 in capital spend and that\u2019s really what supporting that acquisition plan.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thank you","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from David Fishman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Fishman","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning, David.","David Fishman","Thanks. On the Generation Pipeline, this was some quick research I apologize, let me know, if I\u2019m wrong here. But it looks like they filed for an Ironville Lateral already that could begin construction as early as February 25th, is this something that was anticipated and expected as part of purchase price?","Gerry Anderson","Yes.","David Fishman","Okay. And then with those sort of opportunity, especially because this a little more exposed to high industrials, do you see this representing a competitive advantage for P&I as well and maybe the combined heat and gas opportunities in the future?","Jerry Norcia","We are having some of those conversations, but I wouldn\u2019t say any of them are well advanced, but there are potential synergies between the two businesses for sure.","David Fishman","Okay. Thanks guys. Congrats on a good year.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse Lane. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up, I just was noticing that the sequentially earnings at the GSP business declined in the fourth quarter versus the first three quarters of the year. Just wondering if you could explain that and what drives the seasonality of that whatever it is?","Gerry Anderson","Maybe, Peter, Dave, you want to\u2026","Peter Oleksiak","We can probably get back with you Michael. My percent is, I know, we had a strong kind of midyear with a summer and then some of the flows of gases on that maybe some volume with some of our pipelines.","David Meador","Peter, this is Dave. Yeah. I think this just maybe the timing of how each platform plays out over the course of the year.","Peter Oleksiak","Yeah.","Gerry Anderson","We can have somebody get here there was nothing material or anything really that we took notice of. So if you\u2019re seeing that we can do a tick and tact for you and just tell you what it was\u2026","Michael Weinstein","Got you.","Gerry Anderson","We see some LED there, obviously, because our pipes flow hot and heavy and hard and certain times in the year like they have been this past month. And other parts of the year less so, so that produces some variation.","Michael Weinstein","All right. Thanks a lot guys. Have a great day.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Gerry Anderson for any additional or closing remarks.","Gerry Anderson","Well, I want to say thanks again to all you for joining the call and for the good questions. As I said at the beginning of the call, I feel great about the year that we had in 2018, not only financially, but on a lot of other fronts that goes such a long way to keeping the context here in Michigan positive. And I feel really good about the position were in heading into 2019 both the start of the year and the plan that we have for the balance of the year. I think we\u2019re really good position to deliver another good year and strong results for you all. And we look forward to providing you updates on all of that as we move forward. Thanks again for joining. We will talk to all of you soon.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect."],"7862":["DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 25, 2014  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Anastasia Minor - IR","Peter Oleksiak - CFO and SVP","Jeff Jewell - VP and Controller","Mark Rolling - VP and Treasurer","Analysts","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Michael Weinstein - UBS","David Pess - Wolfe Research","Operator","Good day everyone and welcome to the DTE Energy Hosted First Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Anastasia Minor. Please go ahead.","Anastasia Minor","","Thank you, Nikki, and good morning everyone. And welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we get started, I would like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the referenced forward-looking statements.","Our presentation also includes reference to operating earnings, which is the non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","With us this morning is Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President and CFO; Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller; and Mark Rolling, our Vice President and Treasurer. We also have members of our management team with us to call on during the Q&A Session.","And with that, I would like to turn it over Peter to start our call this morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Thank you, Anastasia and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. There will be a beautiful spring day here in Detroit reaching close to 60 degrees. Actually, it\u2019s supposed to be raining today but we\u2019ll take rain and 60 at this point in the year. Hard to believe that only a few weeks ago we had our last blast of winter and snow at its first quarter was one for the record books, record cold, record snow and the Red Wings reaching the play offs the 23rd year in a row, so as I said about the first and last records I mentioned, the cold and Red Wings definitely too much snow. Before I get started I\u2019d like welcome Jeff and Mark to the earnings call for the first time in their roles. They\u2019ll be taking you through earnings and cash flow after I provide a brief overview.","We\u2019ll turn on Slide 5. Before I jump in the financials, we\u2019d like to review our investment thesis. At the top of this list is our utility growth plans, next few years these plans are driven by environmental-related spend. In the longer horizon, we\u2019ll be starting the process of renewing our aging coal fleet with gas and renewables. For gas utility, we have cast iron main replacement program that will last several decades. What sets us apart from most of our peers is our non-utility investments. We have strict criteria where they have to make strategic sense and are contracted to reduce risk. In this space, we\u2019re more excited about our non-utility gas midstream business.","We know every day we need to earn the regulatory structure in the environment we currently have. In a few pages, I\u2019ll describe our recent move we made with our next electric rate case to further reinforce this environment. Now the way to keep regulatory structure we have is to deliver strong operations and high customer satisfaction. And as always, we look focused on cash and keeping a strong balance sheet which has led to recent credit upgrades. This approach has translated to strong results as you can see on the next page.","On Slide 6 you can see that we have a targeted earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% and we have achieved over 7% since 2008. In our planning process, I know we\u2019ve described that we do have contingency if you see last year\u2019s we did not need that contingency and overachieved our 5% to 6%. Another key component of our investor value story is our dividend growth. We have grown dividends since 2010 and have grown them at a 5.4% average. The $4.30 guidance midpoint puts us at a 61% payout near the bottom of our range. With the growth contemplated on utilities and non-utilities in the next five years we will be approaching a $1 billion of net income at the end of this timeframe.","We can now turn to Slide 7 and this shows our earnings guidance by segment. We are reiterating our earnings per share guidance range of $4.20 to $4.40. Although the first quarter weather wasn\u2019t favorable to our utilities, our gas utility in particular is still early in the year. You can see in the guidance since many of you maybe scratching your head looking at our guidance for the utility gas that we did not change that. We have put there a green arrow up there. We have not changed the gas segment guidance even though at some point in the year we will know that we probably we will be revising that segment higher and most likely when we remix all of our segments after the third quarter.","At this point in the year, we\u2019ll reserve the winter weather favorability in the first quarter as contingency for summer weather variability. Jeff will cover the details and the amount of the weather that landed in the first quarter and is now guidance contingency. We also plan on reinvesting some of weather upside directly back into our gas utility. So bottom-line, there are no changes to guidance at this time but with a strong bias upward. As we discussed in our 2013 year-end call given the strong performance of our utilities and growth oriented non-utility businesses, our 2014 guidance does not depend on operating income contribution from our trading business.","Accordingly, we have set the Energy Trading earnings guidance for 2014 at zero. Longer-term we expect 20 million to 25 million of economic earnings per year and we made earnings comment that income it will be over and above of our 5% to 6% earnings goal. I mentioned this because you will see in the guidance here on this page in our financial results sections of our presentation that Jeff will walk you through, we\u2019ll be providing earnings results and guidance for our growth segment in addition to operating earnings including the contribution of Energy Trading to better illustrate where growth is coming from.","We get a lot of questions around updates on the Michigan economy and on Page 8 highlight some of the key metrics here and it does provide evidence of an improving economy of Michigan. You can see that most of the Michigan economic indicators have returned to pre-recessionary levels and are forecasted to continue to improve in the near-term. You can see auto production levels are well above the lows of 2009, and actually on a national level the U.S. auto sales are at 16.4 million which is definitely better than pre-recessionary levels. A key indicator at Michigan employment that continues to trend downward. The March unemployment number which just came out was 7.5% which is the lowest since May of 2008. And Michigan actually leads the nation in new manufacturing job creation.","On Slide 9 it is what I indicated earlier in terms of the move that we made here in the first quarter around our electric business. This slide provides another indication of how the support of regulatory environment the MPSC approved our application to suspend and move the amortization of the DTE Electric\u2019s revenue decoupler to 2015. A revised plan to file a rate case at the end of 2014 or early 2015 with the option to self implement in six months. We have a strong focus on cost control, customer affordability, and maintaining strong regulatory relationships. This action demonstrates our focus on all three of those priorities. For DTE Gas unit, we\u2019re leveraging our infrastructure recovery mechanism and continuous improvement to keep operating costs as low as possible with the intent to stay out of rate cases for three years.","Finally on Page 10, before I hand it over to Jeff to sum up. We remain confident in achieving our 2014 guidance. First quarter results were very strong with higher earnings quarter-over-quarter across utility and non-utility businesses. Both utilities came in well over last year due of course due to colder weather we had this past winter. Our cash from operations and balance sheet remains strong providing the foundation for our growth investments. ","With that I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller to provide more details on the first quarter results. Jeff?","Jeff Jewell","Thanks, Peter and good morning everyone. I would like to start on Slide 12 and the first quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE Energy\u2019s operating earnings were $1.69 per share. And as a reference our reported earnings were $1.84 per share. You\u2019ll find a reconciliation of the first quarter reported operating earnings on Page 29 with the largest reconciling item related to the mark-to-market time and adjustments at Energy Trading which we discussed with you in the year-end call.","Now for the business segments, the major driver for the quarter as everyone would expect was the extremely cold weather. The November through March season in Southeast Michigan was the coldest in 100 years, produced a record snowfall that was over twice the average, and DTE Gas set two daily volumetric records in January; one for daily storage withdrawals and the other for daily system throughput. Each of these records were 50% higher than the average. For the two utilities, DTE Electric contributed $0.77 and DTE Gas came in at $0.73. The non-utility segments combined earned $0.25 with Gas Storage & Pipelines at $0.12, and industrial projects at $0.08 and Energy Trading at $0.05. Corporate and other had a loss of $0.06 for the quarter.","Let\u2019s move to Slide 13 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segments. The first item I would like to draw your attention to is how we will be discussing our operating earnings for the Company going forward. As Peter explained in this overview, will be discussing our earnings with and without Energy Trading to better illustrate alignment between our growth goals and our growth segment and businesses. If we start on the left side of Slide 13, you will see two boxed areas, one called growth segments operating EPS and the other called operating EPS. The growth segments include the segments that will contribute to our 5% to 6% EPS growth goal that excludes Energy Trading. The second box is labeled operating EPS and includes all DTE Energy segments including Energy Trading.","Now for the results for the quarter by segment. Growth segments operating earnings were up 65 million for the quarter. Both our utilities, DTE Electric and DTE Gas had significantly colder than normal better in 2014 versus the near-normal weather in 2013. DTE Electric earned 21 million year-over-year and DTE Gas had an increase in earnings of 33 million. Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings were 4 million above prior year. This increase was primarily due to the growth in our Bluestone pipeline and gathering assets. We also saw weather driven favorability in our storage business that was partially offset by deferred revenue accounting adjustment.","Our Power & Industrial Projects segment was up 3 million from 2013. This increase was driven by higher reduced emission fuel earnings, from relocations completed in the late 2013. Our Corporate & Other segment came in favorable by 4 million from last year, primarily due to lower taxes. These results again provided 65 million of favorable earnings quarter-over-quarter at the growth segment level. At Energy Trading results were 1 million higher due to market opportunities in our gas marketing business offset by losses in the power marketing group. Page 28 in the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation page which shows both economic and according performance.","I would like to now turn to Slide 14 and walk you through some quarterly details for both DTE Electric and DTE Gas. Starting from the left with DTE Electric, the Electric segment had earnings favorability of 21 million quarter-to-quarter with 13 million attributable to weather, 14 million related primarily to the 2014 amortization of our revenue decoupler liability and a reduction of 6 million for higher O&M and depreciation expenses. The chart on the right shows DTE Gas was up 33 million with the major driver being weather of 28 million and other net favorability of 5 million, which was driven by increased midstream storage margins offset by increased weather-related O&M expenses. Adding the two companies together, we experienced more than 40 million of weather favorability during the quarter or about $0.25 per share.","Now turning to Slide 15 which adds some additional color to Peter\u2019s earlier comments on EPS guidance. As you know we operate and manage DTE Energy as a portfolio and strive to deliver on our stated growth targets. Since it is still very early in the year and we have the potential for significant earnings variability in our Electric segment due to the summer weather we\u2019re not changing our 2014 EPS guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 or segment mix at this time. The chart depicts how we are thinking about our balance of the year potential weather exposure in relationship with the first quarter weather favorability of $0.25. We view the two currently offsetting each other thus leading us back to our guidance range of $4.20 to $4.40. That concludes the update on our earnings for the quarter.","I would like to now turn the discussion over to Mark Rolling, Vice President and Treasurer, who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics.","Mark Rolling","Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. I want to start off by saying that it\u2019s great to be back working with our investors and analysts again. So you\u2019ve heard my predecessors saying many times that maintaining a strong balance sheet and cash flows is a key priority for DTE. And I want to assure you that is still going to be the case going forward. I am going to begin on Slide 17 with a look at our first quarter cash flows. Through March cash from operations was $500 million, down slightly from 2013. The colder weather that Peter and Jeff spoke about drove higher customer cash proceeds and at the same time those were largely offset by higher purchases of gas and power that were needed to meet those demands.","Capital spending was slightly higher than last year due to increased CapEx at the electric utility and continued investment in our Gas Midstream business. Overall, DTE\u2019s net cash was down slightly year-over-year and in line with our full year guidance. Slide 18 lays out our capital investments in a little more detail. The electric utility capital was higher due to increased spending and distribution reliability projects and the refueling outage at our nuclear plant. Gas utility is a little lower quarter-over-quarter, but that\u2019s really timing related. And the non-utility CapEx is up driven by investments we are making at our Bluestone-related assets at Gas Storage & Pipelines.","Let me wrap-up with a look at our balance sheet metrics on Slide 19. Our balance sheet remains strong with both leverage and FFO metrics expected to be within the targeted range for the year. We have adequate liquidity with 1.5 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter, and our plans are to issue no new equity in 2014, but plan to issue between 200 million and 300 million of equity in 2015 and 2016.","And now I\u2019ll turn the discussion back over to Peter.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks Mark. Summary on Slide 21, you can see the first ticked point that we are on-track to meet our operating earnings guidance, and I can say we are more than on-track. As we described and Jeff described, we\u2019re coming in the remaining three quarters with some good contingency to the guidance. Also we received approval from the MPSC to suspend our electric revenue decoupler. This has actually helped us to move that rate case timing to the end of \u201914 and early \u201915. We think that\u2019s been a good move for us and for our customers. Our balance sheet and cash flow metrics remains strong and investments in our utility and non-utility businesses will provide the targeted 5% to 6% EPS growth on a go forward basis.","I\u2019d like to thank you all for listening to our call this morning, and Nikki I would like to open it up now for any questions that maybe out there.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Can you guys just update us on the status around electric choice, and what is happening with the proposed legislation both for and against, and when you see potential resolution coming?","Peter Oleksiak","There is a bill introduced that was looking at the deregulation bill which was a very interesting twist, as we have been seeing overtime, bills to increase the choice count and so this was an interesting one where that was for, and moving away from the hybrid model, the deregulation -- that has gotten its time in due diligence, but now there is really no support for that bill. And if anything, it\u2019s really putting the broader context around regulation and central the re-regulations. So that bill on particular, right now it\u2019s pretty much is on its course.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","And just in pipeline expansion that was highlighted as a key area of growth in 2013, what kind of updates can be look is at the upcoming AGA conference?","Peter Oleksiak","The AGA conference, we\u2019re kind of working through right now internally. The level of disclosures that we\u2019re intended to increase the disclosures in the pipeline segment, give you some more updates around the pipeline, the gathering, potentially even at the storage which are three components of that business and looking at expansions, looking at growth plans and looking at capital spend for those segments.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Peter Oleksiak","Hi Matt.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good morning and congrats on a nice quarter.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Just a follow-up on the midstream side you talked in the past about ongoing discussions for additional acreage commitments at Bluestone. Could you provide some update on that as well as the progress you\u2019re making on President\u2019s Agreements for the NEXUS pipeline?","Peter Oleksiak","Sure, starting with Bluestone, the activity around Bluestone continues at a vigorous pace, we actually have a couple of things on the pipe itself. We\u2019re in the process of expanding. We have put this pipe into service late 2012, so a little less than a year half and later we\u2019re doubling the capacity of the pipe northward that\u2019s progressing along. We\u2019ll have those expansions in place this year and the beginning of next year. On the gathering side, we\u2019re right now currently working with Northwestern with our gathering around the Bluestone project with the additional acreage that they have and potentially we\u2019re cutting our teeth on this first acreage they have. So we\u2019re optimistic we have a great relationship with Southwestern Energy and we\u2019re improving ourselves out with the first tranche of gathering there.","Jeff Jewell","You asked also around the NEXUS project, I can give you a brief update there as well and that we\u2019re very excited about this project. Jerry indicated on the year-end call, we saw a significant spike in interest levels. Interest here with project where that\u2019s kind of a medium level when the cold happened. There were strong price signals in the Michigan Ontario market. That interest continues to be strong even though the weather has tampered here. We have three agreements. We\u2019ve talked about on this pipe. We\u2019ve talked about it in terms of it being supported around end utilities. We have three agreements at this moment of time with three utilities of anchored the project. This project really is going to be driven through on the producer side the amount of shale gas is going to be coming in this region and the activity on that side continues to happen at a feverish space, and we\u2019re in discussions right now with half a dozen producers and actually a late stage negotiations with the few of them. We are also progressing on some of the engineering field work related to the project. And we are very bullish on the project at this time. The Utica shale is actually one of the most profitable shale plays in the country. A lot of drill bit money being allocated to the region and we\u2019re excited to have the project right in the middle of it.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks. Do you have a kind of timeframe in mind right now that you\u2019re targeting for kind of go-no-go decision on the project?","Peter Oleksiak","For the project right now the targeted end service stage is in the end of 2017. We\u2019d be really referring around these agreements. We\u2019re really going to be building this thing. We need to get an 80% to 90% of basically capacity committed to it and around a midyear timeframe is what we\u2019d be looking for. I think it\u2019s really more of a matter of time at this point versus the go-no-go given the extremely strong interest that we\u2019re seeing in the project.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Got it. Thanks. And then just shifting gears, it looks like the RDM liability amortization was about a 14 million impact to earnings, is that the right level to be assuming for the second quarter and then when it picks up again next year and could you give the pre-tax number associated with that?","Peter Oleksiak","The RDM amortization overall if you recall it 127 million pretax and when you kind of break that down after-tax per quarter it\u2019s a little south of $20 million per quarter. We\u2019ll have that in the first quarter and second quarter of this year. We\u2019ll stop the amortization and begin again next year of the first and second quarter of next year.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks. And just one last just follow-up to that. Can you talk about how the decision to defer the second half amortization kind of plays into your intact guidance?","Peter Oleksiak","For this year it is contemplated in reiteration of this year\u2019s guidance and that is -- as we came into the year I\u2019d say it\u2019s a combination of taking look at the cost controls that we put in place, a lot of that was in the benefit reductions, and we had another tranche of benefit reductions that happened last year related to our union contract, so we really understood that, understood what\u2019s happening with discount rates related to those benefit expense. And also to some of the first year favorability that we\u2019ve seen here on the weather side, so one way that we\u2019re essentially reinvesting it back into our business with our customers. We\u2019re utilizing that to basically suspend in the move that amortization and move out our rate proceeding to the end of the year or early next year.","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Got it, thanks Peter.","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes.","","Operator","And the next question will come from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Peter Oleksiak","Hi Andrew.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Thanks. Good morning guys. My question is about the load growth I see from the supplemental slides you have it at zero. I know that weather normalization is practically impossible with this quarter but just wondering that is a slowdown from last year, so just wondering if that\u2019s something that you see as a real trend or is that just noise around the extreme weather?","Peter Oleksiak","I think it\u2019s a good question, and I am going to ask our Controller Jeff Jewell to answer that question.","Jeff Jewell","Hi Andrew yes what we\u2019re forecasting that we had for this year was -- as we\u2019ve stated before is about a half percent growth overall. And so what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re seeing that in the first quarter in line with that in the industrial and the commercial and you\u2019ve seen that temperate normalize piece. And then what you\u2019re seeing in the residential just like you mentioned it temperature normalization, you\u2019re right, that creates some challenges around that, but we still feel that that\u2019s going to come in flat and that in combination with the commercial and the industrial is going to allow the overall to be in about that half a percent growth year-over-year.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Okay. Thank you. Next question is as far as trading, I know you\u2019re assuming zero for this year. I think I heard you say you\u2019re expecting more of a long 20 to 25, is that right?","Peter Oleksiak","That is correct. We have indicated for this business unit that -- we really don\u2019t want to put a part of our guidance in our operating earnings growth, so we are signaling the zero your guidance. And actually the other phenomenon that's happening here in the near-term, we are moving a portion of that business to more longer-term contracts so they have more accrual accounting basis, so there will be a lag between accounting recognition and economics. When you look at the pure economic income and that\u2019s the main metric we use to judge this business unit it is a $20 million to $25 million range that we are looking at over the longer-term. And this year if you look at the first quarter they achieved $10 million of economic net income.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Okay, so the way you present to that is sort of below the growth line, to me that looks like what some companies would call a discontinued operation or non-core, is there any reconsideration about keeping this business?","Peter Oleksiak","We are definitely keeping the trading business. We think there\u2019s a lot of strategic value from the cash perspective, the 20 million to 25 million overtime is cash that provides actually a lot of good market intelligence for us from the commodity standpoint as well as different geographical regions. For instance it is interesting in this last quarter, we were talking around the Northeast and the PGAM market, and some of the challenges we\u2019ve had there and actually there has been a lot of insights we\u2019ve gained here. And our management team has gained around PGM and the PGAM markets, just having the training company. So it is -- definitely it provides a lot of interest to you, what have you.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Okay, great, and my last question sort of a bookkeeping one. When I look at your cash flow, I see $15 million of stock repurchase; what\u2019s going on there and should we expect that to just be timing over the year, and it will be a net zero?","Mark Rolling","Hi Andrew, this is Mark Rolling. That is just geography in the cash flow statement. We\u2019re not issuing new equity. We settled up on some of our employee benefits, equity options, equity benefits. And we actually did purchase stock and then replaced that, so it shows that on the cash flow statement as a source, and a repurchase, and it\u2019s really net zero. We were issuing no equity and nor we are buying back equity.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","So at that, just wanted to make sure. Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein with UBS. Your line is open.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - UBS","Hi. Good morning. Can you just talk a little more about the timing of expected announcements for expansion on NEXUS, Bluestone, Millennium? And at what point do you increase your, 10% to 15% expected long-term growth rate in the segment?","Peter Oleksiak","The announcements -- first stating with NEXUS as I mentioned and probably get some new disclosures in the call today, is that conversations are happening, pretty intense manner both on the utility side supporting the project as well as the producers. So we will -- as those come about we will provide update to you guys around those. I would expect over the next few months with the target of midyear having most of this wrapped up.","On the Bluestone, we have laid out, Bluestone right now in terms of the expansions that will be occurring, that is the expansion right now is to double the capacity going north, and that will be happening this year with a small piece happening next year as well. And in terms of the overall growth rate, that\u2019s something we will start talking about at the AGA, more likely than not, we\u2019ll be probably providing an update on that on the end of the year. A lot of that is really getting a sense with all of these projects in motion to the NEXUS one in particular getting a little more firm around that before we update our longer term guidance for this segment.","Michael Weinstein - UBS","Okay, thank you very much.","Peter Oleksiak","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from David Pess with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Peter Oleksiak","Hi David.","David Pess - Wolfe Research","Yes good morning. Just had a question, how would an extension of bonus G&A through 2015 impact your current growth plan?","Peter Oleksiak","Right now, I will let you know the bonuses part of the extenders package, right now we do feel relatively low probability that it will get extended. If you look at that this year we have zero equity issuance, and so this year it will not impact this year. Next year we have -- in the next two years put out there a targets of 200 million to 300 million, so we do get it out, imagine it may be near to the lower end of the range, for these one of those years. It\u2019s not going to be extremely material for us, but it may help shave off a portion of one year\u2019s worth of equity.","David Pess - Wolfe Research","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oleksiak of any additional or closing remarks.","Peter Oleksiak","I would like to thank everybody for being on the call this morning, and for you hockey fans I know the Red Wings are down right now, three to two to one so we are going to need your support to help us breakthrough with this first round of play-offs. So everybody have a great day. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, to Mr. Meador. Please go ahead, sir.","David E. Meador","Thank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Controller; Nick Khouri, our VP and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me if needed during the Q&A session. ","If you turn to Page 4, this morning we're going to cover our first quarter results, and we'll also discuss the recently filed rate case at MichCon. We'll be at the AGA financial forum on May 7 and 8, and we'll take that opportunity to update you on some of our growth projects of the 2 utilities, as well as the Gas Storage & Pipelines' Bluestone Project in the Power & Industrial, Reduced Emissions Fuel business line. ","We're expecting a high today of about 55 degrees here in Detroit. Actually it's a nice, sunny day, which is consistent with what you would expect here in Michigan in April. This is a sharp contrast to the first quarter, where we experienced anything but seasonal weather. Similar to many other parts of the country, the MichCon service territory saw one of the warmest winters on record. The mild temperatures were great news for our customers in form of lower utility bills. But as you've seen in our recent press release, the warm weather had an impact on the first quarter. We did include about $8 million of that weather from January and early February when we provide the guidance. ","So with that said, let me start on Page 5. We have a disciplined growth plan that will provide 5% to 6% long-terms earning growth per share. And when you combine that with our attractive dividends, it provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. All of this is set around one of our north stars and that's maintaining a strong balance sheet. Both of the utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, as we played out for you, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy, while at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including a long-term cast iron main replacement plan and a program to move gas meters out of customer homes. The importance of these infrastructure investments is evident in the rate case that we filed last Friday at MichCon. We have a very constructive energy legislation framework in Michigan and also a regulatory structure, and we see it as our responsibility to earn that favorable construct every single day. We utilize continuous improvement, capabilities in everything we do to ensure that our utilities are controlling costs and minimizing rate increases to our customers and also ensuring great customer experiences. ","Many of you have heard us talk about our intense focus that we have on continuous improvement. This is something we've been working on for many years, and I'll talk more about that when I talk about how we're going to offset weather this year. But it's something we take great pride in. As we look at the challenges of the quarter, we're going to use this continuous improvement program as a lever to help pull us in line with what our goals are for the entire year. ","We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses, both at the power industrial projects and Gas Storage & Pipelines. And as I mentioned, we'll give you a more detailed update on that at AGA in just over a week. ","On Page 6 is an overview of the quarter. In the face of the unusually warm winter, DTE Energy had operating earnings per share of $0.91 compared to $1.11 on the first quarter of last year. Detroit Edison earnings were flat year-over-year, while MichCon's earnings were down significantly due to the weather. Earnings at Energy Trading were down a little from last year, and we are reaffirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance of $3.65 to $3.95, and we're targeting the midpoint of $3.80. We'll leverage our cost and revenue opportunities across the portfolio businesses to offset the first quarter weather. And as we've indicated, it's a priority for us, and our balance sheet continues to remain strong. We generated over $600 million of cash from operations from the first quarter, and Nick will talk about that a little bit later in the call. ","Turning to Page 7, with the first quarter behind us, I'd like to take a few minutes to take you through how I'm thinking about our full year 2012 guidance. With a final order in the Detroit Edison rate case last fall, we are expecting earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year. And this is consistent with our original guidance that we provided you. As you know, the summer cooling months and storm activities are drivers of results at Detroit Edison, and much of that still lies ahead of us. Assuming normal weather, I am confident that Detroit Edison will hit its target and actually might get slightly above midpoint. With the biggest part of 2012 heating season behind us, MichCon is going to need to work hard to reach its guidance range for the year. But with continuous improvement and potential onetime cost actions, the bottom end of the range is achievable. ","Gas Storage & Pipelines continues to provide solid earning streams. Additionally, we're looking at some revenue opportunities here in this business to help offset the challenges at MichCon. Year-over-year, we're expecting reduced emission fuels or REF, as we call it, to deliver a nice bump in operating earnings at the Power & Industrial projects. We're also looking at revenue enhancement opportunities in this business to offset the first quarter weather and other business units. So, for GSP and the Power & Industrial group, we're looking to drive both of those to the high end of their guidance range. ","As Peter will explain in a few minutes, Energy Trading saw a small loss for the first quarter, and that was also driven by unprecedented warm weather across the country. Our expectation for this business is to deliver results over the next 3 quarters similar to annualized historical levels, thus making it achievable to reach the low end of their guidance. And we expect the holding company to have improved results over last year, and that's driven mainly by lower interest rates. So in total, we remain committed to our original earnings per share guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 and target the midpoint of $3.80. ","Now turning to Page 8 is an overview of the rate case that we filed last week at MichCon. MichCon's gone nearly 3 years without a base rate increase. Now recall we filed a case in 2010 and then we withdrew it when we determined that we could achieve our authorized return on equity without additional rates. The current rate of filing is just for under $77 million, that equates to roughly a 4% increase annually in base rates since the last rate increase. When you couple this with a decline in natural gas prices, the typical residential customer will see a lower bill in 2013 compared to recent years. This combined equates to an annualized 5% decrease in residential bills. The 2 biggest drivers in the rate case are capital investment and lower sales. We're seeing lower midstream revenue at MichCon and continued customer conservation since our last rate case, and we continue to make investments in our aging infrastructure. ","Other highlights of the case include a simplified decoupling mechanism, an authorized return on equity of 11%, which is consistent with MichCon's current authorized level. And maybe the most important element of this case is a proposal to implement an infrastructure recovery mechanism to support the investments needed in replacing cast iron mains, moving gas meters out of customer homes and continuing the pipeline integrity work in our transmission system. ","Before I hand it over to Peter, I'd like to also provide you an update on recent developments at Detroit Edison. As many of you have seen on April 10, the state of Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision relating to an appeal on the January 2010 MPSC order. The 2 items of interest here are the revenue decoupling mechanism or RDM and AMI, the automated meters. ","First, regarding the RDM, the court determined that the MPSC exceeded its authority when it authorized Detroit Edison to adopt the revenue decoupling mechanism. As of March 31, 2012, Edison had accrued on its book a regulatory liability related to the pilot RDM, which predominantly represents weather in prior periods. The MPSC has until May 22 to appeal the decision to the Michigan Supreme Court, and they are collecting comments through May 18. We will comment as part of that process, but ultimately, we're going to have to take the lead of the commission, so we're waiting to see how the commission plans to proceed on this. ","We've always been supportive of an energy efficiency-only mechanism, and when coupled with a well-functioning energy efficiency incentive program, we've been supportive of that. If this is appealed by the MPSC, it could take some time. Before we learn of the Supreme Court, we'll hear the appeal. And if the appeal is taken, it's likely that process will take months to years before it's completed. So we're going to continue to maintain the RDM liability on our books, and we also will not be implementing the 2012 RDM until we get further direction. ","The second item of note is the court's decision as it relates to AMI. Back in January of 2010, the MPSC approved the inclusion of $37 million in rate base related to the AMI pilot program. However, the court found that the record of evidence in the case was insufficient and has remanded this to the MPSC for further review. We provided the cost benefit analysis of the AMI program and we believe this will be resolved in a positive manner. So with that background, let me pass it over to Peter, and he'll take you through the quarter with some additional comments.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 10 in the first quarter earnings result. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings are $0.91 consistent with reported earnings. Detroit Edison contributed $0.56, and MichCon, which was affected by the unusually warm weather, came in at $0.31. The Non-utility segments combined earned $0.13. The drivers for the Non-utility first quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipelines at $0.10, Power & Industrial Projects to $0.05 and both Energy Trading and Unconventional Gas Production at a loss of $0.01 each. Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.09 in the quarter. ","Let's move to Slide 11 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are down $32 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings are $96 million, down $1 million from the prior year. I'll cover more details on Detroit Edison in a moment. MichCon, which typically has a strong first quarter, had operating earnings of $52 million, down $31 million from prior year, with 2\/3 of its variance due to the warm weather in 2012 and 1\/3 driven by colder-than-normal weather in the first quarter of 2011. In other words, the whole variance is due to weather. Our Non-utility segments in total are down $3 million, driven primarily by the change in our earnings at our Trading segment. Similar to our gas utility, our Trading business was also impacted by the unusually warm weather. In particular, this impacted our full requirement services transactions, which historically has produced solid earnings. In the first quarter of this year, we saw weather that was close to 3 standard deviations. We price our full requirement deals and has the physical commodity assuming some weather volatility, but not to the extreme as we experienced. ","So in the first quarter, the business saw lower margins and lower volumes and with long and towering gas hedges in the low-priced markets. Page 21 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading Page, which show both economic and accounting performance. In addition to the lower margins on the existing deals, the level of economic margin and new deals was also down this quarter in comparison to the same period last year. Keeping on the same page and moving to the Power & Industrial projects, this segment was down $2 million. Last year, in the first quarter, there was some lumpy earnings related to the early extinguishment of an outside energy contract that shows up at the year-over-year variance. As Dave indicated earlier, our growth plans for the P&I business are on track and we are comfortable with achieving the full year guidance in the segment and are driving towards the upper end. Gas Storage & Pipeline earnings are up slightly from the prior year due to the growth in the pipeline transportation revenues. Finally, Corporate & Other was up $3 million from last year due primarily to the refinancing activity done last year at historically low interest rates. ","Now, I'd like to turn to Page 12 to walk through some quarterly details for Detroit Edison. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison are $96 million, down $1 million from prior year. There are a lot of ins and outs for this segment this quarter. Margin for the quarter is up $9 million, driven primarily by the 2011 rate order, partially offset by warmer winter weather. ","In the supplemental page that we provided with the earnings release, you will see that actual sales for the quarter are down 3% year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. This decline represents the impact of weather on the electric-related heating load. Absent the weather impact, load was relatively flat for the quarter and we are forecasting approximately a 1% increase for the total year. Industrial sales were up 1% in the quarter, which is a continued indication of the improving economic activity for Michigan. Another item to note is O&M for the quarter impacted earnings by $8 million, primarily due to increased weather-related customer restoration activities and an increase in benefit expense, which we anticipated with lower discount rates. ","That concludes an update on our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures.","Nick A. Khouri","Thanks, Peter. As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first quarter this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full year goals. Page 14 summarizes those balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year well within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we appreciate a series of credit improvements by the rating agencies so far this year, including an upgrade at Fitch and a positive outlook at Moody's. As discussed in prior calls, we are on track to reach $300 million of new equity in 2012 through a combination of employee compensation, dividend reinvestment and pension contributions. ","Finally, liquidity remains strong with over $1.4 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Page 15 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow in the first 3 months of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $600 million was down slightly from last year, reflecting higher tax payments this quarter. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was positive $100 million in the quarter. ","Page 16 details capital spending. So far this year, total capital at DTE is up sharply from the prior year. Some of the increase is timing, for example, capital spending related to the schedule of refueling at Fermi. But overall spending so far this year is consistent with the 25% year-over-year increase we expect in 2012. In the first quarter, capital was higher in all our business units, including renewable business in Detroit Edison and non-utility capital in our Gas Storage & Pipelines and Power & Industrial business lines. ","In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, supporting higher levels of investment across all our business. ","Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up.","David E. Meador","Thanks, Nick. Let me wrap up on Slide 18. As with many in the industry, the first quarter of 2012 was a challenging one. However, we see this is as an opportunity to improve as a company. When we talk to our employees about our goals for the company and the challenges we face, we talk about working to make DTE Energy the best operated energy company in North America and a force for growth and prosperity in the communities we live and serve. So this is an opportunity for us to get better at everything that we do. And I have confidence, as we've seen in the past, that our employees will help us get there. Additionally, we continue to make investments necessary to drive our long-term growth and we look forward to sharing more details of our plans at AGA in early May. We're scheduled to deliver our presentation on Monday, May 7 at 2:15 p.m. Mountain Standard Time or 5:15 p.m. for those in the Eastern time zone that might be calling in. Now with that, we'd be happy to take questions now, Corinne.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A lot of your unregulated businesses are kind of tied to coal, and obviously that market has softened up. Kind of what are you seeing -- how is that impacting your businesses? And then are you seeing any impact on the appetite for the REF program as you seek out partners? And then just lastly, with gas prices down here, how is that impacting the Barnett process?","David E. Meador","Yes, let me take these one at a time, and I might get some help from Peter and Nick as we go through this. So if you look at what's going on with low gas prices and then the impact on coal and think about DTE, actually one of the things that we've enjoyed over the years is our portfolio businesses do have different drivers, and because of the way we're contracted and so on, it's really worked out well for us. So you take the midstream businesses as an example, where we have long-term contracts with tenors of 7 to 8 years on the Pipes & Storage. And there's not only no impact there, we're actually seeing an opportunity near term on short-term storage deals. If you went over to the Power & Industrial business, there's really no impact related to coal prices and the Power & Industrial. And actually what we're seeing is some opportunity to sell some of our coke battery output that was not contracted for. In longer term this gas price environment actually is an opportunity for that business, and I think you'll hear Gerry talk more about that at AGA. But a low gas price environment would give that group an opportunity to look at some new growth opportunities down the road. And then when you go over to Barnett, I think we have to stop thinking about this as gas play. If -- right now we are drilling specifically for oil in the Marble Falls and 80% of the revenue is coming from oil and natural gas liquids. And so we are exiting that business, but we are exiting on oil and NGLs, not on gas.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And aren't you -- looking at your income statement and cash flow statement, it looks like there was some gains and charges. Can you kind of give some more color as to what those were?","Peter B. Oleksiak","There was an impact last year in the first quarter. If you recall, we did talk about it, it was with -- we had an original unit down at our Fermi site that we took a charge, really, at the retirement accounting that we took there.","David E. Meador","Was there something more specifically that [indiscernible]?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, go ahead right in front of me. I'll follow up with it offline.","Peter B. Oleksiak","When I look at that, that's the one that's kind of popped on the statement, is that retirement charge last year.","Operator","Next question will come from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","I wondered if you could help me understand decoupling at the gas utility. I was under the impression that you had decoupling there, so I guess I'm a bit surprised that the mild weather had such a big impact on net income.","David E. Meador","Go ahead, Peter.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes. The decoupling that was implemented at the gas utility was really a usage on base. Decoupling -- actually weather did flow through that decoupling mechanism, so it really is kind of working as designed. The weather does flow through.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Okay. And then...","David E. Meador","Leslie, we were not -- that has never included weather protection at the gas utility.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Okay. And then on the electric, because of the court decision, you won't collect or accrue for any decoupling there going forward.","David E. Meador","Correct. The -- basically, what the court said was that the 2008 law was very specific about authorizing gas decoupling, but was silent on electric. And the -- so the judge concluded that the MPSC didn't have the authority, so that -- I think the way you have to think about it is there is no decoupler right now. And again, we'll have to wait for the MPSC to take a position. Whatever happens would be a perspective issue anyways. Unless, for example, if the MPSC decided to appeal and the Supreme Court overruled the judge, then this could still be in place. But we don't know exactly what the MPSC will do. And if they did appeal, it's uncertain whether the court would hear it. And if they did hear it, ultimately what the outcome would be.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Okay. And then just finally with low gas prices and dark spreads being compressed, are there any thoughts in terms of your CapEx program on scrubbers? Or your overall generation mix over time?","David E. Meador","No. Not at this time. As you know, we've laid out our environmental program at AGA, I think Gerry will be talking a little bit more about the ongoing testing we're doing with DSI. But right now, when we look out going forward, our environmental program as we see it is not going to change.","Operator","Moving on to Kevin Cole with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Dave, can we -- I guess just kind of rehash Slide 7, the guidance slide, just to make sure I have this right. So for Detroit Edison, you expect to be in the midrange of the guidance? And then...","David E. Meador","Midrange and possibly slightly above midpoint. If you did the walk down here you'll see that MichCon were driving to the low end of the range. Gas Storage & Pipelines we -- as I indicated, we're seeing some opportunity in some near-term storage deals, and we're going to work hard to drive that to the top end there. The Power & Industrial business, we see driving to the top end also there.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then with -- I guess with trading. If I remember right this time last year, you were able to give us some, I guess, hard numbers or, I guess, pretty good color on the shaping for the rest of the year. Is that more of an AGA event or do you have any commentary like that available?","David E. Meador","Well, we'll certainly talk more at AGA. But our sense right now is if you look at historical numbers for the remaining 3 quarters, we feel that we will be able to get to the low end of the range. You got to keep in mind that what we saw in trading here was specifically weather driven, something that we see it really 1\/3 standard deviation of that around RFS deals. And so there would be no -- I view that as a onetime event, not a recurring event.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Kevin, this is Peter. There may be some lumpiness in the remaining of the year by quarter, and a lot of that, it is -- we have to roll on accounting which we reserve and then release as the deals are done. And so -- but as Dave said, if you cannot take the remaining of the year, looking at historical level of activity, we're comfortable with the low end.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Yes, seasonality is always kind of tough on the business. And I guess so now on with REF, because we've been hearing some more chatter from a few of the larger Midwestern utilities that they're looking at that technology. Can you offer any color on the footprint that your license allows?","David E. Meador","We've said before, the counterparties that we're talking to are Midwest utilities. And we've also said, we know there's some other competing similar technology, but we are also making progress on the 4 relocations. And again, I would expect an update at AGA, but if you look at 2012, just backing up, there's 9 machines, and 5 basically are driving the earnings for this year. And then we're going to relocate the 4, and we expect to be able to give you more insights on the 4 at AGA. But think about the 4 as the driver to 2013 earnings and not 2012.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then so the upside, that will be achieved through on 2012 that we described earlier, that's just through some more volumes being put through than expected?","David E. Meador","Well, the upside in Power & Industrial businesses is coke sales that we hope to be lacking in soon. But we've also said to the extent we can accelerate -- there's a timing issue on the 4 relocations. If you accelerate, we'll pick up additional tonnage this year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move on to Brian Chin.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Question on the -- going back to the decoupling mechanism in the MPSC appeal. We were sort of under the impression that either you guys or the MPSC could appeal the decision. But sort of listening to your comments, particularly in response to Leslie's questions, it sounds like you may not want to appeal it, or can you just give us a little bit of color on depending how the MPSC appeals process goes. Are you guys intending to appeal it as well? Just give us a little bit of color on your thought process there.","David E. Meador","Yes. The ball is really in their court, and I don't -- because they're taking comments right now, I don't think they've indicated what they're going to do. So if this is appealed, it's likely going to be appealed by the MPSC.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So, it's not as though you guys would have your own appeal. Largely, even though you have the ability to appeal it, you'd watch to see what the MPSC does and use that as a -- as sort of the , okay, that's as good as the appeal as the whole process can face.","David E. Meador","Right. I think that's the right way to characterize this. We -- as we've said, we were happy with the revenue decoupling mechanism to address energy efficiency. We think going forward, you could address energy efficiency through another mechanism. For example, you could have EE tracker that works with an incentive program that gets you to the same place. I don't know if they'll consider that or not, because again, I think right now we're just in our comment period. And then if we did not have decoupling, we've also said that even though it's slightly makes the risk profile for the company is higher, we have always had the ability to file rate cases and self-implement. And because of the level of capital, we'll be in regular rate cases. So we were okay with the decoupling mechanism. And if there wasn't one, we would be okay also. But we'd be very interested in something that would specifically address energy efficiency.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then if the decoupling mechanism ultimately sort of goes away and before you guys have the ability to put in something like an EE tracker. Is there -- if I remember right, I think that there's a regulatory liability on the books that might be released. Could you talk a little bit about that? What would happen on the balance sheet if that decoupling mechanism would ultimately go away?","David E. Meador","It's really too early right now. We do have a liability accrued on the books. And what the MPSC might do, for example, whether they would appeal, whether the Supreme Court would hear this, what the Supreme Court ultimately does -- I think we've just taken a position. It's too early to speculate on what might happen with that liability. And as we get more insights to that, certainly we will know in May what the MPSC's position is, then we can provide you more color on that.","Operator","And we'll move on to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","With respect to the weather impact on kilowatt hour sales, I saw the revenue impact, but I wasn't clear on what the weather normalized growth would have been, in your best estimation, if you backed out the impact of weather in the leap year.","Peter B. Oleksiak","This is Peter. Let me take you there. The impact of the leap year for the total year is pretty immaterial. It's one extra day in the quarter, so there's probably close to 1% impact in the quarter. But by the end of the year, it's noise. So when you looked at it -- and I know you'll see in the supplemental we provide the actual sales, and I'll take it really class by class. First, the total actual sales were down 3%. Now the residential sales were down 5%, and I'll say that was predominantly weather. If you temperature normalize that, it'll be relatively flat in the quarter. And then on the full year for residential, we are looking at a relatively flat. And our energy efficiency programs really are targeted at that segment. So that's our assumption right now, it'll be flat in a temperature-normalized basis. The industrial sales -- actually, this class is pretty weather insensitive, and it was up 1% for the quarter. Now for the total year, right now our projection is there's a 2% growth for that. So that 1% actually is in line with that and maybe a little bit higher than we're anticipating from a run rate perspective. The commercial sales was down 3% in the quarter, and once again we look at that as all weather. We do see a little bit of uplift and the temperature normalized in the quarter and then the full year. It's about a 0.5% that we're going to be anticipating on a temperature-normalized basis.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then just \u2013 there is a lot of talk about Detroit having its fiscal problems? Should we -- how should we think about the impact on you guys if there is any? Just -- what do you think the outlook is there, if you care to posit an opinion there? But also, how should we think about that as being a potential impact on sales or any impact on you guys that we should -- if there's any?","David E. Meador","I'll start, and I'll ask Nick for help here also. I think Detroit right now and we have a great governor and mayor that are working together to work through this issue. And I am more optimistic about not only Michigan but more optimistic that Detroit is going to pull out of its issues than I have been in a long time. We're seeing real interesting economic development. We're seeing a lot of young professionals move in to the city, and there's some real positive signs. If you look at us directly, Detroit has a -- is a very, very small piece of our business. The city itself is current on its bill, so I don't see any direct dollar risk there. And it's just something that we do what we could to because it's part of our corporate aspiration here, to be part of the growth in Michigan and Detroit, to do what we can do to be helpful with both the city and the state.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on the REF and the coke sales and everything that -- I guess you guys could give us a little more detail at AGA. Should we think of it this -- can you give us any sort of flavor as to what we might be seeing or?","David E. Meador","Well, on the coke, we just have a small portion of coke that is not contracted because those coke batteries are contracted out through 2014, '15 and '16. And so there is a small portion that was open that we're going to take advantage of current prices to lock in. And the way to think about it, it'll help drive that business to the high end of their guidance is what it will do. And then on REF, we are actively negotiating with potential host sites. And I think by the time we get to AGA, Gerry will be able to give you more insights on that. But we have objectives to have those machines relocated during this year, basically, to be in place to help drive 2013 earnings. And right now everything looks like it's on track.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Actually, Paul took care of me, so I'm all set. And just -- but just to understand for your forecast for sales, it's 0% residential, 2% in industrial and 0.5% for commercial, is that correct?","Peter B. Oleksiak","That is correct. And one thing if that if you -- all in, I think I did mention that, it's about a 1% all in before energy efficiency. Then if you -- that impacts about 0.5% for us.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So these numbers are all before energy efficiency?","Peter B. Oleksiak","They include. Yes, they include the energy efficiency.","Operator","Moving onto Catapult from Gutteman Origongi [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I got a quick question for you. Just want to ask about this customer restoration expense that kind of drove or went up this quarter, is that going to be recurring? Or just a onetime?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Well this is something that we -- in our guidance a full year forecast. And storm and restoration costs are typically lumpy throughout the year. But when you look at it on a total year basis, there's some consistency. So when we do our planning process, we look at basically recent history and averages around that. Having said that, we did see larger than traditional in the first quarter, and actually, weather-related about 3x as many customers were impacted. Some of this ties back to that warmer weather that we saw that really impacted the MichCon business. But we did see some increase storm activities that we normally don't see in the first quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now move on to Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","Dave, just a quick -- on the MichCon rate case, can you get just give us what is 100 basis point sensitivity to the revenue requirement?","David E. Meador","Don, do you want to answer that? Here's Don Stanczak with our Regulatory Affairs.","Don Stanczak","Yes. Their -- MichCon's equity is about, as I recall, $500 million, so about [indiscernible].","Ashar Khan","If $500 million is in this case, so that would be like what?","Don Stanczak","I'm sorry, it's $1 billion, so 1% would be about $10 million.","Ashar Khan","1% would be about $10 million aftertax.","Don Stanczak","So if you kind of pretax it up, it would be about $15 million.","Ashar Khan","$15 million or $16 million, okay. And you mentioned Cap structure and ROE. What's happening in the Cap structure? Is there more equity in there or what from before?","Don Stanczak","It's deferred taxes is really what's driving the reduction. Deferred taxes are up that's why the change in capital is a reduction in revenue requirement.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up from Brian Chin with Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one more question on the RDM. So while it's sort of in a little bit of appeal limbo right now, if load recovers, does that go with the some type of regulatory asset? Or do you actually get the benefit from that at the interim while we're sort of waiting for all this?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes, from an income perspective right now, we are accounting that we do not have an RDM, so any type of load increase or margin increase would flow to the bottom line. Having said that, we did have weather impact the first quarter for Edison. So even this year, the load increase, I would look at it really just offsetting that first quarter weather.","Operator","We actually do have a follow-up from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Actually, a couple of follow-ups. Is one of the potential fixes around decoupling just to have the legislature insert the word electric into the energy bill? Is that feasible?","David E. Meador","I don't think this requires or anyone would want to go legislative relative. That would be a lot of heavy lifting. I think it would be a lot easier -- if they choose to do it, it would be a lot easier to just to adjust a regulatory mechanism. So again, I don't know what direction the commission will take on this, but you could modify the energy efficiency incentive program that's already in place just to account for the over and under energy efficiency load. As an example site, it will be much easier path to handle this through a regulatory path and not ever go legislatively.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just back to my question, I'm looking at the cash flow statement. You've got -- it looks like a $19 million gain in there? It's the third line down after net income.","David E. Meador","No, we'll have to get back to you. So I suspect you're going to find it's a number of small things as we continue to press on cash and make sure that we're optimizing our cash flows.","Operator","And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. Mr. Meador, I turn the conference over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David E. Meador","Well, thanks, again for joining us, and hopefully we've laid out the year for you. We're pretty confident with all the actions that we're going to take on the revenue and the cost side, that we'll be able to deliver on our commitment of $3.80 per share. And as a reminder, again, for those that won't be at AGA but would like to listen in on the webcast, it's on Monday, May 7 at 2:15 Mountain Standard Time or 5:15 for those of us in the Eastern time zone.

(Operator Instructions)","For opening remarks and introductions, I will now turn the call over to Anastasia Minor. Please go ahead.","Anastasia Minor","","Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second-quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we get started, I would like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.","Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","With us this morning is Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President and CFO; Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller; and Mark Rolling, our Vice President and Treasurer. We also have members of our management team with us to call on during the Q&A session.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to Peter to start our call this morning.","Peter Oleksiak","","Thanks, Anastasia. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Those of you who have talked to me at any length of time on the road quickly learned that I'm a big Detroit Tiger fan, so I feel compelled with this captured audience and use of air space to give a brief update on my Tigers: they are in first place, seven games in front of Kansas City, with 63 games left in the season. Feeling good, but a lot of games left. I am hoping that in the third-quarter call, I will be giving a World Series update. And hopefully I didn't just jinx the Tigers.","In a few minutes I will turn the call over to Jeff and Mark, who will be taking you through earnings and cash flow for the quarter and year to date. Before that I will be providing a brief update on what is happening at the Company.","I will start on slide 5, which describes our investment thesis, serving as the foundation of success and future growth. At the top of the list is our utility investment plan. Electric investment is driven by environmental spend in the near-term and renewal of our generation fleet in the longer term, which is natural replacement of our aging coal fleet with some more certainty now on the retirements, given the recent EPA actions.","For our gas utility we have a cast-iron main replacement program that will last several decades. I'll talk further about our utility investments in a few minutes.","In addition to our strong utility growth, our non-utility investments set us apart from our peers. We have a strict investment criteria for these businesses where each investment must align with our strategic vision and provide better-than-the-utility returns.","The majority of our investments are contracted under long-term contracts to reduce earnings risk, which supports our long-term earnings profile and growth targets. That is the way we like it and, I know, the way our investors like it.","The regulatory structure in Michigan continues to be very constructive, and we know we have to do our part every day to earn that relationship. One way we earn this constructive environment is by using our continuous improvement discipline with cost management in both utilities to extend out time between rate filings.","Another way to keep the regulatory structure we have is to deliver strong operations and high customer satisfaction. We have seen improvements on both fronts over the last few years. Finally, we have been very consistent throughout the years with our focus on cash and keeping a strong balance sheet, which allows us to maintain our strong credit ratings."," Slide 6 shows the success of our focus on the business strategy I just described. As you are all aware, we recently increased our dividend to $2.76 on an annualized basis. This is over a 5% increase and marks the fifth consecutive year we have raised our dividend. This is just one of the ways we deliver value to our shareholders, so we are committed to target, growing the dividends in line with earnings."," We have a longer-term target for earnings per share growth of 5% to 6%. You can see in the chart that we have achieved a growth rate of over 7% from 2008. With the growth contemplated in our utilities and non-utilities over the next five years, we are approaching $1 billion of income by the end of this time frame."," We have delivered solid returns compared to our industry and across broader markets. You can see on slide 7 that compared to market indices, over three years, five, and 10 years, we have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Utilities, a track record we are very proud of. And it is built on the foundation of delivering the results we promise. Our approach is to have consistent outperformance year in and year out.","With the backdrop of our business strategy and our commitment to delivering results, slide 8 provides some detail on our growth opportunities in both our utility and non-utility businesses. A large portion of our growth opportunities are focused on our utility businesses, as our utility investment levels are more than double depreciation levels.","Our electric investments are driven by environmental spend in the near-term. In the time frame through 2030, investments will be driven by the replacement of our aging coal plants, but the timing and level of our investment has been shaped in a way that will fit energy policy at the state and national level.","We expect to invest multiple billions in our new generation in this time frame. We see Michigan's energy policy starting to take shape in 2015, with new comprehensive legislation, with flexibility in these energy policies to comply with the recent carbon emissions plans released by the EPA. For DTE, our plan for a natural replacement of a good portion of our coal fleet with gas-fired plants has been in the works for the last few years, and this fits in with the EPA regulations.","We are still working through the details on the timing and level of plant closures. These regulations will most likely accelerate coal plant retirements and be a major input in the establishment of new renewable energy targets.","For the Gas Utility, investments are driven by main renewal, pipeline integrity, and meter move-out. The gas utility is supported by an infrastructure recovery mechanism which allows for the recovery of the majority of these investments.","Growth in our non-utility businesses is supported by growth in our gas storage and pipelines and power industrial project segments. Expansion at the Bluestone will bring total capacity up to 1 B by 2016, up from 0.6 BCF when the pipe went into service less than two years ago.","We continue to see progress on the NEXUS pipeline project, with multiple gas and electric utilities and Appalachian producers committing volume to the project. We are very excited about this investment. And many of you probably took notice of the NEXUS pipeline initiated binding open season earlier this week to allow the additional interested shippers an opportunity to commit volumes to the pipe. We expect in-service to be in the fourth quarter of 2017. The open season will run through August 21.","Following the open season, final project sizing and partnership structure will be determined, and the next major milestones will be the regulatory approvals. Since much still needs to be pinned down regarding final volume commitments; project sizing; and, often, ownership levels, we are comfortable with our previous provided financial disclosures on our interest in the project.","As the project continues to develop in the balance of the year, we will provide project updates as they are available. We know there are competitors in this region, but we remain confident in the build of this northern flowing pipe that ties right into our existing investor pipeline and Michigan-related assets.","To wrap up on the non-utility updates, the relocations of our REF units continues to progress. With the relocation of the eighth unit complete, negotiations are underway for the ninth unit after completion of a test run this summer.","Slide 9 shows our earnings guidance by segment. We are reiterating our earnings per share guidance of $4.20 to $4.40. Although weather through June has been favorable for the utilities, our gas utility in particular, weather variability in the balance of the year is still unknown.","Similar to where we were at the end of the first quarter, at this point in the year we will reserve the year-to-date weather favorability as contingency for weather variability and reinvestment spending in our operations. Jeff will cover the details on the amount of weather that landed in the first half of the year that is now guidance contingency. He will also cover the potential uses of that weather contingency.","So bottom line, there are no changes in guidance at this time, but a strong bias upwards. And with that I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller, to provide more detail on the first-quarter results.","Jeff Jewell","","Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I will start on slide 11 and the second-quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $0.73 per share. And as a reference, our reported earnings were $0.70 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the second-quarter reported to operating earnings on slide 28.","For the two utilities, DTE Electric contributed $0.73 and DTE Gas negative $0.02. The non-utility segments combined earned $0.12, with gas storage and pipelines at $0.10; power and industrial projects at $0.07; and Energy Trading at negative $0.05. Corporate and other had a loss of $0.10.","Let's move to slide 12 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Gross segments' operating earnings were up $27 million or $0.15 per share for the quarter. DTE Electric was favorable $40 million quarter over quarter, driven by the revenue decoupler amortization in 2014 and O&M reinvestment that occurred in 2013 but did not reoccur in 2014. DTE Gas was $12 million lower as the second-quarter earnings profile in 2014 returned to a more normal level, with a seasonal loss of $4 million.","Gas storage and pipeline earnings were $2 million above the prior year. This increase was driven by higher pipeline volumes and additional gathering asset growth. This was partially offset by a deferred revenue accounting adjustment.","Our power and industrial project segment was up $2 million from 2013. This increase was driven by REF earnings. Our corporate and other segment came in unfavorable by $5 million from last year, primarily due to income taxes. Again, these results in the growth segment provided $27 million of favorable earnings quarter over quarter.","At Energy Trading, operating results for the quarter were negative $10 million with economic income of positive $11 million. Year-to-date results for the business, which are in line with our expectations, were negative $2 million for operating results and positive $21 million for economic net income.","As we have discussed previously, Energy Trading is strategically pursuing more physical business, which will tend to create accounting timing differences between economic and accounting results. Page 26 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.","I'd like to now turn to slides 13 and 14 and walk through some quarterly details for DTE Electric and then DTE Gas. Starting on slide 13 with DTE Electric: the electric segment had earnings favorability of $40 million quarter over quarter, with $5 million attributable to weather; $21 million related primarily the 2014 amortization of our revenue decoupler liability; $10 million related to lower O&M expense, which is primarily due to the reinvestment activity that occurred in 2013 that did not reoccur in 2014; and $4 million mainly due to lower interest expense.","A note on the revenue decoupler liability \u2013 DTE Electric received a commission order on April 1 of this year that approved our request to suspend the amortization of the RDM starting in July through the remainder of this year and to resume amortization of the balance over the period January through June 2015, thus deferring 50% of the amortization. The amortization for the first half of 2014 equated to $39 million.","Moving on to slide 14, DTE Gas segment was down $12 million quarter over quarter, which was a return to a more normal second-quarter earnings profile for this business. The drivers were normal weather in the second quarter of 2014 versus the cooler-than-normal second quarter in 2013. This weather accounted for $3 million of unfavorably. The other drivers were O&M of negative $6 million due to timing of activity from the first quarter, increase in uncollectibles expenses, and lower benefit expenses.","Now turning to slide 15, which adds some additional context to Peter's earlier comments on DTE Energy's EPS guidance: as you know, we operate and manage DTE Energy as a portfolio and strive to deliver on our stated growth targets. As a company we start each year with three budget plans \u2013 a base plan and lean and invest plans. This ensures that we are prepared to react to either positive or negative changes in our business environment due to various unforeseen events, including weather.","Because of this planning discipline, we wait to see if weather is different than normal before we take action for the balance of the year, which includes guidance revisions. The chart depicts how we are thinking about our balance-of-year potential weather and other business uses in relation to the year-to-date weather favorability of $0.27.","As of today, July weather is forecasted to be below normal. This supports our discipline of waiting until after the summer months to make balance-of-year decisions. Therefore, we are confirming our 2014 segment mix and earning guidance range of $4.20 to $4.40.","That concludes our update for the earnings for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark Rolling, Vice President and Treasurer, who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics.","Mark Rolling","","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin on slide 17 with a look at our cash flows for the first half of the year. Year-to-date cash from operations is $1.1 billion, which is down a little from 2013. We saw higher weather-related customer payments that were offset by higher purchases of gas, power, and coal that were needed to meet both our current demands as well as rebuilding our inventory levels.","Capital spending was higher than last year due to increased investments at the Electric Utility, partially offset by lower capital spending in our non-utility businesses. Overall, DTE's net cash is down year over year, and that's in line with our full-year guidance.","Slide 18 lays out our capital investments in a little more detail. The electric utility CapEx is higher, due primarily to increased spending on a refueling outage at our nuclear plant and the acquisition of the Brookfield wind park. CapEx at our non-utility businesses is down slightly year over year, due primarily to GSP. This reflects the completion of the Bluestone lateral build back in 2013 and lower gathering-related spending compared to last year.","Let me wrap up on slide 19 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong, with both leverage and FFO expected to be within the targeted range for the year. We have adequate liquidity with $1.4 billion of available liquidity at the end of June, and we are taking advantage of the low interest-rate environment and have refinanced over $900 million in long-term debt this year. This will result in nearly $20 million in annualized interest savings.","And our plan to issue no equity in 2014 remains unchanged. We do plan to issue between $200 million and $300 million of equity in 2015 and 2016.","Now I will turn the discussion back over to Peter.","Peter Oleksiak","","Thanks, Mark. To summarize slide 21, we continue to remain on track to achieve our earnings guidance for 2014, with strong results in the first half of the year. We increased our dividend for the fifth consecutive year. Our balance sheet and cash flow metrics remain strong, and our investments in our utility and non-utility business will provide our target of 5% to 6% earnings growth going forward.","I'd like to thank you all for listening to our call this morning. And Doug, I like to open it now for any questions that participants may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","First question, on NEXUS \u2013 I just wanted to cut to the point here. It sounds like you are saying NEXUS at this point is going to happen, and it's more a matter of figuring out kind of the size. Is that fair?","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes. Let me first say that I know there's a lot of interest in this project, and there should be. I'd like to say up front that at this point in the project, we are in confidentiality agreements, so there's not a lot of detail I can disclose \u2013 you know, the disclosure would have to be limited.","Obviously, no project really is 100% certain until the pipe is in the ground. There are competitors that have emerged in this region, also with northern paths. This really was not completely unexpected, given the amount of gas that needs to get out of the region and the urgency of the producers.","Now, we are still very bullish on NEXUS. We think it's a northern-flowing pipe that makes the most sense, since it ties directly into our existing Michigan pipeline infrastructure. And it really minimizes new pipeline build.","That makes our pipe very economical and least disruptive on the environmental and regulatory fronts. Because once tied into our Michigan infrastructure, gas can flow into Michigan, Chicago, Ontario. And producers really like that optionality. So I'd really say we are still feeling really bullish, but really nothing is 100% certain till we get the project done.","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","That's fair, and I understand you have partners. I guess earlier you had said you needed to get to at least 0.8 BCF per day of firm commitments to move forward. You are looking to get at least 0.3 BCF of that, I believe, from producers. What's your level of confidence that you are at the least \u2013 that 0.8 BCF per day?","Peter Oleksiak","","As you said, we said from the start of the project that NEXUS would be a 1 B pipe, and that we would have a certain amount of commitments before we'd go forward. We've had enough commitments to move to this very important step in the process, so we are feeling confident at this point in time.","So we will understand through this binding season \u2013 you know, in the open season document it did disclose that this pipe is scalable up to 2 BCF. This binding season really looks to determine the final size of the pipe; also, the finalization of the commitments from the producers and whether we are going to go forward. The next step here would be the regulatory filing process.","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, thanks. I expect some others will have some questions on NEXUS, so I'll move on. I just wanted to ask about \u2013 you issued an RFP for generation capacity earlier this summer. Is there any color you can give us on how that went?","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes. We issued this RFP back in June. The process and timeline is designed, really, to run to the end of the year.","So we are currently reviewing proposals. The whole idea here is that our electric utility has a current short, and also, new generation will be needed longer-term. So we have merchant plants in Michigan, and we are looking to keep that generation here in Michigan if it makes sense from a value perspective with our customers. So it is going very well, and we are currently reviewing proposals.","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks. And just one last one. The eighth REF unit: can you tell us when that went into \u2013 or when that was placed? And did that really contribute much to second-quarter earnings?","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes, the eighth unit \u2013 it did go in at the first half of the year.","","Anastasia Minor","","Yes, just this summer.","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes, so this summer \u2013 Anastasia indicating when it went in. And at this point in time it really did not contribute. It really is in a kind of open ramp-up mode at this point in time, Matt.","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, thanks a lot, Peter. I'll jump back in the queue.","Operator","","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","","Just first, on the utility: when you think about the generation replacement, this RFP and future ones and the shutting of coal, how much of that is in your current CapEx plan at the utility? Or would this all be incremental?","Peter Oleksiak","","The way to think about the CapEx in our electric utility is in two time frames. We have the first near-term flat time frame; it's really around the environmental compliance \u2013 finalizing that, really, with the max rule. We were estimating about $1.3 billion a year for electric utility. I would say that's still a good assumption around that.","We have put out some disclosures recently on that second five-year window, really, the 2019 to 2024; and the range there was 1.3 to 2.0. I would say at this point, looking at the EPA compliance, it's really going to accelerate the retirements for our coal fleet and essentially have additional spending. So I would say we are more towards the upper end of that 2.0 operating year guidance in that second five-year time frame.","We are in the process of finalizing our details and plans. Our objective is in the fall to provide you more of a detailed update. But that's probably a good rule of thumb for now.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","","Okay. And then moving back to NEXUS \u2013 and I apologize for maybe being a little repetitive. But maybe you could help us a little bit with the color of from the time you put out the initial unbinding commitment to the announcement that you made this week \u2013 you know, we've had some other proposals come out.","These commitments that you've gotten, I guess particularly from producers \u2013 were these ones that, to the degree that they were going to go with other pipes, they would have left? Or is there a risk that they are optioning several of these and just going to end up picking one of them? Or did you see, like, some pull out because of the competing pipes? Just any kind of color on the dynamics that occurred here?","Peter Oleksiak","","And I think I did mention to you where we are at right now in this process. It does make it a bit difficult to give a lot of details around the nuances with the producers. But I do understand why you guys are interested and want to see the details here.","We did have enough commitments. And these are real negotiations, talking to producers, to go forward with this important step. That's really what I can say at this point in time. So we will understand. And part of this process at the end of this is finalizing those commitments into agreements, and understanding \u2013 is there additional interest in the pipe itself? Which really, then, it would help size up the final size of the pipe.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","","And then on the size issue, in theory, when you said you are using the current one now, I would think that assuming the pipe is going forward, it's either going to be what you have now or bigger in terms of your capital commitment?","Peter Oleksiak","That would be correct.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","","Okay. Okay, thank you.","Operator","","And our next question is from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Matt Davis \u2013 Credit Suisse","","It's actually Matt Davis. I just had another follow-up question on NEXUS, and if you guys could provide a little more color around how you see the project competing with other projects in the region? And at what size would be the optimal level to compete with other Marcellus and Utica projects?","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes, I'll address how we feel our pipe is very competitive. There are competitors, and they have emerged recently in this region. We are really providing a northern-flowing pipe. The gas in the Utica is going to go to multiple places, and a lot of it will go south. Producers are going to want the optionality to go north, and we provide a northern path. And I know other competitors are putting a northern path in place.","Our pipe has the least amount of new build needed. We tie strategically right into the Vector Pipeline in our Michigan infrastructure. We think that really provides a distinct advantage to our pipe, because it really does make it very economical and also least disruptive.","There's a lot of regulatory approvals that are going to be needed by the other competitors because of a new pipe build. We also think from an environmental perspective ours is the least disruptive as well. Really can't get into the whole details of the economics, but I can say just the fact that we have a lot less new pipe makes our pipe very economical.","Matt Davis \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Thank you very much. And then just on the generation needs, can you provide a little bit more color about timing of when you would look to add generation, or if at all, given the shortfall identified by MISO and the possibility of choice going away sometime next year?","Peter Oleksiak","","We have indicated that the new generation \u2013 the bulk of it will happen post-2019. But we have this RFP out right now; so if we are able to get from our customers generation at a discount to new build, then that's good value, and it keeps merchant generation in the state of Michigan. It will do that.","So there may be some timing of new generation happening in this five-year window, and it really would be tied to this RFP. We have other options to satisfy that 2016 shortfall in the MISO region that we are at. But we are looking at this point in time, if we can, to get some new \u2013 at least a new merchant plant in part of our portfolio mix. But the bulk of the spend will be close to 2019.","Matt Davis \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Can you just provide a little bit more color on what you guys have to \u2013 what you were referring to with options for the 2016 shortfall?","Peter Oleksiak","","There is purchasing that we can do within MISO \u2013 some contracts, PPAs. There's other things that we could do.","But we feel at this point in time, given where the market is at, given merchant plants that are in the state of Michigan, with choice \u2013 I know there's issues and debates around choice; whether choice is going to \u2013 if those customers are going to come back. It makes the best sense for us right now to explore purchasing existing Michigan assets, if they are available and if they are at a good value for our customers.","Matt Davis \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","And our next question is from Andy Weisel with Macquarie.","Andy Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital Securities","","My first question is on the Michigan economy. I'm a little bit surprised that it seems like the weather-normalized load growth has pulled back, especially the industrial side a little bit, and especially when compared to your neighbors who reported yesterday.","Then, also, on the gas side you mentioned increased uncollectible expense. What are your latest thoughts on the local economy? Is there anything that maybe has slowed down a bit relative to the prior trends? Or any higher-level thoughts?","Peter Oleksiak","","I'll talk mainly on the economy, and I will hand it over to Jeff to give some of the details on the load and the uncollectibles. The economy we are seeing continue on very strong in terms of recovery.","I know we have been putting out indicators on unemployments; unemployment levels continue to go down. Automotive production continues to be high. Housing starts continue to rise, as well. Customer counts in our residentials are continuing to increase. So we are still seeing the economic indicators that we have seen over the last few years, and those are continuing on.","Jeff, maybe you can provide a little color on the load?","Jeff Jewell","","Yes, I sure can. Hi, Andy; this is Jeff.","So what we are seeing is in the first half of the year some of what we call \u2013 probably some weather-related items and also one-time impacts. One, as you know, we had an extremely cold winter. So what we are seeing on the residential side is a lot more conservation from our customers in the first quarter. And we saw that continue into the second quarter in April and May.","And also, what we saw in April and May is we did not see any sustained heat. We saw a little bit of heat, but it wasn't like three days in a row kind of a deal that incentivized people to start turning on their air-conditioning load and those types of things. So we are seeing that as a one-time sort of an event.","And then on the industrial side what we saw, same thing, is the extreme weather. There just wasn't a lot of car sales that were happening. And so the inventory levels were growing at the autos, and some of the autos were doing some maintenance around doing some outages. They were also doing production, sort of lowering down their production to be able to manage their inventory. There was also some other model changeovers that were happening, too.","So going forward for the year, given that, that down a little bit is going to probably flow through the full year. We are looking at about a 0% sort of growth for the full year. But our long-term growth projection \u2013 there's still about that 0.5%. So we are not changing off of those.","And then your other question, on the gas side \u2013 that one's pretty easy. Again, just because the revenue at the gas side was, obviously, because of the winter, was way up on the revenue side. So obviously, the uncollectible expense is going to the greater than what it was last year. So that's, again, just a function of the weather and the higher revenue.","Andy Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital Securities","","Yes, that makes sense. Very helpful. My next question is on the EPA carbon policy. If I heard you right, it sounds like you said you are going to be giving an update on your generation plans longer-term later in the year, so looking forward to that. My question is: do you see any potential impact on the timing of political decisions around the energy law, and particularly issues around renewables or energy efficiency?","Peter Oleksiak","","That's a really good question, Andy. And we still believe there will be comprehensive legislation in 2015. And what's going to be interesting is how, with that comprehensive legislation, the state will be still in the process of determining the EPA compliance on the CO2.","So there's going to have to be flexibility within that legislation to provide us \u2013 to meet those carbon rules. It doesn't make sense to do it all at the same time. They are all essentially interrelated when you're looking at the renewables standard \u2013 even the choice, because the utilities need some certainty of build before we go ahead and build, that we believe at all \u2013 there will be some comprehensive legislation, but with enough flexibility to meet the EPA standards.","Andy Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital Securities","","Not to get too cute on timing, but any sense of when during the year that might come out?","Peter Oleksiak","My sense is most likely it will be postelection and most likely be the first half of next year.","Andy Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital Securities","","Okay, great. Then, lastly, an obligatory one on NEXUS. When can we expect updates? It sounds like about a month or so till the open season is over. Should we in the financial community expect an update shortly after that? Or would it be more like around EEI or year-end when the regulatory filings come?","Peter Oleksiak","","The update really will occur with the FERC filing process. So we have a 30-day \u2013 roughly a 30-day open season. After that, if we are proceeding on the project, we will do a FERC filing.","In that FERC filing itself, there will be details around the pipe. And I anticipate once we have that FERC filing out there, we will be reaching out to you guys, providing updates.","Andy Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital Securities","","Great. Thank you very much.","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","I wanted to follow up, just to \u2013 I will kick off with NEXUS, and then I'll leave it alone. Can you talk a little bit about ownership and participants in the project? It seems a little bit in flux. What are your thoughts about your involvement in the project, giving that up potentially, and how that could impact the project as well?","Peter Oleksiak","","That's a good question, Julien. On the ownership front, the original MOU with the original partners did expire. So DTE and Spectra are in the process right now of determining ownership levels with other interested parties, including Enbridge. The finalization of the ownership participation will coincide at the same time with finalization of the volumes and the size of the actual pipe itself.","So I would say at this point in time, we are sticking with our prior disclosures of the one-third ownership. But that could change with the finalization of the participation levels of interested parties as well as the size of the pipe.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","Great. And just from a timing perspective and trying to juxtapose the conversation with NEXUS with that of expanded coal retirements, more gas: is this more a question of timing, of when rather than if, just in terms of getting this off the ground and the incremental need in the state? If you could comment broadly?","Peter Oleksiak","","For the \u2013 I'm sorry; I was distracted here a little bit. Could you ask the question again?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","Yes. Just kind of taking the two conversations that have been ongoing here \u2013 just NEXUS; the need for incremental gas in the state, given the coal retirements; is this a question of when rather than if? And how do you think about your own plans for more coal retirements in context of expanded pipe needs in the state?","Peter Oleksiak","","It is definitely a matter of when. There will be gas needs within the state of Michigan. That's why \u2013 and the NEXUS pipe will provide that when it connects into the existing Michigan infrastructure. It will be sourcing Michigan as well as potentially sourcing the Chicago-Ontario market.","So we do feel there is a need for this pipe going into Michigan and then existing infrastructure within Michigan. Once NEXUS is built, we are going to need to be doing some expansions on Vector as well as our gas utility system.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","Excellent. Then going back to the coal retirement side, or moving on to that side, rather: can you comment? You mentioned upper end of the $1.3 billion to $2 billion range. What are the primary drivers as you are thinking about that?","I know we are a little early. And perhaps specifically here the Belle River plant \u2013 how are you thinking about that in the context of carbon and your comments earlier, that perhaps it had a little bit of a bigger impact on timing than you might have had initially?","","Peter Oleksiak","What we are working through right now \u2013 we really are in the process of working through this detail. The EPA has a compliance by 2030, but it also has \u2013 is averaging between 2020 and 2030. So how do you do that? What's the timing of that? And that's really where the acceleration is going to come in as they hit those averages.","And as you mentioned, we do have some longer-term coal plants \u2013 the coal plant, in particular, where we put $2 billion of environmental spend on at our Monroe plant \u2013 that's going to be here long after I retire.","The other plants are something that we were looking at, whether \u2013 what's going to be the timing. You mentioned the Belle River plant, one of our newer plants that will be around quite a while. But in this time frame, we are analyzing as well what we do with that plant as well in this time frame.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","Perhaps just be more specific there. Does the upper end of that $2 billion range include a full scrubber on Belle River? Is that one of the big CapEx items there?","Peter Oleksiak","","We are \u2013 that's something right now, actually \u2013 what we need to do with Belle River with these EPA standards. We have deployed this dry sorbent injection technology across a number of our generating units, including Belle River. So it's that's one thing we are analyzing right now; the engineering people are analyzing whether we need that scrubber or not, or just continue on with this dry sorbent injection technology.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","Got you. And so I suppose that will be part of the update later this fall?","Peter Oleksiak","","It will.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","Great. I'll let it be. Thank you very much.","Operator","","And our next question is from Mark Barnett with MorningStar.","Mark Barnett \u2013 MorningStar","","So we have talked a lot about the pipelines and the utility today, which has been great. Thanks for that. Just a couple of smaller questions. Just one housekeeping: how large was the impact year to date from the change in your benefit assumptions in the income statement? If that's not a number that you have right away, we can \u2013 .","Peter Oleksiak","","We are getting that number right now. One second, Mark. We can come back with you on that.","Mark Barnett \u2013 MorningStar","","Okay, no problem. The second question is more of a longer-term question here for the REF units. What's the average, I guess, tenure of those contracts, at least the ones that you have finalized now? And how potentially a little bit down the road, when maybe some investment decisions are made about the lifetime of those plants with some of the new regulations that we are seeing or going to see, how do the contracts treat that possibility?","","Peter Oleksiak","","These plants are \u2013 they are 10-year tax credit projects. So the economics here is really driven by tax credits. We had roughly half of them go into service in 2009. They will actually end in 2020. The other was a 2011 ending in 2022.","So right now, what we are planning on is the economics will play out during this time frame. Having said that, as you indicated, there may be some continued use for these facilities from an environmental compliance, but it would be at a much reduced level.","Mark Barnett \u2013 MorningStar","","Okay, thanks for that.","Jeff Jewell","","This is Jeff Jewell. From the plan design, we are about $10 million after-tax savings with respect to 2014. And then there's the asset returns and stuff like that, maybe other $5 million. So we are talking, like, maybe $15 million.","Mark Barnett \u2013 MorningStar","","Okay, thanks, appreciate it.","Operator","","And our next question is from Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","Basically, all set \u2013 but just back on NEXUS, just to make sure I understand what you said about Enbridge: so I guess I noticed in your brochure for the open season that you just did, obviously Enbridge was not listed, as it was in an earlier brochure. So should we just assume that Enbridge is basically out; and that if this pipe goes ahead, you will have a larger percent?","Peter Oleksiak","","Really too early at this point to say that. We are in discussions right now with Enbridge around their continued potential ownership interest in the pipe as well as other interested parties. This is all will come to a head within the next 30 days with this open season.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","Okay. But basically, the question is why were they not included in the brochure?","Peter Oleksiak","","We are right now the lead \u2013 the DT inspector are the lead. So the lead developers are the ones who drive the process and are mentioned in the open season documentation.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","Right. But they were in a previous one. So I'm just wondering why they are not in this one.","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes. The MOU did expire. And we are, at this point, the lead on the project. That's really what I can disclose at this point.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","Okay. And again, I guess the CapEx that you are looking at in your \u2013 you have your bar chart where you to give earnings for the natural gas segment, for the pipe segment through 2018, I believe it is. How much of that \u2013 does that contemplate a third, third, third in the earnings power that you give there? And then you have your, like, white section there \u2013 .","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes, our disclosure, which I said at this point we probably \u2013 we will be sticking with until we understand this open season. It was 1 B pipe at a $1.5 billion spend with a one-third ownership.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","Okay.","Peter Oleksiak","","But it's in the schedules as well.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","Got that. And then do you think really by the end of this binding open season in the next four weeks \u2013 again, it could be extended \u2013 we will kind of know at that point whether it's a go or no go in the time frame that you have set out?","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes. The next step would be to have a FERC filing. And at that point in time we will be proceeding into the next important step of this pipeline project.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","But what I'm asking is that this binding open season that you are doing should really determine whether it's a go or no go?","","Peter Oleksiak","","It will determine the ultimate size of the pipe.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","Of the size of the pipe?","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","So is it safe to say that it's almost certainly a go; it's just a matter of size now?","Peter Oleksiak","It will be \u2013 in terms of a FERC filing process, there's definitely a high probability that we will be proceeding with the FERC filing. It's really determining now the size of the pipe.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","Okay. So I don't know if you want to put a percent. But like you said, it's a very high probability that this\u2026","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes, and I did indicate that I remain very bullish. Our pipe here\u2026","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","","Right, yes. I saw that on Bloomberg's\u2026","Peter Oleksiak","","Yes, and in terms of where we tie into the reduced level of new build needed, for us it makes a lot of sense.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital ","","Okay, that's great. Those were my questions. Thank you very much.","Operator","","And we have a follow-up question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","I wanted to follow up here. You mentioned needing to \u2013 or potentially tapping the bilateral market here for further capacity as you look out. I'd be curious; can you comment at all around some of the other data points we've heard around improvement in MISO capacity pricing, to the extent to which you are willing to comment? Some of the data points out there have supported $2 to $3 a kilowatt month. Any thoughts? Is that consistent, in the ballpark with what you are seeing?","Peter Oleksiak","","Julien, I really haven't gotten into that level of detail, to be honest, with the team. When I did talk to the team, there are options that we have. So we don't need to proceed in terms of buying a generating plant here in the state of Michigan. If it doesn't make a lot of sense for our customers, we will not do that; we will proceed with other options.","Don't really have the specifics in terms of what we are seeing in the pricing, what those options are going to be. But obviously, it would be something we would determine at the end of the RFP process whether we were going to go to that route or not.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","Got you. What would be \u2013 just the order of magnitude \u2013 how much are you thinking about procuring potentially from the market versus any other resource for your own internal planning? Just if you could give us a sense there? And I will leave it there.","Peter Oleksiak","","We do have a natural short in the summer time frame that's around 1,000 megawatts that will continue to be needed for us to procure in the summer time frame.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","Great. And that increases by how much, or to what levels?","Peter Oleksiak","","I'm going to say it's roughly 1,000 megawatts. There is changes in terms of load and peak load demands, but it's approximately 1,000 megawatts. We are anticipating that to stay.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","All right, great. Well, thank you very much for the clarity.","Operator","","And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I like to turn the conference back over for any additional remarks.","Peter Oleksiak","","I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. And then have a great weekend.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"7860":["DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 25, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","David E.

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Meador. Please go ahead, sir.","David E. Meador","Thanks, Andrea, and I apologize to you for that music while you're on hold there. We were hoping to have Tigers theme song playing while you're on hold, but that didn't work out so well this year. Maybe next year. But good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings call. And before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.","Moving on to Slide 3. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Senior VP of Finance; Dan Brudzynski, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Anastasia Minor, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me, if needed, during the Q&A session.","Looking at Slide 4 on the agenda here. We're going to provide results on the third quarter performance and also update you on our financial goals for the rest of the year. Gerry Anderson will be presenting at the EEI Conference in a couple of weeks, where he'll provide you an in-depth business update and details on the growth plans. So this morning, I'll focus the call on the quarter and the remainder of the year, but as always, I'd be happy to take questions on any topic.","So moving to Slide 5. This is an overview of our business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans for the next 10 years of both utilities are robust. Our electric utilities growth over the next 5 years is driven by operational investments, environmental controls, renewable energy, and then if you look out to the second 5 years, new generation, which is going to replace some of our coal fleet, but the gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments and meter relocation.","We also have meaningful low-risk growth at our non-utility businesses, and they provide diversity, both in earnings and geography. And as I have said, we'll provide more details for all these businesses at EEI in a couple of weeks.","We operate in a very supportive regulatory environment, and we work hard every day to continue to earn that construct. Our effort, as you know, begins with highly engaged workforce and an ongoing focus on continuous improvement. This enables us to continue our cost savings track record. And also, it enables our utilities to consistently earn their authorized returns. We also continue to focus on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe is distinctive in our industry.","Our dividend payout range is 60% to 70% of earnings, and we target a strong BBB credit rating. Our strategy altogether provides for a consistent 5% to 6% earnings growth and attractive and increasing dividend and all of that with a strong balance sheet.","If you turn to Slide 6. This is our earnings and dividend growth slide that we've shared with you in the past. We remain confident that our growth plans will deliver our 5% to 6% earnings per share growth.","In fact, for this year, we're tightening our range on our guidance of $3.95 to $3.14, and we're going to affirm our $4.05 midpoint, which Peter will go over in a little bit more detail in a minute. The midpoint provides 6.6% growth over our weather-normalized earnings of last year, which were $3.80. We're also reiterating our confidence in our 2014 early outlook, midpoint of $4.27 per share, which provides about 5.5% growth and which is right in line with our long-term growth outlook.","But back to the chart, if you look on the left-hand side, you can see we've actually exceeded our commitment of 5% to 6% growth by delivering 7% annual growth from 2008 to 2014. As you know, we increased our dividend each year, starting in 2010, and earlier this year, we increased it to $2.62, which was a 5.6% increase.","Based on the $4.05 earnings per share midpoint this year, that dividend gives us about a 65% payout. And as our earnings continue to grow, we would expect to grow our dividend over time. And then on the bottom, you can see our overarching goal is to earn $1 billion by 2017, and we're well on our journey to do that.","Turning to Slide 7. The Michigan economic turnaround continues. We have actually one of the better economic growth rates in the nation, which by the way, when Peter talks about our load numbers, it's directly reflected in our load growth. If you look at that measures that we track, auto production, housing starts, new customers, unemployment, just to name a few metrics, they all continue to trend very positively.","We're also being recognized by many external organizations in areas that demonstrate progress that Michigan is making. On the bottom of Page 7, we've just highlighted a handful of these. If I included all of them, I'd have to have more pages in the presentation.","As the state continues its strong economic comeback, the city of Detroit continues to work through the resizing of city government. We are in the bankruptcy filing that happened earlier this year. This is the first step in Detroit's recovery, and we believe the process will address its financial problems in a sustainable way. We also continue to believe there will be no impact on DTE Energy as a result of the bankruptcy.","I realize how Detroit's often portrayed in the national news, which is not often showing the signs of the city moving forward and the progress that's really being made that we see every single day here. There's a lot of positive momentum on economic development and job creation and real estate development in the city.","For example, Google recently named Detroit 1 of 7 new entrepreneur technology hubs in the entire country. Detroit was 1 of the 7. So I'm very confident that Detroit and Michigan will continue this positive momentum and will come out stronger both as a region and a state.","While I'm discussing the city and the state, it's a good time just to mention the energy policy work that's going on in Michigan. The MPSC is currently issuing its fact-finding reports. They came out of a collaborative work with stakeholders over the last year. Final reports on the 4 areas, which were energy efficiency, renewable energy choice and then other considerations, and an example on that bucket would be electric reliability, are expected to be issued by the end of November. These findings should help set the foundation for the governor's long-term energy policy recommendations. We expect the governor to take a balanced approach for the state, ensuring that the policy makes sense for Michigan residents.","Now moving to our financial overview on Slide 8. We continue to have strong results in 2013, and we're very confident in our earnings guidance midpoint. And we've tightened the guidance range, as I've mentioned, to $0.20. Our year-to-date operating earnings of $3.09 per share are up $0.01 from 2012. Third quarter operating earnings were $1.13 per share compared to $1.30 last year. It's important to remember that we experienced extremely warm weather last year. In fact, it was one of the warmest summers on record, and it provided the electric utility $40 million of favorability in the third quarter of last year. This year's electric sales returned to a more weather normal condition. And like the second quarter of this year, we experienced lower benefit expenses due to our benefit design changes that we made.","Our gas utility earnings returned to a more typical performance in the third quarter. Last year, the gas business benefited by a number of onetime items that are not repeated this year. We're very confident in our earnings targets for gas, and we're raising our guidance for the segment to a range of $125 million to $130 million, which is a $10 million increase. And Peter will take you through the details in a minute.","The balance sheet remains strong, and we generated approximately $1.7 billion in cash from operations year to date. We're increasing our cash flow guidance for 2013 primarily due to improved working capital and summary timing of capital investments at DTE Electric. So we're on track to meet our balance sheet goals for 2013 with a strong credit rating from each of the agencies.","Before I turn it over to Peter, I just wanted to comment briefly on the challenges around quarterly earnings guidance, which we don't provide, and the consensus that comes out from sell-side analysts. As you know, our overarching goal is to deliver for the year both our guidance at midpoint, and to earn our authorized return at both utilities, and we have an established track record of doing that. We've explained in the past how we're managing our O&M, primarily around weather with our lean and invest strategy.","This year, changes in retiree health care triggered $60 million to $70 million of favorability earlier in the year. And when you couple that with the first quarter gas favorability, we started out the year in a very strong position. So we initiated higher O&M for reinvestment in the second quarter and the third quarter. Normally, reinvestment based on weather favorability would have been timed later in the year. So we actually launched our reinvestment strategy much earlier than we do normally.","But given that background, even with lower trading earnings, we're very confident in the $4.05 for the year. And as you know, we always plan the year and the forward years with some contingency in our planning.","So with that background, let me turn it over to Peter, and he'll go through some more details on the quarter.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'll just start with Slide 10 on the third quarter earning results. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings are $1.13. As a reminder, there's a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings included in the appendix.","The 2 utilities, DTE Electric contributed $1.02, and DTE Gas, which typically incurs an operating loss in the third quarter, came in at a $0.07 loss. The non-utility segments combined to earn $0.21 for the quarter. The drivers for the non-utility results are Gas Storage & Pipelines at $0.09, our Industrial Projects at $0.15 and the Energy Trading segment at a loss of $0.03. Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.03 as well.","Let's move to Slide 11, a summary of the quarter recorded performance by segment. DTE Electric contributed $15 million less earnings year-over-year, and DTE Gas had a decrease in earnings of $17 million. I'll cover details around our both our electric and gas utilities in a moment.","Operating earnings for our 2 non-utility growth segments are up a combined $7 million in the quarter, offset by a loss in our Trading business.","Our Gas Storage & Pipelines segment for the quarter, earnings growth in our pipeline assets is partially offset by lower storage earnings. Incremental pipeline growth is starting to flow through the bottom line in the second half of the year as volumes increase in our Bluestone and related gathering investments.","Power & Industrial earnings are also higher for the quarter, driven by increased earnings from our reduced emissions fuel projects and our on-site energy project portfolio acquisition that occurred last year. Year-over-year growth in the segment will continue for the remainder of the year.","At Energy Trading, accounting for economic hedges related to longer-term transactions and economic earnings not yet realized for accounting purposes is driving the loss for the quarter. The economic income for the quarter is comparable to last year. In the appendix, we've included our standard Energy Trading slides to show both economic and accounting performance.","Finally, our Corporate & Other segment came in favorable by $4 million from last year due primarily to lower interest and taxes.","I'd like to now turn the talk to the 2 utilities in more detail, starting with the electric utility, if you turn to Page 12. The DTE Electric earnings variance is mainly driven by the return to relatively normal weather this quarter compared to the 2012 abnormally hot weather. Actually, cooling degree days last summer and the quarter were 40% higher than normal compared to this year, which actually was relatively close to weather normal. This weather difference is driving $40 million in lower earnings in 2013.","I know individuals on this call are always interested in what's happening with our underlying electric service territory load. We continue to see growth in underlying load with temperature-normalized sales growth at 3% in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. And actually, for the year, on a year-to-date basis, normalized sales are 2% higher in 2013 and actually is driven by growth in all of our segments.","Also driving year-over-year earnings is reduced benefit expense. Dave mentioned that in his opening remarks. As you recall, on the first 2 quarterly calls, I talked about structural cost changes we made to retiree health care plan. This benefited electric earnings this quarter by $14 million.","Typically, we don't talk about the next quarter on the call, but looking to the fourth quarter drivers for the electric business, we'll see a lot of quarter-over-quarter growth driven by the benefit expense reduction, which will flow and improve the fourth quarter results and also by significant reinvestment spending last year that occurred in the fourth quarter that's not occurring this year. Just as a reminder, last year we did spend $20 million of reinvestment really driven by that weather favorability with the majority of that occurring in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to DTE Gas on Slide 13. As I mentioned earlier, the gas business typically sustains a small loss in the quarter. In fact, the DTE Gas showed earnings of $4 million in the third quarter, and 2012 is atypical for the gas company and is driven mainly by short-term cost reduction actions or lean actions the company took to offset its slow start to the year last year.","During the earnings call last quarter, I talked about reinvestment into our core utility assets that would be occurring in this year. For DTE Gas, this drove $6 million of the variance of this quarter from 2012. An increase in rate base-related expenses is the primary driver in the other variance of $5 million.","Let me now move to the total enterprise and the guidance for the remainder of the year. As shown on Slide 14, we are nearing our EPS guidance from $0.30 to $0.20 while we're maintaining our midpoint of $4.05 for all of our segments. In addition, we are remixing our 2013 earnings guidance, reflecting strong earnings at our gas utilities and the economic earnings that will not be realized for accounting purposes this year at our Energy Trading segment.","At DTE Electric, growth in the electric sales as well as renewable investments and lower benefit expense have funded our reinvestment activities. We expect DTE Electric to achieve the guidance range of $480 million to $490 million.","At DTE Gas, year-to-date earnings have been very strong, driven by favorable weather, higher weather normalized consumption and lower benefit expense. We'll continue O&M reinvestment in the last quarter of the year at our gas utility segment funded primarily by this usage and benefit expense favorability.","As I mentioned earlier, Gas Storage & Pipeline and Power & Industrial Projects segments are on track to achieve their guidance with the Bluestone Pipeline and Gathering system ramp-up and the incremental earnings associated with our reduced emissions fuel business line flowing through the remainder of the year.","That concludes an update on our earnings for the quarter. And I'd like to turn the discussion over to Dan Brudzynski, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures.","Daniel G. Brudzynski","Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 16 and our year-to-date cash flows. Through September, cash from operations is $1.7 billion, which is comparable to 2012 levels. Capital spending was slightly higher than last year due to increased spending at the electric utility and increased investments in our Bluestone pipeline and its related gathering assets. Electric utility capital is higher due to increased spending on our nuclear operations, system reliability and environmental projects, partially offset by the retiming of our renewable energy spend. Overall, DTE's net cash is down slightly year-over-year.","Slide 17 lays out this detail for the year-to-date capital expenditures. You can see the increases in electric utility capital as well as the non-utility businesses, which as I said earlier, reflects increased investments in Bluestone. The gas utility is comparable to 2012's levels.","Turning to Slide 18 and a look ahead for 2013. As David mentioned earlier, we are increasing our cash flow guidance for 2013 with cash from operations expected to be slightly higher than the original guidance and capital spending expected to be slightly lower. Our increased cash guidance is driven by the timing of surcharge collections at DTE Electric. Our prior guidance had assumed recovery of these under collections over 2013 and 2014 and also lower corporate tax payments. The change in capital is primarily due to the retiming of dry sorbent injection, or DSI, installations based on a 1-year compliance extension that was granted by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. And you can see that detail in the table on the right of that page.","And finally, finishing up on Slide 19. As David mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong with leverage and FFO metrics in line with our targets. Our financing plan is on track. As we have issued approximately $300 million of equity into our benefit and DRIP plans by year end and the remaining DRIP plan in effect, we expect total equity issuance for the year to be slightly over that $300 million. We have issued about $800 million in debt and continue to have sufficient liquidity.","And with that, I'll turn the discussion back over to Dave for some concluding comments.","David E. Meador","Thanks, Dan. Let me wrap up on Slide 21. As we laid out for you, we're on track to reach our 2013 earnings per share guidance and that we narrowed our guidance from $0.30 range to $0.20 range with a $5.05 -- $4.05 midpoint. We are increasing our cash flow guidance, and Dan took you through that. The balance sheet is exactly where we want it to be. Going forward, our robust operational and utility investments, together with low-risk non-utility growth opportunities, are expected to provide 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth and dividend growth.","As I mentioned, we'll be at EEI in a little over 2 weeks, and we hope to see many of you there. Gerry Anderson will be providing a detailed business update for each of our business segments. The presentation that Gerry will provide will begin at 11:15 Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday, November 12. For those of you not going to EEI, you'll be able to join that webcast through our Investor Relations website.","And Andrea, with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Kevin Cole with Credit Suisse.","Matthew Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's actually Matt Davis. Just a quick question on the O&M reimbursement program and the timing for this year and look -- in the fourth quarter and looking at it versus last year. I know you guys said that you had spent $20 million extra last year, and then this year, you kind of had reaccelerated that earlier in 2Q and 3Q. And so what kind of year-on-year changes, and what are we looking at in the fourth quarter?","Daniel G. Brudzynski","Yes. Last year was predominantly in that fourth quarter, so I would say about 3\/4 of that. And then this year, we just have -- we've had some small remaining amount, but actually, the majority of it, if not all of it, has been spent already this year. Clearly, you'll see that fourth quarter last year flow to the bottom line.","Matthew Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And how will this level of O&M flow into 2014? Should we expect this is kind of like a normalized level of O&M or increase, decrease?","Daniel G. Brudzynski","The reinvestment really is kind of on a year-by-year basis. So if you look at normalized O&M, I would take the reinvestment off of that. And we've described before, basically going through the year, we have a couple of different plans. One of them is the weather normal plan. The other one is more of an invest plan, if we get additional revenue in. So next year, we're projecting out -- as we talk about productivity and relatively flat O&M, but as we get into the year, we'll make the decision whether we reinvest.","David E. Meador","So long term -- well, first of all, we are still back at our 2005 O&M levels, which is about $1.5 billion, and our goal is to hold it a $1.5 billion through the next several years. So year-to-year, you might get some shifting back and forth, certainly quarter-to-quarter -- or quarter-over-quarter as you see this year. You'll see that happen, and we want to try to help you through that. So if you're looking forward, I would just assume that we're going to hold O&M flat as we have been, which is offsetting inflation and also offsetting new O&M that's coming into the business.","Matthew Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, what kind of guidance are we -- should we expect to get at EEI? Are we going to be getting additional CapEx guidance, additional segment earnings guidance? What level of detail should we be expecting?","Daniel G. Brudzynski","Yes. We definitely will talk a little more detail around 2014. So you can expect an update around '14 guidance.","David E. Meador","And then we've already laid out, as you know, 10 years of CapEx for the utilities. There probably will be some refinement about there. There will probably be some more clarity about our thinking about the transformation of our coal fleet over time and how that plays out and plays hopefully into the governor's new energy policy and hopefully what we see transpiring in Washington. So I think we have a pretty good story to tell about over time, how some of the coal fleet will close just naturally because it's coming down to life and how that will be replaced and do that in conjunction with expanded renewable energy policy and so on. So I would expect Gerry to go into more detail on the utilities and energy policy and then clearly more details on the non-utilities.","Operator","Our next question will be from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","It sounds like the utilities are strong. I appreciate the color you just gave me O&M reinvestments and 3% weather-adjusted load growth at the electric business, if I heard you right. Any change to your plans about the timing of the next round of rate case filings?","David E. Meador","No change right now.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes, no change, yes.","David E. Meador","Yes. We're still thinking that we are going to be filing next year for the electric business with new rates in '15. And the gas business that we are -- we have the infrastructure tracker and that with ongoing cost control is going to allow us to stay out 3 years or longer. So we go into '14 with a lot of stability and no rate cases.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Great. Next question on the pipelines. It sounds like Bluestone is ramping up pretty nicely. Can you give us an update on NEXUS, the Utica pipeline? Specifically, I'm curious what you're hearing from producers right now, when you think contracts might start being signed, and what might be a range of possible in-service dates?","David E. Meador","This is one of the projects that Gerry will talk more about at EEI. But just to generally give it some tone, we still get positive indication so that not only the demand for the gas in Michigan and Ontario at the Dawn connection, but also, as all of us are watching the wells in the Utica play, a lot of positive signs there. So I think what we're thinking our way through right now is as the Utica develops, which pipes in the region go through the expansion first. So either they're going to be additional compression or looped, and then at what point in time are there going to be new pipes built? And as this plays out, I still -- I would characterize this as very positive. And the timing right now in terms of in service, our thinking has not changed. I think it's in the 2016, 2017 time frame. But again, we'll give you more details at EEI.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Great. And then lastly, just for the Trading business, it sounds like some timing issues on accounting earnings versus economic. Given that you're basically a small loss year-to-date versus your updated guidance range, should we assume that catches up in the fourth quarter? Or might some of this fall into 2014? And for now, are you still comfortable with the $10 million to $30 million guidance range for 2014 earnings?","David E. Meador","You want to answer that, Peter?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes, I will answer that. I guess first, I can talk about the guidance -- the overall timing. We do have in the appendix -- we do lay out the difference between the economic and the accounting and there's a $14 million timing in the quarter. There is -- a few million of that will come back in the fourth quarter. The rest of that actually will play through on 2014, 2016. And I wish I could take a moment and talk a little bit more around the timing that we're seeing. Actually, there's 2 pieces on this. One of them is related to economic hedges, and we talked about this in the past, kind of this one side of the accounting that occurs. So as we hedge in transactions, the accounting-related to those hedges actually kind of get mark-to-market versus more accrual base if one would be a transaction. Actually, there's a bigger piece of this timing that is tied to the mix of the types of transactions. Actually, this business, we're moving more towards from pure trading type of transactions that get immediate accounting and economic recognition to transactions related to origination deals and contracts tied to assets and actually the accounting of this flows with the transaction. So that describes some of the longer tail, and this roll-on is really tied to those transactions. But Andrew, one other -- you're talking about the guidance. Actually, the guidance, revised guidance is $5 million to $15 million. So we did take down the guidance for the segment.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","That was for this year. I was asking about next year.","David E. Meador","We're thinking our way through that. My general sense is, as you know, this is not part of our growth story at all. And over time, hopefully what you're going to see is our other -- you look at our non-utility businesses in the midstream and Power & Industrial, they're growing 15% to 20% per year. And just as a strategy, working with you all, I want to de-emphasize Trading. And so we're working our way through that. And either we'll have an update at EEI or when we finalize our guidance in January.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have actually been asked and answered. I guess I wanted to ask the first question kind of in a different way. When you look at the implied fourth quarter guidance on the electric side, it implies something like $30 million to $40 million year-over-year earnings growth or 50%-plus. Given weather was only drag about $5 million last year and assuming normal weather this year, should we assume most of that is coming from O&M? Or could you just talk a bit a little bit about the drivers there?","David E. Meador","It's probably split half. Some of that benefit favorability we're seeing in the third quarter. So you saw that level come through. That same level is going to come through in the fourth quarter. And the other, as I mentioned, we had a $20 million reinvestment last year. About 3\/4 of that is going to flow through favorability in the fourth quarter.","Peter B. Oleksiak","And actually, as you look at the fourth quarter, what -- the implied fourth quarter, it is actually pretty typical for a fourth quarter result for the electric utility. Actually it's getting it back to more of a typical fourth quarter result.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. And kind of a similar question, maybe similar but opposite on the gas side. The guidance implies a pretty steep year-over-year drop-off. Is that again primarily just on O&M reinvestment?","Peter B. Oleksiak","That is correct.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll hear from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you guys already asked about -- or answered regarding NEXUS. But on the Bluestone side, you had some developments in the quarter regarding new agreements, et cetera. Could you perhaps provide a little bit more color about added CapEx and perhaps further achievements after the Southwest deal?","Daniel G. Brudzynski","I would just tell you, this is an exciting time for us, an exciting time for that segment. So as you know, in the whole midstream space, the estimates over the next 10 years is there's going to be $1 trillion of investments made because you have to get this gas to market. And we're putting a lot of our muscle into not only what we can do on Bluestone, on the Bluestone area, with Southwestern and other producers, but we're also looking at what other opportunities there could be for us. So I would just characterize this as very positive. And not that we're coming out with any major announcements at EEI, but it's just something I think Gerry Anderson will talk more about at EEI. And then, as things develop here, certainly we'll provide more color around that. But we are talking to Southwestern as we speak about deepening and furthering our relationship not only in that basin but possibly in other basins.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And I presume that would involve the CapEx update at EEI, just to be clear?","David E. Meador","Yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just going back to the Trading side, just again to be clear on this one. It's clearly not necessary reversal in '13, but as you think about the accounting risk as the operating -- or I suppose that's the description, that would materialize in your operating earnings beyond 2013, so perhaps there's a little bit of a tailwind here into '14 and subsequent years?","Daniel G. Brudzynski","As far as the strategy to get these more origination or non-derivative type of transactions, it does kind of build some income base for this business over multiple years.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. Is there anything in particular you can point to for subsequent years here?","David E. Meador","Not at this time.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","You mentioned pretty specifically in the context of answering other questions that you expect to be able to hold your O&M absolutely flat over the next few years. Can you comment on what you're seeing? And I know interest rates have come back down from their peak, but in terms of what you're seeing in terms of changing discount rate on your pension plans, and how significant an O&M reduction on the GAAP pension expense you might be looking at and what your funding status might look like given where interest rates are today?","David E. Meador","Sure. And actually, before I do that, I want to correct myself. On O&M, we are striving for flat O&M. And at the same time, we're exploring further structural cost changes over time. And it's part of our strategy around trying to keep rates as low as possible for customers. So we have this one goal for O&M, and at the same time, we're looking for opportunities for step function changes. And I think at EEI, we'll talk more about that. An example of that is what we just did with retiree health care where this year, we're going to see $60 million to $70 million of benefit and on an annualized basis. Next year, it's $70 million to $80 million on retiree health care. So we continue to look for opportunities on that. On the pension side, and I'll ask Peter and Dan for help, the discount rate continues to move. You only measure that once a year. So you measure that at the end of the year. But we expect with interest rate movement here, the discount rate will go up and that, that in addition to real good returns on our assets, we're seeing our funded status go back up. Do you have those numbers, peter?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes. And then you have the funded as over the 80%. So we're well on our way over the next few years to get fully funded. And I guess in the benefit, and as we talked about this, the strategy with the retiree health care, it really is part of our bridging strategy coupled with the need to stay out, as well as our affordability for our customers. And actually, next year, there is another portion since we had 2 changes. We have one on our salary plan, our union plan. And actually, the union plan, the benefits are flowing in the second quarter. But we're going to start to see some additional favorability. And that's why the group goes up to 70% to 80% from the 60% to 70%. So, and as you mentioned, there was another tranche of favorability that's coming related to discount rates. And actually, we like that. For next year, I said, once we really settle in what that accounting is and what it's going to be, we'll update you in terms of where we're at on our overall earnings as well as investment plans within utilities and if this holds it'll be good for our customers as well, in terms of overall...","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just to be clear, this is completely away from retiree health care, but just on pension, given the way your performance has been and given where discount rates are trending, you would expect to have to fund less on a cash basis, A? Secondly, you would expect a significant reduction in your GAAP operating expense, is that correct?","David E. Meador","Over the next several years. So we -- as we mentioned, we're 82% funded, and we'll have a couple of years of cash contributions. Our goal is to be fully funded by 2016. We're already starting to shift our asset allocation in terms of immunizing our risk to future interest rates changes. So as we increase our funding, our cash contributions will be much less and our pension expense will be much less. And we will then have hopefully immunized ourselves to any future interest rate changes down the road. You're spot on on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick one. I want to make sure I heard you right. You talked about 3% versus the underlying electric sales growth. Was that the third quarter versus third quarter last year?","Daniel G. Brudzynski","Yes, that was -- it's kind of a third quarter over third quarter.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And it seems to have picked up slightly as you move through the year. What is your best guess where you're going to finish the year? And how are you thinking about 2014 and beyond?","Daniel G. Brudzynski","Yes. We think right now on a total year basis, we're going to be at the 2%. Actually, as you know, year-to-date, we're 2%. Residential, right now, year-to-date, is 2%. We think that'll settle in at 1%. And then our industrial will be settling at about 4% for the year. So we're thinking 2% there may be a little up -- bias upwards on the 2% but still thinking that it's going to be a 2% growth. And then on a go-forward basis, we're looking at about a 1% growth. And that's actually including energy efficiency, so net of efficiency.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","1% net of efficiency going forward, is that how to break down between the segments roughly?","Daniel G. Brudzynski","I'd say it's probably residential relatively flat. That's typically how we've given usage, and that's where your energy efficiency programs are. And both the commercial and industrial are pretty relatively equal and make up that 1%.","Operator","We do have a follow-up question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sorry, I wanted to follow up here just on transmission, actually. I mean, some of your peers out there have been talking about it of late. Any thoughts to perhaps pursuing something comparable?","David E. Meador","Not at this time. For those of you that were in Grand Rapids yesterday, I saw the PowerPoint from CMS also, and I'm curious to learn more about that. But we don't have any plans like that at this time.","Operator","We'll go next to Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","On Bluestone, David, you talked about making some progress there. And I understand there'll be more detail at EEI. Can you just give us a sense of where you stand relative to your comments at the second quarter? You talked about, I think, $650 million of investment to go there and expectation that you could get to $100 million in earnings. The target was higher than that, and you talked about white space. Can you fill us in on what kind of progress you've made in those terms?","David E. Meador","We -- I'd rather hold that for EEI. We're making a lot of progress in filling in that white space and continue to get questions about can you grow this beyond the $120 million. And we have a fair number of balls in the air right now, but the answer is it possible yes, and that's what we're working our way through right now. Everything we see there, as you know, the amount of gas that's coming out of that Susquehanna County in particular is, I think, a paradigm shift for a lot of people. And so what you're seeing in the whole region, including our assets, is that over time, you're going to see pipes filling up. You're going to see expansions happening faster than people thought at Bluestone and at Millennium. And then there's ongoing opportunity for whether it'd be laterals tying to that Bluestone pipe or additional gathering system contracts. So whether it would be Southwestern and\/or others, I think over time, you're going to see us come back with higher investment numbers and higher earnings than we've previously disclosed. That's not -- I don't think you're going to see us change our 2014 numbers, but there is a lot of positive activity in the space right now.","Peter B. Oleksiak","And Kit, this is Peter. I know the $650 million actually is kind of spend-to-date. We were thinking about and talking about this now as a go-forward spend. We're looking at $1 billion to $1.3 billion of capital on the segment from '13 on, and we'll give you an update at EEI in terms of where we're at.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett with MorningStar Equity Research.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So just a quick question on something smaller that you mentioned about your cash flow guidance for the year. You talked about the improvement, I guess, in working capital versus your plan. Is that something that's going to be more or less sustainable or kind of a non-repeatable thing that we shouldn't expect for 2014?","David E. Meador","I would characterize it as non-repeatable, more of a onetime.","Peter B. Oleksiak","It's related to underrecoveries. We have the PSCR, the GCR. We had some reconciliations around the choice tracker that went away roughly over a year ago. And we had some under-recoveries. We settled the cases, got them done earlier. So the collection on those under-recoveries started a little earlier. So they were -- we were planning them to bleed a little bit into '14, but it turns out that they'll occur mostly in '13.","Operator","We'll hear next from Andrew Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Levi","So just kind of sticking with the gas and the infrastructure. It sounds like things are moving along quite nicely, maybe a little bit faster than what you guys anticipated earlier in the year for the outer years. At what level of -- whether it's net income or capital opportunities, do you start to consider doing an MLP?","David E. Meador","As you know, we don't have an exact number. And we've said for some time that we needed to get more scale. And it wasn't just more scale on what I had today, but I also feel strongly that I need line of sight to an investment -- a set of investments. So as you know, when you set these up, you would have to have a pool of assets that you either currently own that you could drop in over time or a line of -- a good line of sight on investments going out many, many years, not 1 year or 2 years but more than that. And we're focused right now on the development side to create that pool of assets, either the assets I have on the ground right now or a line of sight on CapEx for multiple years. And that's where we're putting our time and energy. And over time, we'll clarify our thinking on MLP, but it's too early right now. We just don't have the scale on our view.","Andrew Levi","Okay. But I guess it's something that you're working towards, I guess is what's fair...","David E. Meador","Yes, where we're working towards and putting, as I've indicated, our shoulder into is the development side. And that's where we're putting all our time and energy and resources to see how we can grow this business and grow it in a high-quality way as we've done in other segments that we've -- it's just not earnings growth for earnings growth's sake. We're still trying to stick to our discipline and making sure we have high-quality returns.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to our follow-up question from Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I apologize if you commented on this and I missed it. But there were several media reports earlier this week indicating that you'd all reached a deal to sell refined coal to Wisconsin Energy. Would that represent the placement of your eighth REF unit? Are you able to comment on that at all?","David E. Meador","Normally, we haven't been commenting on host sides because we're in the middle of placement and negotiation. So usually, I would say no. But they pulled an environmental permit. So it was disclosed, and that is the eighth unit. And we're working on the ninth unit that we hope to have placed and up and running in early 2014.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And what would be the timing on the operations of that eighth unit?","Daniel G. Brudzynski","Like spring.","David E. Meador","Normally, it's a 4- to 6-month period to construct, relocate and then get it up, test it and up and running. But this is all in line with not only next year's guidance but our longer-term guidance that we provided for that segment. So these relocations are happening on the right time line with the right tons of coal host locations. So everything is on track there.","Operator","And our final question today will come from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","My questions have been answered.","Daniel G. Brudzynski","Good. Thank you.","David E. Meador","Okay, well, great. And thank you, everybody, for joining us. And again, for those of you that will not be at EEI, you can get the webcast presentation on November 12 at 11:15 through our website.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Anastasia Minor. Please go ahead.","Anastasia Minor","Thank you, Dana and good morning everyone. Welcome to our 2014 year end earnings call. Before we get started, I would like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 of our presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation.","With us this morning are Gerry Anderson, our Chairman and CEO and Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO. We also have members of our management team with us to call on during the Q&A session.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to Gerry to start our update this morning.","Gerry Anderson","Well, thanks Anastasia and good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us. I think I am going to be able to give you a very positive assessment both of what we accomplished this past year and what we feel we are positioned to deliver this year in 2015. So, the agenda for the call is laid out on Slide 4. I am going to begin with a look back on the past year and then I will provide a summary of energy policy developments both in Michigan and in Washington. And I will wrap up my comments by taking it through a long-term growth update and then I will turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to provide a financial update and some closing thoughts.","So, I am going to frame my look back on 2014 within DTE Energy\u2019s system of priorities and those priorities are laid out on Slide 5. Those of you who have been on this call in recent years should recognize this system of properties. It does describe the way we think about our company and the way we run our company. And I will take you through it briefly just to re-familiarize you.","So, we start things with our employees and this is a core focus for the company with a simple common sense that it\u2019s hard to create a great company, if your culture and the energy of your people isn\u2019t great. If you get that right, you can translate that into great customer service and to great continuous improvement and management of your costs and you can also translate it into people who are willing to work hard to grow your company. And if you get those right, then I think great customer service and good management of cost and growth that plays into, for example, the State of Michigan\u2019s economic development agenda. I give you a good chance to shape a political and regulatory context that\u2019s constructive for the company. And if you combine a constructive regulatory context with a good growth strategy, we have a chance to produce really strong outcomes for you. And for us, that means consistent, predictable 5% to 6% or more annual earnings growth combined with an attractive dividend and a strong balance sheet.","So, let me take you through the results around each of these priorities in the next few slides beginning on Slide 6 as a way of looking back on this past year\u2019s accomplishments. Starting with our employees, so we ranked in the top decile of Gallup\u2019s Employee Engagement Survey, Gallup does this all over the globe. And we entered the top decile for the first time in our company\u2019s history. And I know at our year end Christmas party this past year, I picked out a couple of things that I was proudest of from 2014 and this was one of the two, because I think it\u2019s a big deal for us to continue the sort of performance that we have had over the past 6 years. We also learned our second consecutive Gallup Great Workplace award. We were top quartile for the second year in a row in our industry with safety results. And we also have the National Safety Council rank us in the top 5% of 672 companies that they work with nationally and they really look at safety culture. So, I think this was another important outcome for us.","On the continuous improvement front, interestingly the Project Management Institute, which is another one of these large global institutes, named DTE one of three finalists for their Global Project Management award. So, I can tell you that we haven\u2019t always been this way. In fact, 6 or 8 years ago I could remember our first ranking on their zero to 5 scale and we have ranked a zero. And it was at that point that we challenged our people to turn our ability to manage large projects into a world-class process and they have worked on it hard since then and interesting to see them start at zero and end up as the finalist for top in the \u2013 top of the list so to speak. This continuous improvement of mindset is translating to our O&M expense was again \u2013 our expenses this past year were flat to 2008 levels. It really comes through a lot of CI work around the company. And so that ranks us again among the top of the peer group in our industry in O&M reductions.","On the customer satisfaction front, we had some good news this past year. Our gas business ranked number one for both residential and business customer satisfaction. And both of those are firsts for our company, first time ever that we have been of the list. We have been targeting this very explicitly with our employees, so it\u2019s great to achieve it. Our electric residential satisfaction is now third in our peer group. And we are pretty clear with our employees that we want to take that to where the gas business is. What we need to do get it there is primarily to invest in strengthening our electric system, reliability is our primary gap to the top one in that satisfaction survey. So we are therefore investing in reliability.","Moving to Slide 7, on a political and regulatory front I really do feel there is positive momentum on Michigan\u2019s energy policy, I will discuss that here in a few minutes, so I won\u2019t dwell on it now. We did this past year file our first electric rate case in 4 years that will play out here in 2015. We have reduced average customer rates last year by 6% in January of \u201814. We have reduced rates another 6% actually in January of \u201915. So that\u2019s a good thing to have rates going down. And then we had Michigan spend, that spend with Michigan suppliers say $900 million, actually we just closed the books on the numbers $922 million. We started some years back in 2010 at about half that level, it\u2019s been a great way for us to play into the economic development and job creation agenda of the state.","On the growth front, we invested over $2 billion this past year, more than double our depreciation levels. We had $1.8 billion in the utilities. One of our significant projects was the Echo Wind Park that was 12 megawatt wind part that pushed us right to our 10% on the renewable portfolio standard here in the state. We made fundamental progress on the NEXUS Pipeline. I will discuss that in more detail here in a few minutes, very active around the Bluestone Pipeline in Pennsylvania, that was a significant area of investment last year and it will be this year as well. We relocated our eighth REF unit and we have the ninth one on underway and should be able to bring that online this year.","On the financial front, our operating EPS came in at $4.60, our revised guidance late last year was $4.52, so we came in at the high end of our guidance range. We began last year with guidance of $4.30, so we cleared that by a pretty healthy margin. We did earn our allowed ROE at both our gas and electric utilities and our total shareholder return for the 1 year, 3 year and 5 year timeframes were all top quartile and we were able to increase the dividend 5.3% as well. So, I look back on that I feel we have a great year in 2014. And I also feel great about the way that we are positioned for 2015.","So moving on to Slide 8, I am now going to turn to an update on energy policy both in Michigan and Washington and I will start that look on Slide 9. And I just want to begin by saying that Michigan continues to have what I consider to be a sound balanced political and regulatory context. I think the state is working hard to behave that way, to behave in a way that\u2019s productive for growth and productive for business. In addition to their normal workload, several of our public service commissioners are giving a significant amount of time to helping the state conceptualize good future energy policy.","So for example, Chairman Quackenbush, he is an important advisor to the Governor and the Governor\u2019s team, as they think through policy options. And as for Governor Snyder, he made it clear that updating energy policy is an important legislative priority for him this year. He called out the need for new legislation in his State of the state address. And in doing that he highlighted the significant transformation in generation sources that our state will undertake over the next 10 years to 15 years. And as is his nature, Governor Snyder has carefully studied energy issues. He has given a lot of thought to future energy policy in our state. And so I feel fortunate to have him leading as we shape policy that\u2019s really going to carry Michigan through an important period of evolution in the state\u2019s energy sector.","We also have good leadership in both of the House and the Senate policy. And so, I will move to Slide 10 to talk about some of the players. Senator Mike Nofs, pictured on the left there, is an extremely seasoned hand when it comes to energy policy. Mike chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee. He was one of the principal architects of Michigan\u2019s 2008 Energy Legislation. He was in the House then, but Senator Nofs thoroughly understands the issues facing our state and the policies that we need to address them.","Representative Aric Nesbitt is also a very knowledgeable and experienced leader on energy issues. Aric chairs the House Energy Policy Committee. He did that last term as well. So, he is well up the curve, and I am confident that he also thoroughly understands the future energy policy needs of our state. And finally, Governor Snyder recently appointed Valerie Brader to head the newly formed Agency on Energy. The governor formed a new agency to better coordinate the various parts of the state government involved in developing and executing energy policy. And Valerie is a trusted and very confident aid to the governor, and I think very good choice for this role. She has been very close to energy issues through the governor\u2019s first term and that continues into his second term. So bottom line, as we head into a really important energy policy and set of energy legislation deliberations this year, we have a really good group of leaders working the issue. And I think that bodes very well for constructive legislation as an outcome.","Now in terms of the nature of the legislation, fundamentally our state needs to do two things, and I think this will be the focus of legislation. First, we need to address the remaining retail access in the Michigan market. And I think that all of the principal players in the discussion understand that clearly. And second, we need to establish a well-defined process for defining and approving the many investments that our state will make over the next 15 years to update and transform our power plant fleet. So we are really going to need a process for thinking through the right portfolio mix, approving those investments, being flexible to change the investment slate and redefine it as we \u2013 as new knowledge comes on board and so forth. That process has not defined for the state simply because we haven\u2019t been through a transformation of the scale in a long, long time, and so we need put that in place. And I also think the policymakers understand and have their eye on that.","Now the power plant fleet transformation that I described is laid out on Slide 11. That transformation, of course, is driven by EPA\u2019s 111(d) Regulation. That regulation will be finalized late summer this year. I am spending a lot of time in Washington, trying to ensure that principally the final regulation is workable in terms of its reliability impacts, and its impacts on customer rates. And both of these issues are really a question of pace not the ultimate endpoint. And I do sense that the EPA and administration are listening to input on this front. So I am hopeful that we can have the regulation brought to a point that works for companies like ours.","For Michigan, as you can see on the right hand side of the slide, 111(d) will lead to a significant shift away from fall to a much heavier share of gas and renewables. And this mix shift will require an investment in our state on the order of $15 billion, a $7 billion to $8 billion of that will be by DTE Energy and thus the need for updated energy policy in the state. It\u2019s a big transformation, akin to what happened back in the 1970s and 80s.","So, moving on to Slide 12, I am now going to shift gears and provide an update on our long-term growth and investment prospects and I will start that discussion on Slide 13. Now, as I mentioned earlier, we had a strong finish to 2014. Our earnings finished at $4.60 a share, up about 12.5% over the prior year. Peter is going to give you more color on this in a minute, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that every one of our business units turned in a strong performance this past year. Back in the fall of 2014, we provided an early outlook EPS guidance for this year of $4.55. We are now increasing that guidance to $4.60. Again, Peter will give you more depth on that new guidance in a minute, but one way to look at it is that our guidance implies that the weather and trading upside that we saw in 2014 will now be internalized into core long-term growth in 2015.","We also continued our dividend growth in 2014. As you see at the bottom of the slide, we have consistently said that as we grow our earnings, we intend to grow our dividend in parallel. And that\u2019s certainly still the plan. As you know, our stated goal for many years has been to grow our EPS and our dividend at 5% to 6% per year in a highly predictable and highly reliable fashion. Our actual earnings growth as you can see at the top right of the slide has been higher than that it\u2019s been closer to 7%. And I think we are in a position to continue this strong earnings growth, which is where I want to turn my attention to now.","So, as you can see on Slide 14, we are going to be pursuing a very full investment agenda over the next 5 years. Capital expenditures from 2015 to 2019 are projected to average $2.3 billion a year, which is by far the highest 5-year average in DTE Energy\u2019s history. Our projected capital expenditures for this year $2.6 billion is also a record level. We have never been actually near the level. So, we are clearly in the heart of a heavy capital investment era at the company.","And as you can see from the graphic, each of our four growth businesses is going to contribute to this investment in growth. The heaviest investment both this year and over the next five will be in our electric business. And contributing to net investment this year is our acquisition of the 700 megawatt gas-fired Renaissance power plant. We closed that acquisition in January. We also do have a second RFP out for another gas-fired plant. We do expect to act on that this year as well. As we make those investments in our utilities, we are intensely focused on keeping the rate impacts modest. I think we believe as a company that it will be those companies who manage the rate impacts of a heavy investment era well that will emerge as the winners for shareholders. So, we are very focused on managing the rate impacts.","On Slide 15, clearly, these investments plus general inflation put upward pressure on rates, but we have a number of factors at work that are offsetting that upward pressure. So, in addition to the continuous improvement in cost management that I discussed earlier, there are over $600 million in surcharges that have rolled off in our electric business over the past 2 years. And as a result, we are able to lower average rates by 6% last January and by 6% again this January. In addition, we have been working with our legislature and Commission on revised business cost of service rates. And the result of both the rate reductions and that work is that many of our large energy intensive companies will see rate reductions of 15% to 20% between 2013 and 2015.","We did file our first electric rate case in 4 years in December of last year. And I think we are just pleased that this rate increase request will be playing out within a broader context of falling rates as I just described. In our gas utility, our gas main renewal and meter replacement programs are covered by an infrastructure recovery mechanism. And as a result of that, we don\u2019t expect to need to file a gas rate case until 2016 or 2017.","So, turning now from our utilities to our non-utility businesses, one area of continued significant investment in growth is our gas storage and pipeline business and Slide 16 lays out the footprint of that business. Our current footprint extends essentially from Chicago to New York City. The Millennium pipeline, the Bluestone pipeline and the Bluestone gathering system, which are on the eastern end of this footprint, were areas of significant investment activity for us this past year driven by drilling in the Marcellus Shale and we do expect that to continue this year. Our gathering activity, for example, will be kind of full throttle. However, I want to focus my comments today on two assets on the Western end of the footprint, the proposed NEXUS pipeline and the Vector pipeline. Vector transports gas between Chicago and the Michigan and Ontario markets.","Moving on to Slide 17, we made a lot of progress over the past year in developing the NEXUS pipeline. I just want to review a little bit of that with you. So, agreements were executed with LDCs and several producers in the Utica region that underpin the pipe and those agreements put us in a position to move forward and we are moving forward. We recently wrapped up a supplemental open season. That open season focused on interest shippers were expressing in additional receipt points. So, for example, receipt points upstream of Kensington Ohio on Texas Eastern. We were also responding to interest in potential laterals from NEXUS to additional load that the pipe might serve. We also over the past year completed interconnect agreements for NEXUS with key pipelines, including Vector, including the DTE system among them.","And then finally and more recently, we submitted our pre-filing. We have engaged an EPC contractor that was announced yesterday. Fluor will play that role. And we are right in the middle of public outreach activities, those are well underway too. So, given all of that, we now have serious engineering work on the pipe underway and we expect to have the bulk of that engineering completed by the fall of this year and we expect our final FERC application this fall as well.","Now, with respect to Vector, many of you are aware that we recently wrapped up an open season for that pipe as well. And I am pleased with the results. Both NEXUS and the Rover pipeline signed 15 plus year long-term agreements with Vector. And those agreements put the pipe on strong financial footing for the foreseeable future. A number of the existing shippers on Vector did not renew capacity commitments. So, we did not in the end need to expand the pipe to accommodate NEXUS and Rover. So, I think if you look forward, the growth and expansion of the Vector pipeline over time is now linked to the growth and expansions of NEXUS, Rover and generally to supply from the Utica shale region. And given that, that supply is expected to \u2013 by almost everybody who has looked at it expected to expand at a rapid pace, we would think that Vector will benefit from that.","Moving on to Slide 18, you see laid out here are the earnings expectations for the gas storage and pipeline business. Earnings were $82 million this past year. We are targeting $145 million by 2019. Anything showed in color is earnings that we feel we have locked in with existing projects and assets. We do have $10 million there for additional development, but that\u2019s not a very big bogie over a 5-year period. So, we hope we can do at least that if not better. You can see that the pipeline platform is slated to more than double over the next 5 years. The gathering platform doubles as well. We have a little bit of shrinkage in the storage platform. That\u2019s what the forwards show, although I must say that I think as all the various changes in the gas markets play out, I am hopeful for storage, but we market to the forwards.","I am going to turn now to our power and industrial business on Slide 19. We are active in three lines of business in this unit. One of those is industrial energy services, where we provide on-site services for large industrials and other large users of energy. In that business line, we have several cogeneration projects that are currently under development. We brought one online this past year. We have several more in development, one sizable one that\u2019s late stage. So, we expect that to be a good area of growth for this business line in the years ahead.","In the renewable arena, we operate wood-fired and landfill gas-fired power plants. Growth here will come from expanded output at existing assets. So, for example, we had a plant last year that was brought outline at a partial year. And since the full year performance will expand earnings, we also brought on several large landfill gas sites this year. So, it\u2019s that sort of organic growth that\u2019s growing this line of business. Finally, reduced emission fuels, where we reduce emissions from coal-fired plants. We brought on the eighth unit last year. The ninth unit is in late stage negotiations. We expect to have that plant operating by mid year 2015.","And on Slide 20, you see the earnings expectations for the power and industrial business. So, P&I earned $90 million this past year. We expect it to grow to $145 million projected at $90 million to $100 million this year growing to $145 million. Again, anything you see in solid colors, are projects that we have in hand. So, we expect that, that growth will come. We do have a $20 million new development bogie that would be filled by things like cogeneration projects that I mentioned earlier. So, we feel good about achieving this as well.","So, that wraps up my comments. And I am going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak now for a financial update. Peter, over to you?","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Gerry and good morning to everyone. Everyone who dialed in on a regular basis to this call knows, I would like to give a quick shot out to our Detroit Tigers, I feel compelled to do that here. Actually one week, exactly one week wake aways, saw spring training starts, so no Bowl predictions, cautiously optimistic and we will provide an update for early season update in the first quarter call. So, with that sort of commercial break, I would like to start with our financial update and our year end results in Slide 22.","As Gerry mentioned earlier, DTE Energy\u2019s 2014 operating earnings were $4.60 per share. For detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, please refer to the appendix, Slide 32. The appendix also includes a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings. Slide 22 shows our year-over-year operating earnings by segment. I will focus on the middle column which is the 2014 results.","Let me start first with the total earnings for our growth segments. 2014 operating earnings of $796 million were up $73 million or $0.37 per share. Our largest subsidiary, DTE Electric earned $528 million and was up $44 million over last year driven by our revenue decoupling amortization in the first half of the year and lower O&M expenses driven by reduced benefit cost and lean actions taken in the second half of the year. 2014 was a great year for electric utility given the weather-related challenges it faced. It was also the final year of a 4-year rate case payout strategy. DTE Gas 2014 earnings of $140 million were just below 2013 earnings as colder winter weather was more than offset by higher O&M expenses, including reinvestment. The appendix contains detailed year-over-year earning walks for our two utilities.","Moving down the page, our gas storage and pipeline earnings of $82 million were $12 million higher than 2013. This increase was driven by higher short-term weather-related storage earnings and also continued growth in our pipeline and gathering earnings. Earnings for the year and the segment were partially offset by the ongoing impact of the accounting change related to one of our pipeline investments. Earnings for our power and industrial project segments of $90 million were up $20 million from 2013. This increase was driven primarily by higher reduced emissions fuel earnings. They were mainly one-time in nature. In total, operating earnings for our growth segments were $4.48 per share, up 9% from $4.11 per share in 2013.","Overall, 2014 was a great year for growth segment. To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our energy trading business. At energy trading, 2014 earnings were $20 million, up from a $3 million loss in 2013, driven by the accounting recognition of the strong economic performance. The economic contribution for 2014 was over double our targeted annual level of $20 million to $25 million and that incremental performance flow through the accounting results. Slide 38 of the appendix contains our standard energy trading reconciliation showing both economic and accounting performance.","Now, let me move the discussion ahead of this year in Slide 23. As Gerry mentioned, we are raising our guidance midpoint for $4.55 per share to $4.60 per share. Slide 23 shows our updated operating earnings guidance for the 2015 by segment. We have a comparison here of our 2015 guidance the far right column compared to the 2015 early outlook, which is in the middle. I am going to focus on where we have a green arrow on the page. The increasing guidance is mainly driven by our non-utilities. We are slightly increasing our gas storage and pipeline guidance range based on higher expected earnings for the pipeline business. And we are increasing the guidance range for our power and industrial projects segments by $5 million for strong performance in the renewables businesses.","So, earnings overall for our growth segments are expected to increase from $4.48 per share to $4.60. This represents a 5.5% growth when you factor weather normalization. You see near the bottom of the page, our comment of lower share issuance in 2015. Right now, we are targeting $200 million of equity issuance this year, which is a $100 million lower than it was assumed in our early outlook. The driver of this change is a combination of strong 2014 cash and the recent extension of bonus depreciation. So, the average shares outstanding for updated 2015 guidance is slightly lower than our early outlook. Both numbers round to 197 million shares.","I just mentioned that the 2015 $4.50 EPS midpoint of guidance represents a 5.5% growth when 2014 weather is normalized and the next page Slide 24 lays out this comparison. The left side of the chart starts with 2014 actual growth segment results, then walks to the 2015 midpoint, including the change for weather. As you all know, 2014 was one of the coldest winters on record providing favorability at our gas utility. This weather impact was a positive $0.12 for 2014. You can see in the next two columns that the growth year-over-year consists of $0.20 per share at the utilities and $0.04 per share at our non-utilities. Earlier I mentioned, strong 2014 cash flows and we can see this on Slide 25.","In 2014, our cash from operations was $1.8 billion, down from 2013 levels, but $200 million higher than our original 2014 guidance. The decrease year-over-year was primarily driven by lower surcharge collections and higher purchase power costs at DTE Electric. Capital spending was higher in 2014 due to increased investment in our DTE Electric. Overall, free cash flow was down from 2013, but $400 million higher than original guidance.","Looking forward to this year, Slide 26 provides our cash flow guidance for 2015. We see lower cash from operations this year driven by the elimination of our securitization bond surcharge. The 15-year securitization bonds that facilitate the recovery of our then nuclear plant assets are now fully recovered. On average, our electric customers saw a 6% decrease in the rates in the month of January. We look to significantly increase capital expenditures in 2015 due to increased generation investment at the utilities and growth projects at our non-utility businesses. Earlier Gerry described our investment in DTE Electric, as we move to transition our generation from coal to natural gas renewables. In 2015, we are making investments in natural gas generation to shore up our summer capacity shortfall. The strong 2014 cash flow performance has set us up nicely for 2015.","And on the next Slide 27, you can see that our balance sheet remains strong with leverage and FFO metrics at or above targets. We plan to continue our focus on balance sheet strength in 2015. We did achieve our target of zero equity issuance in 2014. And as I mentioned previously, we are targeting $200 million of equity issuance in 2015, down from the $300 million in our early outlook. We look to issue $800 million to $900 million of equity over the next 2-year period, 2015 to 2017 of the swing most likely with the pace and timing of investment in our non-utility businesses. Issuing debt over the last few years in this historically low interest rate environment has been great for the financial results and our utility customers. With the refinancing done in this low interest rate environment we have saved more than $100 million of annualized interest expense since 2010.","I know everyone wants to get to the Q&A portion of the call, so to let me wrap up on Slide 29 and then we will take your questions. 2014 was a very good year and we are well-positioned to have a successful 2015. DTE has delivered on its growth targets over the years, actually exceeding our targets. We provided nearly 7% annual EPS growth over the last 5 years. Our 2015 EPS guidance provides a 5.5% growth over 2014 segments after adjusting for unusually cold weather in 2014.","Part of our shareholder value equation is to continue to grow our earned dividend with earnings. Our EPS growth coupled with our dividend has historically delivered total shareholder return above utility indices. As we laid out for you at EEI and now in this call, we have meaningful investment opportunities within our two utilities our gas midstream businesses and power and industrial projects business. Collectively these businesses will continue to have a clear line of sight of growth opportunities in front of them.","Our energy growth which is the bulk of our growth over the next 5 years, our utility growth I mean is occurring in a growing Michigan economy and constructive regulatory and legislative environment. We know we have to earn this constructive environment everyday. Our work on operational excellence, cost management and customer satisfaction will do good things for our customers and help to make sure we keep that constructive regulation.","So with that I will wrap it up. And thank you for joining us this morning. And Dana will now be open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning, it\u2019s Julien here actually.","Gerry Anderson","Hey Julien.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning. So I was particularly intrigued by your comments around full throttle if you will, can you expand on that little bit both with respect to kind of near-term opportunities, I mean how robust is that, what kind of upside versus what you have disclosed do you kind of see and then as you think about building out this business, I mean what are we talking about vis-\u00e0-vis your partnership and the ability to take that elsewhere was that also what you were getting at in that comment?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, that was a comment around our gathering activities and what I meant to imply was our work with Southwestern around Bluestone last year was I would just say extremely busy. They \u2013 as they disclosed on their calls really are focusing capital there because it\u2019s a good place for them to earn returns. And as they focus their drilling there we need to \u2013 we are between them and the market. So we are extremely busy this past year. I will tell you that maybe the most important continuous improvement project we had in our company this year was driving down gathering costs for Southwestern and becoming best in industry, yet undertaking that, because your ability to earn additional opportunities with gatherers is driven by how well you do it and never being in their way in terms of getting to market and just being consistent. We did as you know I think expand our agreement with them. So that will be leading to other activity with them in that region in expanded geographies, so that\u2019s going to keep us busy for the next couple of years. And we do in that business line have an explicit goal to take the skill set that we have developed in Michigan and are working there in Pennsylvania to places like the Utica Shale and more broadly in the Marcellus Shale. So that\u2019s probably what I was getting at.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And then just talking a little bit turning a little bit to Vector here I mean what\u2019s the timeline here for getting a little bit more of an update, I suppose in some sense I was looking for data points sooner, I suppose the question is you alluded to the opportunities with NEXUS and Rover when do we find out about those kind of at a higher level?","Gerry Anderson","I mean future growth opportunities or the way I would characterize it is that the agreements that were signed with NEXUS and Rover if you were to look at the earnings growth guidance that we have provided, those agreements fully supported the guidance that we have out there and what we need from Vector to fulfill those. I think the future growth of Vector really now comes as NEXUS and Rover mature and as volumes grow in the Utica, if you look at anybody\u2019s projections of the Utica, they are going to see aggressive growth there and we fully expect that those volumes to go both north and south and to the mid-Atlantic, but a healthy portion will find their way north, because they are good markets. And I recently have had a good basis differential. So, we would expect as the overall volumes of the region grow, we will get our portion of those and that\u2019s really what will drive Vector\u2019s growth. In terms of timeframe, most of the projections you see of that growth on Vector happen pretty \u2013 that growth in the Utica happen at a pretty aggressive pace over the next 5 years. So, we don\u2019t have anything firm now, but we would expect as that growth comes, the Vector should benefit.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Yes, absolutely. And then just in terms of P&I, the renewable segment, if you could comment briefly here, just when you are thinking about just \u201815 versus \u201814, what\u2019s kind of the shift there? I know it\u2019s a specific question here, but it seems like kind of a nice improvement there.","Peter Oleksiak","Hey, Julien, this is Peter. The increase in earnings year-over-year in renewables in that sub-segment is related to the ramp up that we have been describing these wood waste generating plants. We have a few of them, actually all of them in service right now, so few of them are ramping up, we are going to see sizable increase year-over-year on that. And also we have some new biomass projects that were coming online.","Gerry Anderson","We had a couple of large projects in California and one in North Carolina, large for landfill gas. Landfill gas projects in general are not huge, but these are in the 10 megawatt to 20 megawatt sort of range and that\u2019s pretty big for those. So, those are adding as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. Well, thank you guys for the time.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers","Hey, good morning guys. Gerry, I guess just first on kind of the Michigan legislation in that process you are looking for, can you maybe give what you think the timelines going to be between the Governor\u2019s March speech and when we start to see formation of legislation and when it could be taken to vote and how important, I guess associated with that is, how important is going to be the EPA rules on carbon to help initiate and shape that legislation?","Gerry Anderson","Well, I think just to start with where you ended that have legislators and policymakers who haven\u2019t been closely watching energy are being educated on the EPA regulation, it\u2019s timeframe and how big a deal it is? It\u2019s not like a big deal for our state, it\u2019s every state, but beginning to understand what a big deal it is for Michigan, but in addition to that, Dan, my service come out with its capacity projections for the Midwest, the upper portion of MISO. And the place where there is a capacity shortfall is Michigan. And MISO is projected at 3 gigawatts in Michigan. So, in addition to the EPA actions, Michigan needs to act, because it has a capacity shortage in 2016. And not surprisingly, the amount of that capacity short is pretty much one-to-one with what the retail access load or choice load in the state is, because we and consumers are building for our customers and nobody is planning for or building for those retail access customers. So, that\u2019s come into the lens as well that the state needs to act to address that capacity shortfall in 2016. And it needs to be clear about who is responsible for that. So, that\u2019s a timing driver too and I think has got a lot of people realizing that we can\u2019t wait on the EPA.","Even EPA, if you think about it, we need to move now to have the processes in place, because this EPA regulation finalizes late summer. We have probably 2 years then to submit plans. And the fact that you are submitting plans means that you have been through some process, where you believe that you come to agreement with stakeholders to actually build what you have in your plant. Well, there is a lot that needs to happen over the next couple years to come to agreement on big capital expenditures to pull that off. Everything that we build takes 3 to 5 years and the EPA has an interim compliance date of 2020. That comes a couple of years after we will have put our plans together. So, anybody who thinks about this very long realizes that most companies are already \u2013 should already feel like they are up against it in terms of timing. And that\u2019s true in Michigan as well.","And I think the folks who have spent some time with energy are beginning to realize that there is no luxury of additional time we need to act. So, I think all of that is coming together to drive the timing of this Dan and that\u2019s positive. What I expect is that the governor will give a address here in March. It was actually a roads ballot initiative to raise money to fix the roads here that will occupy a lot of folks in the political arena in the early part of the year that will play through. And then I think both the Governor and legislative leaders have said that that energy becomes a principal priority, numerous people have spoken about trying to knock it off by mid-year. So we would expect that there will be a pretty pointed discussion in the second quarter, about where to take energy policy.","Dan Eggers","Thank you for that. And I guess Gerry just kind of on that $7 billion to $8 billion of 111(d) related spending did you guys see it. With the rules coming this summer and relatively tight timelines when do you think that starts creeping into the CapEx program and starts eking its way onto the EPS growth rate slides?","Gerry Anderson","Well, we are seeing the first - kind of the first Echo\u2019s of that whole thing right now is we are buying existing power plants that\u2019s responding to capacity shortages in the near-term but its also beginning to position the fleet longer-term. In terms of new assets we could see some renewable build I think continuously between now and 2020 with larger projects beginning to show up in the late-teens and early-20s, those would be the combined cycle units. So our hope would be to spread this out over time as much as possible and not point load it, so that we can really manage customer rate increases in a ratable way. So I would expect that once we become a bit clearer on state policy we are going to begin to step our way into this.","Dan Eggers","So we should be looking maybe over the next year or so to seeing that CapEx number have to raise just as you guys flush out how quickly you have to respond?","Gerry Anderson","I think we can be clearer on the sorts of assets that we will be investing in the timeframe once we get a plan put in place and a clear framework for that. And I do expect that if I look forward over the 5-year planning period that we will start pushing investments in to respond to this. The renewables you can move pretty quickly. The combined cycles as you know to permit and engineer and so forth take longer. So we couldn\u2019t get those out until probably the late teens and earliest into the early-20s. But we will \u2013 that\u2019s the timeframe we are targeting.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Thank you guys.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks Dan.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore Investment Banking.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. So I missed beginning of the call, I apologize, so if I am repeating something that you answered already forgive me. So can you quantify that this dovetails what you were just talking about and if you can quantify what the impact might be on your capital plan if you were therefore necessitated to pick up your pro rata share of the capacity shortfall?","Peter Oleksiak","The choice \u2013 Greg, this is Peter. The way to think about it our choice shortfall is about 900 megawatts. And we will take some short-term actions that comes back quickly, but long-term we will be feathering that into our long-term planning and base load generation.","Gerry Anderson","To put it in a different way, as I said in my comments we don\u2019t have a policy that makes it clear who is responsible for that roughly 1,000 megawatts. If that responsibility comes to us then we can\u2019t do anything in terms of long-term assets in a short timeframe. So we will have to scramble to put together short-term solution, but it would mean that we would be building 900 more megawatts of some combination of renewable peaking and combined cycle assets. We don\u2019t know the exact mix of that, but it would be roughly a 1,00 megawatts of additional construction that we would undertake.","Greg Gordon","Now, that was precisely my question. Thank you. Take care.","Gerry Anderson","You bet.","Operator","And we will go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matt Tucker","Good morning. Congrats on a great year.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning Matt.","Matt Tucker","First question on vector, could you comment on any expected earnings uplift or degradation as you transition to the new contracts from the old ones?","Peter Oleksiak","No, the way this worked out is really nice for Vector. The expiring contracts have now been completely filled with the new volumes coming from Nexus to Rover. And as Gerry mentioned earlier it\u2019s really nice with our earnings guidance and planning for Vector. And it sets up Vector nicely for future expansion. Now that it\u2019s refilled.","Matt Tucker","Thanks Peter.","Gerry Anderson","So to put it differently, no degradation and right on our plan.","Matt Tucker","Perfect. And then a couple on NEXUS, if you could just comment on the expected partnership structure, I noticed your contractor Fluor\u2019s press release has mentioned you and Spectra as the lead sponsors? And also with respect to the potential expansion, I am just curious if you are in \u2013 if you\u2019d say you are in active discussions even today on the possible expansion of NEXUS","Gerry Anderson","So, let me start with the last question. What I would characterize on the additional open season is that at DTE and I think Spectra is very similar. We like to have 80% plus of the pipe contracted with firm contracts before we head into the engineering and construction. And with the initial open season and the work we did this past year, we achieved that, so we are moving ahead. But on any of these pipelines, the process then of expanding take really happens continuously right through the day you start the pipe. And so as our pipe has become more real and people realize we are moving ahead with it, people then begin to say well, maybe we got to look at attachments. So, we \u2013 as I mentioned in my comments, we got interest in additional load upstream of the pipe, upstream from Kensington. We also have load points along the path of the pipe that realize they could build out modest laterals and use the pipe for things that work for them. So, those are the sorts of things that are coming in. And as we think about the pipe, we are really trying now to evaluate and finalize the ultimate capacity of the pipe. And the work we are doing with these additional expressions of interest is going to help us clarify just what final capacity we want for the pipe and so forth. So, I hope that helps. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s so much an expansion as it is trying to land on the capacity we built for the pipe and build additional support to undergird it.","Matt Tucker","Thanks. And if you could just comment on the expected partnership structure?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, yes. I am sorry I forgot the first part. So, our number is still assumed that we are a third and Enbridge continues to work through. So, they have signed on to take capacity from the pipe, but I think they have this still in their capital allocation decision-making queue. And we consistently say we would love to have him on as a partner, but we and Spectra stand ready to take the project 50-50 if they decide they want to put their investments into other opportunities at the company. We don\u2019t have clarity on that yet that\u2019s really in their decision-making process.","Matt Tucker","Thanks. And just a final follow-up, given your long-term visibility on Vector has much improved and the visibility on the likelihood of NEXUS going forward is a lot better than at this time last year, does that impact your thinking at all about a potential MLP?","Gerry Anderson","I think our statements in that are probably similar that we have done a lot of work looking at MLPs and understand that the quality of an MLP is very proportionate through the scale of assets that you have available and the length of time that those assets could be deployed over. And you see radically different quality from companies who don\u2019t have much of a queue that they can utilize versus companies who have a long one. And the implied yields are extremely different. So, what we have concluded is that we really wouldn\u2019t want to move at a scale that implies a low-quality MLP. And if we choose to do this, it will be after we play out at least the plan that we kind of have in front of us right now.","Matt Tucker","Great. Thank you.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Just another question on Vector, it\u2019s great that you refilled the capacity that were from expiring contracts, but I am a little curious to hear a bit more feedback from them as to why some of the existing guys didn\u2019t renew and why we are not going to go forward with the expansion at least not now? Is that related to the pullback in gas over the past few months or any thoughts like that? And then on a related question, does that at all affect the potential for future Millennium expansions?","Peter Oleksiak","Andrew, this is Peter. The initial Vector pipeline you recall was really built to deliver gas from the west to the east. So, those additional foundational shippers that help underpin the economic stability in that pipe. It was really different basins in different purpose than today we are actually excited now to see that Vector has a role and purpose within the shale gas that\u2019s in our region. And it really will be more of a producer driven pipe with our producers within our region. So I think it played out nicely for us and really we feel the pipe and it\u2019s really a defined purpose now for Vector going forward.","Gerry Anderson","Just to add to Peter\u2019s comments back when Vector was build Canadian volumes floating to Chicago market and it was a pipe in many ways to take that gas into storage in Michigan and at Dawn. And you know what the dynamics of Canadian gas have been, they have changed pretty sharply. And so a number of the shippers and there were a couple of marketers in there as well who had capacity. That play just really wasn\u2019t there with the same strength it had in past, so that was behind their not renewing and as Peter said the pipe really flipped through the pipe it\u2019s now more focused on Utica. I do think it will be bidirectional so that Utica gas is going to be able to press its way into Illinois and Wisconsin markets and those are great markets as well as Michigan and Ontario.","Andrew Weisel","Great. And Millennium thoughts, they did potential expansion there and when we might see some updates timing wise?","Gerry Anderson","I think you asked whether there was any connection between the two, there really isn\u2019t Millennium interestingly was initially build as a pipe to take Michigan and Dawn storage to New York and the Northeast and it\u2019s been overwhelmed by Marcellus Shale dynamic. So it\u2019s now a bidirectional pipe that\u2019s all about Marcellus Shale. If we continue to expand that pipe as fast as we can because the volumes there are growing so heavily, the region is constrained for export capacity, you know that the Northeast is looking for more path so the discussions are very active about all of that.","Peter Oleksiak","There are some early conversations we are having with LDCs in the East Coast. So, if there is an expansion opportunity, it will be more in the \u201917, \u201918 timeframe.","Andrew Weisel","Great.","Gerry Anderson","Thanks for the question.","Andrew Weisel","One more if I can, a follow-up. The electric utility CapEx came down by about $130 million compared to the EII deck is that just related to the actual purchase price from Renaissance or are there any other changes to \u201915 of the longer-term outlook?","Peter Oleksiak","That was as we are refining our capital planning and this is what we always call \u2013 characterize it as an early outlook. There is the normal timing of it with some environmental related timing, generation related timing. It really was not related to the RFPs.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. ","Gerry Anderson","Good morning Jonathan.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning Jonathan.","Operator","And Jonathan please check your mute button, we are unable to hear you.","Jonathan Arnold","Sorry, is that better?","Operator","Yes, we can hear you, please go ahead sir.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. Good morning guys. I had noticed Gerry in the opening remarks you talked about your long-term growth goal of 5% to 6% and you have commented on the actual having being closer to 7% and then you said you were feeling confident about being able to continue with strong growth, are you \u2013 were you suggesting that you feel confident continuing to deliver about the range given the above largest CapEx plan you had in while etcetera, I was just want to make sure I didn\u2019t take that out of context?","Gerry Anderson","Well, I am happy to answer it. So you are right that whether you pick the start year 2008, 2009 the growth has been closer to 7%. And I think we have also been open with shareholders that internally we target higher than the 5% to 6% so that we are able to hit that with consistency. I have always said that if you target equals your plan that doesn\u2019t give you any ability to offset unexpected events. So we do target higher and our goal every year is to come in higher. And in recent years we have been able to do that. So I hope we can in the future, that\u2019s our goal, but we put the 5% to 6% out there because it\u2019s something we are absolutely committed to achieving with a higher degree of predictability. Does that answer it?","Jonathan Arnold","Yes, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our final question today from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Good morning, how are you?","Gerry Anderson","Very good.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning Paul.","Paul Patterson","I have \u2013 most of my questions have been answered, so just quickly on Rule 111(d) and just projected sales growth in general. As you know, the EPA sort of making a big deal about energy efficiency as being a big driver, and I was just wondering, a \u2013 what do you see sort of the normalized sales growth over the next few years? And also are there any opportunities for you guys to actually make money maybe deploying energy efficiency strategies or something for your customers and just sort of innovatively if you guys have gotten any sort of \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I know that\u2019s sort of \u2013 it\u2019s not necessarily traditional, but I just thought maybe you guys might be thinking about that?","Gerry Anderson","So, a couple of comments, it\u2019s clear from the way the EPA has handled energy efficiency. And if you are in the inner workings of the rule, it\u2019s really a carbon intensity target and they have put energy efficiency in the denominator. So, it actually behaves like megawatts. And what they are trying to do by doing that is encourage deployment. I think our state and our administration want to see good high-quality energy efficiency investments deployed in Michigan. So, I am certain that it will be a core part of our response plan and it\u2019s one of the ways frankly you can keep the rate impacts of this and the affordability impacts with customers more manageable. So, we are working hard to think about the right energy efficiency investments.","In terms of the impacts on growth, you have seen it around the country that it\u2019s muted, slowed and in some cases put a slight negative tilt on growth. In a lot of places that have been at this time a long time, it does flatten growth, which is a good thing, but it generally doesn\u2019t put it into some, I am talking electric now, it doesn\u2019t put it into a kind of a secular decline like you saw in the gas industry, where there were significant volume reductions over time. I don\u2019t expect that in the electric industry, because we keep adding electric end-use load and so the two are really offsetting each other. And so while we expect modest growth to flat growth in our electric demand, we don\u2019t expect decline. And so we think that we are going to be \u2013 the capacity we are expecting to build out is on the order of what we are dealing with now plus a bit. That could be impacted by things like automotive load shifting. If you get close to some of folks, the cafe standards, there is a lot of thought that as you get into the later years of the cafe standards, it\u2019s going to be hard to comply without shift of petroleum into electric. And if that happens, it really affects demand for electricity. So, all those sorts of things will affect it in the end. And I hope that answered your question?","Paul Patterson","It does. Just what \u2013 regards to flat growth, I mean, your service territory, what do you guys \u2013 could you quantify that a little bit in terms of what that sort of means in terms of just from your internal modeling kind of perspective?","Peter Oleksiak","We plan on about 0.5% growth in \u201815. We are forecasting now is 0.5% growth to 2014. So within that, I would say the underlying growth before energy efficiency is probably about a 1% higher, but we are counting on above 1% of efficiency in that.","Paul Patterson","Okay, thanks a lot.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","And gentlemen, I will turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Gerry Anderson","Well, look I will wrap up quickly just by saying that we feel great about 2014. I repeat what I said at the outset. I feel great about the way we are positioned for 2015 as well. So, as I said to our employees the other day, we have had about a half dozen years of really strong both performance and financial results here at the company and I feel good about making 2015 the seventh in the string. So, with that, we will close up look forward to talking with all of you and seeing you in the near future. Thanks for being on the call.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation."],"8147":["DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call July 25, 2018  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Barbara Tuckfield - IR","Gerry Anderson - Chairman and CEO","Jerry Norcia - President and COO","Peter Oleksiak - SVP and CFO","Analysts","Richie Ciciarelli - Guggenheim Partners","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the DTE Energy 2018 Q2 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Barbara Tuckfield. Please go ahead.","Barbara Tuckfield","Thank you, April, and good morning everyone. Before I get started, I would like to remind everyone to read the Safe Harbor statement on page two of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","With us this morning are Gerry Anderson, Chairman and CEO; Jerry Norcia, President and COO; and Peter Oleksiak, Senior Vice President and CFO. We also have members of management to call upon during the Q&A session.","And now I will turn it over to Gerry to start the call.","Gerry Anderson","Well, thank you, Barb, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. So this morning, I'm going to give you a recap of our performance for the second quarter and also share some thoughts on our long-term growth plan. And then I'll hand it over to Peter, who will provide a financial review and some additional color around our increased earnings guidance. And then, Jerry Norcia will wrap things up by providing more detail on the progress of both our utility and non-utility growth plans. And then, we will take your Q&A.","So, I'm going to start on slide five. I told you on the first quarter call that I feel good about our financial performance, and halfway through the year, I feel even better. To be honest, financially we are crushing it this year. And so, both utilities are right on track, and both GSP and P&I are having an exceptional year. And so, given this, we are increasing our 2018 EPS guidance midpoint by $0.35, or a full 6% to $6.13. And this new guidance implies growth of nearly 10% versus our actual in 2017.","Cash flows are also very strong. So we are increasing our cash flow guidance for the year by 200 million. And as Peter will discuss later, we expect this cash flow strength to reduce our equity issuances over the three-year period.","On the regulatory front, I'm encouraged as well. So, on the first quarter call we told you that our recent electric rate case was a bit low. Since then, on rehearing, the MPSC increased the case outcome by just a little more than 10 million. And that outcome also had important benefits for one of our local community. So, their decision was appreciated.","MPSC also recently approved our plan to move forward with a 1,100 megawatt combined cycle plant to help backfill some of the coal plant retirements that we have coming. We also recently filed a 1.7 billion renewal energy plant with the Public Service Commission, an investment that will help backfill the retiring coal plants and meet the 2021 RPS requirement that we have here in Michigan.","In July, we filed an electric rate case, and importantly that case includes an IRM provision, or an infrastructure recovery mechanism that we discussed extensively with the MPS in a series of meetings before the filing. And Jerry Norcia is going to give you more detail on that provision in a bit. And finally, our gas rate case will be finalized in September, and we expect the outcome in that case to be without surprises.","So moving on to slide six, I want to transition to a discussion of our future growth. So, both of our utilities are evaluating investments that would be additional to those in our current plan. So, in the electric utility, those investments are tied to voluntary renewable projects with large customers, and those discussions are progressing well with the customers. In the gas business, we filed a plan to further accelerate our gas main replacement program, and Jerry will give you additional color on both of these areas in a few minutes.","There is a lot going on at GSP related to future growth. So NEXUS construction is now 80% complete and progressing well. In fact, a group of us along with some board members flew to the pipeline route yesterday, and saw mostly dirt covering pipe, so that's a good sign.","On our Link asset, the DTE Board recently approved a $250 million gathering expansion investment for a key customer. And overall, the Link asset just continues to surprise to the upside. We also have four other laterals or expansion projects that are either under construction or have recently been completed. And Jerry will give you some further color on those in a little bit. Finally, we are evaluating acquisitions that are of a scale analogous to Link. And as we look at those, we will keep you abreast of the work in that area.","So P&I also has a lot on its plate relative to future growth. So, the Ford central energy plant that we recently closed is now in full-bore construction. We've also begun construction on an RNG or Renewable Natural Gas project in Wisconsin, and we sense that there are more projects like these two that I just mentioned that will be coming. So we expect to close an additional one to two cogen or RNG projects this year. And the development queue behind those projects continues to be very strong. And so given all of that, we now expect P&I's 2022 earnings to be materially above the $70 million that we have previously disclosed.","We also remain committed to our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate target over the five-year plan. So there's been some discussion about whether we can hit those targets out in 2022, so I want to spend a minute on that topic. And I'll address the topic from two vantage points; looking forward and looking back.","So let me start with the forward look. So there are a range of long-term EPS forecasts out there for us, and in our eyes a few of them are light. And for those who are light we see a few key themes. These forecasts tend to be light on future utility earnings, heavy on future holding company expenses, and heavy on future equity issuances versus our plan. And the combination of these factors account for the perceived shortfall.","I'll also say that our portfolio of growth opportunities feels better than it did even six or nine months ago. We continue to look for and find good investment opportunities, which has been a pattern for the company over the years. So that brings me to the second vantage point I mentioned earlier, and I'm moving on to slide seven now. The five-year forward growth targets that we have provided you over the years versus what we have actually achieved are shown on this slide. So, for example, if you look at the second set of bars from the left, seven years ago, in 2011, our targeted EPS growth rate implied an EPS level in 2016 of $4.64. We actually delivered five years later, in 2016, $5.28.","Similarly, in 2012 our five-year forward growth estimate for 2017 was $4.97. We ended up beating that last year by $0.62 or 12.5%. And based on the guidance update that we've given you this morning on this call, the 2018 EPS growth target that we provided to you back in 2013 looks pretty conservative now given that we expect to come in $0.90 higher or over 17% above what we told you we were targeting for this year five years back. So what's the point of this backward look? Well I have to tell you every one of those five-year projections that we gave you over the years felt challenging at the time. I can vouch for that. And every one of those five-year plans had some level of go-get in them, that is growth that we expected to play out and we're committed to finding but hadn't yet fully pinned down. And our pattern shows that we've been able to more than fill those future growth goals.","So as I look forward five years to 2022, things feel much the same. There are challenges in the plan. It wouldn't be a decent five-year plan if there weren't some challenges in it. But the challenges feel very analogous to those that we have not only met in the past but have materially beaten over the past decade. So I hope that's some hopeful perspective on our future growth. And of course we'll provide you a more detailed update on all of that later this year.","And with that, I'm going to turn things over to Peter for the financial update. Peter, over to you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Gerry, and good morning everyone. I'm going to start on slide nine. Before I get into the quarter I always like to give an update on my Detroit Tigers. While the Yankees, Red Sox, and Astros battle for the best record in the American League, after last night's loss to Kansas City, my Tigers are now 17 games below 500 and deep into the rebuilding process. On the positive side, my minor league prospects are looking good, including the number one draft pick, so there is a bright future ahead for my team. But it really can't come soon enough for me.","Now turning to our financial results, as some of them were positive, DTE is off to a great start this year. As Gerry mentioned, the first half-year came in very strong. We had operating earnings of $247 million or $1.36 per share. And for reference our reported earnings were $234 million or $1.29 per share. And you can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment including a reconciliation to GAAP-reported earnings in the appendix. Let's touch on each of the segments in detail starting with our utilities. We had very interesting weather during the quarter that provided some favorability of both utilities.","Our Gas utility experienced a very cold April, actually the second coldest April on record. And our Electric utility experienced warm weather in both May and June. In fact, May was the second warmest on record here in 2018. This weather was positive for both utilities, so a perfect utility quarter for us. To review the quarter-over-quarter earnings variance I will start with Electric utility. The DTE Electric earnings for the second quarter were $163 million, $15 million higher than the second quarter of last year, driven by new rate implementation and the warmer weather I just mentioned, partially offset by higher O&M expense and rate-based growth. A more detailed year-over-year earnings variance walks for DTE Electric to be found in the appendix.","DTE Gas operating earnings were $14 million, or $13 million higher than last year, driven primarily by the cooler April weather. The Gas Storage and Pipeline business, operating earnings were $60 in the second quarter, $20 million higher than last year. This increase is due to lower corporate tax rates, as well as increased gathering and transport volumes across the platforms, mainly at Bluestone.","Future growth that we anticipate at GSP is showing up earlier than we thought, and we're essentially seeing growth that we expected to play out next year roll into this year, which really solidifies earnings across this year and 2019. And the strong cash flows that go along with the earnings are going to help reduce equity needs for us.","Operating earnings for Power & Industrial business was 43 million to 13 million higher in the second quarter of last year. This increase is due in part to higher REF volumes, and our waste wood renewable plans performed better than last year. We have been saying that we continue to optimize our REF assets until they begin to sunset in 2020 and 2022. And then, we expect to see some earnings upside from these assets in the near-term. While these earnings upsides we are seeing results of first higher throughput at some our existing REF sites. We also moved some of our units to larger sites where they can handle higher volumes.","Now these incremental earnings can now be for monetized for accelerated cash flow. You will see these earnings for cash trade play out next year as we get tax equity partners for some of these projects. There is a strong growth in our non-utility this year. We have increased guidance at GSP and P&I which I will discuss on the next slide in a minute.","Rounding out our growth segments in the second quarter is Corporate & Other, which is at 9 million unfavorable compared to last year due to tax reform and higher interest expense. The Energy Trading had operating earnings of 8 million in the second quarter, up 4 million from last year driven by stronger performance of gas portfolio. So overall, TT is $1.37 per share in the second quarter of 2018 or $0.29 over the last year.","Let me turn to the next slide. Let me start with the -- at the top of the slide, the DTE Electric, it is why our guidance increased. You may remember in the first quarter we guided towards the lower end of the range. Now with the favorable weather we experienced this quarter, we now expect to land firmly in the middle of the range for this year.","The DTE Gas, we feel comfortable with the current guidance range for 2018. As I mentioned, both GSP and P&I we are having a very strong year. We are increasing the guidance range of GSP to 225 million to 235 million due to the growth in gathering and transport volume. At P&I we are increasing guidance range to 150 million to 170 million due to the higher earnings from the area of assets and strong results from our steel projects.","Our non-utility businesses differentiate DTE from our peers and continue to provide some very good long-term growth opportunities for the company. We are decreasing guidance for Corporate & Other due to taxes and other items that should be considered onetime in nature. As I mentioned, DTE Energy had earnings of 8 million in the second quarter and is on track to have another solid year. Year-to-date trading had earnings of 9 million. So we are comfortable with the 5 million to 20 million guidance range we have been putting in the trading business. Overall, we feel very good of achieving our new operating EPS guidance this year. And with this, we provide stronger cash flows and will allow us to reduce equity issuances, which I addressed already. The earnings strength we are seeing this year is continuation of a decade-plus pattern.","Let's turn to slide 11. You can see this. You can see as we have met and\/or in most case exceeded our annual earnings guidance that was provided to you for the last 11 years which is over a decade. Over the front-half of the period, we got 4% to 6% annual EPS growth. In most recent years, we have guided to a 5% to 7% growth. But as you see from green ovals on the top of the slide, our EPS growth over the last decade has been closer to 8% and our growth over the last five years approaches 8.5%. So, it has beaten our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate of over a decade which is a great track record.","Now prior to turning it over to Jerry Norcia, I would like to give you a brief update on our cash flow on the next slide, slide 12. This year's strong earnings and cash performance not only demonstrates for the 11th year in a row our ability to deliver results but also immediately helps our EPS growth in the future. We are upping our cash forecast this year by 200 million and reducing our expected equity issuance by 100 million across 2018 to 2020. This year's total issuances are reduced from a previously disclosed 300 million to 250 million. Our goal is to minimize equity issuances next year outside of the Link converts. And we are targeting 100 million to 200 million.","Now I would like to turn to Jerry Norcia to discuss our long-term growth.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you, Peter. I'll begin on slide 14. We continue to see growth in our utilities fueled by our investment in infrastructure and generation due to lot of positive things going on in our electric utility that will help secure our generation reliability and improved customer satisfaction.","As Gerry mentioned, the Public Service Commission approved the need for new natural gas plant earlier this year. This is a 1,100 megawatt natural gas plant combined cycle that we are building at a cost just under $1 billion. Along with renewable energy, natural gas will be a critical part of our power generation capacity in the decades ahead. New plant is scheduled to break ground in August of this year, with full construction underway in mid 2019. We expect the plant go in service in 2022 which fits with the timing of three coal-fired power plants being retired in 2020-2023 timeframe.","Earlier this year, we submitted our renewable plan to the Public Service Commission. We are planning to double our renewable capacity to 2,000 megawatts by 2022, investing approximately $1.7 billion on renewable energy over this timeframe. We're also adding 300 megawatts of new wind capacity, supply voluntary renewable energy program for large industrial customers who are looking to reduce property measures.","In July, DTE Electric filed a general rate case, which included a three-year infrastructure recovery mechanism, which we call the IRM, designed to reduce rate case frequency. This proposed IRM would recover our distribution investments, our new natural gas bio power plant and certain fossil generation, and nuclear investments. These investments total approximately $1 billion per year, and are critical to modernizing our distribution system and improving our liability for our customers. This current rate case is the fourth and the last five years for DTE Electric. The company's need for rate increases has been, and is expected to be largely driven by the needs to replace critical infrastructure to safely and reliably serve our customers. For the proper IRM and Electric Company in place to address this critical infrastructure, we believe that maybe held to defer filing rate cases on an annual basis.","IRM creates alignment, certainty, and continuity for our investment strategies as it relates to modernizing renewing our infrastructure. And it also creates tremendous efficiencies and our ability to engineer, procure and construct the infrastructure when we know years in advance what our work will be. All of this accrues as a benefit to our customers, and reduces the frequency of highly repetitive regulatory proceedings. As you know, we have a recovery mechanism for our main renewal capital at our gas utility, and this has worked very well helping our efforts to improve safety and reliability in our gas main infrastructure.","Recent rate filing also included a request for electric vehicle program, which we call Charging Force. This program will help customers realize the benefits of EVs and reduce barriers to EV adoption through communication, residential charging support, and charging infrastructure. Filing also incorporates the customer benefit of Tax Reform. We have a legislative 10-month rate case cycle in Michigan, so we expect these new rates in the electric to be effective in May of 2019.","Now moving to DTE Gas, we began reducing customer rates for Tax Reform in July. Our general rate case is progressing. The rate case includes a proposal to increase the annual number of miles of main replacement, increasing the base from a 25-year base through a 15-year cycle. This proposal will allow the system to be hardened at equipment pace and will significantly decrease O&M cost over time. As always, when considering the investment in system herding, we are very focused on rate affordability for our customers. We filed the plan with the Public Service Commission; returned the balance of benefits from the tax rate decrease to customers. This rate reduction will go a long way towards mitigating the effects of the gas rate case, and will allow us to achieve our new affordability goal, achieve our affordability goals.","Now let's move to slide 15 to provide an update on our Gas Storage and Pipeline business. I'd like to start with an update on the NEXUS pipeline. Before I highlight some of the progress we have made on construction, I want to take a step back and talk about project as we see it. It is a long-term project that will help grow this business segment for many years to come. We're very encouraged by forecasts of future production in the Basin served by NEXUS. The pipe is located over the most prolific, one of the most prolific dry gas basins in the country.","Basin's production capacity is expected to grow significantly from 28 BCF a day to 40 BCF a day by the end of next decade. Forecasters are also predicting that basin will be short in capacity in the very near future. And our ongoing discussion with producers of the seas and industrials reflect this sentiment. We have enough volume under discussion to fill the pipe, so this pipe is clearly needed and well-positioned. Given this, we are focused on getting long-term deals to provide a strong base for NEXUS for years to come. We expect these that play out after the construction is complete and the pipe goes into service. This is something that is counted to play in our financial plan.","Speaking of construction, we have made significant progress in all aspects of construction, and we are approximately 80% complete. 100% of mainline walling on the pipe is completed, leading this walling as a key milestone in any pipeline project, and we are in very good shape with this phase.","Regarding our horizontal threshold drilling, we have completed 16 of the 18 HDDs we need to drill, which is another key phase in construction and the two remaining HDDs are pretty minor in terms of size. So all-in-all, we are pleased with how the NEXUS project is coming together. We look forward to growing this platform much like we have done with our other existing pipeline assets, and we expect the pipe to be a strong contributor within GSP for many years to come.","Our Link collateral and gathering asset continues to perform well and they progress towards future growth. Jerry mentioned the $250 million expansion Link that our Board of Directors recently approved. This is the third expansion of Link. This investment is really coming along well. Volumes and investments are coming in faster than a pro-forma plan we have shared with you.","Additionally, we are currently evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities roughly the size of Link. We have multiple assets under consideration, and we are in detail evaluation base of one asset in particular. As I've said before, when talking to investors of potential acquisitions, they are very disciplined in our approach, we are focused on assets that fits strategically in our GSP portfolio and keep our business mix where we like it. We will continue to update you on our progress in this area.","As far as some of our other GSP projects, they are progressing well. Millennium's Valley Lateral was recently placed in-service after receiving approval from the FERC. This is an 8-mile lateral that moves natural gas to a 720 megawatt power plant in New York. This is a good size lateral that can deliver for 130 million cubic feet of natural gas. Also in Millennium, we have the Eastern System Upgrade on track and in-service in the fourth quarter this year. This expansion will provide 220 million a day of additional capacity under the Northeast markets.","On our Bluestone pipeline, we will complete ongoing construction a 100 million a day expansion by the third quarter of this year. Finally, on the Birdsboro Lateral, we are in full construction mode. This 14-mile lateral is expected in service in the fourth quarter. So as you can see, we have a lot of positive momentum in our GSP business and we will continue to update you as these are progressed.","Now I'd like to move on to the Power & Industrial business on slide 16. Our P&I business continue to see progress on the development of both industrial energy projects and renewable natural gas projects. We began construction in the Ford motor company central energy plant that we have discussed with you in the past. We are also finalizing agreement on other cogeneration project for the large industrial customer in the Midwest. We expect to close the project this year.","In our RNG business, we have made progress since our last call. We finalized the agreement on one of the gas capture projects we told you about, and have started construction. This project is in Wisconsin, and we expect it to be on service on early 2019. Between these two business lines, we have been evaluating about 10 projects as a result we have closed one RNG deal this year and expect to close one or two deals on the cogen RNG's base later this year. So we are feeling really good about the progress for current P&I projects. We believe we have a good pipeline of future projects with a secured growth in this business.","We previously told you that our 2022 earnings goal is $70 million, and that we need a $45 million in income to new projects developed between 2017, and 2022 to hit that target. By the end of this year, we expect over two-thirds of the $45 million to be in hand, only three years into the five-year period. So given this, as Jerry said earlier, we expect P&I's earnings by 2022 to be materially above $70 million level.","Now, I will wrap up on slide 17, and then we will open it up for questions. All-in-all, I feel great about position we are in both our utilities and non-utilities to deliver another strong year-end 2018. We delivered strong second quarter results and significantly increased our 2018 operating EPS and cash flow guidance. Our utilities continue to focus on necessary infrastructure investments to improve the liability and the customer experience.","With additional expansions in business development, we continue sustainable growth with the non-utility businesses. Given this, I'm confident that we are on track to deliver strong EPS and dividend growth will drive premium total shareholder returns, and we are confident our plans to reach our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth target over the five-year plan.","With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And April, you can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Ciciarelli","Hey, this is actually Richie Ciciarelli here for Shar. How are you guys doing today?","Gerry Anderson","Doing fine, thanks.","Richard Ciciarelli","All right, good to hear. Just wanted to touch a little bit on your Midstream growth strategy, can you just provide a little bit more color on your evaluation process for acquisitions, like how much is it from gathering and processing versus transportation assets? And can you just maybe touch on the long-term strategy, how much is fueled by acquisitions versus organic growth opportunities?","Peter Oleksiak","Well, the assets that we're looking right now are gathering and transportation, so there's some high pressure transmission as well gathering assets that we're looking at. In terms of mix into the five-year future, there is a balance that we try to maintain between what I would call purely demand-charged style projects and what I would call demand-and-variable charged projects. So that mix there, we try to maintain. We try to maintain a good balance. So there's a balance of both gathering investments through acquisition as well as organic development.","Gerry Anderson","The other thing I would say is that we have had a pattern of building a platform and then expanding organically from the platform. In many cases our best growth comes from those organic expansions. So if you look at Millennium, Millennium led to Bluestone, which was an organic expansion. Bluestone led to some gathering, which has turned out to be a nice business line for us. And that whole area continues to produce growth opportunities. So for example, we recently reached an agreement with Cabot there which we think will be a good relationship, a positive relationship for us in that area.","And we see Link playing out analogously where we made an acquisition but we expect that acquisition to lead to a host of agreements like the one we just mentioned where we've got Board approval and are ready to anchor $250 million-ish investment with one of our counterparties there. So that's the thought process that's worked out well for us. And these acquisitions we're looking out are meant to repeat the same pattern.","Richard Ciciarelli","Got you, guys. That's very helpful. That's all I had. Thank you.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning everyone.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. So wanted to follow-up a little bit here on the comments on the long-term guidance, perhaps just to kick it off, can you comment a little bit on how you think about the Link-sized acquisition and the context of the 5% to 7%, and how that might position you within that guidance range? And then separately, let me also just throw these other questions in there while you talk about the 5% to 7%. How do you think about the P&I segment, specifically you talk about being materially above that. Certainly in an '18 context you're certainly tracking very well. How much of that is REF-related versus some of these other elements like RNG? And when you say materially can you maybe expand a little bit more on that?","Gerry Anderson","Sure. So maybe I'll start with P&I. So yes, we're having a very strong year in 2018. And as Peter told you, we had focused on optimizing these projects and positioning them to get as much as we could out of them, which is going better than we thought. But we're also moving toward the phase where we're going to be doing tax equity transactions. And the goal there is to accelerate cash flows and then redeploy those cash flows into other growth projects, debt reduction, and equity reduction. So I think what we're going to see out of the P&I projects is higher earnings in the short-term, and then the long-term benefit will come from the higher cash flows that the projects will generate versus what was in our plan even a handful of months ago.","Concerning the Link-style acquisitions, we are looking at those. We're disciplined about how we go about those. So we'll do it if it's right for us to do. But if it is I think it would be one of the things that really helps us shore up our 5% to 7% growth targets. So we aren't saying if we do one of those we're going to raise the 5% to 7%. It's really meant to achieve that. It'd say in general those platform investments, as I've described them, have surprised us to the upside. So the whole Bluestone platform certainly did. So far the Link platform is. So we're seeing things come at us faster on Link than we had anticipated. And we're ahead of the pro forma that we shared with you when we invested in the project back in 2016.","And so our take for Link is everything we've seen there is positive. So if we think we can do another of those, and we like the investment then our history would suggest that they're fruitful places to firm up and fill out the growth plan that we shared with you.","Peter Oleksiak","Other area that we're seeing strength in at P&I is our steel business. With the surge in steel production we're seeing the value for coke that we produce go up this year. And we expect that that will provide some value next year as well.","Gerry Anderson","And then long-term with P&I, I think Jerry mentioned this, that we continue to add cogeneration projects. And I think in part that's a reflection of the positive natural gas environment in the United States and the confidence that industrial producers have in that fuel. On top of that, there's a real push nationally to bring some renewable into natural gas, that's true both at the federal level through the EPA and in various states. So for example, California has a renewable natural gas push in the transportation sector. And currently there the sector is short supply, so it's providing favorable dynamics. And so in this renewable natural gas space, which as an area we haven't been doing it as renewable, but we've been doing waste methane capture for decades.","It's an area we have the skills for, but it's one of these niches that I think we've stepped into that has some very favorable growth wind behind it. So we think that's going to be a attractive area for us to grow, and is one of the things that's convinced us that the $70 million number that we've been communicating for the last couple of years feels conservative now. And then we think we're going to materially beat that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, excellent. Can you comment a little bit on the utilities then, I mean you obviously alluded some incremental capital spend specifically to the renewables program, et cetera. You delineated a capital plan through '22 for electric and gas of 10-4 and 2-1 respectively previously. Can you elaborate just where you stand relative to those perhaps as well just to kind of give me some\u2026","Gerry Anderson","We'll give you a full-capital kind of re-stack later this year. But I can say that the voluntary renewables has added about $450 million of renewable investment to the plan that we communicated previously. And we also have the item Jerry mentioned, which is the acceleration of the gas main replacement as additional to the gas plan. And that's a program that as we further look at both operating impacts, environmental impacts of an old system, we just think we've got to move and get that system fixed and modernized. So that's an acceleration as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, excellent. And then lastly on the GSP segment, just to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying. Obviously the Link would be incremental. How far above plan are you when you talk about your original Link investment that you talked about and\/or anything else? I mean is there anything new that we should be considering in the context of the 2022 CapEx plan and earnings growth target range?","Gerry Anderson","Well, I guess I would say that we're multiple years ahead of plan. So in 2018 we kind of sit where we thought we might be in terms of volumes and so a couple of years from now. And I'd say we've more than locked in our base case and are now working on upside to that. So we got to continue to produce good results there, but it's a lot better than being behind, I'll say that, to be well ahead of plan. And the dynamics there continue to be positive. I mean we bet on the asset because the reserves are such high quality, and that's what's playing out. The nation continues to deplete and needs to drill to replace production. And this is a very good place to do that. So, one of the producers there substantially increased plans versus what we thought they would do in our pro forma and it's accruing to our benefit.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. All right, guys, thank you so much.","Gerry Anderson","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, guys; really impressive results all the way around the horn.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Greg Gordon","Not to beat a dead horse, but I know that you guys are very comfortable with the long-term plan. But when we think about the base of earnings that you're using for your 5% to 7% earnings growth target through 2022, I mean I just want to -- given that the steel business can be cyclical and that the REF business obviously has a tail how should we think about the, despite the fact you're crushing it in those businesses today, like what base you're using off to set that 5% to 7% earnings growth target. Because I just fear that investors will get ahead or you or dip behind you in terms of the long-term view on where you're going to be given the cyclicality in the steel business, the falling away of the REF stuff. And there is some natural cyclicality too potentially in Midstream. So I just wanted to get a sense of how you think about the endpoint versus the beginning point, and so we can right-size our expectations.","Gerry Anderson","So we're still guiding off of where we always have, off the initial guidance we gave you for 2018. And we're clearly seeing a very strong earnings performance this year. So if you look at GSP, for example, I mean our guidance year-over-year is up over 40%. And that business is not going to be up 40% every year. So we're not guiding to that. But it's great to see your long-term plans evolve at the front-end of your investment period because it brings certainty, and allows you to move on and focus on adding to that rather than trying to peruse what you hoped you could. So yes, we're still guiding to 5% to 7% off of our initial guidance from this year and 2022. And we know that, for example, in GSP, there may be times when we bring a lot to the table in a particular year. And some year down the road may be slower. But that's fine as long as the overall growth rate is good.","And P&I, yes, we've talked about REF and the sunset there, and harvesting cash flows from that business. We've been talking about that for five years or more. So that's not news. But you mentioned steel. That is a business where I think the breezes are generally good, so people talk a lot about tariffs where the prices for domestic steel are up some 20%, and we are seeing increased production. Probably gives us an opportunity here as we see that strength to bring some contract term to some of our positions, so we'll be looking to do that. And then some of the other businesses, cogen and REF, those are all businesses where we see longer-term trends.","Peter Oleksiak","Yes, I was going to add that the steel business is going to give us some favorability, of course, and already is. But the fundamental growth in P&I is driven by asset investment of long-term contracts. And that's going to revolve around the cogen deals that we're pursuing. And we're very close to closing on another one this year. And the RNG deals, I mean these are all asset investments with long-lived deals. So that's really the -- if you were to model where is the growth going to come from in P&I it will come primarily from those two types of investments.","Greg Gordon","Yes, but that's what I thought. I just wanted to get a sense. You're actually replacing over time some of these more cyclical revenue streams with longer-lived assets with more predictable revenue streams. Is that your summary?","Gerry Anderson","We said last year, maybe even earlier, that what we needed to hit our longer-term growth plan out of P&I was $70 million of recurring earnings, and that we needed $45 million of incremental earnings to achieve that. Last year we got $15 million of those incremental earnings. This year we're projecting to get the next $15 million. So we're two years into the five-year plan and we're two-thirds done. And the fundamentals are more favorable than we saw a year or two ago. So when we put all that together we think P&I is going to be an incremental arrow up to brining our 5% to 7% growth -- bringing certainty to all of that. It feels better than it did a year ago.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you guys. I appreciate it. Have a good day.","Gerry Anderson","You as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, actually it's [indiscernible] for Michael.","Gerry Anderson","All right, good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Just to go back on the pipeline segment. So good performance this quarter, and this first-half, but what should we think about -- it seems to be implying the lower second-half versus the first-half?","Jerry Norcia","Well, we've raised guidance in this sector, as Peter and Gerry had mentioned for the balance of the year, so we're not predicting a lower second-half.","Gerry Anderson","Yes, the second half is going to be strong just like the first half, which is why the guidance is up so strongly. And I mentioned the 40% growth rate year-over-year, some of that's taxes, but some of it is just fundamental volumes on our various platforms. So we expect a strong second half of the year as well.","Unidentified Analyst","So, so far is any one-time non-repeating items in this first-half?","Gerry Anderson","No.","Jerry Norcia","Yes, not in the Gas Storage & Pipelines there is no\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Jerry Norcia","No, I would say the only one-time non-repeating item that I've mentioned is 40% growth. And I don't expect to see that repeat here.","Gerry Anderson","Yes, I mean as Gerry mentioned, yes, there was the tax change that you'll see, the one-year bump around the tax reform, a lower corporate rate.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, okay. Thank you very much.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter, not so much the Tigers.","Peter Oleksiak","Cleveland is going well, so\u2026","Paul Ridzon","Just to follow-up on that, I mean the first quarter you said the unregulated business were coming swinging and you pointed to the top end. And now with the second quarter under your belt you're actually raising guidance. Is there any conservatism built-in there for the second-half of the year?","Gerry Anderson","You mean do we have any contingency left?","Paul Ridzon","Yes.","Gerry Anderson","Yes, we have some room left if were to run into unfavorable weather or storms, et cetera, we could cover those.","Paul Ridzon","I was just -- at the unregulated businesses, I mean is there -- kind of how much more strength are you baking into the second-half of the year, and is there upside to that?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes, Paul, this is Peter. In terms of the guidance for non-utility, no, we're feeling really good where we're at right now with our non-utilities segments. As Gerry mentioned, that we do have contingency still in our Utilities segment, depending on how weather plays out, we may have upside overall to guidance whether it'll be coming from out utilities segments.","Gerry Anderson","We mentioned the mix of weather in the second quarter, cold April you know, hot May, and so forth. But June was warm and so was July. July is playing out warm too. So from a weather standpoint it's been favorable. And that gives us some strength through weather in the utilities which covers some of the -- provides some of the contingency we're talking about. And then could be conceivably see a little more out of the non-utilities, we will just have to see how the year plays out possibly, but we're giving you the best guidance we can.","Paul Ridzon","Jerry, you mentioned as you look at some forecasts for the out years that some people are light. And of those issues is the utility forecast. Is there any aspect of that that you think might be missing? What are they missing?","Peter Oleksiak","In regards to the utility forecast, we despite the point of clarification post tax reform we think people may be a little bit light; earnings will be growing 1% faster than the rate base for both utilities. So that utility rate-based growth is 6% to 7% and earnings growth would be 7% to 8%. And for Gas Utilities our rate-based growth is 7% to 8%, so our earnings growth of about 8% to 9%. And that is because as we're giving back cash -- deferred cash to our customers we're replacing that with equity over this timeframe. So we believe that some people are missing the nuanced post-tax reforms as an increase of equity that's coming to both utilities which just provides earnings growth over and above rate base.","Gerry Anderson","So, capital is financed with more equity and less deferred tax in our base, so that's the effect Peter just mentioned. And then on top of that there are -- the renewables is an area where we're seeing customers reach out and working with large customers, and just wanting a higher percentage in their mix. So that's, I mentioned that is short of $500 million we think in the five-year plan for that and then the Gas main replacement program. So the combination of some additional important investments along with this shift in how the utility is financed is where we think the difference is.","Paul Ridzon","Where do you see the 2022 equity layers at the Electric & Gas utilities?","Peter Oleksiak","They are currently around 38% if you look at overall capital structure. So it will start bleeding in. We don't have to \u2013- I don't really disclose the precise numbers, but I think it's really about $70 million a year that providing the fact the customers across both utilities. About 35 of that will be going at the both utilities. But there is a technique that probably gets into the more low 40s by the end of the year of the five-year period.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you very much.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Hey, good morning guys.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Quick question on -- so you talked about the IRM that you filed in the electric rate case and that it would help you to defer having to file annual cases. Can you go \u2013- I mean how long do you think you would potentially go to stay out with that mechanism?","Peter Oleksiak","Well, we are targeting \u2013- I think you'll see in our filings, we are targeting multiple years as an approach. But that's something to worked out with the commission staff and the commissioners over time here as to how long we could stay out. But we are looking for at least two years, and if things play out well, beyond that, but that's what in our current filings.","Gerry Anderson","So we have got in the IRM our new \u2013- look if I step back in the IRM what we have been talking to the commission and commission staff about is elements of our capital that are driving rate increases that are totally predictable and agreed upon. So this gas plant, for example, we know the schedule. We know the gas, what the gas flow is going to be look like. So covering that in an IRM is something that could make sense. We have also been talking a lot about our long term distribution investment plan and trying to reach agreement with the commission and staff and what that should look like for customers. Once agreed upon, that's not something that needs to be a ongoing basis of re-discussion and rate cases, it just needs to be executed and reconciled.","And so, we are trying to bring those sorts of items into the plan to focus rate cases on things that really are extraordinary. How are sales changing, how are cost changing and so forth. That needs to be done less frequently than every year. And so, I think the commission recognizes that and we do too. We have been clear with the commission that we think this IRM can reduce rate case frequency and that is our goal. We have also been clear that we can't promise some stay out period because you never know what happens in the world. So I think the understanding on our side and theirs is that the goal is reduce frequency without a specific locked in target is to what that means.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. And if I heard you correctly, you have been able to have sufficient dialog with the commission and staff that what you filed is it is likely to be aligned with something they would find acceptable?","Gerry Anderson","We had many rounds of dialog with them. So I can never kind of prejudge where the commissioner will land. That's their call. But we did try to take a process where we had many rounds of detailed discussion about what would make sense to them and what made sense to us and where our needs lie and so forth.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. Okay, and then just quickly on NEXUS you announced saying you expected to fill terms of contracts after it and just services, are you still saying the same as you were saying last quarter -- effectively or is \u2013- yes, I think you were saying around the time it enters service. So I am just curious if that is a shift or not a shift?","Gerry Anderson","Jonathan, I would say that last quarter we were saying that we are holding on to capacity that we feel is really valuable in this basin as capacity becomes short in this basin -- in a growing \u2013- very quickly growing basin. So we've got \u2013- continue to have discussions with producers, detailed discussion for capacity commitments. And we are trying to maximize volume and term. And that we think this will play out once the pipe goes into construction and\/or is in construction and goes in the service. So we have seen intensity of the discussions heat up as we predicted as we went into construction. And we look forward to concluding deals here as we go into service that gives us the pricing that we are looking for.","Jonathan Arnold","So would you expect that to happen in this calendar year?","Peter Oleksiak","So Jonathan, let me just add, not only answer that one is that I think we have been saying it for probably a couple years that the way these things play out is serious discussions happen once your pipe is in construction. And people believe that the know it's going to be there and it absolutely has played out. Our team is in deep discussions with multiple producers at a scale that is very significant. So that's promising. For a variety reasons, these deals are going to close after the pipe is in operation. And that's probably all I can say on that. But I think we will see deals closed not over a multiple years, but I think it's going to take months for what Gerry talked play outs will considerably see late 2018 into 2019 for these discussions to play out. And the reason is that people see the basin going short takeaway capacity in a couple of years. The writing is on the wall for that. And so as producers try to set up capital plans in 2019 and beyond, they can't \u2013- that capital plans until they have got takeaway. And so that's what people are talking to us about. And as Gerry said we are going to make sure that we use what we think is really valuable resource in a basin that's going to go short in the best way for DTE and its partner.","Jonathan Arnold","Great, okay. Thank you. And then just quick your comments on equity, are those sort of \u2013- do those encompass doing a linked sized acquisition? Or would that presumably change your comments on equity?","Gerry Anderson","That would change the comments that we did in the acquisition some of the link we will be issuing shares just for that project in itself. That project will support additional equity that we would be issuing.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And then just one other thing on the RNG projects, you talked quite a lot about that business here. If I am not wrong, that business kind of keys off of the RIN values in the RFS program. And I am just curious how you have long term visibility on the value on those contracts given that the program sunsets in 2022. And just if any further insight you can just sort of give us on how much term visibility you have on what the earnings are likely to be on these deals in the longer term? And maybe I am incorrect about some of that.","Gerry Anderson","Well some of the first deals that we did have long term up ticks. So that was very valuable to us. And there is an ability in the market to hedge some of these products that we are producing so that is one of the ways that we are going to manage cash flows going forward. But based on what we see and sort of the requirements that's been established by Congress for provision to provide these fuels, we see the market remaining short on supply and long on demand which we think will continue to put a lot of pressure on \u2013- upward pressure on pricing, so again multiple strategies. One is long term upticks with counter parties, bilateral arrangements as well as hedging program that help secure cash flows in the future.","Peter Oleksiak","The other thing I would say is that the RIN program is one source. And the way that's not short. It's way short supply demand and has been consistently supported through congresses of every stripe and EPAs by the way of every stripe as well. So it seems we are durable program that has a provision that's just got a supply-demand gap that's not going to be closed anytime soon. But actually some of the deals are not driven by that market. That could be support market that is actually driven by state market. So for example, California has a market that wants to pull renewable gas in the transportation sector. And some our deals are directed at that market and its dynamics. And again, there are producers there who need to fulfill those obligations and where we are supplying gas to those counter parties.","Gerard Anderson","One of the added features that makes this market attractive for us is that as we look at IRRs and cash flows, the simple pay back is very fast. So exposure to market fluctuations has lessened the concern from an IRR perspective.","Jonathan Arnold","Sort of filing in the REF fall off perspective, I mean what is your visibility on the sort of post 2022 pricing on these deals?","Peter Oleksiak","I think -- first of all I think there are actually really good dynamics in terms of filing in those earnings because they are strong earnings and good returns. And I think that as Gerry has been implying we have got visibility through that period. Now could Congress change out in the late 2020s? I suppose, that's possible. But there is we have seen no sign of that. There's been very durable support in Congress for these sorts of provisions. But beyond that, I guess I would point you away from Congress to more some of the local markets that were supplying which have been if anything had the stronger and deeper into these sorts of provisions.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. So how long are the deals you have signed so far? Can you disclose that?","Gerard Anderson","Actually, we don't disclose deal-specific terms because we are negotiating other deals. So will probably keep those propriety. But we can give you a feel for how we view this business long term as we shed more light on it down the road.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. Thank you very much guys.","Gerard Anderson","You bet.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of quick ones on the utilities, first question as far as generation with the increased renewable spend, the new gas plant, is there any change you are thinking from a supply\/demand perspective as far as generation needs over the next say five to 10 years, or with the incremental renewable come as a replacement for something else you have been thinking about whether existing or new?","Gerard Anderson","Well, I don't know if you noticed the discussion in the state on long term renewable that happened. So we had a ballot initiative emerged in the state. It was kind of push Michigan to a 30% renewable standard.","I actually wasn't crazy about it because it was from someone outside the state. The state was very well aligned behind what was happening here. We actually had Republicans and Democrats and environmentalist and utilities on a common sheet, but what happened interestingly out of that whole discussion about the ballot initiative was an agreement that came out that targeted a 50% clean energy standard which is when you dig behind what that means it implied for us 25% renewable by 2030.","And when you look beyond this current renewable plan that we said has some upside for customers that are requesting voluntary increases, we think it implies in the 2022 to 2030 period incremental investments in renewable to what we would add to some measure. And I think that one thing I would say is that as we continue to see renewable cost go down, I think those go hand in hand. So I would expect that renewable investments in the 2022 to 2030 period will probably surprise to the upside given trends and technologies and on the agreement that was just reached.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, thanks. Then on the IRP scheduling, you guys are going to be going next year whereas your neighbors are going this year. What in particular will be watching for to see how that process unfolds? And what you might be able to learn from them being the guinea pig so to speak?","Peter Oleksiak","Well, I think we will certainly watch it very closely I mean their proceeding. And we are looking to file in March and we filed a version of IRP under the old legislation as part of our CON filing. You know, it's a need filing for the new power plant that we are going to build. So we'll be updating it. I don't think they are -- we don't expect fundamental shifts in our plan. So I think you can rely on the current IRP that we filed as a projection into the future. We may update the renewable investments as we \u2013- as Jerry mentioned as we start to think about how the next decade may evolve. But that will only likely mean a higher renewable content or business.","Gerard Anderson","And one of the things that I think people need to realize about us versus our neighbors is their starting points are different. So they have a much higher gas currently than we do. I think their mix is in the order of 30%, ours is much lower. So, our gas plant needs sense from that perspective.","And then I think one of the things we will be watching is technologies above is the need for another gas plant in the late 2020s versus the ability to handle that via renewables, and time will tell on that, we will just have to see how both our load and technologies evolve, but that will be one of the things I'm sure that we evaluate in the IRP next year scenarios that evaluate both potential outcomes.","Andrew Weisel","That's helpful, and that certainly ties back to my first question as well. Lastly, just a quick one on NEXUS, you previous talked about waiting for talking on some of the expansions whether it's compression, looping, all the other good things that you have done at Bluestone and Millennium, should we still be thinking of those types of announcements is coming only after U.S. commitments in excess of the initial capacity?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, that's correct.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, thank you.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to today's speakers for any closing or additional remarks.","Gerry Anderson","Well, again I want to thank everybody for joining the call. As I said at the beginning of the call, we had a great first-half of the year. And our increased guidance shows that. Second-half of the year as I mentioned, I think we are really well-positioned also. So I think you will see some really surprises, 2018 will be a strong year. I also feel really good about the position that we are in to continue the track record of delivering premium results that we have shown over the last 11 years.","So we look forward to providing you with updates as we move through the year and as we move through our longer term plan. Thanks for joining. We look forward to talking to all of you soon.","Operator","This concludes today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.

I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their hard work that they contributed to achieving this success.","We achieved strong financial results in 2019 with operating EPS of $6.30.

When it was announced that I was taken over as the CEO role, I said that we will continue to sharpen our focus on the priorities that have driven our success, and I\u2019m confident in our ability to continue to focus on employee engagement culture that drives service excellence, which in turn, helps us deliver distinctive shareholder returns.","On the next slide, I\u2019ll turn my focus to 2020 and beyond. With a strong 2019 behind us, I\u2019m confident that 2020 is going to be another successful year. Our 2020 guidance provides a 7.5% increase over our 2019 original guidance and includes the benefit of recent midstream acquisition. Our 2020 EPS guidance pinpoint is $6.61, which would be the base for our 5% to 7% long-term growth, and we continue our commitment to a long-term business mix of 70% to 75% utilities.","We will invest 80% of our capital in our two utilities over the next five years, which will continue to provide our customers with cleaner and more reliable energy and deliver high-quality operating earnings with increased certainty. These goals are attainable with a strong culture we have here at DTE.","As you can see on the next slide, this marks the 11th consecutive year we have exceeded our original EPS guidance. This does not come easily, and as a result of a rigorous planning model. I\u2019d like to talk to you about that little more on Slide 6.","As I mentioned, we exceeded our EPS guidance for the 11th consecutive year of 2019. We attribute this continued success through our planning process, which includes a detailed five-year plan with earnings contingency across the portfolio for any number of potential scenarios. The first two years of the plan are worked in detail, with weekly reviews by the management team. Goal of these weekly meetings, which I chair is to understand with a high level of detail, how we seize opportunities and address challenges in the plan. These reviews provide us real time information to help make plans to allow us to stay on track financially.","As I said, we have contingency across all our business lines, while much of the contingency is based on addressing weather conditions at our utilities with our lean and invest plan. We also have contingencies planned in our non-utilities. This allows us to manage the entire DTE portfolio of businesses to react to any number of developments that may occur during the year, and many times over, deliver our financial goals. We have successfully employed this lean and invest approach over the years, allowing us to pullback expenses when needed, and to invest back in the business when the opportunity presented itself.","And I\u2019ll turn it over to Slide 7. I\u2019ll talk about our employee, customer and community successes. Our employee focus on customers and communities makes me proud to be part of the DTE family. A key area of focus here at DTE is safety, and I\u2019m proud to say that we had another safe year. For the second time in a row, DTE was ranked in the top 2% in safety culture by the National Safety Council. Safety is a great indicator of an employee\u2019s level of focus and discipline, resulting in a strong safety culture with engaged employees. And this engagement leads to a customer-focused environment, although I would say there is always more we can do to improve employee safety, we are currently driving new leadership competencies and communications in an effort to make another step change and improve the quality of safety.","We\u2019re ranked in the top 3% of the world\u2019s by Gallup for a high employee engagement, and every day I see evidence of this through the distinctive work our team does around service excellence. We can feel the high energy of our employees at all our facilities, in our headquarters and in our field operations. I\u2019m often approached by employees and told, how much they love working at DTE Energy. We also received our seventh Gallup Great Workplace Award, the only utility company ever to receive this award, and are confident we\u2019ll continue our focus to earn our eighth award in 2020.","Our strong focus on service excellence, this was both of our utilities, high in the customer satisfaction rankings. Our electric and gas companies, both ranked in the top quartile for J.D. Power\u2019s Residential and Customer Satisfaction Study. DTE was also ranked one of the country\u2019s top Corporate Citizens by Points of Light and J.D. Power. I\u2019m proud of all the accomplishments our team has made this past year, and I\u2019m looking forward to more successes in 2020 and beyond.","Before I turn it over to the business update, I just want to let you know how the local economy is doing. The Michigan\u2019s economy remains strong. Unemployment continues to be at the lowest rate since 2000, and the population continues to grow. GM recently announced that it would invest $2.2 billion in Detroit, a plant where it will produce all electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. You may have seen the commercials in Super Bowl where they\u2019re going to build a new Hummer \u2013 Electric Hummer here in Detroit, very excited.","Fiat Chrysler is planning to spend $4.5 billion to update several Detroit plants, along the companies start making electric versions of its Jeep models. Ford Motor is converting the abandoned train station in Detroit into a center for autonomous driving and innovation and investing $740 million. All of these are examples of the revitalization of Detroit and Michigan as a whole.","Turning over to the business update. All our businesses achieved successes in 2019, which positions us for continued growth in the years to come. As you remember from last year\u2019s EEI, we mentioned that we were going to invest $19 billion between 2020 and 2024 in our utilities and non-utilities with 80% of these investments going into our utilities.","Starting off with DTE Electric on Slide 8, as a leader in the march towards clean energy and more reliable energy; continue to invest heavily in clean energy, infrastructure renewal and technology innovation. In 2019, we announced, we were accelerating our carbon emissions reduction by a full decade, targeting 80% reduction by 2040 and reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Achieving these milestones will help us shape our environment for all future generations.","Our Blue Water Energy Center, which is a natural gas plant that we\u2019re building is also progressing quite well. We\u2019re nearly 40% complete, with an expected spring of 2022 in-service date. It supports our carbon reduction plan by reducing our carbon emissions by 70% compared to the three coal plants that we\u2019re retiring.","Early in 2019, DTE Electric received the approval for our Charging Forward program for electric vehicles. This program is bringing the benefits of EVs, to more Michigan residents and businesses through incentives. Customer education and charging infrastructure growth.","We have also partnered with a number of groups including the City of Detroit and General Motors by installing charging stations near our headquarters here in Detroit. There is a step to promote EVs in Michigan, and it goes hand in hand with our Charging Forward program, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing many more charging stations here in the State of Michigan.","Additionally, DTE Electric is progressing on its voluntary renewable program very nicely. In 2019, over 400 megawatts were committed by commercial customers, including Ford, General Motors, the University of Michigan and the Detroit Zoo. Additionally, about 10,000 residential customers have committed to voluntary renewable power. I can tell you that every day we\u2019re enrolling new customers into this program. We\u2019re also upgrading the circuits to improve reliability, redesigning substations to avoid overload and enhancing remote monitoring and operating capabilities to detect and resolve outages, much more quickly.","A few items of note include, the completion of two substation upgrade projects and one new station and over the next five years, there will be 18 new or upgraded substations that will be planned and built. The City of Detroit and surrounding areas, about 128 miles of overhead lines were upgraded in 2019 with over a 1,000 miles planned to be upgraded over the next five years. And we began construction of our new electric system operations center with the completion expected in 2021. Overall, our electric utility had a very successful year, and I\u2019m feeling confident, we are well positioned for 2020 and beyond.","Moving to slide 9, I\u2019ll talk about some of the accomplishments at our gas company. We made progress with accelerated main renewal program. In 2019, we renewed 180 miles of bare steel and cast iron. We are looking to complete 200 miles in 2020, keeping us on track to replace all cast iron and bare steel over the next 15 years.","We\u2019re also continuing to develop plans to invest on additional system improvements, including a gas transmission renewal project to be completed in 2021, to support the growth integrity and reliability of our system in Northern Michigan. This new program along with our main renewal program, firms our commitments to provide safe and reliable service to our customers.","Continue to make progress on our commitment to reduce methane emissions from our gas business by 80% and by 2040. Overall, we are looking forward to another strong year from our gas company. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to our non-utilities on Slide 10. Our Gas Storage & Pipeline business completed three acquisitions and two organic expansions in 2019. We significantly increased our ownership in Link. We acquired a generation pipeline, and we completed the acquisition of the Blue Union and LEAP pipelines in the Haynesville Basin.","With LEAP, construction teams are mobilized in December and are currently clearing the right of way along the pipeline route, and I would say, construction is progressing on plan and on schedule. We expect this pipeline to be in service in the third quarter this year. This is a 150 mile, 36-inch pipeline delivering into Southeast interstate systems and the Gulf Coast LNG export markets.","For the Blue Union system, we\u2019re on track with our financial goals. As we acquired these assets, we discussed how much due diligence was done to confirm that all of these assets were highly accretive, connected to large demand centers and supported by strong resources, contracts and credit. These assets provide contracted long-term growth and will deliver compelling value to our shareholders.","Along with these acquisitions, we also executed an expansion at Millennium, and continued to build out our Link asset in an accretive way. Recently, we have been getting questions about the low gas prices, and how this will affect us. There has been a softening in the market, and we have a plan for that in 2020. We also have the benefit of diversification through a portfolio of businesses allowing us to weather different business cycles.","Let me reassure you, 85% of GSP\u2019s revenue is inferred by fixed demand-base revenue contracts and flowing gas. Our producers are significantly hedged in 2020 with attractive pricing. As a matter of fact, our producers are 80% hedged in 2020 at an average price of $2.75, and we review their credit and cash flows weekly and feel good about their condition.","Most importantly, we\u2019re going to every year with contingency, and lean and invest plans across our whole portfolio of companies. The development of these plans has provided us a history of consistent success. This year is no exception to our conservative nature when it comes to planning. Going forward, we have significant contracted growth in the portfolio and are focusing on additional organic growth around these assets.","Now, let\u2019s talk about our Power and Industrial business on Slide 11. As we mentioned on our earlier calls, we acquired three industrial energy services projects and two RNG projects in 2019. particularly proud of the progress that we\u2019ve made in the RNG space, one of our RNG projects in Wisconsin was named dairy project of the year, by the American Biogas Council.","Our work is important and continuing down the path toward a cleaner environment on multiple fronts. RNG is an attractive source of pipeline quality gas from renewable sources that benefits customers and the environment. Along with RNG, cogeneration is the other main focus of our P&I growth. This business is attractive to our customers in times of rising electricity rate and low natural gas costs. We have been successful and growing our cogen business due to our ability to find and secure long-term projects and contracts with repeat customers.","Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to develop additional utilities like RNG and cogeneration projects. So, I\u2019m feeling great about the progress we\u2019re making on all of our business lines. 2019 was strong and we have many successes to be proud of. I sat with my team last Friday as I do every week to review in detail the opportunities and risks in our 2020 plan, and I came away feeling confident that we\u2019re going to nail our 2020 goals. And also, the quality of our workforce and our leadership team gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver this high growth at our utilities and non-utilities with a goal to 5% to 7% EPS growth or better, and our track record has been better.","And with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Peter to share our financial results.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks Jerry, and good morning to everyone. Before, I get into the financials I always like to give an update on my Detroit Tigers. First update, I\u2019d like to give is that this year is winning Super Bowl quarterback was drafted by the Tigers, that gives me hope that the Tigers know how to pick a winner, and as has been over the past few years, this is the best time of year for my Tigers with the third upstream training, just a few weeks away. Although my Tigers finished in last place this past season, I still have hope for the future.","This year will be a turning point in the rebuilding process with top prospects playing their way to the Major League 12. Unlike my Tigers, DTE has been very consistent and delivering strong financials and 2019 was no exception. I will start the 2019 review on Slide 12. Total earnings for the year were $1.166 billion, now this translates into $6.30 per share for the year and you can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings and the appendix.","Let me start my review at the top of the page, with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $716 million for the year. This was $47 million higher than 2018, largely due to the impact of new rates implemented in May and 2018 items not repeated in 2019. This is partially offset by rate base growth cost and cooler weather in 2019.","As you remember, we experienced a significant weather favorability in 2018 and much of this favorability was reinvested system reliability. DTE Gas\u2019s operating earnings were $22 million higher in 2019. the earnings increase was driven primarily by the implementation of new rates in the fourth quarter of 2018 and colder weather in 2019. This was partially offset by a rate-based growth.","Let\u2019s move down the page to our Gas Storage & Pipeline business on the third row. Operating earnings for our GSP segment were $213 million for the year, which is right on top of the midpoint of guidance for 2019. In 2018, GSP experienced higher earnings related to AFUDC at NEXUS and higher than planned volumes across the portfolio. 2019 has normalized earnings at NEXUS and volumes were on plan. As a result, 2019 is down $20 million versus 2018, which was contemplated in our 2019 guidance for this segment.","On the next row, you can see our Power & Industrial business segment operating earnings were $133 million. Earnings were $30 million lower than 2018, which by the GSP business was contemplated in our 2019 guidance. This decrease is due mainly to the REF tax equity transactions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018.","As we communicated previously, we entered into equity partnership and our REF units and accelerated cash flows to support other projects. On the next row, you can see our operating earnings at our Energy Trading business were $30 million. Earnings were $10 million lower in 2019 compared to 2018 due to realized results and the gas portfolio. Our trading company had another solid year in 2019 with strong accounting and economic end task.","The appendix contains a standard energy trading reconciliation, showing both economic and accounting performance. Finally, corporate and other was favorable $15 million in 2019 compared to 2018, and this was due primarily to lower taxes and one-time items in 2018, offset by higher interest expense.","Overall, DTE earned $6.30 per share in 2019. Now, let\u2019s go to Slide 13 to wrap up before we open the line for questions. 2019 was a strong year financially and operationally and we are planning for another strong year in 2020. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to target 5% to 7% EPS growth with 2020 guidance as the base for that growth.","Our 7% dividend increase of 2020 demonstrates our confidence in the company\u2019s performance and long-term strategic plan. The 2020 operating EPS midpoint of $6.61 provides 7.5% growth from our 2019 original guidance. This high growth rate is driven by strong performance at all of our business units, healthy growth at our two utilities, near-term EPS accretion from our GSP acquisitions, and organic growth and continued business development at P&I.","We\u2019re committed to maintaining the strong balance sheet and credit profile that its investors have come to expect from DTE. Finally, we remain committed to a business mix of 70% to 75% utilities, a good portion of our non-utility earnings coming from regulated or long-term contracted businesses.","With that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And operator, we can now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey, good morning guys.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza","Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza","So, let me just touch a little bit on the non-utility, the recent acquisition you guys did kind of highlighted $2 gas as still being economical, and obviously, we\u2019re continuing to trend below this. Could we just get a little bit of a status on your thinking there, given weakening fundamentals, but really more importantly, is there any impact with your prior guidance to like $2 billion to $3 billion incremental accretive growth opportunities, you highlighted for this segment, in let\u2019s say, a prolonged weak gas price environment, especially for sort of the opportunity as you guys highlighted in the past as being an early-to-mid phases. I mean, could we see some of that capital being diverted to other areas?","Peter Oleksiak","So, I\u2019ll say this that for 2020, our forecast for Indigo is right on top of our fixed fee charges and demand charges. So, we are highly confident delivering 2020. Also, as we mentioned prior, our growth on this asset is also contracted at about a 90% level for the first three years. So, we\u2019re really confident in the growth that we\u2019re forecasting with this asset.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. I guess the question is just more of a longer-term. You\u2019ve allocated some obviously, accretive or incremental growth opportunities for just the gathering, and the storage and product segment. I\u2019m just curious like the $2 billion to $3 billion, that could be incremental opportunities that are sort of in the early phases of spend in a weakening gas price environment, is there a potential that you could redeploy capital somewhere else or even projects that are in the early phase will continue?","Jerry Norcia","All of the projects that we planned for this year, we\u2019re confident, they\u2019re going to continue Shahriar, and longer-term, as we look at our assets, multiple platforms here in the Northeast as well as the Midwest and Louisiana, we feel that we\u2019ve got a great resource behind those pipelines and extremely well connected to markets, and one thing that we do know is that supply and demand are currently rebalancing. We saw this happen in 2015 and 2016, and that\u2019s happening now. So, longer-term with demand growth in the natural gas sector, which continues at a pretty robust clip, we see that our resources are really \u2013 or our pipelines are well positioned with these resources in markets to deliver on our growth. So, we\u2019re not seeing anything right now that long-term would give us pause in terms of growth of our assets in this space.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, perfect. That was the first question. And then just second, can we just strip to the regulated, and talk a little bit about the IRP and sort of the recent ALJ recommendation on how we should sort of think about the generation needs there, maybe from a framework perspective?","Jerry Norcia","Sure. So, I would say that the staff position and the IRP has been quite supportive, but also say that most of our assets are in flight to deliver on our five-year plan. So, I would say that the bulk of our renewable asset build has been approved already by the commission, and of course, our combined cycle plant has been approved by the commission, and is well under construction and is 40% complete. In addition to that, the heavy investment that we\u2019re making on our wireless business is getting a very good support from the staff and from the commission in the last rate case, and also signals that they\u2019re sending with their testimony in this rate case.","Shahriar Pourreza","Terrific. Thanks, guys. congrats.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. Just to follow up with Shahriar\u2019s line of questioning there. Understand 2020 seems pretty locked in with hedging at Indigo $2.75. But going forward beyond that, how far out \u2013 are they hedged about $2 or in that $2.75 range that would support them, supporting the contracts they have with you.","Jerry Norcia","Michael, I would say several things; one is the producers are hedged beyond 2020 in a significant way that we\u2019re dealing with. In addition to that, our contracts are solid with them in terms of 85% of our contracts, moving forward for \u2013 in the five-year time horizon are 85% fixed fee and demand charge. So, we also look at their credit and we\u2019re monitoring their credit on a regular basis with basis, which we\u2019ve always done, and looking at their liquidity, and we feel at this point, based on their current hedges that they\u2019ve got the ability to furnish on those contracts.","Michael Weinstein","Great. And then on the P&I business. These three projects that are under construction for the \u2013 on the R&D side, is that the origination that you need for this year to make it to achieve the $15 million or without any additional origination?","Jerry Norcia","We\u2019re in the process originating an incremental $15 million this year and we have some really good prospects. The $15 million you referred to was what we brought in the house last year. So, we\u2019ve got three years in a row now, where we\u2019ve locked in $15 million of net income growth. So, we\u2019ve got a total about $45 million new net income that\u2019s been already originated, and we\u2019re looking to originate an incremental $15 million this year with good prospects in and around the both, if you will.","Michael Weinstein","Great. And the California plan? California\u2019s rules that support that program, are there any changes contemplated there at all or?","Jerry Norcia","That\u2019s been a really robust program and we \u2013 there is really high confidence through 2020 and 2030 in that contract and it\u2019s providing a really solid basis for the unlevered IRRs in the RNG space for us. So, we\u2019re feeling real good about California.","Michael Weinstein","Terrific. And also, just can you just remind me when are they supposed to give you a final approval on the IRP?","Jerry Norcia","In February 20.","Michael Weinstein","Got it. Okay, great. thank you very much.","Jerry Norcia","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning team.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. So, I want to come back to some of the earlier utility commentary, you talked about nailing at this year. I suppose coming off in two years and strong weather, being at the upper end of the range on 2019, how do you think about trends even within the utilities for 2020, and more specifically, as you think about being able to do some of the O&M work ahead of time, given some of the weather trends we\u2019ve already seen. Just could you elaborate as to sort of the positioning beyond just \u201cnailing\u201d it?","Jerry Norcia","So, Julien as I mentioned, we look at our financial condition, both opportunities and risks every week, and we\u2019ve been doing that for about seven years or eight years. So, I would say that in early last year, we were already working on building contingency for 2020. and so we entered 2020 with a significant amount of contingency that positions us to deliver on our results and that\u2019s how we deliver on our results each and every year.","If we see any of that contingency being threatened, we immediately start to work on tactics to hold that contingency and deliberate for our shareholders at the end of the year. So, when I say nail it, that\u2019s the reason I feel confident that we\u2019re going to nail it is because of all the work we do weekly, at a very senior level, and we walk through every line item of opportunity and risk, and the goal of those discussions is to seize the opportunity and kill the risks, and we\u2019ve done that quite well in the past and confident that we\u2019re going to do that in the future.","Peter Oleksiak","Probably, just expand on what Jerry Norcia was saying, and you mentioned weather \u2013 we are seeing warmer weather here first quarter, but that we go into each year with three plants, one thing I\u2019ve learned in my career here was that weather normally usually, doesn\u2019t happen. So, we came in, we have a plan around lean, the weather comes in a little bit lighter. So, we already are deploying those plans as well as we came in the year with \u2013 really good contingency levels as Jerry Norcia mentioned.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","All right, excellent. And then a little bit of clean up on the last couple of questions if you don\u2019t mind. The non-utility side, just long-term targets unchanged. I know you kept the consolidated numbers you reaffirmed, just want to make sure on the GSP segment, that\u2019s indeed the case. And then also, to elaborate just quickly onto your other question, on the IRP just the process, if you can elaborate a little bit more on the last question there as well.","Peter Oleksiak","For the non-utility, our capital guidance hasn\u2019t changed from EEI. We have the whole portfolio of $19 billion, $15 billion of that\u2019s going into the utilities, so $4 billion is going to the non-utilities, and there was questions on the Midstream segment. The $2 billion or $3 billion, just a reminder, a $1 billion of that is tied to the Indigo and the Haynesville acquisition milestone payment as well as kind of building out that system there. So, we\u2019re still feeling really good when they think of prospects, they tend to add on to the existing platforms and Midstream, and as Jerry Norcia mentioned, we\u2019ve been nailing our 15 year, $1 million per year origination goal in P&I and we\u2019re feeling good around \u2013 continuing to deploy capital in that space as well.","On the integrated resource plan, we are really in the final stages right now. It\u2019s really right with the ALJ decision. It\u2019s going to be right for an order and there is a commission meeting on February 20, that\u2019s when we\u2019re expecting and we\u2019re expecting a constructive outcome that\u2019s from that. It\u2019s been a great process, a part of the 2016 legislation was to do this, so all the stakeholders got their voice in that process and as Jerry Norcia mentioned, we don\u2019t really have capital tied to this program, it really goes through our renewable energy plan, as well as the certificate of need that we had at our gas plant, but we\u2019re looking forward to having a constructive order from our IRP.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you all. Best of luck.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","My first one is it going to be a bounce back here, next year for the Red Wings too?","Jerry Norcia","We hope so. With Yzerman in town, we hope so.","Peter Oleksiak","With Yzerman, we\u2019re feeling good.","Greg Gordon","To make the Rangers look like Stanley Cup champions, which is hard to do. So, I\u2019m sorry to beat a dead horse on the GS&P segment, but it really has been an intense focus for investors. First, that $2.75 number that was across all your counterparties, not just Indigo when you said \u2013 when you talked about where they\u2019re hedged? I just wanted to clear that up.","Jerry Norcia","That\u2019s correct, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And I think you\u2019ve been pretty clear that the Indigo relationship has not just demand payments, but minimum volume commitments on 90% \u2013 related to 90% of your expected financial outlook, but I think the concern is also in the Marcellus, on the Link and Bluestone systems and on throughput on NEXUS, and I mean you talk about having contractual protection, but do you also have volumetric protection, as you look out past 2020 into 2021 and 2022. And if volumes \u2013 if you don\u2019t and volumes were to fall short of your baseline forecast, given Jerry that you\u2019re very proud of how you model for contingencies in your five-year plan, what might be the contingencies you could \u2013 that you could fall back on to still achieve the remarkable success you\u2019ve had over the last 10 years, 15 years of being at the high end of your earnings guidance?","Jerry Norcia","Well, let\u2019s say, I\u2019ll start with this Greg. So, first of all, our fixed fees and demand charges across our whole portfolio, for 2020 and beyond, are at approximately 85% of our revenues in our plan. So that will give you an indication of the quality of the contracts that we have for the medium-term and long-term on our assets. So that gives us good comfort. We also, in many of our contracts, have credit provisions that help secure those payments as well.","And as I mentioned, we look at the quality of credit, liquidity on a very regular basis. So, we feel real good long-term, where we stand with the quality of resources that our pipelines are connected to. And of course, we are going through a readjustment between supply and demand, but the last time that happened in 2015 and 2016, it\u2019s about a nine-month process before it corrected itself and I think we\u2019re in the middle of that now.","We plan for that for this year conservatively. I think we described that in our past discussions. So, I feel real good about 2020 and long-term, I feel that our pipes are well positioned, I guess the resources and the markets that they serve, and with the quality of contracts that we have being 80% fixed fee and demand charges.","Greg Gordon","I get that, but if you\u2019re wrong and I\u2019m sure you probably did some contingency planning around what would happen if you were wrong on those assumptions, other areas in the business where you could pivot, I mean is the RNG business sort of potentially larger than what you\u2019re currently budgeting? I mean, where are the opportunities in the plan? They continue to stay really pear-shaped on the E&P side for longer.","Jerry Norcia","Sure. That\u2019s great question, Greg. Now, the value of our portfolio is that we\u2019ve got really strong utilities that are \u2013 have very strong growth prospects, and I think we mentioned at EEI, we\u2019ve got capital sitting on the sidelines that we\u2019re working on every day to get into the plan from an affordability perspective, so opportunity there for sure. Our P&I business is also ripe with many opportunities and still feel confident that we\u2019ve got really strong opportunities inside GSP business where we\u2019re working smaller, highly accretive transactions inside GSP in each and every day. So, when you take our portfolio in total and in addition to our conservative contingency planning, each and every year, we feel real confident that we\u2019re going to deliver our 5% to 7% going forward.","Greg Gordon","Thanks Jerry.","Jerry Norcia","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Turnure","Good morning, guys. I know it\u2019s a smaller part of your business. But, could you give us some color on maybe the end of 2019 performance for the trading business, what you\u2019re thinking for your 2020 guidance, kind of what\u2019s underlying that, and just remind us of the maybe geographic profile and customer profile of that business?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. Our trading business had a really solid year. We had performance economic \u2013 we really measure that on economic income. So, economic income contribution was $40 million, that translated into $30 million of operating. We do typically target $30 million to $40 million economic contribution every year. So, we\u2019re feeling they\u2019re really good. With that, and we do plan a bit conservatively in terms of operating guidance that the economic contribution will flow sometimes in the current year \u2013 sometimes in future years, so we always come in the year in terms of our guidance to be a little more conservative. So, we do have a midpoint of guidance of $20 million for 2020.","Chris Turnure","Okay. And, no kind of color there on the current state of the market, and how things have trended in recent years?","Peter Oleksiak","We make our money there across a portfolio of businesses. We have FRS contracts that we do also \u2013 the trading company supports our GSP business in terms of marketing those as well. We also have a credit renewable business line within that as well. So, we have between power and gas, renewables and supporting our midstream business. So, we have a lot of products that kind of creates some stability of earnings year-in and year-out there.","Jerry Norcia","Yes. We rely on a trading business really for steady cash flow. We generate between $30 million and $50 million a year of cash from that business, and the fact that it supports our pipeline business as well as our RNG business, we view it as strategic in that way, but we don\u2019t count on it for growth going forward.","Chris Turnure","Okay. And then switching gears to the balance sheet. The $100 million to $300 million of equity this year I think is all internal programs, but can you remind us of how you\u2019re thinking about pension contributions here, and then maybe if you\u2019re disclosing this share count or FFO expectation for 2020?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. We are going to be issuing our disclosure has not changed since the EEI, so, we\u2019re planning on issuing $100 million to $300 million of equity here in 2020, that will be internal sources, a lot of that is through our pension contributions. We are planning on over the next, probably three years to four years to be fully funded there. Next year $100 million to $400 million and that will probably be a good portion of that through our pension contribution as well. We do target an 18% FFO that really positions us well in terms of our current credit ratings with S&P and Moody\u2019s and Fitch.","Chris Turnure","Okay. And do you think you can hit that FFO this year or is that more of a target into next year?","Peter Oleksiak","It\u2019s a target, but we do hit, even in 2019 we\u2019ve achieved 18% FFO. So, that\u2019s our target and we have been able to achieve that year-in and year-out.","Chris Turnure","Great. Thank you guys very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning guys.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Quick question on the CapEx guidance for 2020. Will you get to the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for non-utility, which I think is a new disclosure. Could you break that down a little bit for us between pipelines, I believe, a good chunk of it is for the expansion projects. And then, yes \u2013 and then the P&I.","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. Close to $1 billion of that is GSP, and it is tied to the milestone payment. We have a $400 million milestone payment, a $600 million of capital to build out the LEAP system as well as the gathering system down there. So, good bulk of this is the midstream and the remaining amount will be our Power and Industrial and it really is tied to the origination of $50 million per year goal that we have there.","Jonathan Arnold","So it\u2019s a $1 billion GSP is the right ballpark?","Peter Oleksiak","Right. There may be some incremental or one above that maintenance type of capital, another potential origination, but the bulk of that is going to be that new acquisition, the $1 billion.","Jonathan Arnold","Perfect. Thanks very much Peter.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from David Fishman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Fishman","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning David.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, David.","David Fishman","Sorry to repeat a little bit here, but I just want to get a little more context, I believe you said a nine-month correction process in the natural gas sector. I just wanted to know kind of broadly what does that look like for the Haynesville or the Northeast in 2020, kind of versus your multi-year production growth expectation?","Jerry Norcia","The reference I made, the nine-month process is what we saw happen in 2015 and 2016. Every cycle will be different of course and it\u2019s hard to predict what it will look like. But, the correction has started to happen where we\u2019ve seen producers start slow activity, and we think that\u2019s the beginning of a correction to better balanced supply and demand. Now, demand continues to grow, as I mentioned, and as it relates specifically to our portfolio, 85% of our growth is contracted going forward, and with good contracts, good resources \u2013 strong resources that we\u2019ll dispatch at the front end of that dispatch stack, to bring incremental supply of the market going forward. And we\u2019re also connected to really good markets. So, I \u2013 that\u2019s what gives us confidence in the GSP growth for the long-term.","David Fishman","And then, sort of thinking a little bit more longer-term, and maybe Haynesville that I guess broadly speaking, when you mentioned being kind of the front end of the dispatch stack there. So, if Indigo or another producer was unhedged, and you would have a situation where maybe the Haynesville was flat or even slightly down, would it put substantial amount of financial distress or would it be something that they could do economically to continue to grow in line with the MVCs, even in a situation where their broader basin isn\u2019t growing?","Jerry Norcia","Well, we saw that when we looked at their drilling plants for the long-term, I think what we saw was that they had very economic resources at the $2 price range for over a decade, and with 15% unlevered returns. And we model that as well as three independent reserve consultants that looked at that with us because we got on the insight of what Indigo is able to do. So, very high quality resource that\u2019s dispatchable obviously in a significant way at $2 and above with strong contracts. And they also have now a very strong balance sheet; they met all their commitments to deleverage their balance sheet and there is a significant milestone payment tied to further deleverage. They\u2019ll be one of the best balance sheets in the industry, if you will, going forward.","So, we feel good about the contracts, feel good about the resource, and feel great about the markets that they are connecting to. And one of the advantage they have from a market perspective is their proximity to one of fastest growing markets, which is the industrial and chemical complex in the Southeast and the Gulf region, as well as the LNG export markets. So, that the proximity and cost to get to those markets matters and they\u2019re in really good position with us to do that.","David Fishman","Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then, still, but just kind of a broader question. I think in the past in 2019, you\u2019d mentioned potential opportunities with laterals with natural gas power plants in the Northeast, Ohio area, I think it\u2019s on Pennsylvania in the past. I was just wondering since a number of things have actually kind of changed with Ohio subsidies, we expanded [indiscernible] there has been PJM auction delays and now much cheaper natural gas in the region. I just wondering to have some of the conversations with some of these power plant developers may have evolved over the past six months?","Jerry Norcia","The conversations continue in earnest because natural gas is readily available and really economically priced. There is incentive in the Midwest to convert natural gas from coal. So, we\u2019re still seeing continued conversion opportunities in and around all our assets, so that\u2019s positive. We\u2019re also seeing \u2013 we\u2019re working on an expansion \u2013 several expansions on our Link assets. We\u2019re looking at connecting the Generation Pipeline through NEXUS that\u2019s progressing. We\u2019re also looking at unique optimization opportunities with our Vector asset and our Bluestone asset. So, lots of activities, all small, but nicely accretive exactly where we\u2019d like it.","David Fishman","Okay, that makes sense. And sorry, just one more on the regulated side. I was just wondering if you could kind of frame the near-term versus medium-term growth rate, especially when looking at kind of the recent gas rate case filing, where the rate base CAGR over two years looks double digits, kind of in the context of your recently raised \u2013 from 8% to 9% net income growth of that segment, how that kind of looks near term versus the medium-term five years.","Jerry Norcia","Over the next five years, we\u2019re highly confident in the growth rates that we projected for both our gas utility and electric utility. The gas utility is in and around 9% income growth and we\u2019ve got 7% to 8% at our electric company. So, there\u2019s lots of good capital that will drive improved reliability and efficiencies and safety for our customers. I\u2019ll point it at that.","Peter Oleksiak","And near term David, I think maybe what you\u2019re seeing in electric segment is a little bit higher growth \u2013 because we have a renewable investment \u2013 significant renewal investment year-over-year by 2020. It\u2019s close to like $550 million more, however there are some new projects that we have coming in and have been pre-approved part of our renewable energy plan. So, we are seeing, kind of, near-term higher growth rate, but we are kind of in the long-term the 7% to 8% at electric company and the 9% for gas utility.","David Fishman","Okay. Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.","Gregg Orrill","Yes. Thank you. Good morning.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning.","Gregg Orrill","I was wondering if you could touch a bit more on the development backlog for the R&D business beyond 2020, and how you think about committing capital around that?","Jerry Norcia","Sure. We\u2019ve provided a forecast over to five years in terms of growth for the RNG space and the cogen space. So, we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity on both fronts. So, we are looking to originate $15 million in new net income each and every year going forward. Feel that the last three years, we delivered on that and we\u2019ve got a nice portfolio of opportunities that gives us confidence to deliver on that for this year and looking obviously every time we deliver $15 million of new net income that travels across the next five years, and each year we start \u2013 we continue moving that forward. Good prospects both in R&D and cogen with the low gas price environment and electricity rates continuing to march up slightly across the Midwest and other parts of the U.S., so the cogen business is very active as well.","Gregg Orrill","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jerry Norcia for closing remarks.","Jerry Norcia","I\u2019ll wrap up by thanking everyone for joining the call. As we already mentioned multiple times, we had a great year in 2019. I feel really good about the position we\u2019re in and continue our solid track record of delivering premium results for our shareholders. We\u2019ve got one of the highest historical growth rates in the industry at 7.5% and we\u2019ll deliver a growth rate of 7.5% this year 2019 over 2020, and have great confidence that this will continue into the future, and deliver at the 5% to 7% EPS growth into the future as well. So, thank you very much. Look forward to providing you updates as we move through the year, and look forward to talking to you or seeing you soon.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Barb Tuckfield. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Barbara Tuckfield - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I would like you to read the Safe Harbor statement on page 2 of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings provided in the Appendix of today's presentation.","With us today are Gerry Anderson, Chairman and CEO; Jerry Norcia, President and COO; and Peter Oleksiak, Senior Vice President and CFO. We also have members of management to call on the during the Q&A session.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Gerry.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Well, thanks, Barb. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.","This morning, I'm going to give you a quick recap of our performance in 2016 last year, and then I'm going to hand it over to Jerry Norcia, who will review our long-term growth update. And then, Peter will review the financial highlights. He'll also provide an overview of how tax reform affects DTE and then we'll wrap things up and take it to Q&A.","So we have a tremendous amount to be proud of at DTE as we look back at 2016. And I'm going to start with a quick recap of our accomplishments on slide 5.","So our ability to sustain success over the years has been built on the foundation of our employees. Employees who are committed to bringing high energy every day when they come to work and employees who are willing to do what's needed to deliver on our commitments to you, our investors, year after year. Our ability to deliver to you is a culture that we've built here.","And so it's no coincidence that the two achievements that I'm actually most proud of in 2016 both involve our employees. We had the best safety record in our company's history last year by a wide margin, a big beat on safety. And look, safety is always a top priority in a company like ours, but it's also a great leading indicator of your employees' level of focus and their discipline.","We also achieved our highest employee engagement score ever. We placed in the 93rd percentile of the top 7% of Gallup's worldwide database in 2016. That's measured across millions of employees and thousands of workplaces across the globe. It was our fourth consecutive year for earning the Gallup Great Workplace Award. That's an award given to only a handful of companies worldwide and we remain the only utility company ever to receive it.","Moving on to customer satisfaction, we rank second in the Midwest for both gas and electric residential customer satisfaction. So, our focus is on being number one in those rankings. So, we'll go back to work on that. Our biggest lever for getting that number one ranking remains improving electric reliability. And so with that in mind, we have been making significant investments in recent years to improve electric reliability and those investments have been paying off. We had the best electric reliability for our customers in over a decade in 2016.","And our future plans continue to include significant investments to build on that progress. And Jerry Norcia will give you an update on our details regarding infrastructure investments in general in just a few minutes.","Now, moving on to the political and regulatory arena on slide 6, we continue to work hard to earn and deserve a constructive regulatory environment here in Michigan. And this year, we received two rate case orders and those rate case orders allow us to continue to upgrade and modernize our infrastructure, make our investments in cleaner generation and improve reliability for our customers.","I would tell you as we work our way through that investment slate, we're also very, very focused on managing customer affordability. On the legislative front, Governor Snyder singed Michigan's Energy Legislation into law back in December. And I think the legislation is a positive step forward for the state. So the legislation supports our transition to cleaner energy sources and it also includes provisions for ensuring reliability from all energy suppliers that are in the mix in Michigan.","The legislation contained a number of provisions related to retail open access, so the 10% cap was maintained and under certain conditions the cap can be reset below 10%. Importantly, alternative providers must prove that they're able to meet their capacity obligations. And if they're able, they will need to pay a capacity charge.","We also have a new rate case cycle, so rate case orders will be received 10 months after filing. And this replaces the prior 12-month cycle with the associated self-implementation process.","The legislation also establishes new renewable energy standards. So, there is a requirement of 12.5% by 2019 and 15% by 2021. We are well on our way to satisfying those requirements, as we already generate over 10% from renewable resources. And we added two new projects in 2016 and we have 150 megawatt wind investment approved and ready to go for 2018. And by the way, utilities can also now own 100% of these renewable investments, which is a change from the 2008 legislation.","So overall, we are happy with the legislation. I mean, no legislation is ever perfect, but this legislation does support the transformation of our generation fleet to cleaner resources and it does address an important reliability issues for the people of Michigan.","Moving on to financial results and our growth and value creation, in 2016, we announced our plans to retire 11 coal-fired units and our plans to build roughly 1,000 megawatt gas combined cycle unit. We also had successes on the non-utility front. So we completed the second largest acquisition in the company's history, the Link Pipeline acquisition, which complements our existing Gas Storage & Pipeline portfolio very well and that acquisition provides us with another significant growth platform in the pipeline arena.","Regarding our NEXUS pipeline, we achieved a number of important milestones in 2016, including moving forward with a host of engineering and procurement activities and receiving the final environmental impact statement. We were disappointed that we didn't receive the final approval for the project last Friday. We really thought that we would because the project has its staff work complete and it is ready to go. But what we've learned is the FERC worked through the queue that they had sequentially by filing date and they simply ran out of time on Friday at midnight, before addressing NEXUS.","So we've received a number of calls into our IR area about what this means for us and so forth. So I think I'll just address those questions now.","So the typical timeframe for confirming a new FERC Commissioner is about two to three months. But we'd like to think that the fact that the FERC lacks a quorum for the first time in its history will result in the process moving along more quickly than that. And we will certainly be one of many parties that are urging the Senate to move things along quickly.","That said, here's how things work for us. Once FERC does reestablish a quorum and issues an order on NEXUS, we will move forward with construction. And we have a variety of construction scenarios that get us to a fourth quarter 2017 in-service and which scenario we trigger depends on the timing of the order and the instruction start date.","So bottom-line is, if we get a certificate on a reasonable timeframe for approving a new Commissioner, we move ahead and we put the pipeline in service in 2017. And we're going to move ahead under any circumstances.","That said, given the lack of a FERC quorum, we'd like to think the administration and Senate will move quickly on this. And I was encouraged to see Senator Murkowski, who Chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and governs this nomination process, I was encouraged to see her come out with a statement on this. And just to quote her, she said she committed to make it a top priority to work with President Trump and her colleagues to move the nominee rapidly to reestablish a working quorum on the Commission.","And then lifting our heads up to look beyond the next few months and to look beyond 2017, we continue to believe that NEXUS is going to be a great long-term investment for the company. In our recent discussions with potential additional shippers, both LDCs and producers, certainly support that thinking.","Turning on to slide 7 and talking about our financial results, you can see that the results in 2016 were strong. Our operating earnings were $5.28. So this marks the 10th consecutive year that we have exceeded our original guidance for the year and, in fact, we exceeded it this year by a wide margin.","During the course of last year, we increased our EPS growth target range to 5% to 7%. It had previously been 5% to 6%. And our communication of this new range was tied to our ability to limit equity issuances, which allows for minimal equity dilution. It was also tied to firming up our midstream opportunities, including our new Link acquisition and it was tied to our continuing investments in utility infrastructure.","Our 2017 guidance of $5.31 a share is up 6.5% versus our initial guidance of $4.93 given a year ago on this call. So that $5.31 essentially internalizes into our 2017 guidance the strong weather upside that we saw last year. And that guidance for 2017 also calls for continued healthy growth at our Gas Storage & Pipeline business this year.","In addition to setting new EPS growth targets last year, we also increased our 2017 dividend by 7.1% and communicated that we're targeting annual dividend increases of about 7% through 2019. So the 2017 dividend increase, which is approved by our board of directors, signals a vote of confidence in the company's current financial strength. And we certainly recognize the importance of our long history of dividend growth and the role it plays in delivering premium shareholder returns.","And along that line, the combination of our efforts to both grow the company's earnings and increase our dividends has resulted in total shareholder returns that have been in the top quartile of the S&P Utilities Index for the past 1, 3, 5 and 10-year periods. And given the way that we're positioned entering this year, I have to tell you I feel really, really good about our ability to add to that record in 2017.","And to give you a little more color on why I feel that way, I'm going to turn things over to Gerry Norcia for an update on our long-term growth plans. Jerry, over to you.","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Well, thanks, Gerry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 9, which lays out what our capital investments look like over the next five years.","Over this time period, we will invest $13.5 billion of capital, up 12.5% versus the prior five years. As you can see on the right side of the page, a big piece of that will go into our electric business, almost $8.5 billion. This will fund the generation transformation and distribution infrastructure improvements that Gerry just mentioned.","On the gas front, we have $1.8 billion of investment plan, much of that is related to infrastructure renewal including gas main replacement, and we do have some capital related to the NEXUS project. At the Gas Storage and Pipelines business, we have about $2.5 billion of investment over the next five years that will go into the expansions of assets and the construction of the NEXUS pipeline. For our Power and Industrial business, our investment is about $800 million for co-generation and on-site energy projects.","Now on to the next slide, which provide some more detail on our electric distribution investments. So we're on slide 10. We have a sizeable distribution system, about 45,000 miles of distribution lines and over 400,000 distribution transformers. Most of that was built and completed between the 1940s to the 1970s. And as the infrastructure ages, its performance have started to deteriorate and there is a need to invest in and modernize the systems, which is something that our customers are expecting and we will provide for them.","Our quality reliability, as Gerry mentioned, is one of our largest gaps in terms of customer satisfaction. We'll have to continue to focus on upgrading circuits to improve reliability, substation redesign, avoid system overload, remote monitoring capabilities to detect outages and our enhanced tree trimming program to eliminate outages.","In the distribution system, we're along on investment opportunities. Our challenge will be to manage affordability for our customers. However, we do believe these investments will be accompanied by substantial cost decreases and productivity increases over the next decade.","Our gas utility is also entering a period of significant investment to better serve our customers and renew our aging infrastructure, as I'll discuss on slide 11. We're focusing on accelerating the replacement of our aging cast iron and unprotected steel pipe. We have approximately 4,000 miles of that in the ground today. We've reduced our main replacement time horizon by half to 25 years from our original base of 50 years and we're always looking for ways to continue acceleration through productivity enhancements and efficiency enhancements.","At the same time, we're automating and moving meters outside to reduce cost along with our electric meters. And finally, we continue to invest in pipeline integrity to strengthen the system and decrease the potential of system failures.","Now, I'll move on to our non-utility segment, the Gas Storage & Pipeline business, which starts on slide 12. Our activity over the next few years at Gas Storage & Pipelines are focused on expanding our growth platforms. As Gerry mentioned, we expect NEXUS will move into service in the fourth quarter this year. Our Link assets have been a great addition to the Gas Storage & Pipeline portfolio. Even though we've only owned the assets for a short time now, the initial market interest is very positive.","Near-term shipper demand is greater and coming sooner than we anticipated. Actually, if the current shipper interest materialized into contracts, we wouldn't have enough pipe capacity to handle it with the current configuration. And we're actively working on our renegotiating contracts for longer terms and increasing volume commitments. Investments like these ones I've just described will enable us to continue growth in this segment at a very healthy pace.","Now, I'll turn it over to Peter Oleksiak to discuss the financial update and implications of potential tax reform. Over to you, Peter.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'm going to start on slide 14. Gerry mentioned 2016 came in strong with earnings of $948 million or $5.28 per share. For reference, our reported earnings were $868 million or $4.83 per share. And you can find the detailed breakdown of EPS by segment including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings on slide 27 of the Appendix. Overall, our growth segment operating earnings were $923 million or $5.14 per share.","Now, let's touch on each segment in detail, starting at the top with our electric utility. DTE Electric earnings for the year was $622 million, and $60 million higher than 2015, driven by warmer weather and rate case impacts. We invested some weather favorability into customers-centric reliability projects and which we do when we have upside with a warm summer. We also self-implemented a rate increase on August 1 that supports the infrastructure improvements we have made since the last rate order. A more detailed year-over-year earnings variance of the DTE Electric segment can be found on slide 20 of the Appendix.","DTE Gas 2016 operating earnings of $138 million was $6 million higher than 2015. And this increase was driven primarily by self-implementation of a rate increase in the fourth quarter and the gas main replacement surcharge. The rate increase and surcharge were offset by warmer weather.","For the Gas Storage and Pipeline business, operating earnings were $127 million in 2016, which are $20 million higher than 2015. This increase is across the portfolio of business lines, mainly the pipeline and storage platforms. Operating earnings for the Power and Industrial business were $95 million and at the same level as 2015.","Rounding out our growth segments in 2016 is our Corporate and Other segment, which was $11 million unfavorable compared to 2015. And this was due to a tax adjustment related to the acquisition of our Link assets and our Gas Storage and Pipeline business.","Energy Trading had operating earnings of $25 million in 2016, which is up $10 million, driven by higher realized power and gas results from prior year multiyear transactions accruing in 2016. Overall, our trading company contributed $40 million of economic income in 2016, which is well above our targeted annual level of $20 million to $25 million.","Main sources of value from this business unit is the cash it generates, which has averaged $50 million per year over the last 10 years, offsetting the need to issue equity. Slide 26 of the Appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation, showing both economic and accounting performance. Overall, DTE's earnings of $5.28 per share was $0.46 higher per share than 2015.","Let's move on to our 2017 guidance on slide 15. Our guidance for operating earnings is unchanged from the earlier outlook we provided you at EEI. We are targeting an operating EPS range of $5.15 per share to $5.46 per share in 2017 and total growth segment guidance is $5.12 to $5.38. And as Gerry mentioned, this provides a 6.5% increase from our 2016 original guidance midpoint and this is at the high end of our new EPS growth range of 5% to 7%.","Supporting this growth are infrastructure investments that enhance reliability at both utilities and returns from investments of our Gas Storage and Pipeline segment. We provided what we believe to be a conservative guidance for Energy Trading as we expect income to accrue into 2017 from multi-year transactions.","Slide 24 of the Appendix shows our cash and capital guidance for 2017 just as a reference. Even though we're expecting to invest nearly $2 billion in our utilities, we're again targeting zero equity issuances this year. I feel very confident that we'll be able to achieve our earnings targets we have set for this year.","Turning on to page 16, before we get into questions, I'd like to talk to you about how tax reform could potentially affect us. First, I want to give a shout out to all the CFOs before me who have been stressing this complicated issue in their year-end calls. We know that investors have a keen interest in understanding the impact of DTE on potential tax reform.","And given all the moving pieces and how early it is in the legislative process, it is really premature to give precise numbers on the impact of tax reform. And having said that, there are key elements of the tax reform package we have been analyzing. And I wanted to share with you today how those elements affect our portfolio of businesses.","The key design elements of the reform are reduced corporate tax rate, the potential loss of interest expense deductions and a potential for 100% expensing of capital investments in year one. I'll first take you through our utility and our non-utility businesses, then I'll talk at a high level about the implications on a consolidated basis.","For our utilities, when you look at the impact of our lower tax rate, it'll be positive for customers and shareholders. At a 20% tax rate, there is $1.7 billion of deferred tax liability re-measurement. And with normalization and refunded customers over the remaining life of the assets that created the benefit will provide good savings and some more rate affordability.","Now, this refund of cash will be replaced in part by incremental equity infusions into our utilities. And there's also reduction that customer bills for the current taxes expense, these reductions will be netted with the cost increase from losing the tax shield on interest expense. There is a potential to backfill some of the net savings for customers with reliability infrastructure investments because we have a significant backlog of distribution reliability investments, which are being paced by affordability considerations.","This incremental investment could and would result in improved customer satisfaction and additional earnings in cash. It would be good for both customers and shareholders. As a reminder, with a 100% capital expensing, there is only a timing benefit to our customers versus interest tax rate deduction, which is a permanent loss of value for our customers. And that's why (22:49) advocating preserving the interest deductions.","Given the significant bonus depreciation taken in recent years, both our utilities are in a tax NOL position and customers will see no benefits to the 100% expensing over the next five years. And shareholders will see no impact on the incremental equity levels of utilities related to new capital spend.","For non-utility subsidiaries, tax reform will be positive for shareholders. The lower end of tax rate more than offset the expense of interest for losing the interest tax deduction. It's also a deferred benefit related to 100% capital expensing that would flow to the bottom line.","What makes us a bit distinctive from other companies is that we have a good portion for our holding company debt which is backed by profitable non-utility businesses. And for the holding company which houses parent company debt, there'll be a negative impact. If interest is not tax deductible, there'll be some impacts from the rate change with a loss of interest rate tax shield will flow to the bottom line, irregardless of the rate.","The lower the tax rate will have a negative impact on our holding company if interest is still deductible, since the tax shield is lower. Also, given the low cash taxes currently paid, there'll be less cash flows from utilities, which would put some pressure on the balance sheet metrics.","On a consolidated DTE level, the non-utility earnings increase will offset the loss of the tax shield on the holding company debt. Equity and earnings increases at our utilities from replacing deferred income taxes and new capital backfilling, the tax rates will be a positive flow on a consolidated basis.","In summary, at this early stage of development, we do not believe that tax reform proposed would modify our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth and we also believe it could have some benefits to our customers.","Now, I'd like to quickly wrap it up on slide 17 and then open the line for questions. Once again, we had a very good year on 2016. Our employees continue to bring their best energy to work every day with our focus on engagement and safety. Our utility investment approach focusing on value-driven projects is enhancing the customers' experience while maintaining affordability. We remain focused on working to grow infrastructure regulatory environment and the strength of our utility and non-utility business gives me confidence that we will deliver the growth that we've committed to 2017 for our shareholders and beyond.","So before I could turn it over to the operator for Q&A, I have to mention that our Tigers' first sprint training game is a short two weeks away. And I guess for those on the East Coast who are hitting a snowstorm today, a little hope is on the way with spring. And I'm really feeling good about our chances in 2017.","With that, we can take your questions. So, Lynn, you can open the line up for questions. That'd be appreciated.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Michael Weinstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So on NEXUS, just wanted to confirm that you're still at two-thirds subscription at this point and does the delay in approval affect that all? When do you expect to fill up the rest of the remaining one-third?","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","So this is Jerry Norcia. Thanks for the question, Mike. We can certainly build the pipe based on the schedule that we're on right now and have a significant amount of interest from LDCs and producers that we're working on to fill out the balance of the pipe. And, yes, the pipe is still currently two-thirds subscribed.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","If I read your question just as a follow-up to that, does it change it all? No, the shippers that we have are committed to the pipe through the contracts. And I think what Jerry is implying is that we're in some very interesting discussions right now with LDCs and shippers about additional volumes. So we continue to feel good about this pipe and its dynamics.","If you look at our experience in recent years with our assets in Pennsylvania, the Bluestone project, and now what we're experiencing with Link, when you get a pipe in a great region, demand seems to come at you faster than you expect once you've got those assets in place ready to serve the market. That's what we found in Pennsylvania. We've expanded that pipe over and over, and the initial work we're doing down at West Virginia with our Link assets is very encouraging as well. So we expect the same experience here because the resources both Utica and Marcellus around the NEXUS pipeline are first-rate resources. They're great resources.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I mean, just to be clear, you wouldn't be announcing an expansion of the extra 1.5 Bcf or 0.5 Bcf expansion until after construction is finished on this first 1.5 Bcf right?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yes. Correct.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning, Julien.","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So perhaps just to follow-up on the same subject here. What's the latest point in time this year that we can get that FERC approval to make sure that you hit this 4Q 2017 timing?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So what we were trying to communicate is that if we go along on a reasonable timeframe, we're going to move into constructing period this year. But any reasonable window, we've got flexibility in the schedule to complete in the fourth quarter. Now, obviously, you can't push this thing out forever. It's fourth quarter project. So if they get into a substantial delay beyond what would be normal, we would adjust the schedule, move into it and take what came. But our expectation is, given the pressure on this and the lack of a quorum, they're going to move to the short end not the long end of this. And, with that, we're just fine.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So basically, if I just make sure I hear you right, I mean, any time through the end of the second quarter would be sufficient for you to complete the constructing activities to meet your 4Q construction target, or is there a specific date that we -?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I don't think we have a specific date. As you might expect, you got a construction schedule and we're moving around parts and pieces on that. What defines it is there are environmental windows you hit. So when I say we're moving parts and pieces, essentially come back to those areas that have environmental requirements later and work around it. And so I don't know that we're out communicating an ironclad date, it really \u2013 we're really just going to look to when we get that. We've got a lot of flexibility in the construction schedule. I think the highly likely scenario is we get this in a reasonable timeframe and put it in 2017. But in reality, this is a pipe that's a 40-year pipe, so what happens with a few months at the front-end is not that big a deal.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just to expand on that a little bit further. With respect to the existing contract agreements that you have, is there some specific date at which you need to get the project in service, be it 4Q 2017 or at some point in 2018? Just want to understand at what point they have some optionality.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Do you want to take that one, Jerry?","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Sure. The contracts that we have certainly accommodate this front-end delay and our customers would remain committed to us.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. So there is some latitude built in?","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then just to follow-up, if I can, on the other side of the house, the renewables. Obviously, we've got the legislation in the quarter, you discussed it on the call. To what extent does your current CapEx budget reconcile with the new 21% target there in the five-year window?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So I think we're working through that in the IRP process. Through 2018, I mentioned on the call, we have a pretty substantial investment, 150 megawatts of wind. We put in 100 megawatts this past year. So we were moving in that direction. But we need to work now into the IRP process that was included in the legislation to determine the actual timing and mix that will bring in that renewables on.","So I don't want to get the cart ahead of the horse, so to speak. But I think it is \u2013 if you were to say, is this going to put more renewables in the mix, then might have been the case under a different IRP or without the requirement, I think the answer to that is yes. So this will add a healthy mix of renewables to our investment over the next five years or so. But the specifics of that, we're going to file \u2013 work our way into the IRP process this year and we'll be getting details out in the actual investment timeframe as we do that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Sorry, just a quick detail there. What does the additional 150 megawatts you talked about get you in terms of the RPS? I mean what percent?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I probably I've to get back to you on the details, but I guess it's somewhere in the 11%s. So we're working to 12.5% by 2019 and 15% by 2021. That will put us somewhere in the 11%s.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you guys, very much.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","You bet.","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. So just not to beat a dead cart before a dead horse on the NEXUS pipeline, if we wind up being a quarter delayed, two quarters delayed, and I'm not saying that that's at all even remotely the base case, there's no risk to losing shippers on the pipe. It would just be timing on when you'd start to generate earnings and cash flow.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. Thank you. Pardon me, if you answered this in the script, because I was a bit distracted earlier. But in the IRP process, at what point will we get a sense of whether or not you're going to need more steel on the ground in terms of traditional capacity to deal with the return of customers or from \u2013 the demand for capacity from retailers because of the new capacity framework in the law?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","If I'm reading your question, when will we know if we need to be responsible for covering the capacity for customers that might come back?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Correct.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. Well, so the Commission's going to go through a process this year of establishing a supply reliability mechanism they call it, which is really this charge. And then, over the course of the balance of this year, they'll set out the process under which that supply reliability mechanism will be implemented. And then, in the first quarter of 2018, about a year from now, alternative suppliers need to inform the Public Service Commission of their supply plan and they need to submit proof of capacity. So that's about a year away.","And then, if they can't, then we're into discussions about how we would cover that and their payments to us for covering the capacity that they can't serve. So, I think as we play out over the next year, that'll become clear.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","But that doesn't give you much time to plan or invest in making sure that there's incremental capacity actually available, should there be. So you'd have to cover that short position, theoretically, with either existing capacity or go into the market. And my understanding is there's really only two power plants in the state that are really available for significant incremental capacity needs. One of them already has a tie into PJM, and the other is DIG (35:07). So are those the only two options, if you wind up being really net short at the last minute with no ability to plan?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. So one of the realities of transitioning from an environment that we had before, which was there really were no reliability requirements for alternative suppliers, to a future environment where they have clear reliability requirements because you got to go through a transition period. So you're right, there's a period of a couple of years here where we're going to see whether they can or can't, and if we get load coming back to us, we've been clear with our regulators that we're going to do everything we can to make supply available from our resources. We'll contract with other resources. We're just going to have to do everything we can to work to get reliable supply for the state.","And then to your point, as years go by, your flexibility to invest in assets and contract with other assets goes up. So, yes, a couple of years of transition here where we and the state are going to be working our way into this and doing the best we can to make sure that we've got reliable supply.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Last question and it's on your disclosures on discussion on tax. Thank you for that. It's extremely useful. When you think about that the sensitivities \u2013 and clearly, obviously, there's 1 million permutations off the base case you've laid out. But when you think about the sensitivities in the base case group within the 5% to 7% growth target, and you talked about the reduced cash flow impact from lower taxes at the holding company putting pressure on the metrics, does that mean that you might tilt back into needing to issue equity to fund your growth? Or do you feel like that the holding company could absorb more leverage to continue to fund uses of cash? Or is that really not the case, because you're also assuming no interest deductibility, so your lowest cost of capital would be equity?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I'm going to hand this one to Peter because he has been engineering to look at these scenarios.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","I've been chin deep probably or not.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. And he's deep. Although I would say that we kind of headed into this year with the notion that this was going to happen fast and there were specifics being put out there. But as you talked about other industries and people on the Senate, there's a sense that like is usual. This issue is complicated. There's lots of competing interest. I think the Senate's inclined to go more slowly. So we're not getting overly whelmed up with particulars and specifics right now. We're trying to gauge first order effect, second order effect, sorts of things. But with that, we have been looking at it carefully. So, Peter, back to you.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. And, Greg, I said a lot of words in my prepared remarks, but maybe a way to think about it simply is I have parent company debt, but I have profitable non-utilities, right. So depending on interest rate deductibility, it could be \u2013 we're seeing it, our non-utilities really kind of support if we lose the interest rate deductions on all debt. And if we don't (38:24) they could be a potentially positive. So it's probably neutral to positive.","And our utilities over time, as we're refunding the customers cash under deferred liability, that's going to get backfilled by equity. So that's going to definitely help shareholders. And we see, with the rate affordability, the potential to do some additional capital spend that'll be beneficial to customers. And that's going to basically increase earnings and cash over time.","So it's really \u2013 I would say, it's kind of timing issue. When you think about our utility and the holding company cash, I really anticipate that we'll have. And if we do issue equity, it probably would be related to we do additional capital spend in our utilities to kind of backfill some of the rate affordability.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, guys. Good results. Congratulations.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You kind of just touched on it, but the language impact is manageable kind of suggest downside risk here. Am I reading that wrong?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","You're talking about taxes?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yes. I'm sorry.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. No, it's not meant to imply that. So here's what I'd say on taxes. What I asked the team to do is, look, we communicated 5% to 7% earnings target. If these taxes flow through, are we still confident we can deliver that earnings target? And the answer to that is yes. We've seen nothing here that would suggest we have any concern about that. But you do get flows in and out, so it's good for our non-regulated business in terms of their earnings, their parent company impacts. Peter just described the flows in and out at our utilities. And when we put all that together for the company, we come out and say that 5% to 7% feels good to us.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So given your business mix, I assume you'll prefer the House language as opposed to the Administration's language?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","You're saying \u2013 so can you clarify the question? You're saying we'd prefer to have -","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Well, the House is, the Administration is you had this either or in terms of the interest rate deductibility for the 100% capital. So, we like that language. We like to have the option to preserve the interest rate deductibility.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Morning, Jonathan.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I apologize for asking that last questions in a slightly different way, but I had the same impression. When you net everything together, although you obviously still feel good about 5% to 7%, do you see the scenario that you put on the slide as one that would push you down in the range as opposed to up, or it's basically a neutral?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","I think Gerry has mentioned kind of the first order impact, when we ran these scenarios, what's fundamental to our growth rate is the capital we're spending across our business line. So when we ran a variety of tax scenarios, some were maybe slightly positive and some slightly negative, but did not fundamentally change the growth rates that we saw.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks for clarifying that. And then, if I could, on the P&I segment, obviously, in the EEI update, there was a good amount of talk about the things you're going to go after to fill in the white space there. Is there any update in terms of which areas you feel you're going to have traction on at this point or is it a little early yet?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So we do have a project in the P&I business where we have \u2013 and it's a nice project where we have been chosen as the counterparties to negotiate the final agreement with the counterparty that we like. So we're working our way through that process. That project is going to be reviewed with our board and so forth. So we've got to work that now from being chosen to finalize an agreement to a final agreement, but we hope that one will happen this year. Assuming it does, it'd be a nice addition to the portfolio there.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And would that pull, Gerry, into the sort of utility like bucket?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. Our long-term contract would involve combined heat and power and some very interesting investments in other things like a big geothermal system and so forth. So, yes, it would involve a very long-term contract at a site of a good counterparty. And so we're hoping that that one is landed and moves forward this year.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And how many sort of projects of that type of scale would you need to sort of fill in the ask you have in the outlook?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","You mean \u2013 well, let me just take it. As you know, we got to step-down in 2020 of our REF earnings. And we'd need probably three like this of this sort of scale to offset that. We also have some interesting things happening actually on the biomass front in that business that I think will be contributors to what I just mentioned. It's a little different project type, but we're having some good activity there. So, we would need two to three of the type I just mentioned and the biomass playing to that as well.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then if I remember right that you'd probably need maybe another two or so to deal with the 2022 incremental step-down in REF. Is that about right?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","That's correct. We'd need more projects of this scale out there.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just can I maybe \u2013 I'll just ask one more thing on NEXUS and you've been come to this two-thirds contracted level for a bit. And I apologize if you referenced this. I missed the front of the call. But do you think, for the negotiations you referenced, shippers and LDCs going to wait for this final approval or do you think there's a chance that you could have something to announce on that sooner?","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","I think that what we'll see is like in our other platforms, like Millennium, Bluestone, and the Link acquisition, as we come closer to being in operation with this pipeline, is I think when we'll start to see a significant amount of activity and closing of these deals. That's our expectation.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Anthony Crowdell. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. I guess, Gerry, on the NEXUS front with the construction schedule, how many miles a day is reasonable in order for you to get this pipe online by year end? What's the reasonable expectation in construction?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I'm going to turn that to the guys who are closer to the construction schedule. I don't know if we've got miles a day on the tip of our tongue. But it's a \u2013 the pipe itself is how many miles?","David Slater - DTE Energy","Yeah. We have \u2013 this is David Slater speaking. We have 250 miles to construct in greenfield construction. And again, we want to do that as quickly as we can as soon as we get the regulatory approvals. So, we can do the math here. I'm doing the math in my head here. You divide that with the months up by the miles and it's multiple miles a day. So...","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","It's been quite some time since I've built a pipeline. Is multiple miles a day a reasonable expectation?","David Slater - DTE Energy","Yeah.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Yes, it is. We'll have four spreads of 700 men approximately spread. And getting multiple miles per day is pretty standard in the industry. So it's not that we're stretching that in any way.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","These things go in. It's pretty amazing. You think that they \u2013 a $2 billion project, 250 miles goes in, in months. That's what happens.","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Yes.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","When you put this thing into the construction process, it flies. So yeah, that's what's anticipated.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. And on tax reform, do you guys think that's more of a 2018 event or it occurs in 2017? I know the Trump administration has been moving fast with a bunch of items. But do you think tax reform lines up more with the mid-term elections or is it something you believe happen in 2017?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I don't know that we're deep enough to make a call on that. I will say we've been in discussions with our delegation and with people in the Senate and have listened closely to others who are. And I know that the House wants to move quickly, but I think the Senate, from the signals we're picking up, is more cautious. I had a conversation with one who said, look, we've got to be really careful that we don't run an experiment with the world's largest economy. We need to think about some of these and make sure we understand their impact on debt levels, their impact on import-export flows and so forth.","So the only think I'd say is, and it's no surprise to you, our industry has clear efficacy but so do a whole lot of other industries who are coming into the mix. And whenever that happens, things take time. So the sense that this might happen really early I think is unlikely and I think the pacing will be set in the Senate, which will be more deliberant and give it more consideration, which is difficult.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","And just lastly, Peter, you gave us the update on the Tigers, but you left out that Red Wing probably one of the last teams in the league. How much do you think the coach lasts this season? Do you think Blashill will last the season?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","I do not.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","All right, great. Thanks for taking my question, guys.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","The new stadiums will.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Neel Mitra. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I just had a general question on the FERC pipeline approvals. Have you seen any themes in the order of pipelines that are approved? Just kind of curious as to why some were approved before the FERC quorum ceased to exist and if you're going to be kind of at the top of the queue or the end of the queue, once we do have a quorum again.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","They went through an order of submission. So it was that simple. And one way to have gone through would have been maybe most ripe or fewest complications. And the other way to go through is order of submission and they went through an order of submission. And I'm not inside the decision making as to why they did that, but I think they knew that this would be an important issue to a lot of companies. So they probably chose a method that they thought was fair and reasonable and that was the one they chose.","So not surprisingly, we were very close to the process and they were working their way through it as fast as they could, but they were issuing a boat load of orders. They just didn't make it through. That's the bottom-line. We have had feedback that the project is in good shape, it's clean, it's ready to go, all those sorts thing, just didn't get it in the window. So I think the key is to get a Commissioner approved, get a clean one, get one that's pre-vetted, get them into the FERC quickly so they can get back in business.","For a President who wants infrastructure projects to move, he's got a lot of them out there ready to go with thousands of jobs per project with one thing that's defining when all that starts. And that's getting one Commissioner there ready to pick back up what they were rushing with last week or I guess two weeks ago.","So that's why we think getting one of these names is what an awful lot of people are advocating. Let's just take a candidate that's acceptable and vetted and get him in place and then we can worry about filling out the balance of the slate later.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","So in terms of the projects that have yet to be approved, you're saying you just basically were one of the last ones that were yet to be approved so you'd be at the top of the queue once we have a quorum back in. Is that the way to look at it?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Well, I didn't say at the top of queue. Actually, I don't know all the projects in the sequence. I do know that we were further out in submission date than the last project approved. But it wouldn't take long once they got back to work. We were expected to be approved right in the timeframe that they were working on. That was the original date. So we really thought we would make it and we're surprised. But I think it was a result of the fact that they took on a bunch of extra work trying to push out projects by date of submission. And so we missed it probably by days or a day, unfortunately. But I don't think it'll be \u2013 I'd be very surprised if it were very long once they get a quorum back before we popped up and we're ready to go.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then just one last question on the Link lateral growth and basically adding contracts. So it seems like you have a lot of interest from shippers, and just general timing as to when you think you'll get from that 80%-ish contract to fully contracted, and what type of contracts you're looking at? Are they minimum volume commitments or just general fixed fee commitments? Anything you can provide on that.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I'll turn that one to Jerry Norcia.","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Sure. Thanks, Gerry. So we're looking at a \u2013 just to give you some color on this, we've taken an investment to our board just recently. So we'll be able to disclose some more details to that in the near future, we hope. We're in the final stages of executing those agreements, which will involve a significant incremental investment in the pipe, as well as move towards meeting our pro forma and exceeding our pro forma in this investment. So we expect a lot more investments like that. And I think to your question of nature of contract, the nature of the contract that we're in deep discussions on now is long-term contract with minimum volume commitments. So, I think it continues to move us towards our goal. And as Gerry mentioned, really support that 5% to 7% growth rate for the company.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So Jerry mentioned one that we took to our board. That was a specific investment and involves a substantial capital investment to pull that off. And then, we are in discussions with several other shippers in the area about their desire for capacity expansions. And those would \u2013 I mean, those are pushing us very closer or to if they're \u2013 if we were to deliver on the ones that are in discussion, we'd be in expansions pretty quickly of the pipe we bought. So, that was why we were indicating that the feel of this in just a few months after we bought the pipe is really good. Already won major capital investment for expansion in the works and several other discussions of that sort that are very serious.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","So just to clarify, do you have to make incremental investment to basically fill up the pipe right now? So if you got to 80% to 100%, do you have to put capital in or is the investment beyond the 100%?","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","I think in our pro forma, we had a modest amount of investment to go in to fill the pipe. And that'll be in the form of compression and expansion of laterals or connecting a few laterals. So in our base case, yes, there was a modest amount of capital that would go in.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Compression capital, for example, to increase compression to deliver higher volumes.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Brian Chin. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brian Chin - Credit Suisse Group AG","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Chin - Credit Suisse Group AG","Just going back to the whole FERC quorum question, we noticed that your slide deck doesn't have the Millennium pipelines in there. Any sort of impact from the FERC lack of quorum affecting the Millennium pipeline timetables?","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Not at this point.","Brian Chin - Credit Suisse Group AG","Okay, great. Also, you didn't spend a whole of time on P&IP in some of the acquisition pickups that you've done recently. Any sort of update there?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Well, the update I gave earlier is probably the best one that we've got. One project that we went through a selection process, we are the selected party working toward negotiating a final agreement, net of the substantial project and investment to add to the portfolio. So our hope is we work through that successfully and have that project landed and going this year.","There is another project of that type that's in the works and down to a couple counterparties that are competing kind of for that on. So that's a possibility. And then I mentioned that we're getting some interesting investment opportunities in the biomass space as well that I think could be material contributors to doing what that business line needs to do over the next four to five years, which is really what we've communicated.","Our goal for them is to offset the step-down that REF will have. That's really the charge that we've given to that business unit. And the investments that I just described are of the scale and of the sort that would do that.","Brian Chin - Credit Suisse Group AG","Great. And then one last one for me. FERC's recent rejection of the MISO capacity auction changes. Do you think that there's any play on that or how might that affect the Michigan Commission's process for the reliability charge, any sort of thoughts there?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","In the legislative process, we anticipated that that could happen. So there was an alternative path set up in the legislation, which really handed the reliability planning to the Commission. So that's the path we're on. There is a state reliability mechanism established in the legislation where the Commission now takes over the process of setting a capacity charge and then establishing a process whereby alternative suppliers need to come in and show that they've got the resources contracted to meet their reliability commitments and procedures, if they can't meet those commitments, for a capacity charge to be paid to us or to consumers in order to make sure those are taken care off. So that was all anticipated as a possibility.","Brian Chin - Credit Suisse Group AG","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Gregg Orrill. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. In the fourth quarter, is it possible to break out the two adjustments relating to tax and the debt charge at the corporate level? And then on NEXUS, you mentioned the wildlife impact. Is it possible to quantify what part of the \u2013 how much of the project that relate to or maybe that's not even a material thing that you're worried about?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I'll turn it to Peter to answer the first question.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","The first question, Gregg, it's roughly half and half. I mean, half of it was related to the tax to our Link acquisition. The other half was with the early debt redemption charges for the holding company.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gerardo Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","On the second question related to NEXUS, at this point, we feel all the environmental conditions that we would have, we can accommodate with the different construction scenarios that we have. So we feel comfortable that we can meet the fourth quarter in-service with those in place.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Jerry.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Shar Pourreza. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Hey, guys. My questions were answered. Thanks.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Shar.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. I'm good as well. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Steve.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Well, I'll close out just by saying that we feel great about 2016. Still, we had a really good year. I feel really good about the way we're set up for 2017. We've communicated our guidance for the year and we always plan flexibility around that guidance to deal with whatever comes. So, I'm confident we'll deliver it for you again in 2017.","And Jerry Norcia took you through our future growth and I feel very good about that as well. We've received a lot questions about NEXUS here this morning that are really playing out over the next few months. But as I said earlier, when you start to look long-term, both of the GSP portfolio and a large slate of things we're doing at our utilities, I think our prospects of adding to that record I mentioned of 1, 3, 5 and 10 years in the top quartile of TSR, I feel good about that because I think we've got strong fundamentals ahead of the company.","Hope you feel the same way. Appreciate your questions and look forward to seeing you all soon.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your line at any time and have a wonderful day."],"7857":["DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February 20, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","David E. Meador - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Member of Internal Risk Management Committee","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman of Internal Risk Management Committee and Group President of Energy Resources","Analysts","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the DTE Energy Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to host, Mr. Dave Meador. Please go ahead, sir.","David E. Meador","Thank you, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. And welcome to our 2012 year-end earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.","With us this morning is Gerry Anderson, our Chairman, President and CEO; Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President of Finance; Dan Brudzynski, our Treasurer; and Anastasia Minor, our new Director of Investor Relations. We also have members of the management team with us to call in during the Q&A session, if needed.","And before we get started, I'd just like to point out that we have scheduled an analyst meeting on May 1 in New York. We haven't done one in about 4 years, so we just thought it was time for us to come to New York and give you an update on a lot of the businesses and how we're going to continue to grow each of the business segments. It also gives us an opportunity to bring a broader group of the management team and -- so you can see the depth and talent that we have at the company.","So given that, this call, we'd like to focus on 2012 earnings and 2013 plans. But as always, we'd be more than happy to take your questions during the Q&A session.","So with that introduction, I'd like to turn it over to Gerry Anderson.","Gerard M. Anderson","Well, thanks, Dave, and greetings to all of you. Thanks for joining us this morning. I am going to start out this morning with a look-back on 2012 and our accomplishments, then I will turn to some of the drivers of our long-term growth and then we'll hand it back to Dave for a financial update.","So I'd start by saying that I'm encouraged by our progress and results in recent years. And I attribute that progress, in large part, to our focus on what we refer to at the company as DTE Energy's system of priorities. And that system of priorities is shown on Slide 5.","Your first reaction may be, why is Gerry taking me through this page full of boxes and arrows on a year-end earnings call? But the answer is that this page really does describe the way that we're running DTE Energy and I think it's helpful for you as investors to understand that. And it describes an interdependent set of 6 priorities, which, I think, if we execute well against, will yield strong outcomes for all of our constituents, including you, our shareholders.","And it all starts on the left-hand side of the slide, the far left-hand side, with highly engaged employees. And I have come to believe that this is the first and most important. I often say to our leaders, you can't be an excellent company, you can't produce excellent result for shareholders if you're getting mediocre energy and focus from your people. And if we don't get this right, everything to the right of that employee box doesn't work.","But if you do get that right, then you got a shot at the next 2 to the right, which is doing a great job for your customers and building an ability to use continuous improvement to manage costs and improve quality. And if you nail those 2 things, your work for your customers and your ability to manage costs, you've got a better chance at having a constructive relationship with your regulators and your politicians because they think you're going to bat for them and doing the right things.","And if you can combine a constructive relationship with your regulators and the political environment with a well-defined growth strategy, that gives us a chance to produce great outcomes for you.","So we've organized the company and the leadership around these 6 priorities, and I want to spend just a minute giving you a quick update on our progress against each of those.","On Slide 6, I mentioned employee engagement as the entry point to all of this. And we measure engagement using what's known as the Gallup survey. There are thousands of companies who use it to try to understand where their employees' heads are at. 2012 marked the sixth consecutive year of increases in our Gallup engagement score, and for the first time, we entered the top quartile. We were in the 78th percentile, so close to the top 20 of Gallup's universe of companies. And I look back on this as our most achievement in 2012. And we now have our leadership team firmly focused on taking our people from the top quartile into the top decile and we're working hard to make that happen.","We also continue to work our continuous improvement discipline. We maintained our O&M levels at our 2 utilities below 2005 levels for the sixth consecutive year. Both our electric and gas utilities have had negative O&M growth over this period. We continue intensive training of our employees in this continuous improvement methodology. The real goal here is we invest to keep our rates affordable and to continue to improve our service to customers and this has proven to be a great tool for us on those 2 fronts.","On the customer satisfaction front, 6 years ago, we were not where we wanted to be and started work on this. And we've moved from near the bottom of our peer group 6 years ago to near the top of our J.D. Power peer group at both the electric and gas utilities. And our focus now is from being in roughly the top quarter to also heading to the top spot in that peer group and that is our expressed goal with our leadership team.","Over that same period, our complaints with the Public Service Commission have been cut in half, including a 12.5% reduction last year. And importantly, last year, we did get legislation passed that will fundamentally change and improve our relationship with our low-income customer segment and that's been a target of ours, and we were really pleased to see the legislature move on that in 2012.","Moving on to Slide 7. I continue to feel the political and regulatory environment in Michigan is fair and constructive and it continues to support our investments in the energy infrastructure of the state. We also have a strategy to defer rate cases at both utilities. I'll talk about these in a minute, but we have a plan at the electric utility to keep rates flat through 2015 or over the next 3 years. And at the gas utility, for a number reasons, we don't foresee being back in soon either. So I think that bodes well for our relationships in that realm.","On the growth front, a lot of activity this past year in the wind arena, I'll talk about that in a minute. We also made significant progress in the nonutility businesses. Bluestone Pipeline, NEXUS pipeline, again I'll talk about those a bit later. And reduced emissions fuel went from essentially a start-up business to a substantial contributor this past year with more to come in that line as well.","Finally, on the financial front, our earnings per share for 2012 came in at $3.94 compared to our original midpoint of $3.80. So we had a strong year. We did earn our allowed returns at both the electric and the gas utility. That's an every-year goal for us and we fight hard whatever comes at us to deliver that allowed return. And we increased our dividend 5.5% to $2.48.","And finally, early this year, we were upgraded by Moody's. Our credit rating was taken up and we saw that, really, as a recognition that our financial performance and fundamentals have been strong and really appreciated that upgrade.","A final point, before I turn to our long-term growth, is on Slide 8. We're transitioning our branding to a single brand under DTE Energy. Or put differently, we're moving away from the use of Detroit Edison and MichCon as names. And we're really doing this at the impetus of both our customers and our employees. In surveys of our customers, they've made it clear that they find the use of Detroit Edison and MichCon frankly confusing. We've done so much branding under the name of DTE Energy that those 2 names are becoming historic artifacts, and they really do know us now as DTE Energy. Similarly, discussions with employees suggest that using 2 different historic company names when all of us really sit in common facilities and a common headquarters building is not good for teamwork. And they'd rather simply be all members of DTE Energy.","So the only relevance to you is that we're going to start talking about DTE Energy Electric and DTE Energy Gas, or our electric utility and our gas utility, as opposed to Detroit Edison and MichCon. It doesn't change any of the fundamentals. But if you see a shift in our language, we're really doing it because our customers and our employees want to see us move there.","Moving on to Slide 9. I'm going to turn now to an update on the drivers of our longer-term growth. For a number of years, we've targeted annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 6%. That's been something we've been seeing for years and that's going to be true again this year.","So if you move on to Slide 10. You will see, if you do the math over various time periods, that we have been achieving or overachieving that 5% to 6% growth target depending on the start and end points of your calculation. We've set the guidance midpoint for this coming year at $4. And you may say, well, $4 isn't 5% to 6% growth over $3.94. Well, that's true, but you have to remember that the $3.94 had some significant weather upside at Detroit Edison in it. And when you look at the $4, assuming normal weather, you will see that we really are internalizing some material growth at Detroit Edison, for example, and in our other businesses in order to achieve the $4 midpoint. So -- and if you were to calculate $4 over the $3.80 start point last year, it is, in fact, in the 5% to 6% growth range.","In the -- on the dividend front, they're in green, you can see that we target a 60% to 70% payout. We've been growing our dividend in recent years in parallel with the 5% to 6% earnings growth. Dividends have been growing at about 5.5% since 2009. And we do continue to expect moving the dividend in parallel with our growing earnings. So for earnings grow, our policy will be to move dividends in parallel.","Now much of this growth that you see depicted on Slide 10 is playing out in our home state of Michigan, which continues a really healthy recovery. You see that on Slide 11. On the left, you see auto production. 2012, as it turns out, hit auto production in Michigan -- this is Michigan auto production, that was 2x the level in 2009, which was the low point. So a big comeback from the bottom and a very active segment now. And you can see it's projected to be up again in 2013. Housing starts were up over 20% this past year. They're projected to be up over 30% in 2013. And you can see that unemployment continues to trend down.","So all of these is garnering a lot of positive attention in the press and in the media. You can see comments from Newsweek and Bloomberg and S&P and the Tax Foundation on various elements of the Michigan economy. But the one that I took most note of is actually bottom left. Michigan recently was the cover story on Site Selection Magazine. And the article really talks about Michigan as a place that companies are seeing as a very different environment to come locate their facilities, which I think says a lot about the transition the state has been through and a lot about the work that the governor and legislature are doing to reposition the state.","A significant amount of the growth that you saw on the previous slide is going to come from our electric utility. And on Slide 12, you see our projected electric investments over the next 5 years, which total about $6.5 billion. A little over $4.5 billion of that will be targeted at base infrastructure. These are the nuts-and-bolts investments in our plants and our distribution system. We've got just over $1 billion targeted to that arena in 2013. Environmental compliance continues to be active for us. You can see that we have $335 million slated in that arena this year. We continue focused work at our Monroe plant. We're also doing plant on dry sorbent injection at some of our other facilities. Then, finally, renewable energy and energy efficiency will be $0.5 billion over the next 5 years as we move to meeting the 10% target and that includes $200 million this year.","Now on the topic of wind investments, moving on to Slide 13. Last year was a big year, bottom left, we brought the Gratiot wind park online in early 2012. That's a 200-megawatt plus wind farm that we own half of. We put almost $250 million into that project. We also constructed the Thumb Wind Park this past year, that's at top right, another roughly $250 million investment that came online very late last year. And we started construction of the Echo Wind Park, and we'll really finish that up this year. We expect to have the Echo Wind Park online and operating by the fourth quarter of this year.","Turning over to our gas utility on Slide 14. Our 5-year plan here includes investments of over $1 billion. Just about 2\/3 of that is in base infrastructure, including $150 million this year, targeted at strengthening and expanding the distribution system. We also have a program in main renewal, meter move-out and pipeline integrity that you see described on the right. Over the next 5 years, $400 million targeted principally at renewing cast iron main, old main that needs to be removed and replaced or bypassed and meters in homes that need to be moved outside. And this is something that both we and the Public Service Commission think we need to be after. And we've targeted, as I said, $400 million over the next 5 years and $70 million this year to that end.","As we pursue all of this investment at both our electric and gas utilities, we're also working plans to minimize the rate increases and the number of rate cases that we pursue. And you see our plans on this front on Slide 15. We really do believe that one of the keys, as you move through these heavy investment periods, is to keep your rate impacts for customers manageable. And our strategy at the electric utility is to keep rates flat through 2015.","And in the blue, in the middle of the page, you see that this year, we believe that we can use cost controls and continuous improvement to stay out of any rate proceeding. And next year, you may recall that we had $127 million due us through the revenue decoupling true up, and we have reached agreement to amortize that $127 million into earnings next year. So that, combined with continuous improvement, we believe will keep us on sound footing next year. And then in 2015, our Fermi 2 securitization surcharge, which is over $300 million a year, goes away. And that creates significant headroom for us to have any needed rate increase and still keep rates flat or down through 2015. So that's our plan, and I like being able to move through the investment agenda I just described but do it without rate increases to our customers. That feels good.","On the gas front, we've just settled a rate order -- a rate case late in 2012. There's one element of that yet to be worked through with the Commission and that's the proposed Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism on the main renewal and meter move-out programs that I described. We expect that, that'll be resolved by April. But assuming we do reach agreement on the IRM and continue to use our continuous improvement, we also think we can stay out of rate cases on the gas front for some period.","I want to cover one final topic on Slide 16 before I turn to our nonutility businesses and that topic is a process that Governor Snyder introduced. Governor Snyder, who, by the way, is doing a great job in Michigan, late last year laid out a plan to use 2013 to study energy and environmental policy in the state. The governor took this step for a number reasons: first, the renewable energy or RPS provisions of Michigan's 2008 energy law time out in 2015, so we've got a couple of years left in the renewable provisions. I think you're all aware that there was a pretty visible and loud debate in Michigan this past year around renewable energy. There was a proposal -- a constitutional amendment proposed to require 25% by 2025. And that didn't pass, actually went down pretty soundly. But it did raise the issue of what should we or shouldn't we do with renewable energy in the future. And I think the governor wants to step in and make his voice heard on that. And in getting himself ready to do that, wants to gather facts.","He also wants to evaluate our energy efficiency investments, their effectiveness, whether the level of investment is right or should decrease or increase. And again, I think he's -- I think his instinct is that these sorts of investments makes sense, but he wants to get the facts and study whether he really thinks they've been effective and should be changed in any way.","Third, the governor also knows that we're going to face decisions about investments in new power plants in the state as some of our all older coal-fired plants are retired over time. And he'd like to take a look at what makes the most sense for the state longer term, the type of assets, the timing of the assets and so forth.","And then finally, the governor wants to evaluate Michigan's choice provisions. As you all know, the Michigan 2008 law set our choice cap at 10%. There have been advocates of increasing that 10%. There have been advocates of lowering it or eliminating it. This administration and the governor have not been an advocate of expanding choice. But I think the governor will want to use this review to weigh in on that issue as well.","Chairman John Quackenbush of the Public Service Commission is playing a lead role in this overall review for the governor. I think that's great because John certainly has a broad understanding of our industry and knows how energy companies work. We'll also be active participants in this review process, and I am confident that the process is going to be productive both for us and for the state.","I am going to turn now to growth opportunities in our nonutility businesses on Slide 17. And some of the best of those opportunities are in our Gas Storage & Pipelines business. We're active in 3 growth platforms. On the left side of the page or map here, you see our Vector and storage platform laid out, which includes our Vector Pipeline and our Michigan storage. On the right side of the slide, you see the Marcellus platform, which includes our Millennium Pipeline and the Bluestone Pipeline. And then on the middle of the page is the emerging Utica platform and our proposed NEXUS Gas Transmission line.","I want to spend a few minutes updating you on developments, particularly in the right-hand side of this page, the Marcellus platform and the Utica platform. And let's turn to Slide 18 to do that.","In the middle of the page, around the Marcellus platform, we are very busy right now with our Bluestone Pipeline. The southern portion of the pipe is in service. We're delivering gas through Bluestone into the Tennessee Pipeline. We're also very active building gathering lines from wells that are being drilled to the Bluestone pipe. We continue to work the northern end of the pipe. It's nearing completion. It will be completed and put in service in the first quarter at northern end ties into our Millennium Pipeline.","One of the updates I have for you is that we are seeing expanded opportunities in gathering around the Bluestone Pipeline versus what we anticipated when we came into the project. And so the estimate of capital that we will invest in and around Bluestone has gone from roughly $300 million now to $500 million. And frankly, we're going to be in discussions with additional producers around Bluestone for what we hope will turn into additional flow to the pipe and perhaps more gathering investments as well. So feels like our investments there have moved from the $300 million range to the $500 million range and we will hope we can continue to expand on that.","In parallel, we are expanding the Millennium Pipeline, as you see described there at the bottom of the middle column.","We're also working the Utica platform. You saw last year that we proposed the NEXUS Gas Transmission, which is a roughly $1.5 billion investment and a pipeline from Eastern Ohio into Michigan and then ultimately delivering on to Ontario as well. We are partnered with Enbridge and Spectra in sponsoring that pipe. We did have a nonbinding open season last year closed in late November. We did have a healthy expression of interest from drillers in the Utica, which was encouraging to us.","So here's how things feel. The Utica is still early in its development, but we do continue to hear positive feedback from the E&P companies that are active there. And our sense is that they know that if the Utica plays out the way they sense it will and expect it to, that the existing takeaway capacity in that region just isn't going to be sufficient to get their gas to market. And thus, there are positive expressions of interest in our open season. That said, the pipe is going to take some time to develop. It's early. We're projecting it to come online in late 2016.","So when you look at the storage and pipeline investment agenda for us over the next 3 or 4 years, you should expect to see us focused on heavy investment in our Bluestone Pipeline and related gathering around the pipeline, $0.5 billion, perhaps more. And in parallel with that, you'll see us working to bring the NEXUS pipeline to fruition and set that up as the next platform that we'll be able to invest in as perhaps the Bluestone area matures.","Our Power & Industrial business is also continuing to develop a number of opportunities. So moving on to Slide 19, this business line is involved in 3 areas: industrial energy services, renewable energy and reduced emission fuel. Probably the most significant thing that happened in the industrial energy services arena, on the left, is that last year we acquired 14 projects from Duke, which brought our total on-site energy projects to 33 in 11 states, and we've integrated that acquisition and this is our first year of full operations. So that's what's new in that segment.","In the renewable energy segment, we now own 5 wood-fired plants, 4 of those that are in operation. We have a big one in construction this year that we will finish up construction in the fourth quarter and put that plant into operation. So that's the big development in that area this year and that'll be an important growth item next year.","And then in the reduced emission fuel arena, on the right, as you know, we have a total of 9 of these units, 6 of them are in operation. We do have a seventh now cited and we are working in construction and plan to have that in operation mid -- in the mid-part of this year. And then we got the final 2 machines that we are negotiating with host sites that we plan to relocate this year.","Now that array of developments in this business that I just described have taken earnings in the P&I segment from $38 million in 2011 to $52 million last year, and we're projecting $60 million to $70 million this year.","And with that, I am going to turn things over to David Meador to provide a financial update.","David E. Meador","Thanks, Gerry. I will go through the financial updates, starting on Slide 21, and try to do that quickly so we can open up for Q&A.","Operating earnings for 2012 came in strong at $3.94 per share. And just as a reminder, there's a reconciliation in the Appendix where we provide our GAAP reported earnings reconciliation.","So starting on the left-hand side of the slide. DTE Electric earned $2.81 per share. This is a significant step-up from our initial guidance range for the segment of $2.56 to $2.62 per share and this was driven by warm summer weather.","DTE Gas came in at $0.67 per share, hitting the top end of our guidance. Gas distribution system improvements and onetime cost actions outpaced the impact of a record warm winter in 2012.","And then nonutility businesses, Gas Storage & Pipelines earned $0.36 per share and Power & Industrial earned $0.30 per share. These results are at the high end of the guidance for these segments and were driven by strong performance at several projects. Energy Trading finished the year at $0.07.","And finally, Corporate & Other incurred a loss of $0.27 per share.","As Gerry indicated, the total year was not only higher than our original guidance midpoint of $3.80, which we projected our 5% to 6% growth off of, but it was also higher than the last guidance midpoint of $3.90 provided at the fall EEI conference.","I'd like to congratulate all of the employees at DTE Energy for another great year on many fronts, including all the initiatives that Gerry covered, but also on our financial performance.","Now turning to Slide 22 and a summary of the year-over-year performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are up $40 million for the year or $0.19 per share. DTE Electric's operating earnings was $483 million, up $40 million from the prior year. The favorable year-over-year performance was driven by warmer-than-normal summer this year. As a reminder, in 2011, an electric decoupling mechanism was in effect. And then in 2012, due to favorable weather again and the absence of decoupling, we were able to leverage this favorability and initiate a reinvestment program dedicated to enhancing the performance of the electric distribution system and power plant reliability. On the sales front, we continued to see stability in the underlying electric load and project long-term load growth of 1% after energy efficiency.","DTE Gas had operating earnings of $115 million, a $5 million improvement over the prior year. The favorability was driven by continuous improvement initiatives on the gas distribution system, which yielded benefits in the form of reduced gas leaks and lower lost gas expense. We also had a series of onetime items that worked to offset the unfavorable impact of a record warm winter in 2012.","For nonutility segments, Gas Storage & Pipelines was up $4 million and that was driven by increased storage and transportation revenues. And Power & Industrial projects was up $14 million, driven by the increase in reduced emission fuels earnings. And Gerry took you through the update on that where we have 6 machines now up and running. Energy Trading is down $40 million year-over-year due to reduced market opportunities. And for your reference, we provided our standard economic to accounting earnings block for this segment in the Appendix.","And then lastly, Corporate & Other is up $17 million and that's driven primarily by lower interest expense.","Now if you'll turn to Slide 23, we'll shift to look forward for -- in terms of our guidance for the year. We're reiterating our guidance provided at the fall EEI conference of $3.85 to $4.15 per share with the midpoint of $4 and this is slightly above the 5% growth off our original midpoint guidance of last year of $3.80.","Let me do a quick walk-through of the components here. DTE Electric's guidance is $475 million to $485 million. And the key drivers here are additional renewables growth and then continued cost control and planned normal weather.","DTE's Gas guidance is $113 million to $118 million, and this assumes normal weather for 2013 and a full year impact of the rate increase. We also expect to have a constructive outcome on the infrastructure recovery mechanism that will play out through the rate case that we expect to come to close in April.","Gas Storage & Pipelines is targeted to have healthy growth year-over-year with a $62 million to $67 million in earnings and this is driven by the Bluestone Pipeline going into initial service and the Millennium expansion. Power & Industrial will also see healthy increases year-over-year to $60 million to $70 million, driven primarily by REF relocations. And then at Energy Trading, we're targeting earnings at a conservative range of $10 million to $30 million, and the holding company will improve year-over-year due to lower interest expense and taxes.","So the total 2013 guidance is approximately $700 million at midpoint.","Now transitioning to 2012 cash and capital on Slide 24. This slide provides our year-over-year cash flow and capital spending performance. Overall, net cash was flat year-to-year. Increased capital expenditure, primarily in our nonutility businesses, were driven by the Bluestone Pipeline and the landmark on-site energy business acquisition.","These were offset by improved cash from operations and the sale of our remaining unconventional gas business in the Barnett Shale. The improved cash from operations was principally driven by increased surcharge collection at the utilities. That was partially offset by higher corporate tax payments.","Now looking forward to 2013 cash flows and guidance on Slide 25. Cash from operations is projected at $1.8 billion. It's slightly lower than 2012 due to higher benefit plan contributions, higher gas inventory purchases and lower surcharge collections. Capital is projected to increase to $2.2 billion, which I'll cover in more detail on the next slide. And we're also projecting that we'll issue $300 million of equity through our DRIP and pension plans and that's consistent with what we've communicated in terms of our long-term equity plans.","Turning to Slide 26. It's our summary on capital spending. We expect to spend $2.2 billion this year, which is up 6.5% over 2012. About $1.6 billion of that is being spent at DTE Electric. Here, operational capital is higher as we continue to focus on both on power plant and electric distribution reliability. In addition to operational capital, environmental spending will increase to $335 million. As Gerry outlined, we'll continue the work at our Monroe facility. And also we are starting the deployment of dry sorbent technology, or DSI, at our plants to meet our 2015 compliance plans. Our renewable investments will continue also, as Gerry outlined, with $200 million targeted for the year and that's primarily tied to the Echo Wind Park, which will go into service by the end of 2013.","DTE Gas is expecting flat year-over-year capital spending, but this is up compared to historical levels. And it's a significant step over depreciation levels as we contribute to the rate base growth in this business. 2013 will see a shift in the mix of capital spending with an increased investment in infrastructure-related main replacements and moving meters to the outside of customer homes.","And then the nonutility businesses are projected to spend $400 million with the focus on the Bluestone Pipeline and gathering system and investments at the Power & Industrial projects.","On a related front, as part of our investment program, the governor asked us in 2011 to look for opportunities to drive greater capital and O&M spending to Michigan companies as part of what is known here as the Pure Michigan Procurement Initiative. Our goal in 2012 was to target $575 million to be spent in Michigan with a longer-term target of $725 million by 2015.","I'm happy to report this morning that we exceeded both those goals by driving over $800 million and 7,000 jobs into the Michigan economy in 2012. And we're not finished there. There's plenty of more work to do.","Now moving to Slide 27 and an update on the balance sheet. As we grow our earnings, we continue to remain focused on maintaining our balance sheet. And our leverage and our cash flow metrics are comfortably within our targeted ranges. I'm also happy that Moody's upgraded DTE Energy and DTE Electric and DTE Gas. Fitch also upgraded DTE Gas recently and that was a follow-on to Fitch's upgrade to both utilities received in January of 2012.","Last year, we financed over $450 million in debt, saving over $8 million in interest on an annualized basis. And then we have another $1.3 billion in debt maturing over the next 2 years, which will give us much more opportunity to further reduce interest expense.","We also issued $180 million of equity last year through internal methods, and this was lower than our plan due to strong cash performance in 2012. And as I mentioned, we expect to issue $300 million of equity going forward each year.","So let me wrap up on Slide 28, and then we'll take your questions. We continue to execute our growth plan that we've outlaid -- outlined for you. This has delivered 7% growth since 2008. And when you couple that with our dividend, which has grown 5.4% over the last 3 years, it provides in excess of our targeted 9% to 10% total shareholder return.","Our utility growth that Gerry laid out for you is set in a very constructive and recovering Michigan environment. We continue to make significant investments in the utilities driven by environmental and infrastructure investments.","We remain focused everyday on maintaining constructive regulatory contact and we understand that's something that we have to continue to stay focused as we earn it every single day.","As Gerry outlined in our priority chart, we have a highly engaged workforce that's committed to using continuous improvement tools to improve customer service and continue to drive efficiencies in the business. And we also have substantial growth ahead of us in our nonutility businesses, driven near term by Bluestone and the REF projects. And our goal is to have the 2 businesses, the Gas Midstream and Power & Industrial businesses, earn a combined $260 million by 2017.","And you can learn more about those growth plans and other growth plans at our analyst meeting on May 1 and also meet members of the management team.","So with that, I'll wrap up, and thank you for joining us. And Casey, we would open it up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Cole with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, first on the midstream and the NEXUS pipeline, I guess, as it shows on Slide 17, it appears that the NEXUS pipeline better optimizes your current midstream and storage footprint. And so how do you expect the NEXUS pipeline to do this with your current assets and what other growth projects you see kind of like building off this pipe?","Gerard M. Anderson","Well, the interesting thing about NEXUS -- but, first of all, it's just a raw play on what we think is going to be a great resource in Eastern Ohio. And we have a market approximate to those resources in Michigan that is looking for added diversity of supply. But Ontario, if you studied dynamics in Ontario, Ontario gas use is really strong in terms of growth, particularly as they transition their power generation sector away from coal to natural gas. So they're -- they project a strong need for this, and thus, we've got 2 Canadian partners sponsoring the pipe. The other interesting thing about the project is that it plays right into our storage platform in Michigan and -- right across the river in Dawn, Ontario, there's another major Canadian storage platform. So the pipe not only brings supply, but it brings it into one of the largest storage hubs in North America. And as these shale resources come on and really dominate, they're going to need storage assets and storage hubs like the one that we have in Michigan and Western Ontario to help them deal with a relatively flat supply versus a fluctuating load. So we think it'll be good for the future development of our storage as well. The Vector Pipeline, as well, we're interested to see how that's going to play out. Whether we may, in the end, end up pushing Utica supply west through Vector up into Illinois and Wisconsin, we're already serving customers up there, but think that bringing the Utica supply on will give us greater opportunities to continue to use that asset. So I think the point of your question was that if it's something that helps us optimize existing assets, and I would agree with you, that we think as it develops it'll be a great fit.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Good. I guess, Gerry, while I have you, I guess, we've been hearing a lot from the Obama administration and other involved parties regarding carbon policy. And I know you're chairing the EEI CEO panel to address carbon. So I was kind of hoping to get your initial thoughts on where you see carbon policy going and whether the prior policy that were set -- or the policy targets set by EEI are a reasonable starting point?","Gerard M. Anderson","When you say the prior, are you talking about in the prior legislative rounds of discussion?","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, back in 2007 and '08 when this was more topical?","Gerard M. Anderson","Yes. Well, a couple of comments. This time, because the legislature has not been able to agree on anything around climate change, the emphasis is going to shift to the EPA. One of the things that needs to be understood is the degrees of freedom that the EPA has to act. And I have had pretty sophisticated lawyers taking a look at the language of the Clean Air Act to understand what the EPA can and can't do. And what's clear is that it's not very clear and it's not very tested. They will act under a segment -- a section of the Clean Air Act that has not been the primary area of activity in the past. And so what they can do there is not well understood. So one thing I would say is both the industry and the EPA need to understand that more clearly and discuss the approach. I can almost assure you that, that's going to get tested in the courts. The courts are ultimately going to determine the EPA's degrees of freedom. I think the industry, as to whether the legislation would represent a starting point, the industry is not that far along in terms of thinking it through. I think what we need to do and one of the things that I and my role will be trying to do is see if we can come to a common viewpoint as to what we think is productive for our industry, productive for the country and so forth. But we're pretty early in that thinking and I would not assume that the discussions back in '07 and '08 are necessarily the starting point for discussions with the EPA.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Citi.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, I've got a question for you on Slide 25. On the cash flow from operations guidance, can you just break down a little bit the reduction in cash from operations? I do see your little footnote at the bottom in terms of equity issued. So if we take that into account, it looks like there's about $0.5 billion of reduction in cash from operations. So if you could just give a little bit more color around those comments that you have over to the right side of the slide?","David E. Meador","I would actually start by pointing out on Slide 24 that we actually had a, what I would describe, as more of a temporary peak in cash from operations in 2012. So if you look at the $2.2 billion compared to 2011 cash from ops or even if you went back a prior year that we had higher cash from operations this year, partly due to these onetime items that are coming through. So we had tracker collections or surcharge collections and we also the timing of our benefit payments that did not happen in '12 that are going to happen in '13. So when you put this together and kind of normalize some of the onetime items, I wouldn't characterize this as a reduction in cash from ops as actually when you get into '13 we're at a more normal level if you looked at our long-term planning. So it's more nuanced between what played into 2012 versus a reduction in 2013.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett with Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the REF units. You placed one, you've got another, you've got another couple you're in talks with. Is there any possibility that you can talk about maybe some -- the length on the contracts where you're placing these and maybe with the 5 that were already in place last year?","Gerard M. Anderson","I missed what you said. What would you like to know about the contracts?","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Oh, I'm sorry, the duration.","Gerard M. Anderson","Oh, the duration. The contracts generally run through the end of the tax credit period, which is out in the 2020-2021 time frame. And so they run through the life of the credit. They could be extended beyond that because these units have environmental value. But as you know, the credits give quite an economic punch to the project. So that's where we've contracted.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I know that this won't necessarily impact you as you are planning to kind of stay out. But I'm wondering if in the governor's proposals, do you expect to see, there's been a little bit of talk around this, maybe a change to the self-implementation process for rates?","Gerard M. Anderson","Well, I think it's probably premature to say. There have been questions around it, primarily coming out of the House. The House has a lot of new members, many of whom weren't even around in 2008 when that whole concept was developed and implemented. The Senate has -- in fact, the guy who runs the Senate Energy Committee was a principal author of the legislation while he was in the House. So you don't see questions coming out of the Senate. But in the House, you do have newer members. John Quackenbush was actually there to testify the other day, started to field questions on that topic and other topics that are just general to how does the law work and what was the rationale for various provisions being put in place and so forth. So I would say it's early. There has -- John Quackenbush has come out and generally said, look, I -- we've got a 1-year limit on rate cases. Maybe we ought to just make rate cases even faster. And if you do that, it kind of makes the self-implement moot. So it's a 12-month. If we back up into 12-month, then your 6-month self-implement, at some point, becomes not that important. So that's a possibility, too, that we would target somewhat shorter rate cases and just say we're going to do them in 8 months, for example, and that's, that and which should be fine with us if that's the way it played out.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","David E. Meador","All right. I just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. As you know, this was a pretty upbeat call for us. We're really pleased with what happened in 2012, and we're looking forward to deliver on our commitments again in 2013. And we look forward to seeing you at our analyst meeting on May 1. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Barb Tuckfield. Please go ahead.","Barb Tuckfield","Thank you, Cynthia, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our 2016 first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is the non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP reported earnings to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","With us today are Gerry Anderson, our Chairman and CEO; Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jerry Norcia, our President and COO. We also have members of the management team to call on during the Q&A session.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Gerry.","Gerry Anderson","Well, thank you, Barb, and thanks to all of you for joining us here this morning. I should take just a minute and recognize that this is Jerry Norcia\u2019s first time on this call as President and COO. Jerry was promoted into that position early in April. I think many of you know Jerry or met him on visits, but Jerry, just a brief history, came in as President of our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, really helped to build that business then took over as President of our Gas Utility along with his role at GSP. Most recently was President of our Electric Operations and then as I mentioned moved into his role as President and COO just about a month ago.","Well, I\u2019m going to start the discussion today with an overview of our results in the first quarter as well as number of key developments at the company. And then I'll turn things over to Peter to give you a financial update and then we will wrap up and take your questions. So moving on to Slide 5, we continue to make good progress on a number of fronts. With one quarter behind us in 2016, I feel very good about our year-to-date financial results and our ability to deliver or exceed our full-year guidance. Energy legislation continues to move forward at Lansing. In fact, this is a key week as it turns out and I will describe that in a minute. And our NEXUS gas pipeline project continued to move forward toward its 2017 end service date and I will give you an update on progress on that front in a few minutes as well.","So concerning our financial performance, moving on to Slide 6, as I mentioned, we're off to a very good start. We delivered first quarter operating earnings of $1.52, which I feel great about relative to our plan for the year. We came into 2016, expecting a warm winter. We\u2019re talking about that prior to the call. We started last July planning for El Nino, so we came into the year with a plan expecting a standard deviation or more warmer this winter and it came, but we came out of the first quarter in great shape, so that all worked out fine.","And given that we're on track to deliver our earnings guidance and another year of earnings growth. And assuming that we do that, 2016 will be our 10th consecutive year of meeting or beating our earnings targets. As you know, we've also been growing our dividend in parallel with earnings and we have every intention to continue that and our balance sheet continues to be in great shape, in fact Fitch, back in February, upgraded us. So bottom line as we head into the second quarter, I feel great about our financial position.","Moving on to Slide 7. As I said earlier, energy legislation continues to progress in Lansing. The current regulatory construct in Michigan was established by legislation passed back in 2008. And the key provisions of that legislation and our current construct are laid out at the top of the slide. And those provisions have and continued to serve the State of Michigan very well. But in preparation for a significant investment in new generation assets in our state as we retire older assets, we've been working on an update to the 2008 legislation over the past year. And this week, Senator Mike Nofs, who is Chairman of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, will introduce his substitute bills and take testimony from a range of key stakeholders. In fact, I'm going to be up in Lansing on Thursday testifying.","The legislation that Senator Nofs has fashioned has a number of key features. So, it establishes firm capacity requirements for all electricity providers in Michigan, but in particular establishes requirements for the first time for the retail open access suppliers or choice suppliers. That's a key reliability provision as the state moves into retiring and rebuilding generation that 10% of the market needs to be planned for and that's what the legislation is targeting.","The legislation also sets up an IRP, or integrated resource planning process, that will enable long-term resource planning and will establish a process for investment preapproval. And then finally, the legislation establishes incentives for energy efficiency investment and it enables decoupling related to energy efficiency and it makes it possible for utilities to apply for broader decoupling to the Public Service Commission as well. So Senator Nofs expects to work these bills hard this week and the following week and then we'll move them out of committee for a vote on the Senate floor when he feels the time is right for that. And then we expect that this legislation will become \u2013 will move over to the House and become the basis for discussions and action there.","So, we also continue to make progress on our NEXUS Pipeline project, and Slide 8 provides a summary update of that activity. As the left hand side of the Slide shows, NEXUS originates in arguably the best dry gas geology in the country, in the Utica shale. And it then runs north and west across Northern Ohio where there are numerous opportunities to interconnect with LDC, power plant, and industrial loads. And then the pipe heads north to interconnect with the Vector pipeline in Michigan, which ties it to a very large gas storage complex in Michigan and in Ontario. And Vector also enables it to serve LDCs in Ontario, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and other mid-west states.","The NEXUS remains on track to be placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2017. A couple of noteworthy first quarter accomplishments for NEXUS are listed on the right hand side of the Slide. As I mentioned, the pipe runs across Northern Ohio. And during the first quarter, we increased our interconnect agreements along that stretch from 1.4 Bcf per day to 1.75 Bcf per day. And these interconnect agreements represent great future market opportunities for NEXUS which has 1.5 Bcf designed pipe. We also ordered compressors for the pipe in the first quarter, so both the steel the pipe, and the compression for the project are on order. And finally, we continue to advance our work with the FERC and that's going well. And we continue to expect our FERC notice of schedule here during the second quarter.","So before I hand things over to Peter for a financial update, I want to summarize on Slide 9. So we have, for years, talked to investors about delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth with high reliability and consistency and pairing that with healthy dividend growth. And on the right side of the Slide in the ovals, you can see that our actual EPS growth in recent years has been 6.5% and we have grown the dividend at just above 5.5%. And given our start to 2016 in the first quarter, as I said earlier, I feel really good about our ability to continue that pattern over the course of this year.","So with that said, Peter over to you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'll just start on Slide 11. And as Gerry mentioned, DTE Energy\u2019s operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.52 per share, and for reference the reported earnings were $1.37 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 29 of the appendix. This Slide shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment, I\u2019ll start at the top of the page with our two utilities.","It is important to remember that the first quarter last year was one of the coldest on record. In fact, February of 2015 was the coldest February in the last 50 years. The first quarter of 2016 was actually one of the warmest on record. So, primarily driven by weather, earnings for both electric and gas utilities were down quarter-over-quarter. DTE Electric\u2019s earnings were $127 million for the first quarter of this year compared to $136 million last year. Along with weather, DTE Electric\u2019s earnings were lower due to the absence of the revenue decoupling mechanism amortization in 2016. This revenue decoupling amortization was part of our strategy that extended the timeframe in between rate cases by four years.","The amortization was offset by the implementation of new rates last July. A further breakdown of DTE Electric\u2019s quarter-over-quarter results can be found in the appendix on Slide 21. For DTE Gas, earnings for the quarter were $87 million compared to $111 million last year. As stated earlier, the significant change in weather was the primary driver of this variance.","Gas Storage and Pipeline earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Earnings for the quarter were up $3 million over last year due to higher pipeline and gathering earnings from production that came online after the first quarter of 2015. Storage earnings were also higher than last year due to lower maintenance expenses. ","Moving down the slide, earnings for our powered industrial projects for $21 million for the quarter, down $12 million for the first quarter last year. This decrease is primarily driven by lower earnings in the steel sector. There's seasonal variability related to the REF volumes and for the balance of the year the REFs will help offset the steel sector decline. Earnings for corporate and other were a negative $7 million for this first quarter of 2016, $18 million favorable over last year due to our first quarter 2015 effective tax rate adjustment which unwound during the rest of that year. The earnings for our growth segments for the first quarter were $258 million or $1.43 per share compared to $282 million or $0.58 per share from last year.","To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our energy trading business. At energy trading, the first quarter operating earnings were $16 million, up $4 million from the first quarter last year driven by stronger realized gas portfolio performance. I trading company is off to another good start. Trading's economic contribution for the first quarter 2016 was $18 million. Slide 28 of the appendix contains our standard energy trading reconciliation showing both economic and accounting performance. We typically wait until the mid-year earnings call to assess the trading company's range of accounting income contribution for the year. At that point we have a good sense of how much accounting income will be flowing through to cover current year operating expenses.","I'd like to move now to Slide 12. Slide 12 provides a quick overview of our capital expenditures through the first quarter of the year. Capital spending was lower than last year primarily due to the purchasing of a peaking generating asset in 2015. Our CapEx guidance range remains at $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion for 2016. ","I'll go into more detail on some of our utility capital plans on the next two slides. I'd just like to turn now to Slide 13 and our electric utility. I want to highlight one of the key areas of focus for our electric utilities segment, which is improving customer related distribution reliability. We are making significant investments in our distribution infrastructure to improve reliability and address growth in certain areas of our service territory. ","Over the next 10 years we'll spend $6.5 billion replacing aging infrastructure and overloaded substations, as well as consolidating existing substations and adding technology and automation to provide greater visibility in to the system for outage prevention and detection. As we said in the past this 10 year investment of $6.5 billion in distribution infrastructure can increase up to an additional $4 billion in reliability investments. ","Customer affordability is at the forefront of our planning and will guide and determine how much total distribution or reliability investment we will do in this time frame. ","Now at slide 14, this slide highlights a large component of our investment at DTE Gas expanded main renewal program. We will invest $600 million over the next five years upgrading the gas system. Our plan to replace 4,000 miles of cast iron and unprotected main steel was accelerated to cut the completion time in half from 50 years to 25 years.","The MPSC approved the acceleration of the infrastructure recovery mechanism at the end of last year. Upgrading the gas main system benefits our customers by reducing costly leaks and assuring the basic gas infrastructure has service territory is there for future generations.","As you can see from the previous two slides, our CapEx plan will address the needs of our customers and the aging infrastructure while being mindful of customer affordability. We've been consistent in our messaging over the years that maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority. So on slide 15 provides a key balance sheet metrics we target and monitor. FFO to debt and leverage. This slide shows the projected level for each metric. Our near term equity issuance plans are $200 million to $300 million over the next three years, and we continue to evaluate our equity needs for this year.","As we discussed on our year-end call, the extension of bonus depreciation provides $300 million to $400 million of favorable cash flow over the next five years, which help reduce our equity needs in the near term. The strength of our balance sheet sets us up nicely as we enter a period of incremental infrastructure improvements, and we're confident that our plans allow us to maintain this balance sheet strength.","Let me wrap up on slide 17 and we can move to Q&A. This strong first quarter, even with a good amount of unfavorable weather, we are confident that we will achieve our operating earnings guidance of $4.80 to $5.05 per share, which will extend our streak to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. We are making significant utilities infrastructure improvements that will continue to provide affordable and reliable service to our customers. We have meaningful investment opportunities at our gas pipeline segment with our investments in Millennium, Bluestone and the NEXUS pipeline. In our Power and Industrial Segment we have opportunities with building on site co-generation projects.","Going forward, we continue to target operating EPS of 5% to 6% for our growth segments and part of our shareholder value equation is to continue to grow our dividends in line with these earnings. We maintain our commitment to a strong balance sheet, which can provide future growth opportunities.","Before I open up to Q&A, I know many of you on the call have been waiting for my Detroit Tiger update. So I have to give a quick update of my hometown Detroit Tigers because no DTE earnings call would be complete without it. This year definitely started out well for the Tigers, but recently they've been having some problems with their pitching. The weather for this year's home opener game in Detroit was definitely favorable for our gas utility as it was one of the coldest home openers ever played in Comerica Park. Our fans braved the weather and packed Comerica Park to watch us beat the Yankees which was our 8th consecutive home opening win. It is always a good day when we beat the Yankees. ","With that I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So, Cynthia, we can open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathon Arnold from Deutsche Bank. ","Jonathon Arnold ","Good morning, guys. ","Gerry Anderson","Good morning, Jonathon. ","Jonathon Arnold ","Couple of quick questions. I think I understood that the delta in the tax rate on the quarter was primarily due to a higher-than-normal rate in Q1 last year. But I'm just curious if the 26% that we see on the GAAP income statement is what you consider to be normal here or whether there was also a benefit in Q1 kind of versus the run rate?","Peter Oleksiak","No, it is normal, and our effective tax rate is close to that 26%. So it will time out throughout the year. Last year just because of reported earnings being higher, we had higher tax expense that quarter which normalized throughout that year.","Jonathon Arnold ","Great, okay. And then I was just curious \u2013 Gerry, in your opening remarks, you talked about having prepped for the El Nino winter and come out of it okay. You obviously had a big quarter in the trading business. I'm wondering if \u2013 was that part of the positioning for the winter? You set yourselves up there, or was it expense management? Just give us a little more flavor of what you were alluding to terms of the offset.","Gerry Anderson","When I said we came out of the quarter the way we wanted, I was really talking about our growth segments. The trading I would \u2013 it's really a separate discussion. So no, we weren't talking about positioning our trading company. What we really did is just look at the odds the way the El Nino was setting up last summer that we would have a warm winter, and the odds are very high when you look across past statistical data. So we all looked at ourselves and said, look, if the odds are this high, we're just going to take it as a given and plan for it. ","So we did go into our expenses, we went after additional productivity in the business. So we always look for productivity improvements but we went for more than normal and that was hard work to put the plan together but it paid off. And we don't publish our plan, or make public our plan but I do feel really good about the way we exited the quarter in our growth businesses relative to the plan we had for the year and that's why you're hearing a confident tone on our ability to play out and meet or exceed our guidance for the year. Trading just is coming on, I mean they had a really good first quarter as Peter said, we usually wait until mid-year to kind of give you a better sense. So we'll probably at our mid-year call update you on those earnings and then give you probably a conservative forecast for where we think trading will land for the year.","Jonathon Arnold ","Can you give any insight into how \u2013 what was the main driver of their performance in a risk context, perhaps? ","Gerry Anderson","We've been migrating that business more and more physical. So for example, the gas business is a very active business in moving gas both in the Marcellus and beginning to play in the Utica area to take gas to market. So that's been a growing and profitable segment. We also are a supplier to other utilities in some other full requirements services businesses. And that segment did very well for us this quarter. So it's kind of lining up supply for the utilities who are in markets that have restructured but still have a responsibility to supply their retail customers. We provide them wholesale to do that.","Jonathon Arnold ","Great. Thank you very much guys.","Gerry Anderson","Great. Thanks","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill from Barclays.","Gerry Anderson","Hey Greg.","Gregg Orrill","Yes, thank you. Hi. Could you talk a little bit more about the legislation and your thoughts around the prospects there and the timeline?","Gerry Anderson","So I've been saying for a while that Mike Nofs is a good guy to be steering this. Mike was one of two principal architects of the 2008 legislation so he's the most knowledgeable guy in the Michigan legislature on this whole topic. Mike has been working this is a very systematic way since early this year and he\u2019s now moved it to a point where he feels like he's ready to take the bills, there are two bills \u2013 out into the open and take commentary this week and next and he\u2019ll then evaluate, look do I feel like things are right for a vote.","I think his intention is to come through that discussion period and bring it to a vote here some time in May, probably the first half of May ideally. And then that legislation will be pushed back over to the House. Then the question in the House is how quickly can it move there? Will they be in a position to move it before the summer recess, or like in 2008 will it come back after the summer recess and be acted on then.","In 2008, just having been part of that, I spent kind of a year of my life involved in that one. The way it played out is actually in that case, the House finished the action just prior to the summer recess and then the Senate came back and acted right after the recess. So we'll wait and see, but I think the hope would be that we'll get out of the Senate and act on it in the House as well prior to the recess, but if that didn't happen, it could play out like 2008 did.","Gregg Orrill","Okay. Thanks.","Gerry Anderson","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi. Good morning. ","Gerry Anderson","Good morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So just coming back to the NEXUS project, don't want to belabor this one too much this go-around. But just curious a little bit on the nature of the contracts signed, and specifically, if you could elaborate on future opportunities for further contracts, whether they are generators or utilities. And then ultimately, as you think about moving forward on the project, where do you stand under contracts today from an ROE perspective on the project? Taking it as a given that you are going to move forward, how does it compare versus what you are targeting ultimately in terms of the ROE range you've kind of alluded to?","Gerry Anderson","I think I'm going to turn this one over to Jerry Norcia. So Jerry, why don't you respond to those...","Jerry Norcia","Sure. Great. So the nature of the contracts we have on NEXUS today, about half the capacity is committed to by LDCs in Michigan as well as Ontario. And then we have three producers that are also anchor tenants. So I would say about half is LDCs and half is producers. In terms of incremental markets, I think it will come from both classes of customers. We're pursuing both LDCs in Ohio, Michigan, Ontario and the mid-west for incremental volumes, as well as other producers that are interested in moving gas for these markets. I think we are well positioned for that. So those discussions are underway.","In terms of returns, we're happy to proceed with the returns that we have based on the contractual commitments that we have today. And as we've said before, I think we've got about two thirds of our total commitment signed with long term contracts today.","Gerry Anderson","So just to add on to that, I think we've said in discussions with investors previously, we typically move ahead with these projects at about 80% subscription level. We're a bit below that, obviously because the market took a pause while we were in process, but the combination of the geology here and those interconnect agreements, I mean those 1.75 BCF of interconnect agreements which really are a substantial part of our subscriptions right now, I mean that represents more capacity than the pipe itself has. So we think that'll be a significant source of future demand, not to mention markets in Illinois, Wisconsin, et cetera.","So the combination of the quality of the geology and so forth is what's given us the confidence to move forward. I would say that you really create the hot value out of pipeline projects as you get full subscription and then expand. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re kind of down in the willing to proceed but not in the hot zone with the level that we're at. And so we are looking to add capacity over time.","Jerry Norcia","I\u2019m sorry, go for it.","Gerry Anderson","No, I said add capacity. I really meant add new customers over time to first fill and then expand.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, all right. But no specific ROE expectations given the two-thirds, though?","Gerry Anderson","I would just characterize it as kind of meeting our threshold requirements. But we\u2019re looking to move it from meeting our kind of threshold requirements to taking it up to what really makes a pipeline project sing, which is getting into the full and then expansion zone. So we're happy to proceed given where we stand now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And then if I can ask you to elaborate a little bit on the P&I side of the equation. You commented on softness in the first quarter and specifically comment that REF would help offset it through the balance of the year. Can you elaborate a little bit more on specifically how those numbers are turning out? And then with regards to the P&I more broadly, how are you thinking about this business and the optimization of the overall portfolio businesses you have in the context of the pipe?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes we anticipated the softness in the steel sector, so we put that into our guidance as you look at the first quarter results that was anticipated when we published the guidance for the year. For the REF segment, that's tied to coal production. There is seasonality. Most of the coal production occurs in the third quarter. So we'll see those REF earnings helping to offset the steel sector. We also had some projects come in late last year on the REF segment. So you'll start seeing those materialize as well coming into at the second half of this year as well. So there is seasonality with the REF we do. And we overall are confident with the segment guidance that we put out there for P&I.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And with regards to the future P&I?","Gerry Anderson","I think on the future a couple thoughts. So REF will continue to be a good business and so is cash flow. Steel as well as things where we've been through this before. So we contract with our steel customers. But contracts rollover and we had one of the contracts roll over at a soft point in the steel cycle. But our typical experience is a couple years after the soft point you're often in a point of recovery and not long after that a hot point in the steel market.","So I think we'll have the opportunity to see that part of the P&I business return. That's certainly been our experience over the years in past ups and downs in steel. The most active area for investment, I think Peter mentioned, is cogeneration projects. We have a number of those that are under serious discussion with counter parties. So we'd expect that to be the place where we could put quality capital to work. And we continue to be focused as we kind of laid out in our five-year plan on understanding that the REF earnings roll off in the early 2020s that we would back fill those earnings with quality investments like the cogeneration.","And that's the plan for the company in terms of producing the 5% to 6% earnings through 2020 and beyond. So we've done a 10-year plan, we are counting on P&I growing in absolute terms, kind of holding its own as REF rolls out while the segments continue to grow.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it but then for this year, kind of flattish as one offsets the other.","Gerry Anderson","Yes, I think that's right, we're still feeling flattish. As Peter said steel was known and we knew that last September when we had analysts into Detroit. But REF is both cyclical and was a bit soft in the first quarter just because of a warm winter and substitution of gas for coal and those sorts of things. So it was down somewhat. But as we assess the prospects for the balance of the year, we still feel good about the guidance we have out there for the segment.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thanks. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Goginham Partners.","Shar Pourreza","Good morning. ","Gerry Anderson","Good morning. ","Peter Oleksiak","Morning, Shar. ","Shar Pourreza","Could we just get a quick update on Bluestone and then sort of if you could just elaborate on any contingencies you have in place? If sort of that production schedule with the producers remains kind of weak?","Peter Oleksiak","Go ahead, Gerry.","Gerry Anderson","Yes, I think right now we're feeling very good about the guidance we issued for the midstream segment. Production that's flowing is in line with what we had estimated. And actually we also feel good about the future there. I think the prospect for Southwestern drilling in that area as commodity prices continue to strengthen become more positive as time goes on. So we feel real good about where we are in 2016. ","Peter Oleksiak","Southwestern was out publically talking recently and I would say that what we are seeing in our exposure to Southwestern is very consistent with their comments publicly, and consistent with the plan that we have out. So when Gerry says we feel good, I think we'd say that it's consistent with what we expected and is playing out in a way that supports the plan.","And then, you know, you look down the road you're beginning to see gas prices for early next year strengthen. I think they were $3-ish when we were talking about them yesterday. And you know, people keep concluding that the drilling's pulled back, but gas declined at 15% in the United States, and you can only allow a 15% decline before \u2013 only allow that for so long before you need to being to backfill it.","And the most obvious place is for Southwestern and other people to begin drilling again is in the Northeast Marcellus and in the Utica I think the well quality there is still high. So our expectation is, is we've pushed up gas supplies in the country awfully hard in 2015. People are on a pause, but they're going to need to step back into it when they do, we expect it to be in the areas we have exposure to.","Shar Pourreza","Got it, that's helpful. And then could you just maybe elaborate on where you are at as far as any potential midstream acquisitions to fill any gaps? Or are we still kind of far off?","Gerry Anderson","We've been in the process of looking at many assets, or at least a handful of that we're very interested in. One of the things that we're finding is that these assets are still trading at premium values. Some recent transactions have illustrated that. We're \u2013 we still have a handful that we're looking at actively pursuing. I think in addition to that we are also looking at greenfield opportunities where we've had most of our success in the last 12 or 14 years in this space. So we've got both in motion to secure incremental growth for the business.","Shar Pourreza","Okay, got it. And just lastly on your capital outlook, I mean obviously you guys have more capital than you can afford. And I think historically, sort of the rate impact to the customer has been that sea link [ph]. What \u2013 is there any sort of guidance you could provide as far as what rate inflation you target when it comes to your spending outlook?","Gerry Anderson","If you look at our recent performance there, rates have been negative, so if you go back to 2012 and compare them to today we're down, and even after the current rate case plays out we'll be flat to down to 2012, so we've been able to work our way through a very heavy capital investment period with rates down. And I'm talking about base rates. The future \u2013 we've consistently say that we're trying to keep rate increases in the range of inflation, so around 3% as you work your way through one of these intense capital investment cycles.","And that's going to require us to both measure the pace of capital investment but also keep the focus on productivity and continuous improvement that we've had in order to do that. So you know what the blend of capital and O&M is. We've got to keep the O&M. Our O&M in recent years, the increase has been zero. And when you can blend a zero with the increases that come from capital, you can hold it at something reasonable. Now we can't commit to zero in the future. But we've worked in the past very, very hard to keep it there. The future is, that's unlikely, you can't continue that forever. But we'll work hard on C&I and we will continue to measure the pace of investment. I think we've said that, for example in our distribution business, there's a lot of demand for investment. But we're going to have to high grade those projects and do the most important ones, we're really doing that from a customer affordability perspective.","Shar Pourreza","Terrific. Thanks so much. ","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon ","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Gerry Anderson","Hi Greg.","Greg Gordon ","I think you gave us a good framework for how you're thinking about power and industrials in terms of what you have to achieve to hit your guidance. But frankly, I think the stock is \u2013 has underperformed year to-date. Not because people are worried about your utility businesses, but because they are worried about that business and they are worried about the gas pipeline and storage business. And the hurdles to hit the guidance you've laid out. So focusing back on the pipeline business, NEXUS is two-thirds contracted, but these interconnect agreements are pretty substantial.","Should we assume that shorter hauls for those interconnects at a certain percentage of those interconnect commitments could get you well into the range of an acceptable ROE on the pipe? Or do you need to get fully contracted for delivery to dawn at a higher percentage in order to hit your return hurdles or some combination of both?","Peter Oleksiak","So I think both will happen. So I think what these interconnect agreements that we have really provide pipeline with a lot of diversity and supply opportunity. So our shippers, long-term shippers on the pipe as well as new shippers that we expect to come on the pipe will use these interconnects as ways to deliver the various markets up and down the pipe, especially in Ohio. And the way I expect that those will turn into real opportunities and real commitments, absolutely. I think that's a given that that will happen. I think in terms of more long haul, we are in discussions with several parties to sign them for more long hauls. So I think what you'll see here as the pipeline build, you'll start to see those interconnects become very active market points for us, and provide what I'd call a lot of optionality to future shippers on a pipe. And I think that'll make it a very attractive pipeline that will allow us to get both short haul and long haul commitments. So I expect both to happen.","Greg Gordon","Okay. In terms of permitting, we just saw obviously a big negative surprise out of New York last week on a different pipeline project. What are the remaining permits you need, beyond just the FERC approval, to get this pipe into the ground?","Peter Oleksiak","I think the big one we're waiting for right now is a FERC notice of schedule, which we expect to happen during the second quarter. And I think we're in really good shape with that. We're getting very good feedback from the FERC in terms of the quality of our filings. I think a lot of our issues we're managing quite well \u2013 routing issues. We're well underway with our right-of-way acquisition process.","And I think in terms of other permits, there are some large customary permits that come with a FERC-regulated pipeline, like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other various permits. But those are the big ones \u2013 I think the FERC order which we expect by the end of this year, and also the other large customary permits, I think they're proceeding very well at this point in time.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And then when I look at \u2013 go back and look at your year-end analyst deck, you said you \u2013 your aspiration is to grow operating earnings from $110 million at the midpoint in 2016 from this segment to $170 million in 2020. If Bluestone were to sort of flatline from here in terms of its earnings contribution and you didn't achieve any bolt-on acquisition, what would that number be? Would it be significantly lower? Would it be only modestly lower? Because really just the crux of the issue on people's problem with valuing the stock is concerns over the growth in this business.","Gerry Anderson","Yes, so I'd say the prospects of Bluestone flatlining are \u2013 I wouldn't frame it that way. We're expanding Bluestone, and we're expanding Millennium. And I think the prospects we see are from more of that. So there's \u2013 you were mentioning cancellation of a pipeline. What we're seeing in the Northeast is a continued pull for gas. They have to have gas for power generation, and the oil to gas conversions continue. So the demand for gas continues to be very, very strong, but there's real resistance in New York and other areas of the Northeast to new pipeline. I think that's what that's likely to do in fact, New York called this out explicitly is bias toward expansions of existing pipes.","So I think the likelihood of some of this resistance you're seeing is that owners of existing position, including Millennium and Bluestone, will see people coming to them as the most credible and doable paths and expansion path to market. So I just start by saying \u2013 I think what we're seeing evolving in the market is a positive for the asset position you have there. Bluestone and Millennium are attached to really good geology and there's resistance in the market of creating new outlet, altogether new outlets for that geology, which means the existing ones are going to have to expand.","And then the long-term growth in our NEXUS is an important part of that growth, but when look out five years and ask, what is the current dynamic in 2016 really mean for 2020? Not much. The gas demand in 2020 is going to be what it's going to be, and power generation conversions are going to be underway, and so the geology is going to have to deliver, the pipes are going to have to deliver.","Now I think that you could say in the short-term did production get out in front of itself a bit with, a lot of excitement in the market. The answer to that is obviously yes, so there's an adjustment in the near-term, and it's changed the path to get to 2020, but the ultimate point that the market needs to achieve in 2020 hasn't changed for either production or delivery through pipes to meet demand. So we really don't see a lot of impact long-term, although the path to get there has changed from what it might have been.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thanks a lot, guys. Have a good day.","Gerry Anderson","You too, Greg.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes, Paul. Good morning.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Ridzon","So with Senator Nofs prepared to move the bill this week, what do we read into that as far as any progress that may have been made with the schools and with the Chamber of Commerce?","Gerry Anderson","Senator Nofs has been in active discussion with the Chamber, and I think I will \u2013 I'm not going to put words in the Senator's mouth. The coalition he's put together I think would be better for him to play that out, but he has been in active discussion with the Chamber. I think he's also put some provisions in the bill that broaden its interest to his Democratic colleagues, so if you look at the energy efficiency provisions, that's positive in terms of broadening the appeal. He also does have the 30% goal. It\u2019s not a mandate, but it\u2019s a goal, by 2025 for renewables and energy efficiency. That\u2019s something the administration has advocated for as we have democrats in the house. So I do think what you see is Senator Nofs listening very, very carefully to a whole range of participants trying to broaden the coalition to the point where he can be successful.","Paul Ridzon","And it\u2019s my understanding that the bill, when we see it, will have a provision where shoppers who leave actually have the opportunity to come back. How are you thinking about that?","Gerry Anderson","Right. So, they do today and they will in the future. We never thought there would be or should be a prohibition on retail open access customers coming back. But the \u2013 I think what you\u2019ll see when you look at the legislation is that there\u2019s a lot more integrity now in terms of the reliability provisions related to this. So the suppliers to the retail open access market need to carry their fair share of local resources that needs to be real. Need to have ties to real local resources for reliability.","Customers who leave the queue, if somebody should come out from under the cap and somebody goes in, we\u2019ll be paying a demand charge, so there\u2019s a series of provisions. So, without me going into all the details, that really do shore up the reliability for that \u2013 the reliability provisions related to that 10% of the market.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you very much.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Jerry Norcia","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Quick question first on the distribution reliability. You are showing the $6.5 billion 10-year plan here. You\u2019ve previously talked about potential for that to be over $10 billion even. Remind us: is that give it potential to add some of the extra stuff there? Does that depend on your ability to cut costs or the state energy law? Or what might be some of the swing factors of getting that into the plan? And when might those decisions be made?","Jerry Norcia","So, I think what we\u2019ve said on that one is that there\u2019s a lot of demand on our distribution system. It\u2019s an aging infrastructure system as we evaluate the need, a need currently outstrips what we think customer affordability will enable. So in order for us to do more of that and kind of work our way into that backlog, it would depend on us finding productivity opportunities. Or if there were things, for example, that evolved on the generation side that were \u2013 required less capital, we could conceivably push some of this needed investment in.","But we are kind of calibrating how much of that we do based upon affordability, because we\u2019ve consistently said that companies that don\u2019t pay careful attention to that when they\u2019re going through a big investment cycle end up losing. You just need to go through these cycles in a way where your customers feel their affordability is workable.","So that\u2019s really what determines how much of the $10.5 billion we would spend versus the $6.5 billion. And you\u2019re right, we can find either capital offsets or productivity offsets, those are the things that would enable us to do more of that needed investment.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, great. Next question is related to Millennium in New York. It\u2019s something I already made reference to the -- a different pipeline basically getting shut down because of it because of regulators not supporting pipeline expansion there. Do you see any risk to the plans for Millennium specifically?","Jerry Norcia","The way I\u2019ll answer that is that with our pipeline investments that we\u2019ve been able to secure through the FERC as well as with New York regulators, for example, we\u2019ve been able to secure an expansion of Bluestone most recently through the New York regulators, and that\u2019s actually a pipeline regulated by New York in New York. And then, secondly, we secured the last two compressor expansions for Millennium through FERC as well as working with New York regulators.","So I think what we\u2019re \u2013 as Gerry described earlier, I think the regulators are pointing towards existing assets as ways to expand into a growing market. So, as you know, we\u2019ve got a Millennium pipeline expansion where we\u2019ve made a FERC pre-filing. That\u2019s going well. We are in active conversations with regulators in Albany on that expansion, and we feel that those conversations are going well. So we \u2013 at this point, we feel pretty confident that we\u2019ll secure our expansion approvals for Millennium.","Gerry Anderson","So Bluestone runs both in Pennsylvania and New York, so you need approvals out of both states. But our recent expansion of Bluestone \u2013 our conversations were very productive. And as Jerry mentioned, same is true for Millennium. So our experience has been that, when the need is clear and you\u2019re dealing with an existing asset with I guess you\u2019d say more modest implications. You can have a productive conversation and work your way through it, and that\u2019s what our last two rounds of discussion in Albany have produced.","Andrew Weisel","Very good. Last question. You added a comment there about continuing to evaluate current-year equity needs. You previously talked about targeting $100 million of equity in 2016. Which direction are you thinking? Are you trying to find ways to maybe reduce that number? Or is that more an implication that if you were to make an acquisition, for example in the midstream business, maybe you would issue some equity?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. We always go into the year \u2013 we have a big focus on cash in the company, and so we did indicate that over the three-year period, it\u2019s a $200 million to $300 million and then we potentially can do up to $100 million this year. We\u2019re assessing that. Our goal would be if we can to make that zero. It\u2019s probably too early to say that. We\u2019re going to see how the year plays out and the cash flows of the company plays out. I\u2019ll still say that $200 million to $300 million over the three-year period, it\u2019s still a good number and we\u2019re assessing how much do we actually need to do of that $200 million to $300 million this year.","Andrew Weisel","So it\u2019s more a timing?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes.","Gerry Anderson","Well I\u2019d say I think what Peter is indicating is that I think our Q says up to $100 million, which implies that the bias would be down given everything we know, but your comment was also right. If we found a great opportunity for investment that we thought create a lot of value that could be the thing that pushes you up toward the high end of equity. So those are really the two balances, as Peter said, we\u2019re always working cash and cash flow. And we\u2019re off to a good start. So our hope would be to be playing out in the up-to zone, not the add $100 million, and the one potential offset is if we found a great investment.","Andrew Weisel","And will the equity needs have an impact on the dividend decision, which you typically announce in June, and have a relatively low payout ratio?","Gerry Anderson","No. We typically will grow the dividend in line with the earnings versus the amount. So the amount of equity we\u2019re issuing is not going to have an impact on our dividend decision.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Thank you very much guys.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn our conference back over to today\u2019s speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Gerry Anderson","Well, I will just wrap up by again thanking everybody for joining the call this morning. As I said at the outset, one quarter into the year, we feel very good about how things are progressing versus planned both with respect to earnings and relative to a number of our key priorities. Look forward to giving you all updates. We\u2019ll be down at AGA and a number of other conferences before we\u2019re back on a call like this for the mid-year. So thanks for joining. Look forward to talking to you soon.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",""],"8023":["DTE Energy Co.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Barbara Tuckfield. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Barbara Tuckfield - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you, Mindy, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to read the Safe Harbor statement on page 2 of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings provided in the appendix.","With us this morning are Gerry Anderson, Chairman and CEO; Jerry Norcia, President and COO; and Peter Oleksiak, Senior Vice President and CFO. We also have members of the management team to call upon during the Q&A session.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gerry to start the call.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","All right. Well, thank you, Barb, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. So, this morning I'm going to give you a recap of our performance for the first quarter of 2018, including an update on a couple of key developments and initiatives at the company. Then I'll hand it over to Peter, who will provide a detailed financial review of the quarter, and Jerry Norcia then will provide similar in-depth business updates.","So, let me turn you to slide 5. So, top line we are off to a very good start to 2018 and with one quarter behind us, I am very confident that we will deliver on our financial plans this year. Longer term, we continue to target the 5% to 7% operating earnings per share growth rate through 2022 that we have discussed with you in recent years. And just as a reminder, 2018 guidance is the base for this growth rate.","On the renewable energy front, we recently filed a plan with the Michigan Public Service Commission to significantly increase our renewable energy capacity over the next few years. And if approved, this will drive increased investment in new wind and solar projects and will double our current renewable energy capacity. I'll provide you with some more details on that plan in a few minutes.","DTE Electric received its final rate order last week, and that order set our ROE at 10% versus 10.1% previously. And it maintained our debt equity mix at 50\/50 versus our request, which was at 49\/51. So, those two items combined with the O&M increase defined in the case mean that we're going to maintain our earnings guidance range for DTE Electric of $648 million to $662 million, but will be biased to the lower end of that range given the changes.","That said, we continue to work very constructively with the Michigan Public Service Commission on a number of important issues. So, after months of collaborative work with the MPSC staff, in January we filed a comprehensive five-year plan for our distribution system. Additionally, we recently submitted our updated Renewable Energy Plan for the next five years and I feel we're well aligned with the MPSC in this area.","And then, third our Certificate of Necessity or CON filing for our gas combined cycle plant will be finalized later this week, on Friday actually. And we expect a constructive outcome in that proceeding.","We also have a rate case in motion for our gas utility. In this filing, we requested that the MPSC approve an increase to the number of miles of main that we renew on an annual basis, and we've had productive discussions with the staff on that issue. We expect to receive a final order in that case in September.","Moving to the non-utility businesses. Our Gas Storage & Pipeline business is off to a very strong start to 2018. Our earnings in this business line are running hot, and we expect to be biased to the high-end of our earnings projections here. We're making significant progress on the NEXUS pipeline with several construction milestones achieved, and we do remain on track for in-service late in the third quarter of the year.","Construction on both our Millennium CPV Lateral and the east side expansion are also going well, and we're still focused on in-service dates for those projects in the second half of the year.","We also continue to be encouraged by the financial performance of our 2016 Link acquisition, and we can talk a bit more about that later.","At our Power & Industrial business, earnings are also running hot this year. And as at GSP, we expect to be biased to the high-end of our earnings range in that business. P&I also continues to make really encouraging progress on its growth plan. We have several very promising development initiatives underway that Jerry Norcia will describe in greater detail a little later.","So moving on now to slide 6. I think, you'll recall that just about a year ago we laid out our plan to transition to cleaner energy sources and to reduce our carbon emissions by over 80% by 2050.","As I briefly mentioned earlier, we recently submitted our 2018 Renewable Energy Plan to the Michigan Public Service Commission. This plan proposes 1,000 megawatts of carbon-free electricity from new wind and solar projects in Michigan that would be completed by 2022. A portion of that capital investment is a pull ahead of capital that we had later in our long-term or 10-year plan.","Michigan, as you know, is in the process of implementing the bipartisan legislation that was passed in 2016 to address the state's energy transition. And this renewable plan that we've submitted enables us to achieve the 15% renewable standard by 2021 that is laid out in that legislation.","Also this plan is another significant step toward our carbon emission reduction goals, and those goals can be met in a way that continue to deliver reliable and affordable power for our customers as well.","If approved, these renewable energy projects would drive an investment of more than $1.7 billion in Michigan and would double DTE Energy's renewable energy capacity.","So to give you some specifics, we plan to bring the Pine River wind park online later this year and the Polaris wind park online in 2020. And together these two parks will total 330 megawatts of new capacity and will be DTE's largest and most efficient wind parks to date.","We'll also be adding an additional 300 megawatts of new wind capacity in 2020 to supply a new voluntary renewable energy program targeted at our large business customers who are seeking to reduce carbon emissions.","Then in 2021 and 2022, we will be adding two additional wind parks that will provide a combined 375 megawatts of capacity.","Along with the increased wind capacity, we're also planning on adding 15 megawatts of solar power. So wind today is clearly lower cost than solar in Michigan, and thus we're really concentrated on wind capacity in the near-term. But solar costs are improving. And we expect that by the mid-2020s, solar will be ready to play a more prominent role in our mix.","Of course, we will continue to add more renewable energy beyond the dates defined in the plan that we've submitted.","DTE has already reduced its carbon emissions by over 25% over the last 10 years, and in the process has driven investments of about $2.5 billion in Michigan's renewable sector and has added 1,000 megawatts of wind and solar capacity.","By 2023, when we play out the plan I just described, we expect our carbon emissions to be down 30% to 35%. It's interesting that that was the range that was laid out for us for 2030 in the Clean Power Plan. So we're going to be down significantly by the early 2020s. And then we plan to be down 45% by 2030 and 75% by 2040, as we continue to play out our transformation.","With that said, before these goals are achievable and achievable in a way that'll maintain both reliability and customer affordability, and the 2050 timeframe and the 80% reduction that we're targeting align with what scientists broadly have identified as necessary to address climate change.","So reducing our company's carbon emissions and developing cleaner sources of energy, as I think you can pick up, is a key strategic focus for us, and it will continue to be an important area of investment, as we transition our generation fleet.","So with that, I'm going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to talk a bit more about our financial results.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Gerry, and good morning, everyone. First, like to give a quick update on my rebuilding Detroit Tigers as we're finalizing the first full month of the season. Our Tigers are off to a slow start as anticipated, but are still within striking distance of first place and actually there were some pretty young prospects that looked promising.","But unlike our Detroit Tigers, actually we got off to a really strong first quarter as you can see on slide 8. We had an operating earnings of $342 million or $1.91 per share. And for reference, our reported earnings were $361 million or $2 per share and you can find a breakdown of the EPS by segment including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix.","Let's touch on each segment in detail, starting at the top with our electric utility. DTE Electric earnings for the quarter were $142 million or $36 million higher than the first quarter of last year. This was driven by lower storm expense, a return to normal weather, and the implementation of new rates. There's a more detailed year-over-year earnings variance for DTE Electric, which can be found in the appendix.","For DTE Gas segment, operating earnings were $111 million and were $4 million higher than last year. This increase was driven primarily by return to normal weather offset by higher O&M.","For Gas Storage & Pipelines business, operating earnings were $62 million for the first quarter, or $17 million higher than last year. This increase was due to the lower tax rate, as well as increased gathering and transport volumes, mainly in the Bluestone area.","Operating earnings for the Power & Industrial businesses were $42 million, or $12 million higher than 2017. And this is primarily due to higher REF volumes and higher steel related earnings, as well as the lower tax rate.","As you know on our year-end call, we increased our EPS guidance by $0.10 per share due to tax reform, which is wholly tied to the non-utility businesses. And you're starting to see that play out here in the first quarter.","Rounding out our growth segments in the first quarter is Corporate & Other, which is $32 million unfavorable compared to last year due to a smaller benefit of a stock compensation, a lower tax rate, as well as timing of taxes. Remember last year the first quarter was impacted favorably due to an accounting change related to the simplifying GAAP accounting for taxes on stock-based compensation, which is why we saw that large positive earnings number in the first quarter last year.","We saw the benefit this year for accounting change, but it's much lower than last year. So, for the first quarter results are \u2013 for Corporate & Other are more in line with historical results. Energy Trading had operating earnings of $1 million in the first quarter, which is down $17 million from last year, driven by lower performance and accounting flow through in our power portfolio.","During the quarter, we disclosed that earnings for Energy Trading were coming in lower than the first quarter last year. And we mentioned the potential for a modest accounting loss in the quarter, but after a solid performance in the power and gas portfolio in March, we finished the quarter strong with slightly positive earnings.","And for the quarter, Energy trading contributed $8 million of economic income, so a good quarter economically. The appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliations showing both economic and accounting performance. Overall, DTE earned $1.91 per share in the first quarter of 2018 or $0.12 more than last year.","Let's move to our 2018 guidance slide, which is on page 9. I'll start with the top of the slide with DTE Electric. As Gerry mentioned we did receive a rate order at our electric company and earnings for this segment will be biased to the lower end of the range based on the factors he described earlier. We still have a lot of the year to play out including the summer weather, and we'll continue to update you on Electric earnings as the year progresses.","For DTE Gas, we feel comfortable that we are on plan this year. We'll receive a decision on our current rate case at the end of the third quarter, and we feel good about the earnings projections for this segment.","For our GSP and P&I segments, we increased the earnings guidance on the yearend call, and as was mentioned earlier these segments are seeing positive impacts of volume favorability. And as you can see by the indicating arrows, we expect to land at the higher end of guidance for both these segments, due mainly to these increased volumes.","Energy Trading had $1 million of earnings in the first quarter. And we are comfortable with the $5 million to $20 million guidance range we have for this business. So, overall, we feel confident about achieving our operating EPS guidance of $5.57 to $5.99 for this year.","Now, I'd like to turn over to Jerry Norcia to discuss our long-term growth.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you, Peter. I'll begin on slide 11. We continue to see growth in our utilities fueled by our investment in infrastructure and generation. As Gerry mentioned, we received our Electric rate order, this rate increase is more than offset by future rate reductions driven by tax reform, sort of allows DTE Electric to recover necessary investments to continue to increase reliability and improve customer satisfaction.","Early this month, we had one of the worst ice storms the company has experienced in the last decade. The ice storm unfortunately left over 400,000 of our customers without power. That's nearly 20% of our electric customers, which tells you how significant this ice storm was. Utility really came together with 1,600 workers from DTE and five other states, and we worked round the clock to restore service to our customers. Restoration crews put up approximately 250 miles of new power lines; enough wire to reach from Detroit to Traverse City. This storm reinforced the need to harden our aging infrastructure.","We're facing the same aging infrastructure challenges that many other utilities are experiencing. And in that regard, in January, we filed an updated five-year distribution plan. This plan provides a comprehensive description of our distribution investment and maintenance programs for the five-year period from 2018 to 2022. It includes details on the condition of the distribution system, cost benefit analysis concerning both capital and O&M, system maintenance and investment strategies that improve resiliency, mitigate the cost associated with inclement weather and, of course, all the associated performance metrics that come with those investments.","We are focused on maintaining the existing distribution assets in a cost effective manner for decades and only expanding this, the system when it was needed to meet demand. However, many of these assets are reaching an age and condition that require them to be replaced in the coming years.","The rebound in Michigan's economy and the revitalization of many of its businesses require that the infrastructure be upgraded to continue to serve customers in a reliable manner.","In addition, as new technologies come to the energy sector, the grid must be upgraded and automated in a way that will enable us to operate more efficiently and reliably. Our distribution plan lays out the strategy for investing in a grid that will serve Michigan's residents and businesses for years to come.","Now let's move on to our generation system. We filed Certificate of Necessity last year to build a natural gas-fired power plant. We expect an order from the Michigan Public Service Commission at the end of this week, on Friday as a matter of fact. The almost $1 billion project is scheduled to break ground in 2019, creating hundreds of Michigan jobs during construction.","In this filing, DTE determined that building a natural gas-fired plant is the best solution for our customers due to many factors, including the environment, liability, and affordability. New plant will be a highly efficient plant, consuming less than 50% of the fuel per megawatt hour produced than coal plants. We are retiring and emitting nearly 70% less carbon, which is the equivalent of taking 1 million cars off the road. It also enables the build out of renewables providing 24\/7 power when renewable energy is not available.","Natural gas-fired plants will be a critical part of our power generation capacity in decades ahead. Long-term DTE plants produced over three quarters of its power from renewable energy and highly efficient natural gas-fired plants. New plant is scheduled to begin operation in 2022, offsetting some of the capacity that falls off when three of our coal-fired plants retire from service in 2020 to 2023 timeframe.","Let me turn to DTE Gas. Our system has held up well with the cold snap here in April, but similar to the Electric system, we continue to need system hardening. As many of you know, we filed the general rate case in November of 2017, which included a proposal to increase the annual number of miles of main replacement. This proposal will allow the system to be hardened at a quicker pace and will significantly decrease O&M cost.","As always, when considering the investment in system hardening, we are very focused on rate affordability for our customers. With the reduced rates from tax reform, we filed the plan with the MPSC to return the tax benefit to our customers; this would go a long way in mitigating the effects of the rate case and allows us to continue our focus on achieving our affordability goals.","Now let's move on to slide 12 where I'll talk about our non-utility businesses. Our non-utility businesses continue to focus on growth projects. At GSP, we're making significant progress on NEXUS and are continuing work with producers and end-use customers on contracting open capacity on the pipe. We've invested over $700 million through March. Much of the grading of the compressor stations work is done, and we've started grading on the right-of-ways as well at all four spreads. Mainline and facilities construction is under way in Michigan and Ohio. And our goal remains to be at full capacity as the pipe goes in service later this year. Negotiations are continuing with large industrial customers, producers and LDCs. And as we finalize these deals, we will announce them.","Along with NEXUS, Link is continuing to progress with its plan. In other areas of the GSP business, Millennium CPV Lateral, and east side expansion are under construction, and as Gerry mentioned, they'll come online in the second half of the year.","In the year-end call, we told you that our non-utility businesses are clear winners with tax reform and that we would update the 2022 targets for these businesses. We are increasing the 2022 operating earnings of GSP by $35 million to a range of $280 million to $290 million. Our capital investment has not changed; it remains at $2.8 billion to $3.4 billion for the 2018 to 2022 time period.","Now switching over to our P&I business. Since our year-end call, things have heated up in our discussions with one of the CHP deals combining heat and power deals that we are working on, and we are in the beginning stages of the construction for the combined heat and power plant at the Ford Motor Company complex. We're also finalizing one of the RNG project agreements we mentioned on the year-end call. These projects are progressing, but due to competitive reasons, we will not be sharing details on these until the ink is dry on these agreements.","These longer-term agreements will replace a portion of the REF earnings that roll off in 2020 and 2022. Our 2022 plan calls for P&I to produce earnings of $70 million. To achieve that, they need to originate $45 million of new growth by 2022. $15 million or one-third of that growth was originated last year. We feel like we have a very strong line of sight on the next $15 million this year, with the projects that I mentioned that are in late stage discussions. So, we could be at two-thirds done by year-end with four years to go.","We're also making meaningful progress on additional combined heat and power and RNG projects. We mentioned we have an experienced business development group focused on driving these projects to completion, as well as pursuing additional projects that we see as good opportunities for us.","Like GSP, P&I will also benefit from tax reform, and we are increasing the operating earnings by $5 million with a target of $65 million to $75 million by 2022. And capital investment from 2018 to 2022 will remain unchanged at a range of $0.8 billion to $1.2 billion.","Now I'll wrap up on slide 13. We delivered solid first quarter results and remain confident we will achieve our 2018 operating EPS guidance. Our utilities continue to focus on necessary infrastructure investments that improve reliability and the customer experience. With additional expansions and business development, we continue the sustainable growth at the non-utilities.","Finally, I'm confident that we are on track to deliver strong EPS and dividend growth that drive premium total shareholder return.","And with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So, Mindy, can you open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, could you discuss the contracting for the remaining one-third of NEXUS, and what \u2013 specifically I understand it's going to be mostly producer push at this point. And I'm wondering what is the demand from producers that you're seeing out there and \u2013 for capacity? And also what your expectations are for length of term and that kind of thing?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","We're targeting producers. The discussions are underway, negotiations with producers, LDCs and industrial customers, and we are targeting long-term agreements, 15-year agreements.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Are you seeing adequate demand out there to fill the pipe by the completion of construction?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Yes, we are.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","We just need to get ink on paper at this point.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. And how are those negotiations progressing, is there any constraint around them? Yeah.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","They're progressing well, of course, lots of negotiations back and forth, as you can imagine. And we are positioned as one of the pipes that does have capacity to bring to the market quickly. So we feel confident that we'll start closing deals here.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And what kind of a timeline do you see for maybe introducing solar into the mix at the utility?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So we already have introduced solar. In fact, last year we brought online a 50 megawatt, 250 acre solar project, so that was a relatively big one for us. We did it now to push our self down that path.","But when we do the numbers, it's pretty clear that wind today is a superior resource in terms of pricing. So as I said on the call, we're going to lean on wind as long as that difference is there.","But we continue like a lot of people to see solar cost trend down. And I do think probably by the mid-2020s or so, it's going to be ready for a larger share of our renewable mix. So as we think about Renewable Energy Plans beyond the one we just filed, we'll probably see some of that mix begin to shift. Does that hit the answer on that one?","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. I was just wondering about what kind of timing you're seeing on when those prices actually cross the threshold and become competitive with the wind that you already have in there?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Mid-2020s is what it looks like.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So \u2013 and by that time, we will have a pretty large installed base of wind in Michigan. So I think some diversification will be helpful as well. So that explains our thinking.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And one...","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","We want a diverse mix of renewables, but we also want to strike where the price is right, so we're going to wait a bit on large scale investments in solar.","So we'll continue to add at sites like the one we described earlier, the 15 megawatts, and the 50 megawatt site that we did, but we're investing in wind in the 1,000 megawatt sort of scale. That will come for solar a bit later.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just one last question on this. Could you like maybe break out the percentage of how much you expect to add through with the C&I offerings that you're giving, and then how much will be utility scale going forward?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","You're talking about the voluntary offering?","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So, that \u2013 we've set aside 300 megawatts for that. I'd say that's hopefully a starting investment because we are seeing some of our large customers come to us and request the ability to increase the renewable mix in their portfolio.","So you've seen customers like GM, for example, say that they want to be 100% renewables by 2050. Well, they're getting started on those sorts of things, as are other large industrial and commercial customers.","So, we're going to set aside 300 megawatts, so that would be 300 megawatts out of a total of 2,000 megawatts by the time we're done with this round. So, you can get a sense for how much that is, but our expectation would be that we'll continue to see demand for that. And as we do we'll push that into our mix.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Hi Julien.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Hi Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So, I was wondering can we get a little bit more clarity on the tax reform benefits at the two segments here, just the $35 million and the $5 million at GSP and P&I. I suppose maybe naively, how has tax reform discussion evolved such that you get such material benefit from these two in 2022? And I've got a follow-up.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","We disclosed on the year-end call that the existing contracts we will get the benefit, so what you're seeing there, an increase of the existing contracts we have in place today. What we've assumed is that new contracts we will pass that on, but we may potentially share in that and that could potentially help close up that white space gap, but mainly it's the new contracts that you're seeing the increase from.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And so, actually that plays right into the follow up here. With respect to NEXUS, not to harp on it too much, but it does \u2013 this reflect higher kind of structural applications on that project. I presume that's probably the bulk of the new contracts that you're contemplating in GSP.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","On NEXUS, the tax reform doesn't have any impact on our ability to capture the value that we forecasted because our recourse rates will be well above our negotiated rates.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. So, that's not impacting those negotiations at all, right. And again, just to say it even more bluntly, the impact from the FERC ruling altogether is very immaterial?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Very modest, because most of our pipes are operating with negotiated rates and we \u2013 on our last call, we said that the impact is about $1 million to $2 million from the FERC actions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. Exactly. But if I can go back to this producer push subject because \u2013 if you could elaborate a little bit about the incremental investment, maybe on the gathering side and the other midstream investments to bring the product to NEXUS, how do you think about that in the context of the statement about continuing to add investments in Link? Are there other type systems that you're looking at whether organically or inorganically to complement the NEXUS expansion?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Where we're seeing most of our action right now is on Bluestone and Link, the two gathering assets that we own today. And as it relates to NEXUS, there are many, I would say late stage discussions about continuing to expand that system with our producers on that system. So, it's a very attractive system and it's got a very attractive resource. So, more to come there, but we're feeling really confident right now about meeting and exceeding our pro forma on that asset. And as you know, that asset is pointed right at NEXUS. So, we expect that in the future, those'll help support the fill and expansion of NEXUS.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","When you say that asset, he's talking about Link...","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Yes.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","...which \u2013 the activity about Link, around Link has been really encouraging, and as we bought that I guess, late 2016. So, we're a year and a half in and in a year and a half in, we continue to be very encouraged by the economics therein by our investment opportunities. So, it's been a good asset.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","(00:31:20).","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But, you're still on track with the targets you had laid out for Link at the time of the acquisition now?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yes, indeed.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. All right, guys. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","We'll go next to Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Morning, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Let me just follow up real quick one more time on Michael's question on NEXUS. Thought we would have an update on this call with at least one of the two industrial customers that you were working with. I felt one was nearly finalized. So, what's the status on those two customers that you've flagged before in the past?","And then, just curious can these two customers provide enough end market demand to finally fill this pipe with E&P signing on to these supposedly two markets \u2013 new markets?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","For the one industrial customer, it's essentially done. Second, we're still negotiating with to complete producer agreements. Again, we're continuing to exchange proposals. So, those discussions continue. And we also have several LDC discussions well underway. And \u2013 so, that's the current status.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Curious why you're not disclosing the one industrial customer that's been finalized?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","I think we've \u2013 have the ability at this point to disclose, but...","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","No, it's under confidentiality agreement.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So, we can't disclose them.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just looking at additional Link type investments and sticking with midstream here, the recent sort of what \"the meltdown\" you've seeing with MLPs, I know you guys vetted Links for a long time before purchasing that investment. Have you seen additional Link type opportunities, especially given the recent \u2013 I guess for a quarter and what you've seen in the MLP markets? Are you seeing more willing sellers of assets that you would, I guess, want to vet?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I think the short answer is, yes, we are seeing more of those. Like Link, we'll take a long hard look. I think the more we hear, the more we believe that there will \u2013 this isn't going to be a short term phenomenon. Some of these companies are going to need to work through this over the foreseeable future. So, we will look at and evaluate opportunities analogous to Link and if we think we find one that's a good strategic fit, makes sense economically we'd be open to that.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And just, lastly, on distribution. So far, can you maybe just update how the dialog is going? And then, just more importantly with the track or a rider request, how should we sort of think about what the podium would be for that ask?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","I can tell you that the engagement level between our team and the Michigan Public Service Commission team, staff team is very high. We've got multiple discussions that are scheduled and happening between now and the time of our next rate case filing. And the goal is to get alignment on investment and distribution, as well as other items in our capital plan that could result in a capital tracker. So, lots of interest in that from both parties, both from the Commission staff and our team, and we're hopeful that we can get to a strong alignment that we can file in our next rate case.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. Thanks so much guys.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Praful Mehta with Citibank.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks so much. So, the first question just on the utility side. It was helpful to get your tax reform impact for the GSP and P&I. But on the utility side, wanted to understand from a tax reform perspective, especially given post the rate case, how do you see the growth rates that those two businesses individually play out through that 2021\/2022, and how does that fit with the overall growth rate for the business?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. This is Peter. The growth rate we will be funding is \u2013 at the end of the year, we're going to have a case around the deferred tax. It's approximately $1.7 billion; we're going to be giving that over 25 years, about $70 million a year. So, as we're funding that piece, in particular we're going to be replacing that half of that with equity. So, we are going to be seeing equity levels increase in both utilities and its worth about a 1% over and above rate base. So, we are anticipating earnings growth happening on the utilities from tax reform.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. So, that should be \u2013 just to be clear that should be over and above just the rate base impact because the deferred tax refund effectively flows through as higher equity in your calculation?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","That is correct. It's about 1% adder on the rate base growth.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Perfect. And then, secondly, just strategically, given most of tax reform impacts are now kind of built-in and you're looking at I guess enough questions on the NEXUS and in the midstream side, but just strategically for your business, is there more discussion ongoing in the industry in general now on M&A, both corporate M&A, both on the buy and sell side? How do you see that playing out and is that dialogue increasing given tax reforms now kind of in the rear view?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Oh, geez, that's \u2013 so, we like everybody has \u2013 have investment bankers who come through, and I don't know that I've had too many times when I haven't been told that the interest in the industry and M&A was high. But, I do think there are parties out there looking around. We saw one play out just the other day was Spectra.","And I think there is ongoing interest, but I don't understand \u2013 I don't sense that tax reform has unleashed a wave that's fundamentally different if that's what you're asking. I think we continue to see the sort of ongoing interest that consolidation of this industry has witnessed for a long time now.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. I totally get the investment banker point, but just to clarify it's not like credit weakness for some companies would be an opportunity for others in terms of M&A as you see it?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Well, I \u2013 actually one of the folks I talked to recently, I think stated it well as an investor not a banker, and he said, look, strengthen your balance sheet is really option value, it gives you the opportunity when good opportunities arise to strike, and when you spend that balance sheet flexibility, you've lost your option value. I think there were companies who spent their option value on what we view as some \u2013 not so accretive transactions. And \u2013 so, I think there are companies who didn't do that, who probably have greater flexibility if they see something come along that they really like.","And so, we continue to look to the earlier question at potential GSP sorts of acquisitions. But, if \u2013 we've always said, if the right corporate transaction came along that we really thought added value, we'd be open to it. But, we aren't going to be involved in a high premium sort of transaction, we just don't see the value in super high premium deals that don't make sense to us. So open, but we'd do them at the right price with the right counterparty.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Super helpful, guys. Thanks.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just one on wind projects. Could you give us a flavor of the nature of the projects you have in the plan or the sites that you've been developing yourselves. Are they coming early or late stage from developers, are you going to do BOT or can build them yourselves, just a little more sense of kind of how that plays out.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","They're mix of both, Julien (sic) [Jonathan] (00:39:50). So, in some cases people had lined up lease rights and we have entered the build out and transfer. In other cases we did that ourselves, and will simply sign a construction agreement and then do the build out by DTE.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So would you say it's sort of an even split or...","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I probably ought to go back and get the numbers before I answer, Jonathan, to give you a split. Maybe Barb could do that with you after this.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. That's fine. And then looking further out in the utility, you're obviously close to the decision on the gas plant. How far out would you see your next gas plant being, given some of the comments around renewables and gas in the longer term future?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So we don't see a need for another gas plant till the end of the 2020s. We'd have our next major coal retirement in the late 2020s. That's when we'd evaluate the need for the next gas plant.","I think one of the things we'll watch over the next decade is how the overall system around us evolves, as we add more and more renewables and our neighboring companies do the same, we have to watch how the MISO grid evolves. And we may find we need the new gas plant out in the 2030 timeframe. We may find that investments in renewables will cover us and provide the reliability.","So I think the answer is we will see. But in the meantime, we're \u2013 between now and the late 2020s, the real focus will be on renewable additions.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Gerry. And could I just on your comments about the rate case order and skewing you towards the lower end, is that a \u2013 do you see that as a 2018 guidance factor? And you'd hope to sort of get back on trajectory, given it's your largest segment beyond or...","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I think the easy way to say it is that we're not modifying our 5% to 7% growth target for the company. So I think in that sense that, yes, we expect our plan to be on track.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And is \u2013 okay. I think I have said enough, Gerry. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Gerry, could you just \u2013 I think there might be some confusion based on some things I've seen. You did not lower consolidated guidance to the lower end of the range, just the Electric segment. And then...","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","...what was your commentary on the other segment?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Oh, yeah, exactly. The Electric segment, we biased towards the low end of the guidance range. The gas utility is doing fine I think in a lot of places. The weather started a little mixed but has actually finished strong here in April. So the gas utility from a weather perspective is in good shape.","And as I said, the two large non-utility segments are running hot to their plan. So the year looks in really good shape.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for that clarification.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So unless we get surprised by something we don't see, should be a good year. I think we're in good shape.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, again.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. So just on the rate order, as you mentioned you'll be back on track after this year maybe. But just what are the types of costs being disallowed? And just is this something that we need to worry about in future cases?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah, Steve, this is Peter. One of the costs that was disallowed was a part of our incentive plans with some financial measures. We've had this in the past. So that wasn't completely unanticipated.","The other was inflation. We had some inflation in the plan, and then they modified the level of inflation that we had in the plan.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And so is that, but \u2013 okay. So basically the reason you might be at the lower end is just that inflation may end up being higher than what they allowed, so to speak?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. We had a little bit more of that \u2013 we had the 10.1% and more inflation.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And then a little on the ROE. Okay.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","The ROE and that were built into our numbers for the year, so it backed us up a bit. But as we said the overall plan looks fine.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then the renewables program that you announced more specifics, is that \u2013 how much of that is additive to your capital plan if at all? Or is it all already in there?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So the 300 megawatts that I mentioned pulling, that was the pull forward and that's a nice investment. But I guess I'd say that we aren't modifying our 2022 guidance due to that pull ahead. So it's additional investment, but when you look at it in the total scheme of the company I think the guidance we put out there for 2022, we will just stand with.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just on the mid-stream side, more high level, again, the \u2013 someone asked before about just the unrest in the sector and maybe created more opportunities. Could you talk a little bit about how size-wise you're willing to kind of make this business as a mix of the whole company? And we assume if you do acquisitions, they'd be more kind of asset-by-asset as opposed to larger kind of company-sized acquisitions?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah, I think that's a fair characterization, Steve, that they'd be asset-by-asset. We often find that we're able to get a better strategic fit, and therefore, create economics we like when we do it that way.","But I'd also say that we stay in very active discussions with our investors on mix and the mix that they like. And I think the feel we have from our investors is that this GSP segment provides the company nice earnings growth profile. But we also know that it could become too large if we pursued investments too fast .So, we're trying to walk the mix line in a way that really works well for investors and for rating agencies by the way. We're well within the boundaries for them too. But I think if you did a large corporate acquisition, it could shift that equation for our investors and potentially for the agencies. So, does that get added, Steve, or give you sense of things?","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","No, that's very helpful. One last very quick clarification, the 2022 guidance updates for the GSP and REF, is that just for the tax changes no other changes in the outlook out there?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah, that's what that was for. Yeah.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you. Appreciate it, Steve.","Operator","We'll go next to Charles Fishman with Morningstar Securities.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Just one question I had. On the doubling of the renewable and specifically the wind, I would assume there may be some transmission involved in that. I realize you sold your transmission, gosh, a long time ago. Are you depending on \u2013 is there a significant amount of transmission involved or are you depending on somebody else to build that? Is there any risk to that 2022 target date or non-issue?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","No, we had a significant transmission build out in what they call the thumb part of Michigan, where most of our early wind investments came. But in Central Michigan where we are moving now with many of these investments, there doesn't appear to need to be material transmission build out, so we don't see that as a factor in timing.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. That's all I had, Gerry. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Hi, good morning, guys.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning, Andy.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Just a couple of quick questions. Just on the Electric side. Was there a refund in the first quarter, the true up for the rate case because you were collecting I guess since November 1?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. There was not a refund. How we're going to get this back to customers will come in three parts. The current rates will be adjusted most likely for both utilities by early fall.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","He's talking about the rate case refund...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Yeah, the rate case. Yes.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Oh, the rate case \u2013 the rate case refund.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. Yeah.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","So, the rate case refund, there will be self-implementation proceeding, which is normal course. So, we'll be probably having that over the next probably few months.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Was that in the first quarter? Did you adjust the first quarter for the refund?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yes, we did.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Or no? Okay. How much was that?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","We adjusted for the level of the rate case, the rate order.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Is that what like $0.11 a share or something like that or?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","We did have a certain amount of the self-implementation, plus a little bit of a reserve on top of that. So, it wasn't that material.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Can you tell us what that number was?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","The total impact or the reserve?","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","No, just the total impact of \u2013 so the first \u2013 in the first quarter, the total impact of the rate refund. So, it's kind of like a one-time item, right?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. So, we were...","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","I'm getting...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","And it's part of your operating earnings, I understand that, but I'm just also suggesting that's maybe part of the reason why you're at the (00:49:48)...","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","The full first quarter was trued up. So, it really wasn't a refund in the first quarter, the full \u2013 it was trued up to the levels of the rate case, we did have some self-implementation early \u2013 late last year that was trued up as well in the first quarter, which is very immaterial.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Just to put...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","I understand.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Just to put a number on it, net of reserve was $10 million after tax is a rate case impact.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. Positive.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay, okay. And then I guess, maybe $0.11 is versus the $1.25 if you had it, okay. And then, is that part of the reason why you're at the low end because of the refund or is it just the lower revenue amount from the rate case in general?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Look, it's all taken together. All impacts, so we have the earnings range for Electric that we had communicated and not unexpectedly if our ROE gets pushed down a tenth and the couple of the other things that were pushed back in the range a little bit.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","And then, sorry, go ahead.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","No, as I say, I don't want to overblow it. We had rate cases play out over time through the years, and we've got lot of other things in the mix, but that is as described, and that said, we're going to play out in the earnings range that we laid out there. And for the company I think, it's going to be a very positive year.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","As it is always for you guys. And then, just on NEXUS. Can you give us on an annual basis, once it's in service, any type of guidance or high-level of thinking on what come in the first year out, what the annual earnings may be from NEXUS? And then, also whether you project financed it at all?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","No. We haven't project financed it. That's always an option down the road if we wanted to do that and our partners wanted to. And I think you know we've generally concluded it's not in our interest to break out earnings kind of line-by-line project-by-project just because we have lots of counterparties to each project and lots of interest in when a deal is signed, what did that do to your profitability on this project.","And so, we're trying to balance our need to interact with counterparties with. I need to give you good information, but that's led us to give you guidance at the segment level, but not do it in detail pipe-by-pipe.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. I mean, that's \u2013 $1.3 billion is the investment. And I guess, maybe at the very least we can assume kind of a utility return and then kind of go from there once it's full?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I think our history with these sorts of pipes is at minimum we want to get in at our cost of capital, right. And then we push from there and our history has been that the pipes end up with returns well above utility returns as you expand them and add compression, and so on and so forth, which is why we like these investments, they've proven to be really good value creators.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. And I assume NEXUS will be similar?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I think NEXUS; NEXUS has that same feel. So, let me \u2013 I'll just go to Link, Link is a little further along because it was constructed when we bought it, but it was still a young pipe. But we went through it fundamentally, because the geology that it accessed was superb, that's playing out.","We've had a couple of the producers and to be honest, it's always hard when you're dealing with really good geography to figure out who it is, that's going to be pushing it hard, but we've got a couple of producers there that are just going after it, and it is accruing to our benefit. So, somebody asked earlier, how you're feeling about Link, we're feeling really good there.","And we're at and beyond pro forma and they've got that firming up now years out ahead of us. So, that's been a real positive. NEXUS is earlier, but it also accesses superb geology, and I think we're going to see driller's go after that hard.","In a gas environment that's long generally in the country meaning, we aren't going to be short gas, as far as anybody can tell. Drillers double down on their best geology and that's what we're seeing at Link, that's what we're seeing at Bluestone, and I think it's what we're going to see around NEXUS. They're going to concentrate their drilling in those really good geologies. And so, that's happening around NEXUS, but obviously it's earlier, but we are hearing chatter now that you get out a few years and in the drillers they're worried about pipe takeaway in the region that NEXUS access being constrained because their own drill plans there, and what they perceive other people's drill plans to be.","So, it feels like the dynamics are set up in a similar way, we're just earlier with NEXUS than we are with certainly with Bluestone and also with Link.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. And no MLP, right Gerry.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Not at this time.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I think we'll hold on that one.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Yes. That was a good decision years ago. So, anyway thank you very much.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Barb Tuckfield. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Barbara Tuckfield - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you, Tanisha, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on page 2 of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating income provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President and CFO, will be providing a financial update for the third quarter of 2016 guidance. We also have members of the management team here that we can call on during the Q&A session.","And now I'll turn it over to Peter to start the call.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Barb. Good morning to everyone and thanks for joining us today. Of course, no DTE earnings call would be complete without an update on my Tigers. So let me get that over with here. Actually disappointed to say that for the second straight season, the Tigers did not make the postseason. So the only source (1:24) here is that we were the last American team to be eliminated from contention this year, but do like to congratulate two great Midwestern cities, Cleveland and Chicago, for being in the World Series. And as always, I look forward to a breaker season next year.","Now, for an update on DTE. We're keeping today's call focused on the quarter and the current year.

Gerry Anderson will be providing our normal detailed business update at EEI. There he will discuss our 2017 really outlook, our long-term growth plans as well details about each of the business segments.","So now I'd like to start on slide 4. As you know, on September we raised our operating EPS guidance for 2016. At that time, we increased the guidance midpoint $0.17 to a range of $5.09 to $5.35 from a range of $4.91 to $5.19. The guidance increases were driven by a lot of weather favorability at DTE Electric, favorability across all platforms at the Gas Storage & Pipeline business, and a strong year-to-date economic performance at our trading company.","In the past, we've talked about our reinvestment strategy, holding favorability until we see the summer months play out. Well, this summer was the hottest we've had in the past 50 years and we were able to reinvest a lot of those revenues back into that system into aging infrastructure to improve customer liability.","We invested a nominal amount this quarter, and we're stepping up on our reinvestment activity for the remainder of the year. Investments will primarily be in our infrastructure with a focus on improving immediate and lasting benefits to our customers.","Another area where we are seeing great results this year is in safety. Now, we always start every meeting with a discussion on safety and it's our number one priority in the company. And I'm particularly pleased to announce that, year-to-date, our employees continue to have the best safety record in the company's history.","And, of course, we have had a major announcement in our Gas Storage & Pipeline segment in the third quarter with the acquisition of our gas midstream assets and the heart of the Southwest, Marcellus and dry Utica Basin. The transaction complements our existing midstream business and provides a play upfront for new value creation and significant growth opportunities. And we'll be discussing the growth opportunities and their impact on our business at EEI.","Now, I'd like to go with the third quarter earnings results on slide 5. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $353 million or $1.96 per share. For reference, our reported earnings were $1.88 per share, and you can find a reconciliation for the third quarter reported to operating earnings on slide 17 of the appendix. For the quarter, our gross segment's operating earnings were $343 million or $1.91 per share.","Now, starting with the segments. With DTE Electric, it was higher by $71 million. This quarter was, as I indicated, one of the warmest on record and drove much of this favorability. DTE Electric also supplemented a rate increase on August 1 as part of the ongoing rate case. This favorability was partially offset by increased expenses associated with the rate base growth.","DTE Gas was higher by $7 million. This was primarily driven by a gas mainline replacement surcharge and the storage and transport services. Our Power & Industrial Projects segment was higher by $3 million due primarily to higher REF earnings from an additional location that came online in the fourth quarter of last year. These REF earnings were partially offset by lower earnings in our steel-related assets.","Our Corporate & Other segment came in $8 million favorable versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of taxes. Again, overall the gross segment results for the quarter were $343 million or $1.91 per share.","Finally, with our Energy Trading segment, there were $10 million in operating earnings for the quarter and economic net income was $1 million. Please refer to slide 15 of the appendix, which shows our standard view of the Energy Trading reconciliation of both economic and operating performance. So, overall, DTE had a very strong third quarter.","With that, moving on to slide 6. I'd like to provide an update on our 2016 earnings guidance. As I mentioned, we recently raised 2016 guidance and are confident that we will land somewhere between the midpoint and upper end of our guidance this year. Year-to-date results are solid and we are in good position to finish the year strong.","You can see arrows next to each of the guidance numbers, indicating where we think the year may play out for each segment. The green arrows indicate achieving the higher end of guidance, while the red arrow signifies the lower end.","The positive signaling at DTE Electric is driven by additional weather experienced at the end of September, with a very warm September. Our Corporate & Other segment is turning towards the lower end of guidance, driven by tax true-ups. In the fourth quarter, we expect Energy Trading to have accounting income that covers their expenses, which puts them at the high end of the guidance range.","Now, moving on to slide 7. In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support our long-term growth. Based on year-to-date results, we're updating our cash flow and capital expenditure guidance. Starting at the left side of the page, we're increasing cash from operations by $200 million due to the strong cash performance year-to-date.","CapEx is increasing by $1.1 billion, which is primarily due to the recent acquisition of our gas midstream assets. We're also increasing our debt financing by $900 million, which was used in part for our recent acquisition and also for general corporate uses.","Taking a closer look at CapEx on the right side of the page, we show capital expenditure by business units. We still expect to invest nearly $1.6 billion at the electric company and $430 million at the gas company. We have increased the non-utility guidance by $1.1 billion. This change, as I mentioned, captures the purchase of the gas midstream assets. This brings our total capital expenditures to nearly $3.8 billion for the year.","Now let's move on to slide 8 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong. We expect to end the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. Due to the strong year-to-date earnings and cash flow, we will not be issuing equity in 2016.","In early October, DTE issued $1 billion of senior notes and $675 million of mandatory convertible securities to support the midstream acquisition. As a reminder, the $675 million of mandatory convertible securities will convert to common equity in October of 2019. Lastly, we ended the quarter with very healthy liquidity position of $1.6 billion.","Now, wrapping up on slide 9, I will summarize the quarter and then open the line for questions. We've had another successful quarter, and are in great position to achieve our EPS guidance this year. We are looking to extend our streak to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. We're investing heavily in our utilities by upgrading our aging infrastructure.","And we're executing on growth opportunities at our non-utility businesses, most notably the Gas Storage & Pipeline business where we recently added a new platform for future growth. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which sets us up nicely for future growth opportunities, as we enter a period of significant investment and begin to transform our electric generation fleet.","Before I open the line for questions, once again I'd like to remind everyone that Gerry Anderson will be giving a formal business update presentation at the upcoming EEI Conference on November 8. And we hope to see many of you at the conference. But if you can't make it in person, you can visit our Investor Relations website to listen in on the webcast.","Now I'd like to open up for question. So, Tanisha, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Peter. Can you hear me okay?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","My question is on Michigan legislation. There was a story in the press talking about some kind of breakthrough and expectation that, yeah, this will get taken up after the election. But it wasn't clear from that what exactly might have changed in the bill. Can you give any insight as to how you guys see this playing out and what there might be new to report?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. I think, in terms of playing out, there's definitely a strong push to get this legislation done in lame duck. There's a lot of public communication that's happening out there. Senator and office made this a priority for that. It is going to be a challenge potentially, given the timeframe left, but I think given the focus and attention on that, there is still a chance it'll happen in the lame-duck session.","We have had some public support recently. The Michigan State Chamber came out publicly to support this bill. So I think that's a very positive movement as well. In terms of what has changed is that this bill in particular is going to be a bipartisan bill. It is related to the State of Michigan, the energy reliability that's needed in the State of Michigan. So both parties need to be supportive and both parties want to get this energy legislation passed.","So, recently, there is some discussion on the renewable side potentially for that mandate. Currently, we're at 10%, potentially go up to 15%. That will help get some of the democrats on board as well. And some of the refining and, as I was mentioning, even when I've been on the road that some of it is getting the detail right around the retail open access and the capacity requirements related to that. So there is some finalization around that language. I know there's a new MISO tariff that may be out there as well that's going to help support and complement legislation as well.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. That was it. Thanks a lot.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","All right. Good morning, Peter.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Hi, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Hey. With the strong quarter from the weather, just wondering if you could just comment on how that will affect O&M in the fourth quarter and your Lean In initiatives?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. With all this favorability, we are going to be putting some of that back in to the business. We've done this periodically as you know, and this really helps maintain long-term really good operations. And we like to put it into customer-centric type of assets and infrastructure assets. So we are targeting potentially around $20 million of after-tax and the vast majority of that will happen in the fourth quarter. We had a minimal amount that did occur here in the third quarter.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","And just a follow-up on NEXUS, as we await I think the draft EIS \u2013 or the final EIS at this point, right?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. I can give you an overall update on NEXUS. We are really at this point in the late-stage constructions. Once again, we are very positive on this project. It's going to be a real strategic part of our portfolio. So, late-stage construction, the pipe is being fabricated as we speak.","Another great milestone here is that we recently signed our first tap and interconnect agreement in Ohio with an LDC and we have 1.75 Bcf per day of tap and interconnect agreements and we expect to term some of those out. And that's how we're expecting to help build out the pipe.","We are currently at the two-thirds and now we've been at the two-thirds for a little bit here. Some of that is with the E&P companies taking a pause with their balance sheets, but we're starting to get some express interest with the E&P companies. But I do expect a good portion of the remaining pipe being drilled will be drilled potentially within that Ohio market.","We expect to receive the final environmental impact next month with a final certificate in the first quarter of 2017, commence construction, and still targeting the fourth quarter of 2017 in service.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Now, the improvement in natural gas prices and frac spreads, I'm just wondering if you're seeing an increased amount of interest in the pipeline at all?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Well, we are. And there's always been a lot of interest. A lot of the pause is just with the E&P companies first getting their balance sheets in order. The other is coming up with their new capital plans and drilling plans. And there's going to be a focus on this region, in particular the Utica and Marcellus. So a lot of that, there's some internal processing that needed to happen within the E&P companies. The other benefit is we do have \u2013 with the new acquisition, there are some synergies potentially there as well that can help support the NEXUS pipeline.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you very much.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Hey. So, perhaps just following up on the last couple of questions. First, you've kind of alluded to it already, but the deal with the MISO, the PSC and actually the Governor's office as well. Can you comment a little bit on how that fits within what you're trying to achieve with the legislation? Is that also one of the reasons why you've been able to get some progress? And can you on platform on the path forward on the timing and what do you expect that to look like ultimately...","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. I think...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","...or how it complements?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","I mean, a couple of comments on that. The movement with the Governor and with MISO and the MPSC really shows that this issue really is around electric reliability in the State of Michigan. So this was kind of a potential how do we ensure some reliability and capacity in the State of Michigan. It does help complement legislation.","So, that would be one where we'll have the requirements for the retail open access providers, show us your capacity plans and with a lot of local clearing requirements that'll have to be in place, given the fact that given the peninsula of state that we have, the limited amount of transmission, we need to have a lot of local generation.","So this new tariff \u2013 if the ROA customers cannot get the capacity, they will come to the utilities and we'll provide it with a capacity surcharge. My understanding is MISO will be filing this new tariff with the FERC shortly, essentially next month.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And to what extent does that achieve your goal around ROA? I mean, (16:15) on getting paid for the capacity. I suppose you're moving forward to the new gas line and so that shows some amount of confidence in the underlying regulatory cost structure present. I don't want to mix issues here too much though.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","No, the goal with the retail open access, first, is to make sure that they have capacity within the State of Michigan, that we have reliability in the State of Michigan. I think that's the number one concern with that for the policy and the regulators, and this really does help ensure it, whether they got to get it themselves; if not, now they got to turn to us and we got to make sure we get it for them.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then turning back to Mike's question a second ago, can you comment a little bit about \u2013 obviously, there's some multiple adjacent projects going forward. Seems like you guys obviously are moving forward with your project irrespective. Is there an ability to combine projects and\/or are you seeing or having conversations with the off-takers from some of the other projects thus far? Just kind of curious if you're seeing some cannibalization here.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","No, I can say that we definitely like our pipe where it's at. We provide a northern path. E&P companies are looking to get their product to market as they like to diversify where they're putting it. So, putting it north within the markets of Ohio, Michigan, and Ontario definitely helps. So we're really at this point concentrating on our project.","And I think a lot of the interest in our project is just because of the multiple markets that it serves. So we're continuing to see a lot of interest in our projects, and we're not really kind of worried about other projects in the area. We have a great project. We think we do have the best northern path at this point in time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. But not taking contracts or in discussions with the actual operators, the other ones, by any means?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","No, we were in contract \u2013 I mean, in discussions with E&P companies around the NEXUS pipeline, and if they want to get their product north, they are in discussions with us.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Morning, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","With your recent acquisition at Storage & Pipes, are you kind of right-sized or do you think there's potential other opportunities out there?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","At this point in time, that's really around new acquisitions. I would say that we are not looking for new acquisitions at this size. We like to develop pipes, traditionally greenfield, that's where you get your most value creation. There is a unique opportunity here. There's a great pipe in the region that we want to be in, which is the Utica, Marcellus. 40% of the gas in the country is going to be delivered from this region. It also fits within our footprint and potentially helps support the NEXUS pipeline.","So, at this point in time, we are looking at developing multiple pipe platforms, growth platforms, our NEXUS platform. And obviously, we're going to be putting a lot of push and development on that. And then this pipeline in particular, there's a lot of upside potential given the expansion opportunities here, and some new greenfield around the pipe that has yet to be drilled and put into the pipe.","So I'd say the focus will be on the development of this pipe. There may be some smaller bolt-on type of acquisitions potentially. So we're comfortable right now with the growth platforms that we have in place and the development opportunities around them.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","With respect to the compromise, it sounds like it was kind of a Senate saying. Is the House on board with it as well?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","I know Mike Nofs has been working both the Senate but also the House in particular. So I think that's some of the movement you're seeing with the renewable side in the mandate. That's going to help get support within the House.","So it's still kind of a wait-and-see to see if they can get it through the Senate and the House. There would be post-election. The idea is potentially to now get it through the Senate, and after Thanksgiving, work it through the House. So there's enough support within the Senate. And then that we get enough of the House Democrats, there is a chance that it can get done this year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I thought the Chamber was on board. Is it they or the schools, are they coming around to it?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","The State Chamber for us was a major supporter. So we're very happy with that and that's where a lot of the work has been done over the last few months. So we're very happy with their support, and that was a key support for us to get.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then the CCN part of it, I didn't understand what that does, the 225 megawatt Certificate of Need requirement. Does that mean anything?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","So we have a Certificate of Need process right now within the current legislation. That's a great process around kind of getting pre-approvals on prudency around. That was a $1 threshold that has moved to $2 a megawatt threshold at this point in time.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Does that mean anything from our perspective? Is that something that we should be thinking about as \u2013 what does that actually feel like, I guess, is what I'm wondering?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Probably it may move a little more projects within that process than the old, which we're okay with, getting kind of multiple stakeholders involved and getting the MPSC to look at these projects is the good thing before you start putting steel on the ground.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then the Ontario transmission line that's being discussed with MISO and what have you, is that something you have been involved in and do you have any more details other than sort of what I've read here in terms of timing or what's actually being proposed? How many megawatts or anything?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","So the Ontario \u2013 are you talking about the TransCanada?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm talking about the Michigan Agency for Energy, and the Michigan \u2013 and Governor Snyder. I'm talking about regional transmission. You talked about connecting more on a transmission with Ontario to examine more interconnections with Ontario?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yeah, that's really not our \u2013 we're not really involved into that issue. Obviously, we'll look for the outcomes of that, but we don't have a direct involvement in that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally, back to the MISO capacity proposal, what I'm wondering is, is would this be a wholesale transaction that the alternative energy provider would be charged. I mean, in other words, would they have to pay you a capacity fee or \u2013 that's why I was a little bit confused about it jurisdictionally. When I read this proposal, it sounded like they could either buy capacity themselves or they could buy it from you at some set price by the Michigan PSC. And I'm wondering, would that be considered a wholesale transaction.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","This really is getting at the issue that we need to have a very high local clearing requirement, which means in state generation. And either they can get generation within the state by themselves; if they can't, they can procure it from us, and we need to be compensated for that. And it would be a capacity charge put in place and the Public Service Commission would be kind of over that capacity charge and what the amount would be.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Would FERC have to be that involved in this in so far as it's a wholesale transaction of the alternative that the Michigan PSC would be setting the price for? Do you follow what I'm saying?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","No, the FERC would not be involved.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay. I appreciate the time. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. You talked about in your release and previously about building 1,000 megawatts of gas in Michigan for \u2013 I think it was 2021. When do you expect to start spending there, and what needs to be done to move forward regulatorily or otherwise?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","The high-level timeline on that, Gregg, is probably late next year we'll be providing \u2013 we'll be filing a Certificate of Need around that with the air permitting, everything that we would need to get the projects going.","The spending on that will occur at the back end of this five-year plan. The in-service date that we put within the recent press release is 2021 to 2023 timeframe. So, the spending will be occurring within a few years. So, probably shortly after that Certificate of Need, probably within a year after that, there will be some spending occurring. Actually a little bit of spending before that just to prepare for the Certificate of Need.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And do you need to file for approval there?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","We would have to file with our Certificate of Need process with our Public Service Commission.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, Peter.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Hey. Good morning, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Just one quick question on the synergies that you just mentioned around NEXUS and the G&P system you purchased. I know you will obviously disclose more when you get into EEI. But synergies, when you highlighted that, is that more of a function of adding additional producers to the pipe?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Really is a function. We have a clear path, contiguous path with our system that we purchased with the Texas Eastern pipeline. There's capacity that we've contracted out NEXUS has to get it to NEXUS. So it really is around the producers, the drilling plans around those producers, essentially not signing up new producers by getting into the drilling plans with the existing producers that we have on that pipe and the new assets we purchased.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just one lastly on the Michigan policy and the MISO tariff. Is there \u2013 just to confirm, there is no impact to any of your potential future coal retirements, right, if we get passage? Like, you wouldn't \u2013 there's no scenario where you would hold capacity not retired, right, on the coal side?","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","No, there isn't. It's a combination of age of life of these plants and there's some new water rules that are being put in place...","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Right.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","...that it is onerous to keep these plans going. So they are retiring.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Excellent. Thanks. See you soon.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Shar.","Operator","Thank you. And it does appear we have no further questions at this time. I will now hand it back over to your speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","I'd like to thank everybody for joining this morning on the call. And once again, I can't imagine EEI is coming up quickly, how quickly the year goes by, but I'll be seeing a number of you at the EEI Conference coming up next month.

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Meador. Please go ahead.","David E. Meador","Thank you, Evelyn, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Looking at Page 2 just briefly before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement, including the reference to forward-looking statements.","And if you'll turn to Page 3, with me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Controller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have some members of the management team with me in the room and on the phone if needed during the Q&A period.","But before I jump into the second quarter, I'd like to take a moment just to update you on some recent announcements and management changes here on the finance and regulatory team as we continue to build and sustain just an outstanding finance and regulatory group.","Effective September 1, Peter Oleksiak has been promoted to Senior Vice President of Finance, and he'll have responsibility for the controller's organization and treasury, which includes Investor Relations. Nick, who has been our Treasurer for over 11 years now, will assume the role of Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. And Dan Brudzynski, who is currently in the regulatory role will replace Nick as Vice President and Treasurer, and Dan will also have Investor Relations reporting to him. So Nick and Dan are effectively trading places.","With these changes, this marks the last quarterly earnings call for Nick in the Treasurer's office and I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to Nick for the passion and expertise he's brought to the Treasury group and the important role that he's played in working with the management team, the Board of Directors and the financial community to help DTE Energy achieve some great successes over these years, including pulling through some of the toughest economic times like 2008 and '09 that hopefully, we will ever see in our life.","Many of you have met Dan, and he's been involved in a number of Investor Relation events over the years, and you can look forward to seeing him going forward. And finally, congratulations to Peter on his well-deserved promotion. And you're not going to lose sight of Nick. He's only 50 feet from my office and he's going to continue to be involved with the investment and credit community.","So turning to Page 4. This morning, we're going to cover our second quarter results and give you an update on some growth projects at our utilities and the nonutilities. So let me kick this off then on Slide 5. We like to ground all of our discussions with investors in what we call our investment thesis, as we believe this concisely summarizes the compelling reasons to invest in DTE Energy.","We have a disciplined growth plan that'll provide a 5% to 6% long-term earnings growth per share. And when combined with our attractive dividend, provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. And all of this is underpinned by one of our key priorities and that's maintaining a strong balance sheet.","Both utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. While at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments, including cast iron main replacement work and a program to move gas meters that are currently inside customers' homes to outside customers' homes.","We have a constructive regulatory structure in Michigan, which is supported by a solid legislation that was passed in 2008. And we know it's our responsibility to earn this construct every day. We utilize our continuous improvement capabilities in everything we do to control cost and we are very focused on minimizing rate increases to our customers and providing our customers with a great level of service they deserve.","We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses as well, particularly in the Power & Industrial group and the Gas Storage & Pipelines. And I have some updates that I'll share with you this morning on those businesses.","So if you'll turn to Page 6. I'll provide an overview of the quarter. Our operating earnings per share for the second quarter came in at $0.86 compared with $0.65 in the second quarter of last year. Like much of the Midwest, the summer here in Michigan is off to a warmer-than-normal start, and actually we're on a track to possibly one of the warmest summers on record. And that translates into strong earnings at Detroit Edison.","As a reminder, Detroit Edison was decoupled for weather during the second quarter of 2011. So if you're looking at quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year analysis, the warm weather last year didn't flow through to the bottom line.","Earnings at the Power & Industrial projects were up over the second quarter of last year and that's driven by the REF business line that's ramping up. And tough market conditions made it difficult for Energy Trading to generate margin in the second quarter. Peter will take you through some of the details on the quarter in a few minutes.","So with the first half of the year behind us, I am reaffirming our full year operating guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 per share. As I will describe later, I'm confident of the midpoint of $3.80 and we could deliver higher than midpoint earnings, and we'll talk about that in a little bit.","In June, our board approved the 5.5% increase in our dividend to an annualized rate of $2.48 beginning in October. This gives us a compounded annualized dividend growth rate of 5% over the last 3 years and demonstrates our board and our management team's confidence in our long-term growth plan. The balance sheet remained strong and we generated over $1.2 billion in cash from operations through the first half of the year.","In June of this year, Detroit Edison raised $500 million of 10- and 30-years secured debt at the lowest rates in the company's history. The proceeds from that debt offering will be used primarily to refinance higher cost debt, which is maturing or is callable later this year.","On another topic, we have also been very clear about our strategy to exit the E&P business by selling our assets in the Barnett Shale. And we started talking to you last year about the shale formation called Marble Falls, which is just above the Barnett formation. DTE has been a front-runner in this newly emerging oil-rich play. As we prove up the acreage, we've had moved way up the learning curve and that we're now seeing top-tier returns from our vertical wells there.","We recently concluded a study that shows a 50% increase in our total reserves over 2011, including 114% increase in the crude oil reserves. And you'll find additional details on the Barnett Marble Falls assets in the Appendix on Slide 22 and 23. We intend to go to market with these assets later this year and we will keep you posted on our progress. And EEI is going to be a good time to give you an update on this and some of the other things that we have underway.","Shifting to areas of growth for the company. In the second quarter, our Gratiot County wind park became fully operational. This is the largest wind farm in the state of Michigan, with 212 megawatts of generating capacity. Construction is underway on our 110-megawatt thumb wind parks, which includes 3 sites in Huron and Sanilac Counties. And in addition to those 2 projects, we recently announced another 110-megawatt wind development in Huron County, which will be constructed in 2013. All of these projects demonstrate the significant progress we're making in achieving the 10% renewable energy standard in Michigan by 2015, which we think is a good standard and a sensible approach to approaching renewable energy.","On the non-utility side of the business, we're very excited about the growth potential surrounding the Gas Midstream assets we have in the Marcellus Shale region. Our first major project that we've been talking to you about is the Bluestone lateral and gathering system. And that project's moving along nicely. The anchor tenant on the project has been seeing some very positive results in their drilling, so we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities that we have in this area. As we work our way through the final stages of the right-of-away and permitting process and then move into the construction phases, we're still targeting the pipeline to go in service in the fourth quarter of this year.","In the P&I segment, we're pleased with the performance and throughput at the 5 sited REF reduced emission fuel machines, and we're making good progress inside in the remaining 4 machines. In fact, the first of the 4 is being relocated as we speak and should be up and running in the third quarter. We also have completed negotiations with the host utility on the second of the 4 machines that will be relocated, and we expect to finalize agreements and begin moving that machine soon. And we're engaged in advance discussions with several other potential host sites for the last 2 machines. So our relocation process is on track and the goal is to have all of the REF machines sited and operational by the end of the year, which will provide a nice earnings bump in that segment for 2013.","And for some new news in the P&I segment, we've shown you the forward projection goals that we're pursuing for this business, where we want to drive the earnings for $50 million this year to $125 million by 2016. And the step that we made is an acquisition of an on-site business line that we recently agreed to purchase from Duke Energy for a little over $200 million. So this is a portfolio of on-site energy projects. These projects are primarily located in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic regions and they provide on-site utility and energy services. They're very similar to our existing on-site projects, and they represent assets and equipment and technologies that we have extensive experience in. This acquisition will effectively double the size of our on-site business and expands our customer base broader into the Midwest. We target returns on these contracted services that are above our utility returns. And in addition to that, we get very good strong cash flows.","So we see these projects making a significant contribution towards our goal of growing the P&I segment to $125 million in operating earnings by 2016. The acquisition will be funded by the parent, off our balance sheet by the end -- the exact details of the funding requirements and timing has not yet been determined. And the deal is not closed yet, it will close later this fall. So we still anticipate that we'll stay within our balance sheet targets even with this acquisition. And we do not see the need to raise equity beyond the $300 million requirement that we've communicated to you in 2012.","Turning to Page 7, and talk a little bit about guidance. With half the year behind us, we remain committed to our full year 2012 earnings guidance. Detroit Edison came into the year with a plan that targeted that's authorized return on equity. And with warmer-than-normal weather we're experiencing during the second quarter and then through the month of July, we now expect to see Detroit Edison come in above the upper end of the guidance range. Some of the July's weather favorability will be offset by increased storm cost as a result of significant storm activity we experienced in the beginning of the month.","While Detroit Edison has benefited from weather this year, MichCon continues to dig out of the hole created by the extremely mild winter. Quite frankly, MichCon is going to need to work hard to reach the low end of guidance for the year. But with continuous improvement work that we're doing and onetime cost actions, we think the bottom ends of the range is achievable. With some revenue opportunities at Gas Storage & Pipelines, we expect them to be at the upper end of the guidance range, which will help offset some of the challenges of MichCon. And we continue to ramp up the REF business line and what we see is the P&I segment is going to end towards -- near the top end of the guidance range for the year.","Energy Trading. I had already mentioned, Energy Trading turned in modest results for the quarter and it's still not at the level we would like to see. So for the year, we're signaling that Energy Trading will likely not reach the lower end of its guidance range. And due to the shape of the roll on that we would see for the rest of the year -- the remaining profits that we would see for the remainder of the year, a good portion of that's going to be back-end loaded and will show up in the fourth quarter.","And finally, we expect the holding company to have improved results over last year, driven mainly by lower interest rates from the refinancing that we've been actively doing. So in total, we are committed to our original operating earnings guidance range of $3.65 to $3.95 and the favorable weather continues that we've been seeing at Detroit Edison, we could be above the midpoint of that range.","Before I hand it over to Peter, I would like to give you an update on the regulatory item that we discussed in the first quarter. As you may recall, back in April, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision that the MPSC had exceeded its authority when it authorized Detroit Edison to adopt the revenue decoupling mechanism. As of the first quarter, Edison had accrued $127 million as a regulatory liability related to the pilot revenue decoupling, and this predominantly represented weather in prior years.","The MPSC has until Monday to appeal that decision to the Michigan Supreme Court. And we won't know until then what the commission will or won't do. If the commission appeals the decision, there could be some time before we learn of the Supreme Court even will hear the appeal. And if the appeal is taken, it's likely that it could take months to years before it's completed.","On the other hand if the MPSC doesn't appeal, we will propose an alternative to the commission that will support our regulatory strategy for Detroit Edison. Our goal is to minimize rate increases to customers, while achieving our financial objectives. That said, the $127 million could be a key component of a plan to potentially push the need for base rate increases at Detroit Edison out to 2015.","So with that overview, let me pass it over to Peter, who will take you through some additional details on the quarter.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. I'll just start with Slide 9 and our second quarter operating earnings per share by our segment. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $0.86. Detroit Edison contributed $0.74. MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss for the second quarter, came in at $0.02 of income, and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute.","The non-utility segments combined to earn $0.17. The driver for the non-utility second quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipeline at $0.10. Power & Industrial projects at $0.06, Energy Trading at $0.02 and Unconventional Gas Production at $0.01 loss. Finally, corporate and other had a loss of $0.07 in the quarter.","Let's move to Slide 10 and the summary of our quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for the consolidated DTE Energy are up $35 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings were $127 million, up $27 million from the prior year.","We have provided a quarter-over-quarter walk in the Appendix in Detroit Edison for reference, but the message was pretty straightforward. The favorability is primarily driven by warmer weather in the second quarter of 2012, paired with the elimination of the revenue decoupling mechanism.","In addition, Detroit Edison's renewable investments provided incremental earnings as we continue to execute our investment plan there.","July is also shaping up to be a strong weather-driven load month. Although as Dave pointed out, we have experienced increased storm restoration expenses, which are likely to offset the portion of the improved margin.","Summer through mid-July, we had, just to give you just a few stats, we have had 23 days at\/or above 90, normal is 12. And actually, of those, we have 4 of those days we're above 100 degrees. And as Dave mentioned in the guidance update, we are anticipating an overall uplift from weather in the third quarter if the summer holds out.","Putting weather aside, I know a number of you are interested in terms of what's happening with our underlying load in the economy. So I want to give you a brief update. Temperature normalized electric load in the territory. When you look at it at a year-to-date, temperature taken out the impact of weather is relatively flat. As a reminder, we had a pretty nice bounce back in sales after the 2008 and '09 economic downturn. And we have seen a 21% increase in sales alone since 2009.","We are continuing to see a trend of growth in industrial sales. And actually year-to-date in the service territory, it's a 2% increase, really attributed to auto and other related manufacturing production. For the residential and commercial classes, we are seeing very positive results in our energy efficiency programs, which have lowered the absolute load in both those classes year-over-year.","For the year, we expect this flat load trend to continue, with continued energy efficiency savings offsetting territory growth. In the longer term, we're anticipating load increases close to 1% after the energy efficiency savings.","Getting back to the earnings. Moving down the table, our MichCon segment had operating income of $4 million, up $7 million from the prior year. The favorable earnings were driven mainly by an accounting true-up after the completion of the initial reconciliation of MichCon's revenue decoupling mechanism. MichCon also experienced unfavorable weather in the quarter that partially offset this benefit.","Our non-utility segments were nearly flat year-over-year at $29 million earnings in the quarter. Gas Storage & Pipelines is up $3 million, resulting for stronger transport and storage revenues. Power & Industrial projects is up $5 million due to REF project growth, partially offset by lower coke sales, volume and price. Energy Trading is down $8 million in the quarter due to commodity price environment that provided a lower-than-historical number of opportunities.","In Appendix Slide 24, you'll see that our standard operating earnings to net -- economic net income walk. In this walk, you will see that the segment did have economic contributions significantly higher than the operating income. Now this difference represents restructuring of some longer-term contracts that will not realize net accounting benefit for a few years out.","As David mentioned, we expect that our full year earnings for trading will likely be below the guidance range of $30 million to $50 million if the commodity environment we have experienced in the first half of the year continues through the second half. For the second half of the year, we do expect","Energy Trading and earnings to be back-end loaded, with about $10 million of after tax benefit coming in the fourth quarter due to roll on of earnings related to prior year's full requirement deals, with minimum roll on and earnings expended in the third quarter. Lastly, Corporate & Other was up $2 million from last year due to lower interest, partially offset by higher taxes in 2012.","That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. And I'll turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, the last time in an earnings call, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures.","Nick A. Khouri","Thanks, Peter. Good morning. As always and one last time, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains the key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first half of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full year goals. Page 12 summarizes those balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges.","In addition, we appreciate a series of credit improvements by the rating agencies, so far this year, including an upgrade of Fitch and a positive outlook at Moody's. As discussed in prior calls, we are on track to issue $300 million of new equity in 2012, through a combination of employee compensation, dividend reinvestment and pension contributions.","As Dave mentioned, DTE has been able to take advantage of historically low interest rate environment. During the last 18 months, we have issued or refinanced nearly $2 billion of long-term debt. Finally, liquidity remained strong, with over $1.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter.","Page 13 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow so far this year, versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $1.2 billion matched last year's level and we are well on our way towards full year target of $1.9 billion. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was a positive $100 million in the first 6 months of 2012.","Page 14 details capital spending. So far this year, total capital DTE is up about $100 million or 13% from the prior year. We expect increased levels of capital spending in the second half of the year and are on track to hit the prior forecast of $1.9 billion for all of 2012.","In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, supporting higher levels of investment across all our businesses. Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up.","David E. Meador","Thanks, Nick. The results for the first half of the year are solid and on track, and I'm pleased with where we are. And that's why I'm confident reaffirming our full year operating guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 a share.","As you heard, weather is affecting 2000 (sic) [ 2012 ] earnings at both utilities, MichCon to the negative and Detroit Edison to the positive. On a temperature normal basis, both utilities are on track to earn their authorized return on equity. But it's still too early for us to remix the guidance for the year, but the weather-driven favorability looks like it will offset any miss at Energy Trading. And that the weather also, if it continues as we've indicated, could push us above the $3.80 midpoint on our full year earnings per share guidance.","Long term, the utility growth plans are underpinned by mandated investments at the utilities and we're seeing very nice growth potential at our non-utility businesses, and they combine together to provide long-term growth of 5% to 6% earnings per share. And as we've said, and we will always say, we do this while maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong cash flow metrics.","Over the last 3 years, we've increased the annualized dividend 5% on a compounded basis. And as we continue to achieve our long-term earnings per share growth, we expect the dividend will continue to grow as well.","We'll be back on the road at the end of the summer and we'll likely see many of you at either the Barclays or the Banc of America Conference in New York in September. And with that, Evelyn, we'd be happy to open it up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Cole, Credit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First on Detroit Edison, can you help me think through how significant the storms were in July and if the July favorable weather was sufficient to offset it?","David E. Meador","We don't want to necessarily give you July numbers or third quarter numbers. But if you look at what played out in July and the statistics that Peter reported, we have pretty solid load. And I would just say that right now, we haven't closed the books. But it looks like about half of it might have been offset with storm cost. So there still will be net of storm and there will be some positive margin playing through.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Then Dave, in your scripted remarks, how long did you indicate that you might be able to stay out from filing a rate case on the electric side?","David E. Meador","Well, as you know, the way we've been working our rate proceedings is to stay out as long as possible using continuous improvement. And then when we do file, file for as little as we possibly can because we're very sensitive to customer rate increases. So right now, we are looking to see if it's possible to stay out as far as 2015 and we're working our way through that. And one of the reasons we're doing that is there's a Fermi securitization charge that rolls off in that time frame. And we're seeing if we could bridge our way all the way to that, I don't know if we can, but it's a goal that we're looking at right now.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then sort of last question on the REF business. If now, since you're significantly down the path, are you still targeting roughly $55 million or are you still seeing a potential for it to migrate up towards the $75 million level?","David E. Meador","It's still too early. As we've indicated, it really depends where the machines gets sited. And I know where the 7 are and we're working on the last 2. And as you would expect, we're trying to drive these machines to, not only plants that consume a lot of coal, I'd rather be at a 8 million ton per year plant versus a 2 million ton per year plant. And also plants that are going to run over the lifetime of the credit. And so we're working with a handful of our host utilities. And I can't tell you where this is going at but -- well, certainly by the time we get to EEI, we'll know by then. We'll have line of sight of where the 9 machines are going to be. And then just a reminder you, we're relocating the 4 right now. But down the road, there is still the possibility of one of those Detroit Edison machines still could get moved again and take us even to a higher ton per year plant. So that's something still down the road. But EEI, I think, will be a good line in the sand to give you an update on where it -- at least, we know the 9 will be starting in 2013.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And were any of the existing plants or target plants impacted by the, I guess, the fall in the utilization rates for coal plants earlier this year?","David E. Meador","No.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry, this is to revisit your comments on guidance, but just to make sure I understand fully. I think you said that you would need the favorable weather to continue in order to push you above the midpoint. Do you mean by that, you have to continue to have above average weather for the rest of the summer or just not see what you've already had flowed back?","David E. Meador","Kind of the context as I think about this is we had warm winter, which was almost third standard deviation warm winter, warmest winter on record. We're now having the warmest summer on weather and it's brought some storm. So we're just signaling that things look really positive right now. But also just reminding all of us that we've got a lot of year ahead of us that could bring either great weather results or not. So things look pretty positive right now, and we'll be able to get a better sense of this as we get through the summer months.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But if you had normal, say, from now through the rest of the summer, is that -- would you still be tracking ahead of the midpoint? I guess that's my question.","Peter B. Oleksiak","I think, Jonathan, as the you mentioned, the dynamics is both the weather and the storms. So normal weather, normal storms actually would provide an uplift for us in the third quarter going forward.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So your above midpoint statement would be correct even if we were normal from here?","David E. Meador","Yes.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That was great. And then on the Power & Industrial with this acquisition that you're doing from Duke, I think you said it was going to, more or less, double the size of the business. How should we think of that in terms of the target? Is this kind of -- with this acquisition, you're going to achieve most of what you're trying to achieve in that business? Or is there kind of incremental stuff you're working on that potentially you'd take that range up as you close on this, and then maybe do whatever else you're working on?","David E. Meador","If you recall, we showed charts in some of our roadshow packages that would indicate that Power & Industrial is targeted to earn $55 million this year and our goal is to get it to $125 million. And we had a stairstep up to say, here's how much of that growth will come from REF, here's how much of that growth would come from the wood-fired plants, and then there was still some whitespace. And I would look at this or describe it as it's filling in about half of that whitespace between now and 2016. And also, just to clarify, I'm doubling the size of the business. It's doubling basically our on-site energy business, a line within the Power & Industrial group.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it's a piece of the puzzle, basically?","David E. Meador","Yes. Piece of the...","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes.","David E. Meador","And it just fills in some of that whitespace.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Brian Chin, Citi.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know you guys have -- the MichCon rate case application has been out there for a little while. But in one of your summary slides, you had said that both utilities are earning close to their allowed ROEs. Just a big picture rationalize again, why is it that we're going in for a rate case with MichCon, when the utilities seems to be earning close to its authorized ROE under temperature normal conditions?","Peter B. Oleksiak","A couple of things. First is, it really is to true-up our underlying load. We do have decoupling mechanism, but you need to go on periodically to true that up. The other is we are spending more than the depreciation, actually, we're filing here with the infrastructure -- stepped up infrastructure around our main line replacement and move out program. So we're proposing a mechanism for that and recovery around that. So that's the other need in going for a rate case.","Operator","We'll now hear from Mark Barnett, Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was curious if you could provide a little more detail. You mentioned, obviously, some of the long time frame for maybe sorting out the decoupling issue and you had mentioned that there are some alternatives that you're considering. Could you talk a little bit about what those might be?","David E. Meador","As I indicated, the MPSC has until Monday to either appeal this decision to the Supreme Court or not. If they choose not to appeal, we're prepared to make a proposal to them that would be public next week. And then we would, obviously, have to get into discussions with the staff on that issue. So I would prefer to wait until next week. So the way this will sequence out is that if they do not appeal, we will be making a filing with them next week and we'll 8-K that so you'll be aware of what we're thinking about.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess just a second question on the regulatory front. With the 11% requested ROE, have you had any or much discussion I guess around that number yet? And are you getting any pushback on that figure based on some CAPM-based methodologies or can you talk about that at this point?","David E. Meador","It's really way too early in the process. If look in -- I think it's in the Appendix. We have a schedule for that MichCon rate case. So we filed in April, staff testimonies is not filed until September. And then this case will play out in the fall. So other than saying that we stand by our filing and our methodology right now, there's not much else I can say. And I think you'll have to wait and see where the staff takes their position in the fall. And then, certainly, we'll talk more about it in the fall as it evolves. But we always, through the rate proceeding, will stand by our numbers.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Fallon [ph], [indiscernible] Capital Management.","Unknown Analyst","Just a question on the portfolio that you guys are buying, the $200 million. Are you expecting to earn above utility authorized returns on the $200 million or smaller equity component?","David E. Meador","So the way we described this business line, that's our energy services business line, that we already do this. So it's where we own and operate assets like wastewater treatment and a variety of energy assets that include compressed air and things like that. We target a 9% to 10% IRR in this business line. And it's slightly above a return that you would see at the utility. I've always referred to this as our private utilities, so we get slightly than better utility returns. I don't have to go through rate cases. It's not exposed to weather. It's been a nice stable earner for us.","Unknown Analyst","So you should earn that on the full $200 million?","David E. Meador","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And on the REF plants that are being, either relocated currently or under contract to be relocated, can you give the tonnages that are on those 2?","David E. Meador","No. We're not going to do that at this time.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Is that an EEI update type of thing?","David E. Meador","It depends where we are on the other 2 machines. Obviously, as I'm negotiating with various counter-parties, I think we're just not going to provide that detail yet. And possibly at EEI, and if not, then it would be after the first of the year when everything is sited and up and running.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And the last question, in the slides you indicate that you expect to earn your authorized ROE on a temperature normal basis. Does that mean that Detroit Edison this year, it's possible or likely even that you over earned this year because weather is so strong?","Peter B. Oleksiak","I mean when you look at authorized returns, it always is on a temperature normalized basis. But there is -- as we push it above the upper end of guidance, obviously, our returns will go above that authorized return.","Unknown Analyst","So the strength at Detroit Edison this year, it's the weather which pushes you above your authorized and that's it?","Peter B. Oleksiak","That's correct.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Andrew Weisel, Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Research","You already touched on most of my questions, but I just got 1 or 2 kind of more bookkeeping ones. Can you quantify the weather impact in 2Q, both versus the prior year and in the other normal weather assumption that you had originally embedded in guidance?","Peter B. Oleksiak","For the Q2, it's $21 million just for the quarter for Detroit Edison alone. And if you look at it, and actually in terms of the weather impact, last year, we had a decoupling, so actually it was kind of brought back to temperature normal. That $21 million really represents our deviation for temperature normal this year.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. Got it. And then lastly on the corporate impairing, there's no real change to the $54 million guidance? The refinancing, if I recall was late June, so would it be fair to say that, that number could come down in this year and future years? And maybe any other thoughts on the trajectory of that going forward?","David E. Meador","Right now, there is net interest savings that will flow through that. But there is some other items that possibly could offset that from time to time, including some tax items that flow through that. So for now, we're holding at that number. And I think the appropriate time for us to give you an update on the trajectory going forward would be when we provide 2013 guidance. But I think in general, it is probably going to be about at the level it is.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on the sales growth and weather, I guess, impact. I was a little confused. When I'm looking at the supplemental slides, it looks like residential sales growth is down 1%. And I assume that's with this hot weather. Commercial looks like it was up. And at least I didn't -- I didn't follow through with the comments that you guys had in terms of what's driving in terms of -- the numbers I thought you guys were mentioning were a little bit flatter, so could you elaborate a little bit on that for me?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes. As you mentioned, from a weather perspective, the residential segment, when you look at the first quarter and with the warm weather we had, it really impacted the MichCon, but it did impact the electric segment as well. There's a lot of heating related load. So when you look at it all in, compared to last year, actually in a temperature normal -- I mean, with the weather basis actually we're down. So really the heating load impact that we saw in the first quarter was partially offset with the cooling demand that we saw on the second quarter. But some of that just reflects on the weather we had last year. Last year we had a good winter also, as well as a relatively warm second quarter. But when you look at, even for the year for residential, when you look on a pure temperature normal basis year-to-date actually we're above. So we're seeing positive impact at a comparative basis, the temperature normal, but a decline year-over-year given the strength of the weather last year. And then from an earnings perspective, really what matters is where we are versus the temperature normalized basis. So last year really was swept by the revenue decoupling mechanism.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Sure. Okay. But then when we look at this -- I mean, in other words, so last year was warmer than this year -- this last Q2 2011 was warmer than Q2 2012?","Peter B. Oleksiak","We were actually warmer this year. But the first quarter, we had more strength of weather-related sales for residential.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","It looks like residential went down on a year-over-year basis Q2 2011 versus Q2 2012?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm just wondering, it does seems like it's a little counterintuitive if weather was warmer. I mean -- or I could follow-up offline, I guess. Just, also, was there a higher peak this year, given the record setting temperatures or did you guys not have a higher peak?","David E. Meador","We don't have that number with us. And I think that the territory peak was higher, but I think our load was comparable. You're talking through June. I think July is going to be different. And I think we're going to see that we're hitting new peaks in July. But we'll, obviously, update that on the third quarter, Paul. On load, just an observation coming out of 2008, we went down really hard, as you know. And then we saw a very significant bounce back in 2009 and then '10 in our industrial load. Commercial load lagged that a little bit, so we didn't see the up in 2009. We saw a big up in commercial load and in 2010. And then residential load over a long period of time has surprised us, in terms of its strength. So when we look at broader economic indicators here, we're seeing a lot of positive signs. We're looking as you are looking at these quarter-over-quarter numbers and saying does that indicate a trend that we should be concerned about going forward. We don't see that. But we're still seeing long-term load growth. It will be modest and won't be as robust as what we saw possibly historically, but something over 1%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just on the rate proceeding, just to make sure I understand this. If your new proposal, I mean we'll -- we don't know whether or not -- what's going to happen with the decoupling. But it looks as if you're able to get your new proposal that may or may not be released next week, depending on what happens with the MPSC's action with the Supreme Court. You guys think that you may be able to stay out for an electric rate case for how long was it again?","David E. Meador","Well, our goal is to see if we can stay out until 2015. This piece would only be one of several things that we would have to work on. So it's not just using the $127 million. But it's certainly, it's an anchor to that, that says if we can get agreement not to return that to net income but to use that, it could be part of a series of things that we do that would allow us to stay out for a while.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally on Slide 24, your Trading reconciliation. If I'm understanding it correctly, it looks like you guys are pretty much where you were in 2011 on Trading, except for these accounting adjustments, except for the sort of accrual treatment with certain contracts and what have you. Is that -- am I getting that pretty much correct?","Peter B. Oleksiak","That is. But I did mention, if look you at that difference in terms of the economic versus accounting, those -- it really is related to some longer-term contracts to restructure, so we'll see the accounting benefit. But it will be a few years out. So you're not going to see that this year or next year.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jim von Riesemann, UBS.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you just talk a little bit about the future, in terms of cash flow. What your outlook is for say 2013 and beyond, both on a cash flow and maybe some of your funding needs, both the debt as well as the equity?","David E. Meador","We provide a 3-year look, we usually do that when we come out at EEI. So if you recall, what we had laid out was that in a sources and uses that over a 3-year period, we needed $1.2 billion. And that was going to be $300 million of equity each year and that would be done through our benefit plans and our pension plans, so DRIP and pension. And then there was another $300 million that we were earmarking for asset sales, which is predominantly the Barnett sale.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is it safe to assume some of the basic premises in the business are going to be the same going forward in terms of like the internal plant, et cetera?","David E. Meador","Yes.","Operator","We'll now hear from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry guys, just a quick follow-up and sorry if I missed this. Did you disclose what the amount of the RDM true-up of MichCon was in the second quarter? Or could you, if you didn't?","Peter B. Oleksiak","That's around $10 million pretax. It's about $11 million.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","$11 million pretax. Okay. Normal tax rate on that?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes.","Operator","We'll now hear from Kit Konolige, BGC Financial.","Kit Konolige","So a couple of strategic items. Energy Trading obviously continuing to track below your expectations. Is there any thought about whether you want to remain in that segment indefinitely at this point?","David E. Meador","We are going to remain in the segment. As we have indicated, we like this business. It's not part of our growth plan. It provides a lot of market intelligence. It provides a lot of hedging and other activities to other parts of the business and it's over long period of time. It's thrown off a significant amount of cash to the parent, so we like that. And the market opportunities are soft right now, so it's just they're struggling to generate margin right now. And it's a business where we have to deal with what the market brings us necessarily. It's not a business that I'm going to push them hard. So even though I'm not happy with the net income, the team is doing everything they can do in this environment. So we're not going to change our risk profile or get more aggressive just because I don't want to change -- chase net income.","Kit Konolige","Okay. Good. And then so for the Barnett assets, looking at a sale there by year end. I mean can you give us some insight into, do you have that process underway now or are there benchmarks or milestones that we should be looking towards?","David E. Meador","Well, what we have laid out was that we wanted to prove up the properties and we had actually a pretty aggressive drilling program that was going on through August. So we went from 1 rig to 2 rigs to 3 rigs. For a company our size, that's a lot of rigs drilling. And they will be done drilling in August and complete their wells in September. And we're already starting the process of setting up the data room and so on. So all indications right now is that we'll engage in the process starting in the September time frame.","Kit Konolige","And one final item separately. Do you have some idea of a run rate in net income or EPS from the savings on interest rate, the refinancing flowing through the debt into the income statement?","David E. Meador","Long term, the number is in the $25 million to $30 million range.","Kit Konolige","In a net income?","David E. Meador","That's pretax savings. So that's DTE, so that's across the enterprise.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Vedula Murti, CDP Capital.","Vedula Murti","I was wondering in terms of following up on Kevin's question on P&I acquisition here. Would it be reasonable for us to think on $200 million of capital investment, basically, 50-50 and maybe a couple of 100 basis points superior return on equity versus a utility return, in terms of kind of a baseline?","David E. Meador","I would hold back on this right now and I'm not going to provide any more details. We've not closed on the transaction yet. First of all, and it's possible that there's a number of projects here that are evaluating that it might not come in into the final close. And there are also, and we'll lay this in more detail, this is a project that has an accounting amortization that's front-end loaded. So the earnings grow over time. That's very strong cash flow from the beginning, but there's an accounting nuance here. So I wouldn't take that high-level approach and I'm not prepared to -- it's too early to give you more details on that right now. I would just caution you not to do that and then suggest, again, the way I'm thinking about this as we showed you the whitespace and the growth for the P&I business. And that long term, this fills in about half of that whitespace if you want to kind of size the net income off this investment.","Operator","We'll now hear from John Ally [ph], AK Capital [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. Your plan for DTE is to stay out as long as possible. When would you file and what year would that be effective?","David E. Meador","Well, if we're successful in working out everything that we've have to work out, we would file in 2014. Now the caveat there is, again, in spirit of doing everything we can for customers while achieving our financial objectives, I'm articulating this as a goal. If we are not able to work out everything we want to do, we'd be filing earlier. But right now, we're just articulating that as a goal of push the filing out to 2014 for new rates in '15.","Unknown Analyst","Understood. And on the Barnett, is the $300 million still a good number to use as a bogey?","David E. Meador","Yes, for now.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. When will we see a more defined, I guess, update on that?","David E. Meador","Possibly, third quarter or EEI we'll be able to give you some indication. It really depends how quick the process goes.","Operator","We'll now go to Kevin Cole, Credit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up on the electric rate case. I guess given the FERMI securitization roll off of around $300 million in 2015, do you think it is possible for this netting effect to fully offset your CapEx plan between now and then to execute a near 0% customer bill increased rate case?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Kevin, as we're working through our own planning, we think this was a piece of the puzzle. As you know, we are always looking at cost and how do we kind of to do our own self-help in this space. So it will be a combination of the 2.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Meador, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David E. Meador","Well, thank you again for joining us. And as I indicated, I think that the next time we'll see everybody first at the Barclays Conference and then the BofA Merrill Conference a couple of weeks after that. And wish you a nice warm summer and we'll talk to you in the fall.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Barbara Tuckfield. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Barbara Tuckfield","Thank you, Rachel, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to read the Safe Harbor statement on page 2 of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. ","Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today's presentation. ","With us this morning are Gerry Anderson, Chairman and CEO; Jerry Norcia, President and COO; and Peter Oleksiak, Senior Vice President and CFO. We also have members of the management team to call on during the Q&A section.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gerry to start the call.","Gerry Anderson","Thanks Barb. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. So this morning, I will give you a quick recap of our performance in the first quarter. And then I will turn it over to Peter to provide a financial review, and then Jerry Norcia will take you through some of our investment activities, a bit [ph] around our long term growth, and then we'll take your questions. ","So I'm going to start on slide 4. So we continue to make good progress on several key fronts. First of all, I'll just start by saying that our first quarter financial results were strong. And they added materially to the contingency that we have for the balance of the year. So we came into the year with contingency and we've added to that in the first quarter. And given that, with a quarter behind us in 2019, I'm really confident that we're well positioned to deliver on our financial plans this year and extend our streak of being able to meet our commitments to you.","Longer term as you know, we continue to target 5% to 7% operating EPS growth through 2023. And just as a reminder, our initial guidance for 2019 is the starting point for that growth. ","So a big part of consistently reaching our financial goals is our workforce and our company's culture. And I'm pleased to say that just about a month ago, we received Gallup's Great Workplace award for the seventh consecutive year. And Gallup has been in this business for a long time, decades. And over that time period, only 10 other companies in their global database have ever gotten seven of those awards in a row. So it says a lot about sort of the focus and mindset of our people and I'm really proud of that accomplishment for our people.","So as we look forward to the next five years and we continue to invest heavily in our capital plan, we also remain committed to a strong balance sheet. Our plans call for us to issue $1 billion to $1.5 billion in equity over the next three years with up to $250 million of that this year. Peter will talk a bit more about that in a few minutes.","I think most of you are also aware that the State of Michigan is in the midst of a fundamental transformation in the way we generate electricity. And in line with that, last month, we filed an integrated resource plan in which we laid out our thoughts on how we will generate electricity in the future.","The IRP, which was submitted to the Public Service Commission on March 29, outlined the steps that we will take over the next five years and beyond to transform to a cleaner generation mix. And we'll do that by adding substantially more renewables, by increasing our energy efficiency investments and by retiring our coal plants sooner than we had previously announced.","So for context, in early 2017, so two years ago, we were one of the first energy companies in the industry to voluntarily commit to reducing carbon emissions 80% by 2050. Well, our plan over the last two years has evolved and we've accelerated that commitment by a decade. So our IRP lays out that we will reduce carbon emissions 80% by 2040. And near-term, we've committed to a 50% carbon emissions reduction by 2030 and a one-third reduction by 2023. I'll talk a little more about our IRP in just a minute.","In our gas utility, DTE Gas, we're accelerating the pace of gas main renewal. So that'll have us investing an additional $450 million in capital over the next five years. And that'll happen within our infrastructure recovery mechanism, and that reduces the timeframe to complete the main replacement program from 25 years to 18. So with the weather having broken here, our team is fast at work beginning to take on a spring and summer and falls of gas main replacement activity. ","In our gas storage and pipeline business, we're moving for the completion of our acquisition of the Generation Pipeline, which should be finalized in the second half of this year. So the acquisition of the Generation Pipeline is fully consistent with the strategic growth plans that we have for NEXUS and fits very well with NEXUS' goals like customers in Ohio, especially Northern Ohio, as well as Michigan, Chicago, Ontario and other markets with Marcellus and Utica gas as those resources continue to grow. And in our power and industrial business, we continue to see progress in the development of both industrial energy services projects, and new renewable natural gas or RNG projects. ","So we are finalizing agreements for two new RNG projects to be incremental to the projects we've developed in recent years. And beyond that, we continue advanced discussions to secure additional RNG projects later this year. We also expect our Ford Motor Company cogen project to be operational in the fourth quarter of this year. So construction is sort of moving ahead at a fast clip on that project, and we're also finalizing the acquisition of a new cogeneration project, and Jerry, our COO will describe that in a few minutes.","So moving on to slide 5, I mentioned the IRP earlier and we submitted that. And the IRP lays out, the plan you can see on the left hand side of slide 30 between now and 2030. And you can see I mentioned the fundamental transformation in our generation. Well, the next decade alone brings a very market shift in the way that we generate power. And I think ensures that Michigan will continue to be a leader in the transition to cleaner energy sources nationally. ","So the plan -- our IRP provides a very well defined and specific strategy for powering our homes and businesses over the next five years. So between now and 2024, as well as what I call a flexible plan for the 2025 to 2040 period. And we're flexible longer term because as you know, technologies, as well as the markets we serve, and the MISO marketplace more broadly, are all going to continue to evolve in ways that are hard to predict long-term. And so we need a flexible plan to take account of that. So we're quite specific for the next five years and then introduce more flexibility longer term. ","What is a fixed marker though is the plan to reduce carbon emissions 50% by 2030 and 80% by 2040. And that plan as we model it, is not only achievable, it's achievable in a way that works for both affordability and reliability for our customers. Now it will require substantial investments. So to achieve the goal, we will be aggressively investing in renewables. And the next five years call for us to invest approximately $2 billion in renewables to more than double our renewable production capacity by 2024. ","Those investments are going to target primarily wind over the next few years, because wind is still more cost effective in Michigan, than is solar. But we do anticipate a shift to solar in the 2024 timeframe, because solar costs continue to become more competitive here in the State.","We're also expanding our voluntary renewable program, and this has been really interesting in recent months. The voluntary program offers homes and businesses the opportunity to buy more clean energy. And in the process accelerate our state's transition to overall carbon reductions and sustainability goals. This also allows individual companies to meet their ESG goals. And we've seen this play out in a significant way in the first quarter of this year, when we announced partnerships with Ford, General Motors and the University of Michigan for sizable transactions.","Together these three customers have signed contracts that we will be supplying by investing in over 350 megawatts of additional wind production. So that's over and above what we will be investing in to meet our utility goals. And we will be investing over $600 million of capital to pull that off. So big moves on the voluntary front in the first quarter, and we expect more contracts like these down the road.","We're also moving our previously announced retirements of the Trenton Channel power plant and the Sinclair Power Plant, both coal fired power plants, we're moving the closure of those plants up a year to 2022. The River Rouge plant will be coming off in 2022, as well. So we have three substantial coal plants coming off in just a few years. And the key factor that allows us to close those plants in 2022 is the fact that the Blue Water Energy Center, our new natural gas combined cycle plant is proceeding through construction well, and we're now confident that it will come online in 2023 to help backfill for those three coal plants that will come offline. ","Blue Water is key to our system reliability as we take off about 20% of our peak capacity production with those coal plants because it will be there when we see the normal fluctuations in renewable power when wind isn't blowing or the sun isn't shining. But the construction on Blue Water is coming along very well. And so we're able to accelerate the retirement of a couple of those coal plants.","So with that, I'm going to turn things over to Peter to give you a little more detail on our financial results. Peter, over to you.","Peter Oleksiak ","Thanks, Gerry. Good morning, everyone. For again to financials, as you know, I always like to give an update on the Detroit Tigers and if you hear a smile on my voice here, that's because we won both games of a doubleheader yesterday against the Red Sox. So we are above 500. An exciting start to the season and hopefully we can build on the wins we've had here in April. ","Let me turn the attention now to financial results for DTE, I'll start the review on slide six. The first quarter came in strong with earnings at $374 million. This translates to $2.05 per share for the quarter. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix. ","Let me start my review at the top of the page with our utilities. Both utilities benefited from a cold start of the year versus last year. And the first row are the results of our electric utility. DTE Electric earnings were $147 million for the quarter and this is $5 million higher than the first quarter of last year. This increase is driven primarily by colder weather and the impact of new rates implemented last year. Our electric business also had higher O&M and increased depreciation and other expense related items to rate base growth. ","DTE Gas had first quarter 2019 operating earnings of $151 million, and this is a $40 million increase from the first quarter of 2018. The earnings increase is driven primarily by the impact of new rates, implemented late last year and colder weather. There's also approximately a $10 million related tax timing item that we reversed in the second quarter of 2019.","Let's move down the page to the third row to our Gas Storage and Pipeline business. Operating earnings for our GSP segment were $48 million for the quarter. The quarter results are also in line with our 2019 full year guidance. Last year, we had one time positive earnings related to AFUDC earnings at NEXUS as well as return to normal gathering volumes this year unless [ph] you got a very strong year across all of our platforms. ","As a result this quarter is down $14 million versus 2018 first quarter but in line with this year's annual guidance. In the next row you can see our power and industrial business segment, operating earnings were $26 million. Earnings are $16 million lower than the first quarter of 2018. This decrease is due mainly to the REF tax equity transactions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. As we've communicated previously, we entered into equity partnerships in our REF units and accelerated cash flows about $100 million per year for the next three years to support other growth projects. ","This lowered earnings this year around $40 million versus 2018. Also I can note that most of our new projects P&I originated will start adding to earnings late this year and early next year.","Our Energy Trading business had operating earnings of $5 million and earnings are up $4 million from last year. Our trading segment had a particularly strong quarter with its power portfolio. Economic contribution was up significantly quarter-over-quarter. The appendix contains standard energy trading reconciliations showing both economic and accounting performance. And finally corporate and other was $13 million favorable compared to the first quarter last year due to the timing of taxes.","Overall DTE earned $2.05 per share in the first quarter of 2019 and this is $0.14 higher than the first quarter of last year. ","Let's move to our balance sheet on slide 7. We expect to issue between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of equity over the next three years, including $250 million this year. This year, year-to-date, we've already issued $150 million mainly with contribution of equity into our pension plan in the month of March. ","Our credit metrics are well within the targeted ranges set by the rating agencies. So we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which supports our capital investment program and growth plans, and positions the company to continue strong investment grade credit rating. ","With that I'll turn it over to Jerry Norcia, who'll go over our utility and non-utility growth projects.","Jerry Norcia","Thanks Peter. As Gerry mentioned DTE had a strong start for the year and we continue to build on our solid long-term plan that we laid out at the platform. I want to highlight several significant achievements of both our utility and non-utility businesses. ","So I'll start on slide 8. In January, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved DTE's proposal to expand our Michigan Green Power program, other businesses and industrial companies, which can bring power's [indiscernible] the renewable program Gerry was describing. ","This program is now available to all DTE customers' level, residential, commercial and industrial customers. And in February [Technical Difficulty] operating Wind Park in Michigan, as well as DTE's most cost effective wind project to-date. The 65 turbines will provide enough clean energy to power more than 50,000 homes.","Last summer, we broke ground on our Blue Water Energy Center, our natural gas combined cycle power plant that will help meet our goal of reducing carbon emissions. Gerry highlighted the fact that Michigan is undergoing an energy transformation and how our recent IRP filings define how we will be moving our generation fleet to cleaner energy. That plan provides for necessary home-grown 24X7 power at times where renewable resources aren't available, while also aggressively, as you heard growing our renewable energy portfolio. ","So moving on to our gas utility, DTE Gas has begun to implement elements of the last time's approved rate order, including our accelerated main renewal program. I'm very pleased with the progress of this program, which will ramp up significantly now that the weather has broken.","Additionally, we announced plans to reduce methane emissions from our gas utility by more than 80% by 2040. We have made good progress on this effort so far from our baseline levels, achieving a 20% reduction through 2018. We are also leading an industry coalition of 3 [indiscernible] aimed at reducing methane emissions and the supply chain of pipes and producers.","Now I'd like to move on to our non-utility businesses. I'll start with an update on growth opportunities at our gas storage and pipeline business. On our year-end call we announced that NEXUS is acquiring Generation Pipeline, on the 50-50 partnership with Enbridge. This is an example of an add-on business that fits directly within GSP's long-term growth strategy. ","Millennium Pipeline completed a 0.2 Bcf per day expansion. In the first quarter, which now brings the pipe to 1.2 Bcf per day. We have numerous additional expansion opportunities within our current gathering and transport platforms. ","Moving on to NEXUS and Link, they continue to perform well. NEXUS is contracted to approximately $900 million a day with long-term contracts. It is drawing [ph] approximately 1.2 Bcf a day and the balance of those contracts are short-term contracts. Link asset have been performing very well, I would say better than planned. ","Next, I will walk through our power and industrial business. As Gerry mentioned, our P&I business continued to see progress in development of both industrial energy projects and renewable natural gas. We feel the RNG market is poised to continue its growth trajectory into the future. An addition to the project was secured in 2017 and '18. We are finalizing agreements on two new greenfield RNG projects. And we continue advanced discussions to secure additional RNG projects in 2018.","On the industrial energy side, we're focusing on our co-generation business. Along with our Ford Motor project, we are in a late stage negotiations on additional co-generation projects. We will provide the details as this progresses and moves towards close. Along with these projects, our P&I queue continues to be very strong.","Now I'll wrap up on slide 9, and then we'll open it up for questions. To sum it up, I feel great have our first quarter results and our position to continue our growth in the years to come. Our utilities continue to focus on necessary infrastructure investments, specifically investments in clean generation and investments to improve reliability and the customer experience. Our nonutility businesses continue to position us for growth. ","Our balance sheet is strong and we have solid credit ratings. I'm confident that we are on track to continue to deliver on our long-term 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate. And I feel very good about our ability to continue to deliver the premium total shareholder returns that we have delivered over the past decade.","With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And Rachel, you can open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Constantine Lednev","Hi, good morning, guys. It's actually Constantine for Shar, He had to hop on another call. Congratulation on good earnings. Just one kind of quick question, for you Gerry, thanks for going over the business growth at GSP. So one other thing that I wanted to ask was you mentioned that there's kind of a mix of greenfield and gathering opportunities and some potential strategic acquisitions in the future. ","In terms of thinking about how you're going to deploy capital into that business, what's the mix there and how are you thinking about it?","Gerry Anderson","Well, our first order is always organic growth. What we're seeing right now is significant opportunities, organic opportunities in our existing platforms. And Generation Pipeline is an example of that, as we close that and then move to connect with the NEXUS it'll be a great market sync for that pipeline. We also have several other opportunities across all our platforms that we're pursuing, that we feel real good about. And those are organic in nature, either connectors or expansions. And in addition to that we do see opportunities for strategic asset acquisitions that connect to these platforms, we'll look part of those.","Constantine Lednev","And magnitude wise, do you think it's going to be closer to something like generation or slightly bigger, just thinking about the overall kind of $4 billion to $5 billion number over the five years?","Gerry Anderson","Right, I think we're -- right now we're focused on building out that opportunity set and I can tell you that we're, I would say we're in line with our guidance this year, in terms of growth capital for both P&I and GSP and feeling really good about that opportunity pipeline. And we continue to secure -- as we secure those, we're securing EPS growth for the future.","Peter Oleksiak","But I would say in addition to that, that things we've looked at for acquisitions have ranged anywhere from the scale of generation pipeline, to the scale of Link and lots of things in between. The other thing I'd say on our capital numbers is we're a lot more focused on value and accretion then we are a capital number and earnings number. And the organic things tend to come in harder with better returns, less capital, some of the acquisitions that set you up for more of that, maybe larger capital numbers, but at least at the outset, a little bit lower accretion. ","So to continue growing we need a mix of those things. And we're looking at a series of first of organic and then see the range of things we've seen for potential acquisition is all over the map from pretty small bolt-on to things that are a bit larger on the scale like Link.","Constantine Lednev","Okay, and just a quick follow-up on also on the GSP business. You mentioned kind of a mix of shorter term contracts on NEXUS. Is there plan to fill that with longer term contract or is the kind of economics working favorably right now on keeping it the way that it is?","Gerry Anderson","So short -- certainly the answer ","keeping it the way that it is.","So short -- certainly the answer is yes, we're looking to move the balance of the capacity to longer term contracts. We feel some of the tailwinds, there are that the basin that we're operating and continues to grow, we expect 5% to 6% a year, which is significant. It's producing about 28 Bcf a day, a day now. And so we view that as a -- sort of strong tailwind. ","In addition to that we're seeing some other pipelines face strong headwinds, if you will, in terms of going into service. We find ourselves in a pretty good position with available long-term capacity that we can place or we see the prices being right and the term being right. And that's what we're really working towards just trying to get the right price and the right time for these contracts, long term contracts. So we're happy to take the short-term contracts in the meantime.","Constantine Lednev","Okay. ","Peter Oleksiak","I would say that we're consistent with what we've really been saying for about a year, which is, we see the base and going short takeaway in the early 2020, 2021, 2020 timeframe. And that's what producers will be targeting. Of course, if some of the pipes in the region delay or don't get built, it intensifies that dynamic.","Constantine Lednev","Great. That's really great color. And just one kind of last one on a little bit more of a strategic end, as you kind of mentioned the 25, 75 and non-regulated to regulated business mix. So is that kind of target going forward for the next 5 years?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, as we model forward that's where we keep landing. ","Constantine Lednev","Okay. And kind of the IRP, I guess supports some of that growth on the regulated front?","Unidentified Company Representative ","Yes, that's right. IRP, voluntary renewables and as you know, we're in a heavy capital replacement program in both distribution or operations as well, gas and electric. So yeah, that's what keeps the mix even though we're growing the other businesses keeps the mix at that 75, 25 roughly.","Constantine Lednev","Okay. Perfect. Thanks. That's it for me.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Praful Mehta ","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning.","Praful Mehta","Good morning. So maybe just touching on the IRP and the whole retirement of coal plants, I wanted to understand from an economic perspective most utilities almost have a benefit on customer bill, these are diamonds. How are you seeing that play out in your IRP? Do you see customer bill impacting positive flat or bills going up? How do you see that playing out in your IRP plan?","Gerry Anderson","So what we've talked about on our bills overall is that our goal is to keep as we invest both in distribution and generation, keep our rate increases to low-single-digits. And we think, we'll be able to do that. In some regimes, if you get into the Great Plains where wind may come in at $0.02, you can displace fuel costs in a way that you may see benefits to bills. We're trying to get our renewable additions in with modest increases and that's what we're seeing. So there's enough capital here and we bring say wind in today at $0.045. ","So we have good wind regime in Michigan, but it's not the best in the country. Certainly a long way from the worst too, it's a good regime, but not quite as strong as you might see in the Great Plains. So I'd say, we're bringing it out in a way that works for customers and is going to keep our overall bill increases affordable and workable.","Praful Mehta ","Got you. So not as good at benefit, but it is manageable within the current plan? ","Gerry Anderson","Yes, I mean, we wouldn't be out saying we can go down 50 and 80, if we hadn't modeled that this is workable from a price and reliability perspective. We spent a lot of time studying that, and absolutely is workable. And generally speaking, I think technology is going to continue to evolve in ways that make this more workable, and probably make things happen faster than people anticipate today. ","Praful Mehta","Got you, interesting. And the other interesting point you brought up on the voluntary contracts, is that something you expect would push the process of this transformation sooner? And how does that then play into bills to these people who sign up the voluntary contracts bear an incremental burden for the transition for those particular contracts?","Gerry Anderson","Well, the contracts are signed up with customers. So the balance of the customers don't pay for those. So GM is paying for their renewables, Ford, UM. And so what that means is as the utility we have said that will have at least 25% of our supply from renewables by 2030. This voluntary could push us up to the range of 30 for the state, with some of that being utility commitments, and some of it being individual customer commitments. ","So the RECs for these projects are assigned to those specific customers and retired by those customers, and in the name of those customers. So we can't use it for utility compliance. It accrues specifically to GM, Ford and the University of Michigan.","Praful Mehta","Got it. Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for that. And then just finally, just a simple clarification question, when you talk about the gas business, Q1 \u201819, versus \u201818, the $40 million uplift that you experienced in \u201819, only partly is explained through weather and the one-time, I think the tax impact that Peter also talked about. What else is driving the improvement and why doesn't that show up on an annual basis in terms of an uplift for the gas side? It seems like the annual number is still the same. So just trying to understand and reconcile how Q1 performance doesn't kind of flow through?","Peter Oleksiak","We've had a very strong start to the year. You mentioned some of the items. We have some of them that are kind of one-time nature. We have weather variability this year. And we also have some tax items. Last year, we booked some accruals related to tax reform. We gave significant benefits back to customers. About half of that $40 million, we looked at the weather and tax timing year-over-year. The other is more permanent. We have a new rate case, last year, we have new orders, new rates coming in. ","We do see a disproportionate amount of that coming into the first quarter just because half the volumes for the year play out in the first quarter. So we see a lot of capability with the new rates coming in as well as we have NEXUS related revenue coming in with NEXUS in service, that's the other half.","Gerry Anderson","In NEXUS we had investments in the utility to enable NEXUS. Those actually benefit the utility customers. They see a benefit, but there are earnings tied to that. So between the new rate case which internalized new capital in the rate base and the NEXUS impacts, that's an equivalent impact of what the weather and timing items were. ","Peter Oleksiak","So very strong start. And Gerry Anderson did mention in his opening remarks around continuously we're building this year and we do have some contingency we are building [ph] for gas utility. ","Praful Mehta","Got you. Well, thanks so much, guys. Appreciate the color.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning, everyone. ","Gerry Anderson","Good morning. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Nice. So I just wanted to follow-up on the IRP discussion. First, just to be exceptionally clear about what's reflected in your CapEx budget today, obviously, the gas plant is but with respect to generation investment on a longer dated side, how does that reconcile with some of the updated and accelerated timelines that you propose in the IRP? ","And then secondly, and related obviously, we've seen some developments on consumer energy's IRP of late and some specific settlement terms. How do you think about the ability to settle your own IRP, and I know, again, I appreciate it's early, but some of the critical pieces, such as recovery on PPAs, and again, more broadly, with respect to PURPA, if you can comment, at least initially, as you see it.","Gerry Anderson","Yeah, so the IRP, as I said, is very specific for the first five years. And then after that, we actually proposed a range of scenarios that may play out depending on how technology and other factors evolve. And when you look at the first five years, they're very consistent with the plan that we laid out at EEI last year. So Blue Water is in there, as expected. The renewables that we need to build to meet the 2021 commitment that we have under the RPS are all in there. ","We do have voluntary renewables in the plan. We have 600 megawatts in. But we are only one quarter into that plan, and we signed up 350. So we're feeling awfully good about being over halfway, only a quarter into the first year of the five years. ","And I do think there'll be more of that, as other companies continue to look hard at what they need to commit to their investors and their customers. So that's going well. So I would say, on the whole, the IRP is entirely consistent with the plan that we laid out at EEI and makes us feel really good that we're on track to achieve it from that perspective. Concerning CMS and their settlement, I think you'd probably be better to direct questions of settlement and terms and so forth around that to them. ","We could settle, although I don't know that I anticipate that. Ours is a pretty early in the process. And then I think it's a pretty straightforward IRP in the sense that most of the discussion is specific, is near-term and it's all things that have been out there for the commission to see for a long time. So wouldn't think the first five years would be controversial.","On PURPA, we actually got a staff order on our PURPA case today that I think continues to evolve that policy in the right direction and in a positive way. In our case, couple of specifics were that they found that we had no capacity need -- no need for capacity. So any PURPA projects would be attached with energy only prices and if the day does come that we're determined to have a capacity need, they set the price at the Blue Water Energy center price which is in the $0.045 range, which is pretty consistent with the renewables that we're bringing on, as I mentioned earlier. ","So the new assets that we're bringing on are in the $0.045 range. And so that's where roughly where they've set the price, which is a good evolution from, I'd say the -- some of the early thinking on how PURPA pricing might be handled. So we feel positive about all of that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it understood. And then separately, just to clarify this voluntary renewables, I know you mentioned it already. But is there a timeline on getting the rebalance of the 300 to 600 resolved?","Gerry Anderson","Yeah, I mean, within five years, is that -- it's in our five year plan. So we've had a really fast start to the effort. I mean, we are looking to bring in 250 megawatts more over the remaining four years and three quarters.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. And then just lastly, anything quickly on replacing the remainder of the midstream acquisition plays?","Gerry Anderson","I think we answered that earlier with we're looking at a whole range of potential or both organic and sizes on acquisitions if we execute those. So I don't know that there's more to say than that. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, fair enough. Just maybe just wanted to be crystal clear. Thank you very much.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from -- just a moment, sorry -- from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Fishman","Hi, good morning. Another follow-up on the IRP. As you guys already mentioned, the filing of one more wind capacity up front, far less solar heavy, relative to some others in Michigan, largely due to cost competitiveness. But when you think about the mix between DT Electric owning versus PPA in this capacity and how other dockets have progressed, does wind present a more compelling utility own proposition relative to solar over the next five years in Michigan? Or they're not really material differences between owning and PPI if it's wind versus solar?","Gerry Anderson","Well, look, one of the reasons that the legislation in 2016, it was passed in '16 about to enable companies to own 100% is that between 2008 and 2016, when there was a 50-50 split, there just was no compelling evidence that third-parties were bringing in wind capacity or renewable capacity more cheaply. In fact, we were always, DTE was always at or below the third-party. So the legislation in '16 enabled utilities to own the renewable capacity. And that's what our plan calls for. ","We think we can absolutely do that at or below what third-parties can. And as you said, near-term that means wind, but long-term, we're convinced we can do the same on solar, and that we will be bringing solar on at or below what third-parties can, and that's our plan.","David Fishman","Okay, thanks. And then one follow-up on P&I, I know we talked about RNG projects in the past, I mean you announced acquiring our cogeneration projects. Are there any kind of incremental insights you can provide on kind of returns contract duration, and maybe how late in the cycle that cogeneration project is? Is it already developed or are you just kind of buying the rights?","Jerry Norcia","We are -- the contracts are long-term on the cogeneration projects, the cogeneration project that we're looking at, that we're in the final stages of discussion on. So I can say that.","David Fishman","Okay. But are -- so is this a completed kind of cogen project that you're just acquiring, once it's done? Or is this something where you'll be having an organic aspect to it? ","Jerry Norcia","The one that we're in final stages on is an existing facility -- operating facility. ","David Fishman","Okay. And high level, are there much competitive advantages with buying an existing cogeneration project? Are you able to bring gas from the GS&P [ph] or anything like that?","Jerry Norcia","But I can tell you that the returns are favorable and north of typical utility returns with a long term contract. So we feel good about our position there.","Gerry Anderson","I'd also say that our group who does that, probably does have operating cost advantages over other operators. Like any business, you can do a really good tight job of running assets or you can mess it up. And they've got 20 years of experience running these projects. So really understand how to do it efficiently. ","Jerry Norcia","And the asset is critical to the operation of the facility that it's connected to. And so operating experience and expertise is fundamental and certainly a competitive advantage. ","David Fishman","Okay.","Gerry Anderson","The other one is, that one is being finalized, we can't say too much specific about much -- more specific about it, and until perhaps it's done in public. But I will say the combination of that, plus the 2 RNG projects we mentioned, get you a long way down the road toward the $15 million that we can got that business targeting this year for incremental earnings growth. But there's as Jerry mentioned, the significant amount more in the queue that's very active behind those three projects. So he and I continue to feel like the opportunity set is good. ","David Fishman","All right. Thank you. Congrats again on a good quarter. ","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. How are you doing.","Gerry Anderson","Good.","Peter Oleksiak","Hi Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Hey, a couple questions on the -- in the electric rate case, the infrastructure recovery mechanism. Is that -- if that isn't approved, what happens with the next filings over the next few years? How does it change things?","Gerry Anderson","One proposal they've made is that we setup a work group to work out the details on the IRM rather than use the rate case to finalize that. And that would be fine, if it's the way it plays out. I think there, Jerry, you talk. But my sense is there continues to be a real interest in the mechanism but a desire to work through the details. ","Jerry Norcia","Yes, we spent a lot of time with commission staff creating an understanding of our investment profile over the next five years. And I would say there's been really strong support, as we invest in reliability and modernization of the grid, as well as our generation fleet, modernizing and transforming that fleet. So there's good visibility into our plan. ","So there is the opportunity to have an infrastructure renewal mechanism to sort of accommodate well understood capital. But I think like Gerry said, it's going to take some time to work through the details with the staff and the commission. And so our expectation is it is likely not going to happen in this rate case. And the consequence of that is it will be in for regular rate cases. So I think if we can get one done benefit is that we can lock in long-term investment plans and drive efficiency into those plans for our customers. ","So we see value there as well as reducing the frequency of rate cases that are pretty straightforward.","Gerry Anderson","The staff proposal was to set up a work group to continue to work through the details. ","Michael Weinstein","And working group is better than a rejection. Okay. On the gathering and processing, can you talk about volume growth and what you expect that to be over the next few years? What it's been this year and specifically on Link, what's the capacity utilization rate on the Link system at this point during Q1?","Jerry Norcia","What I can tell you is that, we expect the Appalachian base in which most of our assets, all of our assets are really connected to grow at 5% to 6% over the next 10 years or so. That's very positive. I mean, it has grown faster in the past, but I think as the basin matures, as well as capital discipline has entered into the production, capital markets, we see -- we project a 5 % to 6% growth. And we think that our assets, Link, Bluestone, Millennium, NEXUS are well positioned to competitively attach that volume growth.","Gerry Anderson","So and you asked specifically about Link, Link continues to perform, as Jerry mentioned earlier, ahead of the pro forma that we had for it. We mentioned last year a new gathering contract, we are in the middle of building that out. The drilling that we see around Link is proceeding kind of exactly as we anticipated, actually, in this year's plan. ","So there is talk of producers not getting out over their skis with capital they spend to chase resources. But in terms of the drilling we're seeing around our gathering assets, it's right in line with what we expected and right in line with our plan for this year. So that, I guess domain you'd say is proceeding well for us in 2019. ","Michael Weinstein","I think you had -- last update was that it's 80% contracted. Is that still the latest you're willing to talk about or is there an update to that?","Jerry Norcia","I don't think we\u2026","Gerry Anderson","I don't think we've talked about contracting levels. It's certainly rising. We're growing into it. And there are various components of the pipe too. So there's a Southern Leg and a Northern Leg and each of them have their own dynamics. So it's not like a point to point pipe like Millennium is it's quite as easy to sum up that way. But\u2026","Jerry Norcia","Like we've said in the past that there's significant amount of expandability that we could secure on a pipe. And as matter of fact, they are under construction right now with a significant expansion on that pipe, to support a customer need with long term contract. So we're in expansion mode right now on Link.","Michael Weinstein","Right. And on P&I, are you guys ahead of plan for $15 million a year of growth? I mean, it sounds like there's -- it sounds like you're doing better than you expected. Is that fair? ","Jerry Norcia","Yeah, we're doing better than we expected at this point in time in a year. I mean, we have approximately most of our growth locked in that we expected the lock in this year and with the very strong queue behind it. So we expect more good news in P&I as we go forward.","Michael Weinstein","Right, and I had one final question on just the equity share account. Are you guys including the Link conversion, the equity conversion, in this year's guidance for share count and also in the quarterly numbers?","Peter Oleksiak","Yeah, we are including that. My disclosures I gave on the call, which is a 1 to 1.5 to 2.50 this year does not include it. When we disclose the share count it doesn't.","Gerry Anderson","Yeah. So we've got 1 to 1.5 plus, the converts that will come in as equity. And of course, those are all in our EPS forecasts and the five year plan that's been -- we've been forecasting that convert for years now. The 1 to 15 would be over and above that.","Michael Weinstein","Makes sense. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, good morning.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning.","Greg Gordon","When you look at the first quarter results in GS&P and the decline in overall earnings associated with coming back to more normal volumes, I know that the fiscal year guidance was for overall lower overall. But is that sort of in line with your expectations and reflective mainly of the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline coming online and those volumes being diverted to that pipe?","Peter Oleksiak","Greg, this is Peter. First of all last year we indicated that we had a really strong year $62 million first quarter last year, $48 million this year. So that's the $14 million decline from $62 million. We had a [indiscernible] accounting for NEXUS also hit all about platforms, pretty hot. ","So that $14 really million is the combination of the returning from [indiscernible] accounting as well as normal volumes. When you look at the $48 million you annualize that and also you take a look at the growth we have for the year Gerry Anderson was mentioning the Link. ","On the last question we're feeling really comfortable with this year's guidance. And we're not anticipating any other pipelines not coming in service and volumes coming from that. It\u2019s really just contracted growth that we\u2019re already constructing that\u2019s going to help us get to the guidance.","Gerry Anderson","Put another way the first quarter results were right in line with our plan for the year so we\u2019re just fine. ","Greg Gordon","Got you. Yeah, I know you guys didn\u2019t call out earlier the flip from AAPDC so I didn\u2019t recall that. So it\u2019s a combination of the AAPDC and volumes normalizing but still down the fairway of how you had thought it would play out so that\u2026 ","The second question I have, a little off the beaten track, when I look at your IRP, as I recall and I did it review it recently I didn\u2019t see any call out specifically for a significant commitment to battery storage. Can you talk about that and what type of technology or vendor you might decide to partner with? Just reading recently that for instance that Arizona Public Service down in the Southwest has deployed a fairly significant chunk of battery source and recently had a major equipment failure from the large vendor and I was wondering as you look at that landscape how are you thinking about that?","Gerry Anderson","One thing that's unique to Michigan is that we have a massive battery that\u2019s existed in the state for a long time known as the Lamington pump storage facility. So that things we\u2019ve been investing along with consumers, over $800 million in that facility in recent years. And it takes it up over 2,000 megawatts. That\u2019s fourth biggest pump storage facility in the world, a couple in China and one here in the U.S. that are larger. And so we had [indiscernible] actually do some modeling recently on forward needs for storage, as we build out our renewable assets in the state and they just don\u2019t show much of a need because a lot of the short term fluctuations that renewable will introduce in Michigan can be handled by Lamington. ","So what we see for batteries is more niche investments for example at substation stocks, investments on our distribution systems. So we will have some but, for the reasons I just described I think the big dollars will be in the renewable assets themselves versus storage within Michigan.","Greg Gordon","Excellent, I\u2019ve been to that facility. It\u2019s really an impressive site. Thank you, take care.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jonathan Arnold ","Yeah, good morning guys.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","Just coming back to the new cogen acquisition and previously you\u2019d been talking about the plan in that business that would focus on developing new opportunities. I thought is this -- are you still on that track and this was an opportunistic opportunity that came along or is this shift in focus?","Jerry Norcia","I think your assessment is accurate Jonathan. We are focused on developing Greenfields in this space and we have several of those opportunities underway that are addressing [ph] quite well actually. This was an opportunistic acquisition opportunity.","Jonathan Arnold","Do you see others\u2026?","Gerry Anderson","We have for example at Greenfield that I\u2019d say it's an advanced development quite interesting. That would be a new build, would be the next one we\u2019re looking at behind this. So if we see these come along as an acquisition opportunity bolt-on that gets our return and skills we\u2019re happy to do it, but we do continue to develop Greenfield actively as well.","Jonathan Arnold","Great and then just on RNG you said you were finalizing these two last quarter as well. So I'm just curious is that of -- is that something that\u2019s come up that\u2019s making this take longer, is it just the process, what\u2019s the kind of update on getting those over the finish line?","Gerry Anderson","Well the deals are done on those two, really we\u2019re in due diligence phase from a development perspective, make sure that we\u2019re happy with everything that we\u2019re closing in on from an economic perspective. But we feel really good about it we expect them to go forward.","Jonathan Arnold","So is that -- you are just still in due diligence and you were in due diligence couple of months ago, and do you think that any of these will close?","Gerry Anderson","Just to be specific, we were in late development a few months ago. The contractual terms are agreed to now, but you always have -- once who\u2019ve agreed on terms conditions et cetera in a definitive way you always have a period of final due diligence where you make sure the assets you're buying, fit the description and so forth. So they're working way through that, but they're very late in that process. ","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, so since you last updated us, you've gone to terms and moving forward effectively.","Jerry Norcia","Yes, I fully expect we will move forward on these two RNG deals. ","Jonathan Arnold ","Right. I think, that's it. Thank you guys.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Weisel ","Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in at the end of the hour here. First, just a couple questions on wind. For the voluntary renewables program, I just want to be clear would those assets sit in the rate base or outside of it, notwithstanding the dedicated rates that you mentioned. Are rates negotiated or would it be a cost plus with something like a 10% ROI. And going forward given the size of Ford and GM, would most of the growth tend to come from residential and commercial customers or industrial? And does that matter from a rate to margin perspective? ","Gerry Anderson","So the contracts are signed with individual customers and their five year term. We expect them to evergreen, because a lot of these companies have long term commitments they've made. They -- if they, any individual customer didn't renew they do revert into rate base. So they behave a just like a rate based investment. They essentially are utility asset that behaves like rate base.","And in terms of returns, those are negotiated with individual customers to work for us and work for them. I think he can think of them is pretty much rate based assets.","Andrew Weisel ","Okay, so the returns will be comparable to the rate base ROE, right that was in?","Gerry Anderson","Yes.","Andrew Weisel ","Perfect. Okay, great. Then just one last one on midstream. You mentioned that you're expecting that tightness in takeaway capacity for Appalachian Gas and the next day two years. Others might be less confident thinking that there could be sufficient availability for a while, especially if people assume a slower rate of production growth than you do. So just to be clear, would you need to see that market tightness to hit your 2023 operating income targets? Or would that represent upside here to your plan?","Peter Oleksiak","Well, we look to -- I mean NEXUS is running full from a contractual perspective, based on available capacity, what we'd like to see is turning out those revenues and at favorable pricing. So I, we still are pretty confident that we're going to achieve long term contracting on this pipe. And move our short term contracts to long term. The basin is growing. I mean, last year, it grew 18% year-over-year. We are forecasting what we believe a pretty conservative growth profile 5% to 6% going forward. And that's what's built into our five year plans.","Gerry Anderson","The discussions that we're having now with producers are very consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. They're active. And we still do see that tightness coming in the early 2020s. I've been telling investors, this capital discipline that people talk about, I think it's a short term phenomenon in the sense that demand five years from now is what demand five years from now is. ","And the fact that producers are being more disciplined about not getting way out ahead of it and producing a surplus, it makes sense for producers, but it really doesn't affect what the demand is in 2022 or 2023. And all the modeling that we see on fulfilling long term demand continues to see substantial growth out of the Appalachian base broadly. But then as you get into some of the stronger sub markets within the Appalachian basis, they grow beyond the pace of that 5% to 6% that Jerry mentioned. ","So you're well exposed to the right theology, you not only see growth, you'll see more than your fair share.","Andrew Weisel ","All right, thank you very much.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back to our host.","Gerry Anderson","All right. Well, look, I want to thank everybody for joining the call. As I said at the outset, we're off to a really good start to 2019. We're in a strong position to have a year. We've, I think, increased certainty of outcome for 2019. And so we're feeling like we can add 2019 to a decade worth of meeting our forecasts and earnings commitments for you. Look forward to giving you further updates mid-year and beyond, the host of investment opportunities that we\u2019ve laid out for year as well. Thanks again and look forward to talking to you soon.

Then I'll give you a quick energy policy update, and then move on to long-term growth. Then I'll turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to give you a bit more detail on our financials, and then we'll wrap up.","So I'm going to provide the 2015 recap within the context of our system of priorities that's laid out on Slide 5. And those of you who followed us for a number of years know that we consistently work the system of priorities for the last half-dozen years. And for those of you less familiar, I'll just give you a quick grounding and then I'll move on to the summary. But system really starts on Slide 5, with employees, and a belief that it's hard to be an excellent or great company when you've got employees who have mediocre energy. So we put a lot of time and focus on engagement in the energy and focus of our employees. Believing that if we get that right, that we can focus those employees on top-decile customer satisfaction, doing a great job for our customers, on continuous improvement that we focus on intensely, and on growing the company.","And if we do those three things right, if we serve our customers well, manage our costs well, and grow, and connect that growth to the economic development of our communities, then the prospects for constructive political and regulatory treatment are higher. And if you combine constructive regulation with healthy growth, we produce great outcomes for you. And for us, that means consistent predictable 5% to 6% earnings growth, combined with an attractive dividend and dividend growth, founded on a strong balance sheet.","So page six then begins a recap of our accomplishments against that system of priorities this past year. And I'll start with the employees, and say that for the third consecutive year, we earned Gallup -- the Gallup Organization's Great Workplace Award, that's given to a handful of companies worldwide each year, and we're the only utility company to ever receive it. We were, again, in the top 15% of their worldwide database. So that was very encouraging.","We also achieved the best safety result in our company's history; the lowest OSHA rate we've ever had. We're now approaching the safest-in-industry level. And that is our explicit goal. In fact, we had the safest January in our company history by a pretty wide margin recently as well. And then the National Safety Council has us ranked in the top 3% of their 670 participating companies. So we're in the top-20 of their nearly 700 companies.","Moving on to continuous improvement, I was really glad to see our customer outage minutes drop sharply this past year by 65%. That's been a key focus for us. We got some help from the weather, but we also had really strong underlying change in our performance. So that's a good thing.","Our fossil fleet was top-quartile in its reliability for the fourth consecutive year. We're nearing top-decile in our gas leak and leak repair program, also an area we're very focused on. And I think importantly for you, our utility O&M costs were down year-over-year, and we remain below 2008 levels, and near the very front of the industry in terms of O&M cost management.","On the customer front, our Electric Company was top-quartile for both residential and business. In fact, our residential was number two in our peer group. DT Gas ranked number one in 2015 on business customer satisfaction, and number two in residential customer satisfaction. So when you look at the overall set of customer SAT metrics, we had a strong year in 2015.","Moving on to Slide 7, on the political and regulatory front, I'd say we had a constructive outcome on our electric rate case that went final late last year. And we also filed late last year our first gas rate case in four years. We're entering the final stages of discussions on Michigan energy policy, and I'll talk more about that a little bit later. And we have now reached the point where our spent with Michigan suppliers has doubled since we started the program back in 2011, nearly $1 billion spent with Michigan suppliers, up from 475 million, back in 2011. That's an important program for us.","On the growth and value front, we invested $2.4 billion, 2.1 billion of that was in our utilities, focused on infrastructure, and reliability, and continued investment in renewables. And we also had significant investments, as I think you're aware, in our gas storage and pipeline business around our Bluestone assets. And we also made significant progress on both the NEXUS Pipeline and expansions of the Millennium pipeline, so significant capital to support future growth.","Then finally on the financial front, operating EPS at $4.82 that compares to our guidance coming into the year of $4.60 was our eighth consecutive year of delivering EPS at or above the top end of our original guidance. And in addition, we increased our dividend by nearly 6%, to $2.92 a share. So based on that recap of 2015, I hope you can see why I said at the outset that we had a very successful year in 2015, not only financially, but on many other fronts.","And though I know it's natural for you to focus most heavily on our financial results, in the end those financial results are closely tied to fairness and the quality of our regulation. And in turn, the quality of our regulation is contingent on how well we do controlling our costs via continuous improvement, and how well we serve our customers, and how we invest in our communities. And so staying focused on the full spectrum of our priorities is really key to our long-term performance.","Moving on to Slide 8, I'm now going to take a minute to update you on energy policy discussions in Michigan. And those are summarized at high level on Slide 9. As you're well aware, Michigan's been considering updates to its energy laws since last year. And the move to update the current legislation was tied to the need to remake Michigan's power generation fleet. And it focuses, the legislation focuses on reforming its retail open access provisions, defining an integrated resource planning process to choose our future generation mix, and on clarifying the role of renewables and energy efficiency in the future.","So late in 2015, a package of bills moved out of the House Energy Policy Committee. And early this year, the focus has moved to the Senate. Now Senator Mike Nofs, who is chair of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, is now leading the effort to define consensus legislation that will be supported by a strong coalition. And I have to say that Nofs is really well-suited to this role. He was a principal author of our state's 2008 energy legislation. And he is as knowledgeable and experienced as any legislator in the state in this area. So we continue to work closely with Senator Nofs to define and pass this legislation in the first half of the year. And we believe that's achievable.","As I said a minute ago, the goal of this legislation is to enable the transition, depicted on Slide 10, between 2015, and 2030, driven by the aging of our power plants, and the clear power plan, our generation fleet will transition from one dominated by coal-fired generation to one with a much heavier mix of gas and renewables. And we began the detailed planning for this transition as you would expect. In fact, some of our early investments will play out this year. That will add 50 more megawatts of wind to our wind production here in Michigan. And we will invest in our first large scale solar facility, a 50-megawatt installation north to Detroit.","I am sure that you all saw that the Supreme Court yesterday stayed the implementation of Clean Power plan. I must say that that was a surprise to me. It's unusual to stay a regulation prior to litigation in the lower courts. People speculated about the possibility, but I don't know that lot of people considered it likely; so, somewhat of a surprise. We'll have to see how the legal challenge continues to evolve.","A quick reaction was kind of night to sleep on it is to I am not sure much will change for us at least in the first half of the 15-year Clean Power plan implementation period. And that's because we and I think many in the industry are dealing with during that period with a replacement of very old smaller and marginally economical plants, especially given gas prices now. We're dealing with those sorts of plants during that period.","But as you look to the latter half of the plan, as you get out in the later years 2025 to 2030, you do start to take on some of the larger facilities. So if it turned that the Clean Power plan were changed in some way, those years I think could be effective. But that's said, there is a lot of water that needs to flow over the dam before we get to specific about the impacts of the stay. It could range anywhere from the rule being stayed, litigated, some refinements made in the Clean Power plan moves ahead without much change in its impact, few things that are more impactful than that. So we just have to wait and see as it evolves.","Moving on to Slide 11, I am going to turn now to an update on our long-term growth and its drivers. Beginning with a recap of our 2015 results as well as our 2016 guidance and that's laid out on Slide 12. So we finished with strong results in 2015 as you can see at the top left. Our initial guidance for last year was 460. We upped that guidance twice over the course of the year, ultimately to 478 at a fall analyst day. And in the end, we delivered 482. And as I said earlier, that's the eight consecutive year in which we've met or beaten the top end of our guidance.","Though we talk about 5% to 6% earnings per share growth, you can see in the oval at the top right that our actual growth in recent years has been 6.5%. This growth has been driven by our portfolio businesses that have worked well together with steady growth from our two utilities and some growth upside from our non-utility businesses.","For 2016, the midpoint of our guidance as you see it's top right is $4.93. I feel very good about our ability to deliver that result or exceed it. As we always do, we entered 2016 with specific plan to address potential risks or uncertainties in our budget. And though I entered the year worried about Super El Nino weather, January was pretty close to normal. And we are off to a good start on the year. And as I sit here talking to you, it's cold and snowing outside, so February is not matching the worries I entered the year with either to this point.","Moving on to the bottom of the slide, we increased our dividend in 2015 by 5.8%. And I have said consistently that it's our intention to grow dividend as we grow earnings and the oval at the bottom right shows that that's been our pattern in recent years and I expect that pattern to continue in 2016.","I am going to turn now from a focus on 2015 and '16 to a focus on our longer term growth and investments and I'll begin that discussion on Slide 13. So the underpinning of our future growth is the investment profile that you see on this slide and as you can see our investment level over the next five years will be up on the order of 30% versus the last five years. And as I'll describe over the next few minutes, this increased investment is playing out in nearly all of our business units, in our electric and gas utilities to address ageing infrastructure and reliability issues as well as the beginning of our generation fleet renewal, and in our gas storage and pipelines business to capitalize on the opportunity to move Marcellus and Utica gas, which are the highest quality gas reserves in the country, to nearby markets via our Millennium, Bluestone, and NEXUS assets.","Moving to Slide 14; within our electric utility, investing in our distribution assets to address ageing infrastructure and improved reliability has emerged as a key area of focus for us. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, of the 18 billion we project we will invest in our electric utility over the next decade, more than a third, 6.5 billion in our base case, is started at our distribution infrastructure. And frankly, the underlying need is larger than that. And this focus really comes from listening to our customers. So, we're approaching the top end of J.D. Power's Midwest customer satisfaction rankings. The biggest gap between us and the top rank performer is in distribution reliability.","And so moving on to Slide 15, we are making significant investments in distribution infrastructure resilience that improves reliability. And we are doing that replacing ageing infrastructure and addressing our circuits with lowest reliability. We're also seeing the need to re-design our distribution infrastructure to address growth in some of our areas.","Many of our substations are now overloaded and need to be upgraded or replaced. We're moving to do this, for example, in Ann Arbor where growth of both community and the university are overwhelming our infrastructure there. And we are doing the same in downtown Detroit. So we have a new $600 million Red Wings arena and multi-entertainment facility going in and probably over a billion dollars of growth when you take into account everything that's happening around it that is going to require a lot of electric infrastructure.","We've a similar project under to enable a new multibillion dollar bridge between Detroit and Canada that requires a lot of infrastructure investment. So, these are the sort of things that we're undertaking on the distribution front. But as we undertake this investment agenda, we're keeping a very close eye on affordability because our customers are asking for improved reliability and we do need to renew our ageing infrastructure, but we've got to maintain affordability and competitiveness while we do that.","And so the next few slides show that we've done well on that front in recent years as well on the affordability front. So, on Slide 16, you can see that residential bills for both our gas and electric customers are down in recent years. The electric bills are down principally due to continuous improvement work and rate reductions. Even after our more recent rate case finalized in December, our bills are below 2012 levels.","We filed our next electric rate case just a little while ago, week or so ago. But even after that case plays out, bills will be flat to levels five years earlier.","In our gas utility on the right-hand side, bills this year are down materially from levels in 2012, driven most definitely by gas prices. We also have a gas rate case in process that was filed last year. But we projected bills still be 10% lower than 5 years earlier after that case is finalized in December.","With respect to our industrial customers, you can see on Slide 17, that our rates are below both U.S. average and the Great Lakes average. And five years ago, this wasn't the case but we've made good progress in recent years. And pushing to the left on this distribution, our industrial rates have declined 22% since 2013, which had been really important for the competitiveness and economics of this group of customers.","I am going to turn now from -- to utilities to an update on our gas storage and pipelines business. Slide 18 lays out the footprints of this business. And I want to focus on two portions of the footprint today. The Millennium pipeline in Marcellus Shale, which you see on the right-hand side of the slide, along with the adjacent Bluestone assets, this area has been a source of significant growth in recent years and continues to see expansion opportunities, so a lot of focus on that. In addition, I want to focus on the NEXUS Pipeline in yellow on the slide, which is positioned to play a similar role in the Utica Shale in the years ahead.","Moving on to slide 19, I am going to start with an update on the NEXUS Pipeline. And I'll start by saying that as things have emerged, NEXUS is arguably positioned to tap the best gas reserves geology in North America. The dry gas well reserves in the region directly adjacent to our NEXUS Pipeline are staggering. When industry observers ranked Shale plays, this region of the Utica shows up at the very front of the industry cost curve, highly competitive.","And so as the gas industry rationalizes supply across basins, which it needs to do, everything suggests that the Utica will be a winner and that investment will concentrate there. And as a result, we believe very strongly in the fundamentals that support this pipe.","Development of the NEXUS projects continues to move along. So we completed our FERC filing late last year. The pipe is about two-thirds contracted. Significant portion of that volume is with utilities, including the Ontario operations of Spectra and Enbridge. In late last year, the Ontario Energy Board approved their off-take positions. We're also in what I would characterize as advanced discussions with additional counter parties interested in positions on the pipe.","And importantly, we've signed interconnect agreements in Northern Ohio, which is the root of this pipe, totally 1.4 Bcf per day with gas LDCs, power plants and industrials which should provide additional demand for NEXUS over time.","Now we are watching and managing dynamics in the E&P sector closely. But as I said earlier, we really do believe that as the sector rationalizes supply, the region served by this pipe is going to benefit. So bottom line, we and our partner Spectra continue to move this pipe forward. And 2016 will be an important year in its development.","With respect to our Millennium Pipeline, we continue to see strong interest in expansions. So we're pursuing a 200 million cubic per day expansion currently. We filed our FERC pre-approval a couple of weeks ago. And our projected in service is 2018 on that. That expansion is really to access higher prices northeast markets rather than lower priced southern markets.","We are also building a lateral off of Millennium, the 8 mile Valley Lateral which should go into service next year. Additionally, we're seeing interest in expanding Millennium from northeast utilities. That's serious interest. And I believe our discussions with them will lead to additional Millennium expansions down the road.","What all this means for earnings in the gas storage and pipeline business is laid out on slide 20. Last year was a big year for earnings growth in this business. Earnings grew by 30% year-over-year to 107 million in 2015. And that growth was driven by our activities in the Marcellus tied to our Millennium Pipeline and the Bluestone assets.","This year the midpoint of our guidance is 110 million. So we're projecting some growth, but slower growth obviously than last year after the big push up and that's really given the reduced activity level we see by E&P players.","I would say that we're also looking carefully for investment or acquisition opportunities that stress in the E&P and MLP spaces might offer us. Longer term, we do continue to target 170 million in earnings by 2020. And although the current E&P sector dynamics will cause a pause in drilling investment this year, we expect little or no impact long term.","The country needs growing gas supplies. Productions from existing wells declined 15% a year as we can't wait very long before the drilling has to resume and our pipes are in the right locations to benefit and grow if that occurs over the next 5 years. So everybody is watching what happens over the coming months. But as you look out beyond that, this country is going to have to drill a lot of natural gas wells, just fundamental supply and demand says that. And the Marcellus counties that we are in and Utica are the places the drilling dollar should go.","I am going to wrap up my remarks with a few thoughts on our power and industrial business. Then I'll turn things over to Peter.","On Slide 21, our power and industrial business operates contracted assets at 66 sites across the country in three business lines: industrial energy services, renewable energy, and reduced emission fuels or REF for short.","On Slide 22, you see that this business line had earnings of 95 million in 2015. And the midpoint of guidance for this year is also 95 million, so flat from 2015 to 16. Two dynamics underlie this guidance. One of our assets that serve steel industry rolled over its contract last year. You are probably aware the steel industry is in a cyclical downturn right now. So, our earnings from that asset declined. But offsetting that dynamic is the fact that we expect our REF earnings to grow, so 95 million for this year.","And longer term consistent with what we communicated previously, our 2020 earnings target 105 million in this segment as our REF project sunset out in the early 2020, we intend to back drill with investments in co-generation which we are working actively and opportunities on the asset acquisition front.","And with that, Peter, I am going to turn it over to you for our financial update.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Gerry, and good morning everyone. As most of you know, I like to take advantage of having the microphone on this earnings call giving update on my Detroit Tigers. Now with the Super Bowl over, all the focus is going to be on the upcoming baseball season. Speed training will be starting soon. I have high hopes for my hometown team. If the Tigers were ranked by number one by MLD.com for the improved team after all the off season moves; won't be making any predictions this year. Let's just say I am hoping for a playoff run. Enough about the Tigers, like to give you financial update and review of the 2015 earnings before we get to your questions, starting on Slide 24.","And as Gerry mentioned, the DTE Energy operating earnings came in strong at $4.82 per share. For DTE, a detailed breakdown of the EPS by segments including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to Slide 43 of the appendix.","Slide 24 shows year-over-year operating earnings by segment; first going to focus on the middle column which shows 2015 results. Let me start first with the total earnings for the growth segments. Earnings for our growth segments were 848 million or $4.73 per share. This is an increase of 52 million or $0.25 per share over 2014.","Our largest subsidiary DTE Electric earned 562 million. It was up 34 million driven by implementation of new rates and return of a more normal weather in 2015.","I will be going over the DTE Electrics earning results in more detail on the next slide, but let me continue on this page. DTE Gas 2015 earnings of 132 million were 8 million below 2014 earnings as we returned to a more normal weather in 2015 after one of the coldest winters on record in 2014. The weather impact was partially offset by a reinvestment and distribution and transmission assets in 2014. These were not repeated in 2015.","Moving down the page, our gas storage and pipeline segment had a very good year as Gerry Anderson indicated, with operating earnings of 107 million which is 25 million higher than 2014. This is a 30% increase earnings and was driven by higher volumes in Bluestone lateral and gathering assets.","Earnings for power and industrial projects were 95 million, are up 5 million from 2014. This increase is driven by strong performance in our renewable business and REF, partially offset by lower earnings in steel. Earnings for corporate and other was negative 48 million in 2015 or 4 million lower than 2014, driven by higher interest expense. So as I mentioned, total operating earnings for growth segments were 848 million or $4.73 per share, which is up 5.6% over the 2014 total growth segment EPS.","To round out our operating earnings, we conclude results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading 2015 earnings were 50 million, which were down 50 million for 2014 driven by a lower realized performance on a gas portfolio. Actually our trading company had a great year economically. The contribution for 2015 was 54 million, which is double our targeted annual level of 20 to 25 million.","As a reminder, slide 42 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation showing both economic and accounting performance.","Let's turn to page to slide 25 and as indicated I want to give a little more detail on our electric utility performance. DTE Electric's 2015 earnings were 562 million, which was 34 million then higher than 2014. There were three significant drivers of this variance. First, the return to more normal weather in 2015, if you recall the summer of 2014 was much colder than normal, while this summer was near normal. Second, the new rate implementation midyear to support the capital spent to improve distribution and generation infrastructure. These rates were subsequently approved by the MPSC in December. The rate implementation is partially offset by the cost associated with these investments such as the depreciation property taxes and interest.","And finally, we experienced lower storm activity in 2015. This is a significant decrease when compared to 2014, we saw multiple storms, including a storm in September in '14 that impacted over 400,000 customers, which represent about 20% of our electric customers. This lower summer expense was partially offset by 2014 lean initiatives, which were not repeated in 2015. Although not as large of a variance, I did want to touch on year-over-year the sales volume effect was just down 6 million. We have provided on page 41 of the appendix more details on the sale volumes by customer class. But let me first start by saying that the underlying economic indicators were our service territory in Michigan are solid.","Customer accounts have increased, in total, in our residential and our commercial customer classes. And this reduction of year-over-year sales was driven by lower volumes in our industrial segment, due mainly to the weakness in the steel market. This impact was partially offset, vindicated by an uptick in commercial sales. And residential are relatively flat, driven by economic and customer growth, but offset by increased energy efficiency. And we continue to see the benefits of our energy efficiency program to help our customers reduce usage, and help keep their average bills affordable.","Now I'd like to review 2016 earnings on Slide 26. As Gerry mentioned upfront, our guidance range for 2016 is $4.80 per share to $5.05 per share, providing a mid-point of $4.93 per share. Total earnings per share guidance is unchanged from our early outlook introduced at our investor day in September of 2015. Earnings ranges for each segment have been refined, and our equity issuance target is now reduced to 100 million, providing lower total share outstanding. Compared to 2016 to 2015 actuals, utility earnings are higher due to increased rate supporting our customer-related investments; continue to strengthen our pipeline and gather platforms, drive the increase in the gas storage and pipelines, including a full year contribution of the gathering bill that took place in 2015.","Our P&I earnings into 2016 remain strong, as the increased REF earnings help offset the near-term reduction related to our steel industry assets. Overall, earnings per share for our gross segments are expected to increase from $4.73, in 2015, to $4.93 a share, giving us a year-over-year growth of 4.2%, but when you look back to the initial guidance of '15 to initial guidance of 2016, the growth is 7%.","Moving on to Slide 27, I'd like to touch base on how bonus depreciation extension has impacted our plan. We expect the extension to provide $300 million to $400 million of favorable cash flow over the five-year period. But based on the change, as well as other adjustments to our plan, we are now targeting a range of 200 million to 300 million of equity issuance for the 2016 to 2018 period, compared to our previous disclosure of 800 million that you can see on the chart. As I mentioned on our guidance page, we expect to issue about 100 million of this in 2016.","We mentioned times in the past that maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority for us. If you turn to Slide 28, you can see key balance sheet metrics on which we target, and that we also monitor FFO to debt leverage. And this slide shows that the projected level for each metric. And as you can see, we are in the targeted range for the next three years. 2015, we issued a modest amount of equity, actually needing less than 10% of our capital expenditures to be financed with new equity. The strength of our balance sheet sets us up nicely as we enter a period of historical high capital spend.","Now let me wrap it up, on Slide 30, and then we can move to the Q&A with the summary. 2015 was a very good year. And we are well-positioned to have a successful 2016. DTE has historically delivered on its growth targets, and actually have exceeded our growth targets over the recent history. We provided 6.5% annual EPS growth over the last five years. As we look forward, we continue to target operating EPS growth of 5% to 6% for our growth segments. And then part of our shareholder value equation is to continue to grow our dividends in line with these earnings.","We have meaningful investments in our non-utilities, that which will drive continued growth in those segments. And we have significant utility investments in reliability and generation modernization that affordable, clean, and reliable service to our customers. The constructive regulatory environment we have in Michigan, coupled with our focus on operational excellence in delivering high customer satisfaction, provides a good foundation as we move into an era of replacing and upgrading our aging utility infrastructure.","So before I actually turn the call over for questions, I'd like to recognize Anastasia Minor. This is Anastasia Minor's last call, so a little shutout to Anastasia. I know been easy to receive the email blast yesterday on announcement so I'm sure I'll hear from you when I'm on the road. But I'd like to say that we're leaving it -- and actually Anastasia is not leaving the company, she's a key member of our management team, and moving into a different role. But we're leaving the job in the good hands. Barb Tuckfield is moving into the role, coming off fresh from her gas utility controller assignment.","So with that I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So, Shavan [ph], we can open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Oleksiak. [Operator Instructions] And we will now take our first question from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers","Hi, good morning guys. Gerry, I think a lot of the legislation discussion has been in part addressing the energy policy but in part kind of trying to get ahead of the CPP a little bit. With the legislation having taken a lot longer than anybody would have expected, do you see this as a reason or a cause for legislation to slow down again or a reevaluation of kind of some of these priorities would seem to be focused on addressing CPP issues?","Gerry Anderson","I don't think Mike Nofs will see any reason to slow down. I think he understands that we've got a lot to take care of on the energy front over the next 10 to 15 years, and that things come and go in terms of regulation, legislation, and policy.","As I said, I'm not here to speak for consumers, but they've got a bunch of plans retiring in the near-term. We do also. We've been pretty visible with the older plants that are going to be coming offline. So both companies and the state will need to backfill those with investments, and this legislation is -- really recognizes that we're headed into that period. So I -- there may be people who really don't like the Clean Power plan, who say, slow down, stop, but Mike Nofs won't be one of them, nor will we.","Dan Eggers","Okay. And I guess just on the NEXUS front, with two-thirds contracted at this point in time, what is your feeling for when you guys might fill in more of that to get to a fully comfortable position on the pipe? And can you just remind us how much of that is maybe percentage-wise covered by utilities rather than producers?","Gerry Anderson","About half of that is utilities, and half is producers, and so I'd say a couple of things. And then I'll have Jerry Norcia, who's here, and President of the Group to add his thoughts to mine. But I mentioned during my comments that we have very active discussions with other parties interested in the pipe. So we're hopeful that those will play out this year.","The other thing I'd say is, we and Spectra, both continue to evaluate this pipe and the fundamentals of it are just so strong. When you look at the fact that it's arguably runs into the very best dry gas region in North America, and then connects that to the largest storage of -- market storage hub in the Midwest-Northeast, and supplies into Ontario, Michigan, and the Chicago markets via the pipeline networks, that, we really are strong believers in the fundaments.","To get back to the original question, we would think that we'll bring additional demand on this year from some of the discussions we have underway. And then that 1.4 Bcf of interconnection across Northern Ohio, we think will add demand over time beyond that. Jerry, any thoughts you'd add in addition to this?","Jerry Norcia","Gerry, you said it extremely well. So, again, I just, really to summarize. A pipeline with great market access to Ontario, Michigan, and really supported by LDCs. And I think that really distinguishes this pipe from other pipes. I mean, I think you're seeing that other pipes are somewhat struggling with routing issues out of this basin, as well as market issues. And I think the fact that we've got a strong LDC base distinguished this pipe when we first proposed it, and now it's even a greater distinguishing factor. So we're still very supportive moving forward. Everything is on schedule from a FERC perspective.","The feedback we're getting from FERC is that we've submitted a high quality product. We've got a great partner in Spectra, who is very experienced in executing these type of projects. So we're feeling really good about where we're at right now with our market, as well as our supply.","Dan Eggers","Got it, very good. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question now from Neel Mitra from Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra","Hi, good morning.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning, Neel.","Neel Mitra","I had a follow-up question on NEXUS. It seems like on the demand side it's really strong. How are you -- generally, how are you viewing the discussions with the producers right now on the upstream side? Obviously a lot of guys are feeling pain. Is there any discussion on delaying on the pipe or do you feel strongly from that perspective?","Gerry Anderson","You know, that's a really good question. And sometimes when you're in some of these developments, and there's stress in the sector, you have people approaching you, trying to restructure or retime things. And we are just not getting that. And I think it's because of the quality of the assets in the region. So we continue to get strong support, and no waiver from the participants in the projects, either producer, and obviously not utility. That answer the question?","Neel Mitra","Yes, that's great. Thank you. And then on the power and industrial segment, in your analyst day you brought up the steel customer. Could you just talk about the general appetite from industrial customers, given that there's some concern over an industrial recession coming up, and specifically how that relates to you, and in your conversations?","Gerry Anderson","So the projects in that industrial portfolio are contracted, but they do roll over. So I think our average duration is seven years or so. But that means every seven years some of your assets, on average, are going to roll. But in between they don't have volume or commodity price sensitivity. So we're not worried about the balance of the portfolio. This one was a coke battery, it rolled at a time when pricing was down, and so we had to roll with the market when we re-contracted. And so that took some earnings out of that segment. But we had growth elsewhere, and we're able to -- the segment is not growing this year, but we're able to hold performance. So those are the dynamics. We don't have any other important contracts that have exposure to industrial weakness here.","Neel Mitra","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Gerry Anderson","Welcome.","Operator","And our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Thank you.","Gerry Anderson","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, perhaps to follow-up on the legislative question, I just wanted to make sure I am hearing you right. Are you feeling comfortable about the outlook for earnings growth sort of even if the legislation is delayed beyond this year or if it just simply doesn't happen? I just wanted to get a sense of the puts and takes in your budget and your comfort within it. Obviously you work with a certain amount of, quote, whitespace. How are you feeling about it?","Gerry Anderson","I guess I would say, I don't think implementation of the legislation, if you were to try to draw a direct link between that an earnings, there really isn't one. The legislation was targeted at two things, one is, if we're going to remake our generation infrastructure we should have a good planning process for doing that. So the legislation focuses on an IRP process. And having a process where variety parties can get their oar in the water, to talk about what the mix of generation should be. And I still think we need to do that.","The second what was really focused on, fairness, which was around retail open access. If we're going to be investing in generation, everybody should participate economically in those investments. So that's a fairness question. But if you try to move from those two things, a good planning process and fairness, to our earnings, there really isn't a link between the two. We think the legislation is important to have a really well-defined and fair process for moving forward. But we're going to move on with the distribution investments, and the power plant retirements, and so forth either way. We really have to. Some of these power plants are just old.","I'll give you an example. We got one I can see from where we're doing the call here that just had a major component failure. That unit is not going to run. And we think it's highly likely. And the reason is it's just old enough and marginal enough that we've got to move on. And so we've got numerous assets in that sort of position, where we really are evaluating just how much longer it makes sense to invest versus move on. And some of the plants that are from the '50s and '60s, it's time to move on. So what I said earlier, that I don't see the early years of the clear power plant, maybe the first half of it being affected much, that's why.","Now when you move out into the later years, closer to 2027, 2030, then you start to get into some of our larger, somewhat newer assets. They could be affected. But I'll tell you, there's a lot to happen between now and then. So there's continued action on NOx, and mercury, and other fronts, water, that will be thrown into the mix in terms of how we evaluate those plants and their life. So I think it's really early to talk too much about what this stay might mean for our -- both our earnings, and really for the Clean Power plan, because it's very possible that they'll send it down to have a couple of specific issues reconsidered or reconfigured. The EPA will address those, and then things move on. Or it could be more fundamental than that. And we really don't know right now. So hopefully I gave you some help in the way we're thinking about it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just to follow-up on the whitespace question, I'd be curious, in the slide deck, it seems as if you haven't included the whitespace CapEx again. Is there anything to read between the lines on that? How are you feeling about, particularly the midstream side of the equation, when it comes to the ability to execute to the upside here? Is there something we should be reading from the slides here?","Gerry Anderson","You're talking specifically GSP or were you talking in the utilities?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Well, I was thinking -- well, I mean, you tell me on the white space, either way with the Michigan legislation and\/or what's going on in midstream, if that has kind of come in on you. But I suppose the question was more specific to the midstream side. And I'm thinking more on the gathering potentially, but more broadly, either ability still to execute on the upside case.","Gerry Anderson","[Technical difficulty] I'll address both. So I think we previously have talked, and I mentioned earlier that it, particularly in the distribution side of the electric utility, there's a lot of demand for investment there. So we've got the 6.5 billion in our base plan. I said that if you look at the fundamentals of the aging of that infrastructure, and the reliability needs, the constraining factor is not how much demand there is for investment. There's a lot of investment needed. So we're really metering that tide to customer affordability. And that has not changed since we talked about it at the analyst day in the fall, it's very much the same picture.","On the mid stream side nothing has changed in terms of -- if you look out over the five-year period, what we think is going to happen in the Marcellus and Utica regions, and the amount of activity there. I mentioned, the gas sector is very, very different from the power sector. Put gas wells in the ground, and a year later the average decline is 15%. So you've just got to continually drill in order to meet the growing demand for natural gas. And in doing that, I think one of the message we've seen out of the stress in the E&P sector, is that it needs to rationalize, and people are going to rationalize it to the very best drilling locations.","And I'm not blowing smoke when I say that the Susquehanna County, and the Marcellus, and the area of the Utica that NEXUS serves are the very best dry gas geology in the country. And so through simple common sense you come back to say and that these are going to be very high activity areas over the next five years. And so our continued sense that NEXUS is a good project, and that there'll be more development and expansion of Millennium are tied to those factors.","Now in the very near-term, this year, does the E&P sector need to work some things out, obviously. We're watching that closely, we're managing it. But I think long-term fundamentals you get down the road the number of years, this will be in the rearview mirror.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","All right, great. Well, thank you very much.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.","Gerry Anderson","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning.","Greg Gordon","So, it looks to me like you guys just tried to sort of evolve your slide deck a little bit, but one of the other -- and I apologize if you've answered this already -- Slide 14, you no longer have the upside case of -- for potential spend in the utilities. I'm not assuming that you're signaling that that's off the table? You just kind of modified your slide a little bit? Is that fair?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, that -- and now I guess the last question is this, there was no change in plan or need. We've just got the base case shown here. But I think it was in the analyst day, we showed that if you talk about what's in our plan, at 6.5, you talk about what we look at as fundamental demand for renewed infrastructure, it's more like 10.5. And how we walk between those two really has to do with demands of customers for reliability versus affordability. And what we've got in the base plan, the 6.5, we think is a good walk between the two. The makes sense or answers the question, I think it gets at where you were asking.","Greg Gordon","Yes, 100%. Second question, you've always talked about your internal planning is for sort of 7% to 8% overall operating earnings growth. And then after share issuance and contingency, you seek to be in or at the high-end or above your 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. Your share issuance number, now over the next several years, is obviously going to be a lower number because of bonus appreciation. But should we assume that if you were to theoretically update that slide, the operating earnings growth rate would be slightly lower, but the share issuance would be slightly lower and you'd be in the same place -- to get the bonus?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, Peter, you might want to just take the topic of bonus, and the way it impacts us as a company. Because it's a little different from the way it may impact some other companies. I'll let Peter answer that, and see if it gets at your question. If it doesn't we'll pick it up from there.","Peter Oleksiak","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","Let me first -- I'll first start with the bonus. And of course, I was happy to see a five-year plan. Every year we went in guessing what would happen with bonus the following year. So I was actually happy to see that. And we have looked at it and we're going to be maximizing the bonus benefits, great for customers in terms of affordability and for us as a great cash benefit. And we're in an equity-issuance mode. So actually the EPS impact is minimal on a go-forward basis. So we are down from the 800 million, to 200 million to 300 million of equity issuance. So that's how we're thinking about bonus.","Also, if you compare us to other companies, we are less than others. We're already in an AMT position, and we have tax credit, some tax planning that puts us there. So our 20%, versus 35% rate gives us a little of a lower-end benefit. And also from a tax planning, we are in a position of tax NOL so the near-term benefit is also pushed out because of that.","Gerry Anderson","That answer it?","Greg Gordon","Got you. Yes, yes. So if I were to summarize, if you were -- if I go to page 12 of your December business update, you give a bar that says we aspire to grow operating earnings 7% to 8%, and then after share issuance and contingency, we're at 5% to 6%. Theoretically, 7% to 8% is slightly lower, but the share issuance is also lower. And you -- net-net, you're still in that 5% to 6% range. Is that fair?","Peter Oleksiak","That's a fair way, and if you look at the remix of the guidance from the early outlook, we did temper down the electric segment a bit because of the rate case. And the ROE, we did temper down a little bit as we refined the impact of the contracts in the power industrial segment. So that was offset by the reduced share issuance to hold us at the mid-point of the early outlook.","Gerry Anderson","And then I think more broadly your take is right, that given our combination of our tax position and equity issuance, when your bonus does affect growth in the utility some because it's effectively zero return cost to capital. But it's very minimal impact on EPS, given the dilution offset we have. So it doesn't turn out for us to be a material factor.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thanks, guys.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Hi, good morning guys.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Gerry, one comment you made was that you see opportunities in the face of market dislocation in the pipeline space. Can you be a little more specific about what kinds of things you might be alluding to? How significant they could potentially be? And how close you are -- we are, you think, to a point where something might actually materialize? And how do you manage the sort of quality bias in the portfolio through something like that?","Gerry Anderson","Couple of comments, so we -- you've been watching the sector and there are obviously company stress. Now companies tend to first hold on and then try to push out assets that they really don't want. They really don't want them. We don't either, generally speaking. We've had some people approach us with assets of interest. I wouldn't say we're close on those. But I think we got to watch across the balance of the year as companies continue to deal with pressures. And I think there will be asset sales that result from that. Our cost to capital is much better positioned than it was year ago to look at those.","So, we don't have anything built into our plan right now tied to this. We're simply signaling that the environment is pretty different than it was a year ago. We think that there are going to be assets to change hands and we're open to that if the right one comes along. That said, we're not going to do things that aren't strategic or that we don't feel good about. No sense buying things that really don't have much upside or strategic value to you. So, we are going to wait through it and we will see what comes.","Jonathan Arnold","Could you talk a little more about what you would see as being particularly strategically interesting? Is it more pipe? Is it storage? Is it\u2026?","Gerry Anderson","It would be pipe and potentially gathering. But I would let Jerry Norcia to comment on that as president of the union.","Jerry Norica","Yes, so we have got a handful of conversations underway what we are looking at I would say primarily assets that are tied to gathering and transmission to main lines. I think as we see producers on under a lot of stress, they are looking to monetize assets. And I think as Gerry said, we are being very selective. Some of the first opportunities that we've seen are perhaps not as strategic as we would like. But like I said, we continue with a handful of conversations that we're hopeful would yield some value for us here.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. Thank you. Just on one other -- on another topic, we were slightly surprised that you filed your electric case so soon after the last one. We thought you were kind of trying to leave a little bit more time. But any comments about what drove the timing there? Something we should -- some context we could put around it?","Gerry Anderson","Well, I think a couple of things, one it has been a very long time since our prior rate case. So there was a lot that we were addressing in the rate case directly proceeding. And that if you simply look at the pace of capital expenditure last year and projected this year and the forward test year, it's a significant spend that we have underway and we need a rate case to deal with that.","So I think historically, we've tried to spread our rate cases out and have been pretty successful in doing that. Our prior case had been four years since the proceeding case. That won't be the case in the future given where things stand. We are investing in both distribution and generation at a healthy enough pace that we're going to need to be in a year, year and half.","Peter Oleksiak","I think just to add on that to give you a perspective, the case we just filed is a billion dollar rate based increase in the final order we just received. This gives you the sense of pace of capital spend that we have over and above depreciation.","Jonathan Arnold","So that comment you just made every year to 18 months is kind of the new expectation?","Gerry Anderson","Yes, I think it is.","Peter Oleksiak","Yes, probably in every calendar year at some point in the year we will be filing.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","And out next question is from Mr. Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Ridzon","Did you talk about the earnings impact of bonus depreciation?","Gerry Anderson","We did. As generally said, that given the share issuance effect the combination of two makes it a very modest impact for us. So, it's not a significant player in our plan. We are -- pulls our share issuance is down fundamentally; does have some impact in utility earnings, but the two heavily offset each other.","Paul Ridzon","Did you -- can you quantify the impact before the dilution offset?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. We did revise down our electric segment a bit. Just to reiterate what Gerry said there was minimal impact. I will say it's relatively small in terms of the earnings growth. But there is a bit of -- the utility growth has taken off just because of the bonus depreciation being used versus equity. But there is an offset corporately on the earnings per share. It's pretty minimal.","Paul Ridzon","That lower utility earnings is all bonus depreciation?","Peter Oleksiak","There is bonus depreciation. And for the electric segment, there was a fine tuning of the ROE that came up [technical difficulty].","Paul Ridzon","Okay. Can you -- I was surprised to see gas segment earnings up in the fourth quarter. Can you give a little more finer detail around what drove that?","Peter Oleksiak","Which gas segment are you talking? Utility or\u2026","Paul Ridzon","I am sorry. DTE Gas, the LDC.","Gerry Anderson","Yes. The combination of that we knew going into the fourth quarter that some of the weather impact. So we did go in a bit of a lean mode in that fourth quarter so that helped the earnings out and there was also some timing taxes that played up in between years.","Paul Ridzon","But we did not have new rates, is that correct?","Gerry Anderson","That's correct. And the other as I mentioned in my speaker notes 2014 we had a really strong weather year, so we had a reinvestment plan. Lot of it took place in the fourth quarter of 2014. So you are seeing investment that occurred in 2014. And then a lean that offset, went the other way in 2015.","Peter Oleksiak","So put differently we started talking about El Nino in July. And we knew it was a distinct possibility. So, we had plans lined up for our gas utility that if it reared its head, we would implement lean late in the fourth quarter, and we did. And it turned out -- we are glad we did. It turned out to be an incredibly warm December. We had the opposite, the flip a year before, coming off that really cold winter we invested ahead. But we invested ahead in 2014 to enable something like we ran into in 2015. And that's kind of the way we do things that we invest in stronger years to give you the flexibility to do the opposite in years when you need to. And you can do that without affecting the quality of your assets as long as you keep that even handed.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you. And then lastly, at gas storage and pipes, as you look at your counterparties or potential counterparties, are there any parties out there that are causing you a little bit of credit concern?","Peter Oleksiak","Well, I think if you look at the whole sector, there's quite a few that share prices have come down fundamentally and are sub investment grade. So, we're watching those. But as I said earlier, we don't -- so they are sub investment grade, but we aren't picking up in our counterparties kind of the scramble to rework timing or rework commitments.","In fact on one of our pipe positions, we had credit requirements that caused them post collateral and they went ahead and did it because the position is important to them and they want to continue on. So we would be selling that to be watching our counterparties carefully. But we haven't seen any yet that have tilted into the mode where we think there's something near term.","Paul Ridzon","Okay, thank you very much.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning everybody.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Just one quick one here, as I look at the past few years of EPS growth versus DPS growth, your earnings have been growing by about almost 100 basis points faster. Obviously, that's going to be putting downward pressure on the payout ratio. Any thoughts on potentially increasing the growth rate going forward? Obviously, you are still planning 5% to 6% earnings growth, as you talked about, but in order to catch up the payout ratio, any thoughts on maybe accelerating the dividend growth?","Gerry Anderson","We have been working the payout ratio. So we have a stated payout ratio. And what we've generally done is push it up into the middle of the payout range and it falls back to the front-end. Then we push it back up to the middle. So, that pattern is probably what you can expect in the future. You're right. We have grown earnings a bit faster than we have dividend. So, we'll keep an eye on what you suggested.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Thank you. That's all I had.","Gerry Anderson","Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks.","Operator","And our final question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Gerry Anderson","Good morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Just very quickly, I think you've answered all of my -- most of my questions, but -- so, basically if I'm to understand it, there's -- you see turmoil. You are monitoring it in the E&P and other energy sector or commodity sectors. But you really see no potential or significant potential at least in the near-term of anybody not being able to meet their commitments as a counterparty or as a partner or anything like that, correct?","Gerry Anderson","Right, we don't see any evidence of that. And we have the chance to deal with counterparties across a lot of fronts including our utility. So generally you know when somebody is in that position, they start to dance on commitment and we are just not seeing that.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. And then just finally on the legislation, how should we think about the delays and stuff? I mean what are the sticking points, if there are any? Is there any particular issue that seems to be sort of holding it up or causing more of a problem in terms of sort of nailing it down?","Gerry Anderson","Well, I think there was - there were -- predictably there are some parties down the retail open access side who would prefer to thing simply stay the way they are. So, there was some noise about that. I think the key to that and we are putting together I mentioned the coalition. Senator Knox is working on a coalition. I think the key is to get a business coalition that comes together and says actually these are right things to do. It's the right future direction for the state and it's fair. And I think we'll be able to put that business coalition together.","So, you can probably imagine who it was saying that retail open access is fine just the way it is. It was some alternative providers and a few people that they were backing. But I do think we will be able to deal with that issue. Beyond that, there are - I would say there is some back and forth on exactly what they IRP process should look like, but I don't think that will be a holdup.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Gerry Anderson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","As there are no further questions in the queue I would like to turn the call back to our speakers and presenters today for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.","Gerry Anderson","Well, we don't really have any additional information for you. I would just say that we appreciate you being with us this morning and your support, and look forward to any follow-up questions that you have. Thanks very much for joining us. We look forward to a good 2016.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference call. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Meador. You may begin.","David E. Meador","Great. Thank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements.","Turning to Slide 3. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President of Finance; Dan Brudzynski, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Anastasia Minor, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me, if needed, during the Q&A session.","Now moving on to Slide 4. As you know, we'll be providing a full business update and outlook at our Analyst Meeting in New York next week on May 1, it's just a couple of days away. We have several hours scheduled with you with what we believe is very interesting material to take you through.","So this morning, if we can, I'd like to keep the call focused on the quarter. But as always, I'd be happy to take any of your questions.","Now turning to Slide 5. This is our investment thesis, and it describes how we will provide value to our shareholders. We believe that our disciplined growth plans will provide a 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth along with an attractive dividend yield. A key enabler into this plan is maintaining a strong balance sheet, which allows us to manage our risk and excess capital under favorable terms.","Growth plans at both utilities are robust, and we will lay this out for you next week in more detail. DTE Electric's growth is largely driven by operational investments, mandated environmental controls and renewable energy needed to meet Michigan's 10% RPS standard.","At DTE Gas, the growth was driven by infrastructure investments in cast iron main replacement and relocation in meters out of customers' homes. These important infrastructure investments were the subject of the Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism order that was issued by the Michigan Public Service Commission on April 16, and I'll cover that on an upcoming slide.","The 2008 energy legislation and regulatory structure in Michigan provides a constructive environment for us to work within. However, as you know, we don't take this for granted and it's incumbent upon us during this favorable construct every day. We continue to focus on our system of priorities including highly-engaged employees, distinctive continuous improvement capabilities and top docile [ph] customer satisfaction, and that's another area that we're going to spend a fair amount of time on next week.","In our non-utility businesses provide us with low-risk and diversified growth opportunities to complement our regulated utilities.","Now turning to Slide 6, an overview of the first quarter. I'm pleased to announce earnings of $1.34 per share versus $0.91 in the first quarter of 2012, a substantial amount of that increase year-over-year is related to weather and we'll be talking about that as we go through this. But it's a nice start to the year, especially after thinking about last year first quarter and the start we had last year, given the extreme weather conditions last year.","In the first quarter of 2012, we talked about that and the impact on the entire company, but especially on the DTE Gas segment earnings last year. This year, we had near-normal temperatures. Actually, it was slightly below normal and that explains a significant portion of year-over-year change. But it shouldn't be lost that we also have continued to focus on continuous improvement and making structural changes needed to stay out of rate cases and also to reach our aspiration of being the best-operated energy company in North America.","A couple of the quarter-over-quarter drivers I'd like to point out is, first of all, our continuous improvement efforts have led to reduced benefit expenses and also efficiencies in our gas distribution system; and the rate case settlement at DTE Gas also provided some year-over-year improvements and earnings.","And finally, our P&I segment benefited from the acquisition of a portfolio of on-site energy projects late last year, as well as higher earnings from the reduced emission fuel projects. The balance sheet remains strong, and we generated approximately $600 million in cash from operations in the first quarter. This, along with credit upgrades for Moody's and Fitch that we talked about in our last call, put us on track to meet our balance sheet goals for 2013. And we'll provide a full outlook for the year at the Analyst Meeting next week.","Now turning to Slide 7. Last week, the Public Service Commission approved our proposed Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism for DTE Gas. This mechanism covers a 5-year period beginning in 2013 with the total projected investment of $400 million over that period, or about $77 million annually. This mechanism streamlines the recovery of these costs through the surcharge, which will be reconciled each year to reflect actual spending, and that surcharge will remain in place until the next rate case.","With that overview, I'll now turn it over to Peter, who will take you through the quarter in a little bit more detail.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 9 in the first quarter earnings results.","For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings are $1.34, consistent with reported earnings. For the 2 utilities, DTE Electric contributed $0.66 and DTE Gas came in at $0.55. The non-utility segments combined to earn $0.21. The drivers for the non-utility first quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipelines at $0.10, Power & Industrial Projects at $0.07 and Energy Trading at $0.04. Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.08 for the quarter.","Let's move to Slide 10 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are up $78 million for the quarter. For both our utilities, DTE Electric and DTE Gas, colder weather in 2013 and lower benefit expense contributed to favorable earnings from 2012.","DTE Electric contributed $19 million more year-over-year. More than half of this was weather improvement. Typically, you don't see such a large weather improvement for our electric business in a non-summer quarter. But last year, we had, as Dave mentioned, one of the warmest winters on record.","DTE Gas had an increase of $44 million for the quarter, and given the size of the increase, I'll cover more details on DTE Gas in a moment. Our non-utility segments operating earnings are totaled up to $13 million, improvement driven primarily by the higher earnings at our Power & Industrial Projects and Energy Trading segments.  Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings are flat from prior year due to growth and transportation revenues across all of our pipeline platforms, offsetting lower storage earnings for the quarter. Our Power & Industrial Projects segment is up $4 million from 2012. This increase is driven by earnings related to our on-site energy projects occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012, growth in renewable earnings related to our coal and wood waste plants coming online, and increased reduced emission fuel earnings. At Energy Trading, improved market opportunities contributed to the 2013 increase from last year and the quarter's performance is in line with our expectations. Page 21 of the appendix contains our standard energy trading page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.","Finally, our Corporate & Other segment came in favorable by $2 million from last year, primarily to lower interest expense.","Now let's turn to Page 11 and walk through some of the quarterly details for our gas business. The operating earnings for DTE Gas are $96 million, up $44 million from the prior year. The largest driver for this quarter's improvement is the record weather we had in 2012 not returning in 2013. The quarterly weather improvement at $26 million actually can be broken into 2 pieces, the 2012 warmer-than-normal weather is actually -- was $23 million unfavorable last year, an improvement for this year. And then the weather this year was slightly colder than normal and contributed $3 million of earnings.","The rate case settlement we received in the fourth quarter of 2012 drives an additional $7 million of margin improvement for the first quarter this year. Continuous improvement efforts on our gas distribution system helped drive lower cost gas for the quarter by $6 million.","And lastly, changes in our benefit plans drive the additional $5 million of earnings improvement over last year. That concludes an update on our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to turn the discussion over to Dan Brudzynski, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures.","Daniel G. Brudzynski","Thanks, Peter, and good morning. Now moving on to Slide 13 and the first quarter cash flow results. As Dave mentioned, cash flow remains strong in 2013. Favorable weather impacts, primarily in DTE Gas, were offset by the timing of planned pension contributions in 2013. Cash is comparable in the first quarter to 2012 and is tracking in line with our guidance for the year. Capital spending is roughly the same as 2012, and I'll cover those details on the next slide. In the financing arena, we successfully financed $375 million of long-term bonds at our electric utility in the first quarter of 2013.","Now moving on to Slide 14 and some detail on capital spending. 2013 investments were relatively flat overall. We had lower investments at DTE Electric driven by a refueling outage in 2012, were partially offset by higher gas investments for main renewal and Advanced Metering Infrastructure or AMI, and the Bluestone lateral and gathering capital spending in 2013.","And then finishing up finally on Slide 15 and a look at the balance sheet. As we continue to grow, a strong balance sheet is a key priority to us at DTE and our metrics remain within their targeted ranges. Our financing plan is on track for 2013 with $100 million of equity already issued in the first quarter and the bond financing I mentioned earlier. Our liquidity is sufficient with the successful extension of our facility to 2018.","And with that, now I'll turn it back over to Dave for the wrap-up.","David E. Meador","Thanks, Dan. And I'll wrap up on Slide 17. As we laid out for you, we had a strong first quarter with substantial year-over-year earnings improvements. And as I said earlier, I was thinking about last year when we started out in the first quarter and we're quite deep in the hole because of the extreme weather last year, so it's a great way to start 2013.","The approval of the Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism for DTE Gas as we've outlined is a key component of, not only making the necessary improvements in that business to improve the distribution system, but it gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of staying out of rate cases in the gas business.","Going forward, the combination of operational and mandated utility investments and then also the investments in the low-risk, non-utility growth opportunities combined are expected to provide us a 5% to 6% earnings per share growth. As we mentioned next Wednesday, we're going to be going into much more detail regarding our system of priorities and our growth prospects at the Analyst Meeting. The meeting is at 8:30, breakfast at 7:30, if you would like to join us at the New York Sheraton Times Square. And if you're not attending in person, you're welcome to listen to the webcast, and that webcast will also be archived. And you can find the link to all of that on our Investor Relations website.","And with that, we'd be happy to open up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Cole with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess Slide 7 is helpful, but I guess if I -- given your comments, given that this is a 5-year tracker, are you expecting that you're going to stay out from filing DTE Gas rate case for the 5-year period while earning your allowed return?","David E. Meador","We will go into multiple year plans next week in more detail. But as you know, one of our north stars has turned our authorized return year in, year out. We're also very focused, as you know, also on cost and customer build. So our goal is to stay out of rate cases as long as possible, while meeting all our objectives, and we've laid that out for the electric business. And now the -- with this tracker, it will allow us to stay out of rate cases for multiple years. So we're evaluating that and certainly we'll talk in more detail next week. But this is going to give us a period of stability, which is joining the electric business. And I'm anticipating we will not be in rate cases for several years at least.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess bring it back to the quarter. I guess with, just for DTE Gas. So with 1Q coming in at $96 million versus full year guidance of $113 million to $118 million, is [indiscernible] flat?","David E. Meador","We lost the last part of your question.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm sorry, I'll speak up. So with 1Q DTE Gas operating earnings coming in at $96 million versus full year guidance at $113 million to $118 million, that seems to imply that the fourth quarter would be similar around $17 million to $22 million, but DTE Gas normally earns, or at least should earn between $50 million and $60 million. And so for the rest of the year, do you expect to ramp up your O&M spending and I guess, bank some O&M for the future? Or just kind of come out at the end of the year above your guidance range for DTE?","David E. Meador","Yes. As you're pointing out, this is a great start to the year on many segments of the business and certainly better than last year. Our normal practice is to update our forecast and review that with the board and evaluate what you're pointing out, which is our lien-and-invest scenario. So our goal is to earn our authorized return to the extent that we have favorable conditions, including weather. Our inclination is to pull ahead investments in the business and the opposite's also that. So we're evaluating that right now. We're going to talk to our board and we'll take you through that in more detail next week at the Analyst Meeting.","Operator","We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to ask you a very quick question here regarding your O&M. As far as it goes, first quarter seems to have been quite positive. How do you feel now with regards to full year? I mean, should we continue to expect this kind of a trend, a decline year-on-year throughout the balance of the year?","David E. Meador","That's another area, I hate to continue to kind of push questions to next week, but we're going to update you next week on, not only the full year, but we're going to update you on multiple years next week, including our thinking on O&M. One item I'd like to point out that what we said is we're going to continue to work hard on O&M. We need to do that on behalf of our customers. And one of the lens on that is just continuous improvement, but we've also signaled that we are always looking for structural changes in our costs and using that as a lever to stay out of rate proceedings as long as possible. So we were able to achieve a couple of our structural changes and continue to work on continuous improvement and we'll lay that out for you next week in terms of our thinking on O&M and how that all plays through, both in the gas and the electric business in terms of staying out of rate cases as long as possible.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Perhaps let me clarify, in the first quarter, how one-time versus sustainable were the cost reductions that we did see here, if you will? Maybe that's a more palatable question. Some of the lost gas improvements, for example.","Peter B. Oleksiak","I'd say probably close to 2\/3 of that will stick. We did have some generation outage timing in there, but as Dave mentioned, some of the structural cost changes, and I was mentioning that the benefit expense will continue to flow through. And the lost gas improvements, for now, we did see physical lost gas come down by 40% in the quarter and we're anticipating that will stick as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And perhaps just broadly speaking again, going back to the notion of staying out. Is there any potential to use some of the amortization of the liability here beyond 2014 on the electric side? And -- or any kind of sense as to how that's going to play out here?","David E. Meador","Yes. Amortization of the liability, are you speaking to the former decoupling play?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, exactly. Sorry if I misread that.","David E. Meador","That again is something that we're evaluating. Right now the way that the regulatory proceeding laid out, we don't have an option right now, we have to amortize that into 2014. And as we've indicated, we -- our current thinking is that we would file in '14 for rates in '15. But as we continue to press down hard on costs, we're asking ourselves the question that you're asking, which is, could you ever move that amortization if you didn't need it in that year? And it's something we're evaluating, but right now, we've not made any decision. We're also evaluating the open question, can we stay out even farther and not file in '14 and possibly push that 1 year later. And again, we'll go into more detail next week. But it's just directionally an indication of how we're managing the company and our cost, which was -- right now, if we could file in '14, we'll do that. But if we can push this out farther or eventually we file, make it as small a number as possible, while still hitting our growth targets and maintaining our balance sheet targets, we're going to do that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess I'll ask the question differently. When did you implement these benefits changes? In other words, how long do we have before we lap them?","David E. Meador","Yes. What had happened here was that, based on what we had done in our salary plans plus our union contracts, we actually had to go through a remeasurement process, and I think it's -- it will be laid out when we file our 10-Q for you. So we had to remeasure our benefit plans, and the way the accounting works it amortizes into income over a 4-year period.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And when did you do that?","Peter B. Oleksiak","It was the end of last year. So we did the year-end calculations for the benefit expense for 2013, that's really where you're seeing it now. But it was end of last year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So is it reasonable to expect the next 3 quarters we should see something similar on the benefits side?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes. That's correct.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. I know you'll probably going to punt it for next week, but obviously there's been discussion around MLPs.","David E. Meador","Actually I don't have to punt it to next week, I'd rather just talk about that right now, if we could. Because we're always asked, as you know, every -- it seems like every meeting I'm in with investors, they're asking, are we thinking about this, and what's our view of these? And the answer is, we're constantly looking at all of our financing techniques, and we've been studying MLPs at a detailed level ever since these things started evolving, including watching, in particular, C corps that are -- now have MLPs versus the large MLPs. But that said, we don't believe that we have the scale at this time and that -- to move on an MLP. We also continue to ask investors what they think about DTE proceeding in its way. We honestly are getting mixed feedback on the thoughts about a company that has the mix of businesses that we have. So we're predominantly, as you know, a utility company with 70% to 80% utility having an MLP. Next week, we're going to take you through our midstream growth aspirations. And as part of that, I would just offer that we constantly evaluate MLPs and other alternatives. And at some point, given future scale, we'll give it more serious consideration. So some have asked recently, it sounds like the tone is changing at DTE Energy. And the answer would be, it is, when the segment was earning $30 million a year, we got asked this question. We answered it one way. Now that we're earning $50 million with aspirations well over $100 million, I think we're just signaling that as this business grows, it's something that we will take a look at. But as of today, as you know, we've been able to grow this business organically and create value without an MLP. So nothing is imminent, but as this business segment grows, it's something that's incumbent on us to constantly evaluate.","Operator","We'll go next to Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Most of the questions were asked. Just back on the benefits. So whether it's on the gas side or the electric side, we should just annualize that number, is that kind of the way to look at it in the savings?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And then same on the lost gas, or is that kind of seasonal?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Some seasonality in that number.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And on the benefits side, was that contemplated in your forecast that you gave earlier in the year?","Peter B. Oleksiak","So this is part of the strategy around delaying the rate proceeding. Even a few years ago, when we're taking a look at it, we would -- potentially would have needed new rates given the size of our capital spend in '13. We knew that we had a design changer that would give us some headroom to stay out of proceeding.","Andrew Levi","So the forecast that you gave for this year, the $3.85 to $4.15, I believe, contemplated this?","Peter B. Oleksiak","That is correct.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just -- I hate to circle back on the MLP. But you mentioned that at a certain point, you'd be more likely if you have the economies of scale. Could you give us a sense as to what that would be?","David E. Meador","I'm not sure there's an exact number. As you know, you want to look at, not only what you have today but you want to look at your pipeline on growth. As a company, we've never wanted to be in a situation where, I created a structure and then I found myself wanting to add growth to that structure that was beyond anything that normally would be in scope or strategy for this company. So I don't think there's a magic answer on that. I think right now, and we'll take you through this next week, we're looking at how far we can push this midstream segment and also what are the range of options that we see happening in this whole Marcellus Shale play right now. And obviously, as this business grows, and assuming that MLPs are still allowed down the road, as you know, there's a very attractive cost to capital structure here that we'll, again, continue to take a look at. But what I want to be careful about is just right now, people shouldn't expect that next week there's some announcement around MLPs. What we want to say is that, as this business segment grows, we'll continue to evaluate this. But it's just not -- we don't feel we're at the right level today.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on the weather-adjusted sales growth, it looks like it was flat. Is that -- does that include the impact of leap year?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes, it does, and that's like one day. So in the quarter, as we go through the year, it becomes less significant, but the load was flat. Actually, at this point, we're expecting our full year to come in close to 2% growth increase.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Now I thought you guys were expecting 1% after the impact of energy efficiency. Has that changed now?","Peter B. Oleksiak","It has. Actually, the industrial in particular, you'll see in the quarter was up 3%. Actually we're anticipating the growth of 5% to 6% by year end.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, so it's all driven by industrial.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Predominantly.","David E. Meador","But still our long term is the 1%, net of energy efficiency.","Peter B. Oleksiak","Our long term is 1%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And could you say what the impact of energy efficiency is?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Approximately 1%.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Kevin Fallon with SIR Capital Management.","Kevin Fallon","I just wanted to see if I could get a little bit more color before the meeting next week on the potential opportunities at the utilities. Should we think about the current capital program as kind of a floor, or is that the full assessment of the need as you see it? Or just directionally, which way you're thinking there?","David E. Meador","You want to take that, Peter?","Peter B. Oleksiak","Yes. I know we've laid out in terms of our capital expense for utilities, our base, we have the environmental and the renewable. That's pretty much kind of playing out over the next few years, as we've indicated in the past. And the gas, it really is, with this, with the IRM really, that program is going to drive the incremental growth for our gas utility.","David E. Meador","Yes, normally, at an event like this, we'll give you a 5-year look. We're going to go longer than 5 years because we have been getting questions about, is there a cliff out there after you go through this wave of environmental spending? And the answer is, no, and we'll lay that out in more detail. I think we've been saying that for a while now, but we just haven't given multiple years of an outlook. And then also trying to explain, what are the dynamics. So over time -- over many, many years, what's going to happen with the generation fleet, what do we think is going to happen with renewable energy and then base infrastructure investment in both the gas and electric utility, and we'll lay that out in more detail next week.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. And just one other one. Back to the MLP for a moment. Just a question, on your internal plans, if you achieve your current internal plans, do you achieve the thresholds that would warrant the scale to do an MLP, regardless of whether you would or wouldn't do it?","David E. Meador","I think that's -- no, I think that's just one criteria around scale. I think there's other questions that, as you know, that have to be asked and answered including, is a company that's 70% to 80% utility and going to remain a C corp, what are the challenges and complexities around us having an MLP for our investors, and will our long-term investors like that or not. And one of the criteria is continuing to get feedback from our investors around that. And as we've said, there's not been a project yet that I couldn't take on in terms of our organic growth because I didn't have an MLP. So we've been able to grow this business, and we'll continue to grow it without one.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Cole with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, since you opened the can of MLP worms, I'll follow up on that. I guess given that you are in a growth phase of the business today and you will need significant amount of capital to grow the business, doesn't it make more sense to MLP it today, that way you can get the benefit of the cheaper cost of capital when you're funding that growth?","David E. Meador","I understand the math in this, Kevin, as well as you do, that using an MLP for a lower cost of capital. You could lay that out. I've laid that out. I think just there's other criteria to this than other -- other than just saying, I'm going to bring a source of lower cost of capital to a company like DTE. So again, I'm not saying that this is imminent because it's not, and I'm not saying that we won't avail -- we won't take this more seriously down the road. I just don't know that there's a triggered threshold that we're going to do this. So we're evaluating it. We're constantly doing this and evaluating it with our outside advisors and our board, and at the same time, we're not there right now. So I just wanted to be careful that if someone thought that we were coming to New York to announce an MLP next week, it's not next week.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess when you're doing the math, too, are you expecting to, I mean, run your MLP synergies. Are you spinning it out completely, that way you can get the full benefit of an MLP? Or is your math, you're dropping it down and you're still keeping it underneath DTE Corporation?","David E. Meador","I'd rather not get into those specifics, because as you know there's a lot of alternative ways, even when you say someone could do an MLP there's different alternatives, including whether the parents keeping some of the limited partnership holdings. And then, is it some of your assets, all of your assets and so on? So I think over time, it's something we'll continue to dialogue with you and others on, including getting feedback from people about how they feel about this company doing something like that.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time.","David E. Meador","Okay. Thank you, again, everybody, and we look forward to seeing you next week, and the meeting starts at 8:30. Take care.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"7868":["DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call October 23, 2015  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Anastasia Minor - Executive Director, IR","Peter Oleksiak - SVP and CFO","Jeff Jewell - VP and Controller","Mark Rolling - VP and Treasurer","Analysts","Julien DuMoulin Smith - UBS","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Operator","Good day and welcome to the DTE Energy Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Anastasia Minor. Please go ahead.","Anastasia Minor","Thank you, Kyle, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.","Our presentation also includes reference to operating earnings, which is the non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating earnings provided in the appendix of today's presentation. We also are now including additional data in the appendix which we have historically provided in a supplemental document.","With us this morning is Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President and CFO; Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller; and Mark Rolling, our Vice President and Treasurer. We also have members of our management team with us to call on during the Q&A session.","I'd like to turn it over to Peter to start our call this morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Anastasia, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Those of you who know me know that I always like to start off with a quick update on my Detroit Tigers. The Tigers looked towards the future at the July trade deadline this year, and [indiscernible] best pitcher, outfielder and closer. With that they slipped firmly into last place by the end of the season. I guess all I can say is, there's always next year and our focus now is on the Red Wings making another playoff run, and I will not be mentioning the Lions or the Pistons on this call.","DTE is continuing to have a successful year in 2015. As you know, we raised our operating earnings guidance a few weeks ago at our Analyst Day. I feel very confident that we will be able to comfortably achieve our guidance. We had a very successful third quarter and we expect a solid quarter to finish the year. We also provided a 2016 early outlook during our Analyst Day and I'm confident we can reach our 2016 EPS targets as well.","Jeff and Mark will be going through third quarter results in more detail, but before we move on to that, I'd like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights of what's happening at DTE. Turning to Slide 5, Slide 5 provides an overview of the business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans for next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Electric utility growth is driven by the renewal of our generation fleet and replacing and upgrading the electric distribution system. Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments, the mainline replacement, pipe replacement and a system expansion to accommodate the increased volumes for the Nexus pipeline into the rest of pipeline.","Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses which provide diversity in earnings and geography. The structure of regulatory environment, engaged employees, continuous improvement and top-level customer satisfaction continue to be priorities that drive DTE success. The constructive regulatory environment is important as our two utilities are investing significant capital in the state of Michigan, and we know fostering this environment is a two-way street. I'll be updating you on some of the regulatory proceedings our utilities are currently working through.","Our highly engaged workforce continues to be a key to our success, and we have described our success throughout the year with the recognition we have received from the Gallup organization over the last three years. Our focus on continuous improvement is distinctive in the industry as the utilities continue to be leaders in maintaining costs. The combination of these two, employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to deliver both a sustainable COGS savings track record and to consistently earn authorized returns at both of our utilities.","We're also very focused on customer satisfaction, demonstrated by our gas utility currently rating highest by J.D. Power among our peers for business customer satisfaction. Both DTE Electric and DTE Gas are ranked second in satisfaction of residential customers.","Rounding out our business strategy is our dividend growth and solid credit rating. Our dividend continues to grow as we grow earnings and our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.","Slide 6 provides some highlights of progress in 2015. As I mentioned earlier at our Analyst Day, we raised our 2015 operating EPS guidance and provided 2016 operating EPS early outlook. I'll provide a more detailed overview of guidance in a few minutes. Today we are revising our cash flow and capital guidance for 2015, and Mark will provide more details on this in a few minutes.","Regarding Michigan's energy policy, there is positive momentum for constructive legislation by the end of the year. The governor and other energy leaders have called this a major priority. There is [indiscernible] legislation that has been developed in both the House and the Senate and the more extensive hearings have now been concluded. There have been a dozen hearings in the House on the proposed legislation and eight in the Senate, so this legislation is moving along nicely.","Also want to give a quick update on the various rate proceedings for our two utilities. Our electric utility self implemented rates on July 1 for our ongoing generate rate proceeding. We expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. We also implemented the new cost of service rates which resulted in rate reductions for most of our business customers at the same time of self implementation.","For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for an expanded infrastructure recovery mechanism that if approved will allow us to double the annual miles of our mainline replacement program. For next gas general rate case, we are looking to file in late 2015 or early 2016. We're finalizing our plans. We feel this timeframe is optimal time to file. As you know, we haven't filed a rate case at our gas utility in nearly four years.","We continue to make significant progress in our non-utility businesses. Let me hit on a couple of developments in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business. Millennium is currently working on 200 Mcf\/day expansion, which is expected to go on service in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, Millennium is constructing an 8-mile valley lateral to supply 130 Mcf to a new natural gas plant in Pennsylvania. This is expected to go in service in April of 2017.","We have increased our ownership in the Nexus pipeline project from 33% to 50%, which increases our planned investment to approximately $1 billion. We have executed a number of key milestones, including the contracting for the major pipe materials earlier this month. Our next key milestone on the Nexus project is the FERC filing which will happen later this year.","We have commitments. We need to move forward with the construction of the pipe. We have recently signed a number of Tampa interconnect agreements that could provide potential aggregate load across northern Ohio for up to 1.4 Bcf a day. This demonstrates strong market support for the project and also strengthens the longer term earnings potential for the play. And we continue to see increasing production forecast for the Appalachian region. So you can see we have a lot of positive things going on in both our utilities and non-utilities giving us confidence to reach our earnings goals in 2015.","I can move on to provide more detail on Michigan's energy legislation, but before I do that, let me give you a quick update on Michigan's economy. The state economic indicators are looking very strong. We show some of the actual forecasts and metrics in the appendix but I'd like to highlight Michigan's unemployment rate for September which was 5%. This is actually lower than the national rate of 5.1%, and it's worth noting because it's the first time in Michigan the unemployment rate is below the national average in 15 years. So things continue to move in the right direction in our state.","So now let me move on to the state energy policy reform on Slide 7. Slide 7 is a slide you've seen before showing Michigan's leaders who are helping to move the state's energy policy reform to its completion. We are definitely fortunate to have these individuals who really understand what good energy policy looks like. The governor identified the need for energy policy reform as one of his top priorities and he has not wavered from that all year. He has taken time to study and understand our industry and land on what a good policy moving forward would be. His good advisors were John Quackenbush and Valerie Brader. And with Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt, we have two very competent energy leaders in the Senate and the House.","So we have a situation where all three entities, the administration, the House and the Senate, are clear that Michigan does need to develop new policy to control its future. There is definitely progress happening. It gives us confidence of a timely resolution to the energy policy reform. Both the Senate and the House energy committee have concluded extensive hearings on the legislative package. Nofs and Nesbitt are working with committee members who would vote in the committee possibly by next month.","So I'd like to turn to some specifics on legislation that is under development in the House and the Senate with Page 8, starting with the retail open access. Leadership in both the House and the Senate realized that the current system is broken, so both are proposing reforms. Both proposals as they stand now would cap the current program at 10% but with stricter and more fair provisions.","Actually the House until recently had planned to eliminate retail open access altogether, but as part of the alignment process has been now proposing to stay at the 10% cap. But importantly, both the House and the Senate would require one-time election to return to the utility, which means there will be no longer a free option to move back and forth between the marketplace and our regulated rates.","To make the cost of capacity more fair and to issue a reliable generation service in the state, the Senate is proposing a three-year capacity commitment, the house is targeting a five-year capacity commitment for those customers who would like to stay on retail open access.","Integrated resource planning or IRP is the second key element of legislation. The proposals enable pre-approvals, so once it's decided on what generation this should be, there will be a process for pre-approving investments and assuring that they are prudent, and similar to our current Certificate of Need process or CON process but on a portfolio basis. This new IRP process will fit nicely into the state's implementation plan for the clean power plan.","Then finally the legislation is going to deal with a number of regulatory reforms. Both the House and the Senate are proposing a move from our current 12 month cycle on rate approvals with a six month sub-implementation, to a simple 10 month cycle. There is also work on establishing a fair net metering policy which I think is important as we head towards building more renewables. Revenue decoupling is also being proposed for electric utilities. We would like to have this option to enable recovery of the impacts of energy efficiency in between rate proceedings.","So I think the state of Michigan is well-positioned to have energy legislation by year-end. That's important so that as a state we can move on in a constructive way to make the investments that we need to transform Michigan's energy infrastructure.","So on Slide 9, this slide shows our EPS history and our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings, evidenced by our recent increase which was at the high end of our earnings growth target. The chart shows a revised 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.78 as well as the EPS guidance midpoint of $4.69 for our growth segments. The 5% to 6% future growth I mentioned is off our new 2016 early outlook midpoint of $4.93 per share. The $4.93 midpoint represents a 7% increase from the 2015 original guidance.","So let me get into a little more detail on Page 10. Slide 10 shows our current 2015 EPS guidance and our 2016 EPS early outlook. I want to focus on our 2015 guidance. Our current EPS guidance range is $4.65 to $4.91 for total DTE Energy and $4.59 to $4.79 for our growth segments. You can see next to the guidance numbers arrows indicating where we think the year might play out for each segment. We have green arrows up next to all of our non-utility businesses. If these businesses have a repeat of the strong performance in the fourth quarter similar to what we've experienced in the first three quarters this year, then we are seeing earnings fall in the upper end of these ranges.","For Gas Storage and Pipelines, we are seeing strong performance in both pipeline and gathering earnings. Our Power and Industrial Projects segment is seeing solid performance in our REF business. And we are seeing strong economic performance at our Energy Trading operations. Our Corporate and Other segment is trending towards the lower end of guidance driven by taxes.","I mentioned the strong financial performance we have seen this year, so I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell to provide more details on the earnings results.","Jeff Jewell","Thanks, Peter, and good morning everyone. I'll be going over quarter-over-quarter earnings results on Page 12, and on Page 13 I will provide more detail into DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter operating earnings variance.","Now turning to Page 12, for the quarter DTE Energy's operating earnings were $252 million or $1.40 per share, and for reference, our reported earnings were $1.47 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the third quarter reported to operating earnings on Page 27.","For the quarter, our growth segments operating earnings in 2015 were $75 million or $0.40 per share higher than 2014. The Electric segment was higher by $79 million. This favorability was due to warmer weather, self implemented rates and lower storm expenses in 2015. I'll provide more detail on Page 13.","DTE Gas was higher by $5 million. This was primarily driven by reinvestment spend in 2014 and increased revenue associated with the infrastructure recovery mechanism surcharge. Gas Storage and Pipelines earnings were $7 million favorable to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes on the Bluestone pipeline and increased investments in our gathering assets.","Our Power and Industrial Projects segment was lower by $6 million versus 2014, due primarily to timing of major coke battery maintenance project expenses and a steel related installment sale contract that ended in the second quarter of 2015. Our Corporate and Other segment came in unfavorable by $10 million versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of federal and state tax accruals. These items were considered in our year-end guidance. Again, the overall growth segment results for the quarter were $253 million or $1.40 per share.","Energy Trading posted a $1 million operating loss for the quarter and economic net income of $14 million. Both the power and gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to Page 25 of the appendix to review the Energy Trading standard reconciliation page which shows both economic and accounting performance. Overall, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $252 million or $1.40 per share for the quarter.","Now let's turn to Page 13 to discuss our Electric performance. Electric segment earnings were $79 million higher quarter over quarter. The variance was driven by three major contributors, increased rates, return to near normal weather, and lower storm O&M. DTE Electric self implemented a rate increase on July 1 as part of its ongoing rate case. This was partially offset by increased rate base growth due to investment in the generation and distribution operations.","The next major contributor was weather. If you recall, summer weather in 2014 was much cooler than normal while this summer was near-normal. This resulted in increased sales of approximately 700 gigawatt-hours when compared to the same period last year. Please refer to Page 24 of the appendix for sales variance detail.","Finally, we experienced lower storm activity in the third quarter of 2015. This is a significant decrease when compared to 2014 where we saw multiple storms including the storm in September of 2014 that impacted more than 400,000 or 20% of our customers. In conclusion, for the quarter, DTE Electric's operating earnings were $79 million higher than 2014.","That concludes the update for our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics.","Mark Rolling","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support our long-term growth plan. Slide 15 lays out our cash flow and CapEx through the third quarter. Cash from operations is $1.5 billion and we saw strong performance across all business units, putting us a little ahead of our plan for the year. We invested $1.7 billion of CapEx through the third quarter, and on the right side of the page you can see the breakout by business unit.","DTE Electric is up due to higher operational investments and higher new generation spend with the acquisition of a gas [indiscernible] back in the first quarter, partially offset by the timing of some wind investments between years. And year to date, the non-utilities are on pace with last year. To fund this CapEx program and the refinance maturing debt, we issued $1 billion in long-term debt this year.","Let me turn now to Slide 16 and the revised cash flow and CapEx guidance that Peter touched on. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing strong cash flow this year and therefore we are increasing our cash from operations guidance by $100 million. We're also making a small change to our CapEx guidance, and on the right side of the page you can see the breakout of capital spending by business unit.","We still expect to spend a little over $1.8 billion at DTE Electric and $280 million at DTE Gas, and we expect our non-utility businesses to invest $350 million for the year or about $100 million lower than the low point of the original guidance. Now this change captures the timing of some of the growth progress upon industrial and will have no effect on the growth plan that we provided at our Investor Day last month.","This brings our total CapEx to nearly $2.5 billion for the year, which is up more than 15% over last year. And back on the left side of the page, we have reduced our debt financing needs to correspond with this $200 million increase in free cash flow.","Now I'll move to Slide 17 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remained strong and we project ending the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. We issued $200 million of equity back in the first quarter and that fulfilled our equity needs for this year. At our investor event last month, we disclosed modest equity needs of $800 million from 2016 through 2018. Earlier this year we renewed our credit facility through 2020 and we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of available liquidity.","As we outlined at our Investor Day, we have a financial planning approach that will continue to rely on the strength of our balance sheet to fuel our long-term growth plans. And now I'll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks Mark. Let me finish the presentation with a quick summary on Slide 19, and then we can open the line for questions. We had three solid quarters so far this year and we are confident that this year's performance will allow us to achieve our 2015 EPS guidance. We also anticipate constructive outcomes this year in both utility regulatory filings as well as the Michigan's energy policy reform. Our balance sheet and cash flow metrics remain strong and our investments in our utility and non-utility businesses support our target 5% to 6% EPS growth going forward.","I thank you all for joining our call this morning and I hope to see many of you at the EEI conference in a couple of weeks. Gerry Anderson will be giving a formal presentation on November 10th that will be Webcasted on our Investor Relations Web-site. So we hope you all can join us. Now I'd like to open up for questions that you have, so Kyle, you can open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien DuMoulinSmith","It's actually Julien here. So quick first question, perhaps obvious, given the trailing 12 months, what are you thinking here in terms of the fourth quarter and implied results, it seems perhaps it could even be potentially down year-over-year, is there something about reinvestment, [indiscernible] et cetera, you might imagine?","Peter Oleksiak","I'd like to reiterate that we are kind of confident with the earnings guidance that we've put out there. The electric utility in particular last year was in a lean mode. That's really, if you're looking quarter over quarter, kind of a fourth to fourth, that's what you're seeing emptying there.","Julien DuMoulin Smith","Got it. So does that actually mean that there is added strength or more of a tailwind that you are reinvesting in fourth quarter into 2016, or perhaps as you just alluded, was in more of a 4Q 2014 phenomenon such that this is more of a normalized pace in 4Q 2015?","Peter Oleksiak","It's more the latter, the last year's fourth quarter phenomenon.","Julien DuMoulin Smith","Got it, excellent. And then perhaps secondly, just of late any developments on the gathering front with Southwestern?","Peter Oleksiak","Our gathering business is going very well, and as you know, our raising of guidance in that segment in particular was with the volumes associated with the gathering with the Southwestern Energy. So the well performance is great, the drilling program continues to be strong in that region and our gathering earnings are flowing nicely there.","Julien DuMoulin Smith","Great. All right, I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers","Just on the legislation in Michigan with the hearings done, do you guys have a read in when something can get formalized or resolved between the House and the Senate and vote where this finally gets cauterized, is there something that we can look forward or a schedule that you guys see right now?","Peter Oleksiak","It is not a firm schedule, but as I mentioned, the extensive hearing process is done, and as you know, you mentioned that as well. There's some finalization of language that will happen both in the committee and the House and then they'll move it, both the Senate and the House, and from there there'll be reconciliation. We are anticipating that will start happening as early as next month, early next month, but going more likely into the month of December.","Dan Eggers","So a conference next month between the House and the Senate and a vote in December seems realistic at this point?","Peter Oleksiak","Right, yes, that's a possibility.","Dan Eggers","Okay. And then I guess your second question, when you think about the \u2013 it looks like you're going to the idea that Choice has to get a firm capacity kind of somewhere between three and five years, is that something that you guys would look at providing or are you not going to be in the business of offering capacity to those customers?","Peter Oleksiak","No, we are not in the business of offering capacity to those customers. We'll offer to our customers.","Dan Eggers","Okay. What is the year to date weather benefit on that after the good third quarter?","Peter Oleksiak","Jeff, if you have that?","Jeff Jewell","Ask that one more time, just make sure we're answering what you're looking for.","Dan Eggers","How much year-to-date weather benefit have you guys gotten? You gave the quarter, I don't know if you have the year handy.","Jeff Jewell","So for the full year, if you go back to Page 24 in the pack, I think that's what you're asking, so I'll just guide you back there. So the first is \u2013 I'm on the left-hand side there in the middle, DTE Electric 2015, you can see what that was for the quarter and we talked about that. And for the year to date, you can see it's at $12 million.","Dan Eggers","Got it, thank you. I should've [looked it up] [ph] myself.","Jeff Jewell","[Indiscernible] was down negative $17 million for the year.","Dan Eggers","Okay. And my last question just on the pipeline tap-ins now that you're 1.4 Bcf of potential customers, when do those start converting either into contracts or something more substantial and what should we be tracking other than just kind of these quarterly updates?","Peter Oleksiak","That will happen over time as the pipe gets built. That 1.4 Bcf is non-binding but we do anticipate that a number of that will potentially turn into nice investments for us, lateral or gathering couple of opportunities. They are more likely \u2013 that will happen once we are done with the construction of the pipe.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matt Tucker","Just wanted to follow-up on the guidance and the full year guidance kind of implying that the fourth quarter would be down year-over-year, you already commented on some reinvestment at Electric. It looks like the non-utility segments, the guidance also implies earnings would be lower year-over-year. Could you talk about what might be driving that or should we kind of expect that the Electric reinvestment could offset some of the earnings there?","Peter Oleksiak","The electric utility, I mentioned I'm feeling comfortable with the guidance range we have out there. There was a phenomenon last year fourth quarter around lean. We're in a normal investment cycle this year in the fourth quarter. But our non-utility businesses are performing strong. On a year to date basis, there is strong performance, and if that strong performance continues in the fourth quarter, those businesses will more likely end up in the upper end of those ranges.","Matt Tucker","Great, thanks. And just hoping you could provide a little more color on the change in timing in the CapEx at Power and Industrial Projects.","Peter Oleksiak","Mark, you want to take that one?","Mark Rolling","Sure. So that as you mentioned is timing related. When we did our original guidance for the year and we provided a range this year on the non-utility businesses, recognizing that those businesses and the timing of the project show-up has some variability. As we are close to the year-end, we have better visibility as to what's going to occur here in late 2015 versus what may occur early in 2016. So it's a timing related item at Power and Industrial. Specifically, if you step back and look at our early outlook for 2016 and our growth plan that we provided at our Investor Day, this has no impact on any of that, it's really the timing item.","Matt Tucker","Got it. And is there any specific projects that you did highlight there?","Peter Oleksiak","I'll add just a little commentary to Mark's comments. Power and Industrial Projects in particular, we do have an acquisition strategy there where if opportunistic we'll acquire small on-site related projects, and they have the tendency to be kind of lumpy in terms of when they show up, and when they do show up \u2013 we had one back a few years ago with the Duke project on the on-site project. So there, I don't want to be too concerned. When they do show up, sometimes they show up and they are relatively sizable. We like to have a placeholder in with a capital for that business unit in particular. So it's really just timing related to these small acquisitions related to in the Power and Industrial segment.","Matt Tucker","Understood. Thanks guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","I just wanted to revisit just timing of the legislature. I know you'll lay that when you know the steps, you see it. Are there some deadlines that we need to hit in order for this to be all accomplished in calendar 2015, when do the session end and at what point would we need to see it out of conference, how much wiggle room is there I guess?","Peter Oleksiak","It is not a firm schedule. The augment deadline was before they moved to the holiday break and which would be the back half of December, but the momentum we are seeing right now with the hearings being concluded, they said there'll be some tweaking of the language in both the House and the Senate, and then at that point a reconciliation. The good thing is both the House and the Senate, essentially with Aric Nesbitt's move to move a bit closer to where Mike Nofs is at, I see that process hopefully happening relatively quick once it starts.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. Thank you, Peter. That was it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shar Pourreza","Just one question on the decoupler, I know it's a little bit preliminary, but Peter, are you looking for a full decoupler which takes any kind of load out of your earnings mix or sort of more of a partial decoupler that accounts for energy efficiency in DSM?","Peter Oleksiak","We'll explore all the options. First is to kind of get that option for the electric utility to have a decoupler in legislation. That's being proposed right now. So we like that to give us that option of flexibility. As we are thinking about it, we really would want it fully focused on the energy efficiency, that's our early thinking at this moment.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. Okay, so you have some potential leverage to macro probably, okay. And then just on the pipe, 1.4 is non-binding, it's a little bit preliminary, but is there any indication that you could reach that to laterals and compressors from a demand side or it's too early?","Peter Oleksiak","The overall pipe we are putting in is 1.5 B, that's expandable to 2 B with compression. The major market when this pipe first was put in was Dawn, and Michigan is Michigan, goes from a coal plant to gas plant conversion. So it's really nice. Actually this Ohio market is actually showing up as well that wasn't originally anticipated. We kind of knew that when we placed this pipe, we deliberately placed it in the Northeast Ohio around these industrial centers. So we are hoping that this 1.4 B, a portion of that gets converted over to this industrial load, which then once we [indiscernible] to get a lateral in gathering, but we feel comfortable right now that we'll be able to expand the pipe to meet that. It will be a nice problem to have.","Shar Pourreza","Yes, exactly. Thanks Peter.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Peter Oleksiak","I'd like to just thank everybody for this morning joining us on the call, and once again we're going to be at EEI and hope to see many of you there. Have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8020":["DTE Energy Co.

(Research)","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Operator","Good day everyone, and welcome to the DTE Energy 2017 Q2 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Barbara Tuckfield. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Barbara Tuckfield - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to read the Safe Harbor statement on page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statement.","Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating earnings provided in the appendix.","With us this morning are Gerry Anderson, Chairman and CEO; Jerry Norcia, President and COO; and Peter Oleksiak, Senior Vice President and CFO. We also have members of the management team to call on during the Q&A.","Now, I'll turn it over to Gerry to start the call.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","All right. Well, thank you, Barb, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. So this morning, I will give you a recap of our performance for the second quarter, including some updates on a few key developments of the company. And then, I'll hand it over to Jerry Norcia, who will provide a bit more detail on our progress, particularly at our non-utility businesses. And then finally, Peter will provide a financial review, wrap things up, and then we'll take the Q&A.","So moving on to slide 5, on the first quarter call, I said that we were off to a really strong start in 2017, and I will just reiterate that at the halfway point of the year. This past quarter was successful on a number of fronts for the company, including our financial performance. So, I feel very good about our financial results over the first half of the year. And based on those results, we are increasing our 2017 earnings guidance midpoint by $0.11 a share to $5.42. I also say that I'm confident in our ability to deliver on that increased guidance, and on our ability to continue to deliver similar results longer term.","So, I think many of you are aware that back in May, we announced a sustainability initiative that commits DTE to reducing its carbon emissions by over 80% by 2050 with interim commitments to reduce levels on the path along the way to that ultimate goal. So this announcement was a defining event for DTE. It set the course for our power generation investments for many years to come.","Interestingly, the announcement was really widely covered in the press with over 200 articles and publications nationwide picking it up. The sentiment of the coverage was very positive, and I'll talk a little bit more about the specifics of the carbon reduction initiative here in a few minutes.","Investment in our utilities, of course, is central to the growth of the company, and we continue to execute our plan to invest both to transform our generation fleet and also to fundamentally improve reliability in both our gas and electric distribution operations.","A commitment to minimizing the impact of those investments on customer rates is a key part of the plan, and it's critical to us continuing to be highly ranked in customer satisfaction amongst our peers.","And in that vein, I'm proud to say that our electric utility ranked second in J.D. Power's Residential Customer Satisfaction Study that was announced earlier this month. And that marked a seventh consecutive year that DTE is ranked in the top quartile for large Midwest electric utilities, and we've improved our absolute customer satisfaction score every year for the past five years.","Moving on to the non-utility front. As I said, I'll touch briefly on a few things and then Jerry will provide more detail. Our Bluestone Pipeline achieved a considerable milestone this quarter. The pipe is now delivering 1 Bcf of gas per day, which is more than three times the amount of gas it delivered five years ago, when we put the pipe into service. It was delivering 0.3 Bcf back then. So, we've seen quite amazing growth. And that growth at Bluestone has been driven by the quality of the reserves that it serves. And this growth gives us confidence in the potential for future expansions at Link and NEXUS, which we believe serve similarly strong geology and strong reserves.","Moving on to a NEXUS update, I know many of you are interested in the progress and the timing of this project. So, before I get into that, and get into the timing, I'll reiterate what I said on the first quarter call, and that is that the precise in-service date for NEXUS doesn't materially impact our 2017, 2018 or long-term EPS profile. So, we want to get moving on the project, but near-term earnings are not the driver of that desire.","So that said, as you know, the FERC quorum has not yet been restored. And as I said on the first quarter call, we expected a year-end 2017 in-service date if we received a FERC certificate by the end of the second quarter or sometime within reach of midyear.","We also said on the first quarter call that if the FERC certificate wasn't received within that timeframe, then the project might push into 2018. Well, that's where we are now, with a in-service date in 2018.","And Jerry Norcia will give more color on the FERC dynamics in a few minutes. But even though the process is taking longer than we'd like, we're still feeling very good about the project itself. We continue to make progress on the pipeline in the interim. So we have all the materials and equipment, nearly all the right-of-way easements, we're in the final stages of obtaining the necessary permits, and our construction contracts are in place.","So to put it plainly, we're completing the steps that are in our control to complete during this period. And once we receive the FERC certificate, we will go immediately to work, and we will, at that time, provide a more precise projected in-service date.","Moving on to our power and industrial business, a quick summary is that, we closed on a second landfill gas plant, and are close to finalizing the agreement on the large-scale central plant that we announced last quarter. And these projects, along with a landfill gas acquisition that we announced last quarter, will help cover the REF earnings roll-off that begins in four to five years.","So now moving on to slide 6, I want to tell you more about the sustainability initiative and the carbon emission reduction goals that we recently announced. So, as I mentioned, we are committed to reducing carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2050, and that's the target and the timeframe that scientists have broadly settled on.","So the slide shows our CO2 emission reduction plan versus 2005 levels. 2005 is the year everybody uses as the benchmark. We'll achieve a 30% reduction by the early 2020s, when we retire several coal-fired plants and start up a gas-combined cycle plant, a 45% reduction by 2030, a 75% reduction by 2040, when our final coal plant closes, and a more than 80% reduction by 2050. These reductions interestingly exceed the targets established by the now shelved Clean Power Plan.","To replace our aging coal facilities, we'll add about 3,500 megawatts of natural gas-fired capacity, that will supply the 24\/7 power and ensure reliability. The first of these gas plants is in motion now. So we have received several bids in response to our request for proposal for the acquisition of existing generation plants, and we're currently evaluating those bids. As we look also at a self-build option, and then compare the two to determine the best solution to meet the needs of our customers.","And our final decision will be integrated into the Certificate of Necessity filing that will be made at the end of this month, so in a matter of days.","We're also planning to construct on the order of 4,000 megawatts of additional renewable energy capacity over time. The next major renewable investments on that path will occur in 2018 and in 2020.","As I said earlier, I believe this carbon reduction plan is a defining initiative for DTE. And I also believe that our sector more broadly would be well served to get out in front of the carbon issue and take it head-on. And I say this, because, ultimately, the transition from coal to natural gas and renewables and from oil to electricity in the transportation sector is one of the best and strongest growth opportunities that our industry has.","And further, I'm convinced that we and the industry can pull off this transition in a way that maintains affordability, that maintains the currently strong competitive position of the U.S. energy complex.","And I feel confident saying that, because the plan we've announced has been in the works for several years, and we have studied and modeled the transition very, very carefully. If there's anything we do at DTE, we run the numbers, and we're convinced that it can be done affordably.","So, don't get me wrong, there are ways to go about this transition that could be expensive for customers. Other countries have proven that. Germany is a clear example. They blew it. But it doesn't have to be that way. And in Michigan, we're committed to going about this transition the right way to ensure that we achieve not only the sustainability goals, but the affordability goals as well.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Jerry Norcia, who will give you an update on our non-utility businesses. Jerry, over to you.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Gerry, and good morning, everyone. I'll be giving an update on the non-utility growth businesses, GSP and P&I. I'll start with GSP in our Bluestone Pipeline & Gathering assets on slide 8. As Gerry mentioned, Bluestone achieved a major milestone in the second quarter. For the first time, the system is delivering 1 Bcf of natural gas per day to the Millennium and Tennessee Interstate Pipelines.","This landmark achievement is significant for a couple of reasons. It is an important achievement for our DTE team as they start \u2013 system started with initial capacity of 0.3 Bcf per day. And through a lot of work and multiple expansions, we have more than tripled the capacity in just over five years. The other reason is that it is clear sign of the abundance of low-cost natural gas in a region closest to the nation's largest gas markets, enabling to build of new natural gas-fired plants.","Our Millennium Pipeline is moving towards completing an additional 0.2 Bcf per day expansion in the second half of 2018, bringing its total capacity to 1 Bcf per day. The success in our Bluestone and Millennium Pipelines gives me confidence that we will see similar results as we move our new projects forward.","The Link Lateral & Gathering project continues to receive significant market interest. Key producers continue to bring on additional wells online, and other producers will soon be doing the same. This is consistent with our expectations and supports the positive momentum for Link.","We're also in ongoing discussions with producers to fill and expand the pipe. Gerry provided an update on the NEXUS Pipeline. I want to reiterate that we are ready for construction with right-of-way acquisition significantly completed, and most of our permits received.","As soon as FERC nominations play out, and we then receive the certificate, we will begin construction. Projects of this scope takes 7 to 10 months to construct. We will be able to be more specific about an in-service date after the first two items occur. We'll do that as soon as we are able to.","Regarding the FERC nomination process, there has been good progress on that front as well. Neil Chatterjee and Rob Powelson have been approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, both by a very strong bipartisan vote. The two nominees now await a final vote by the full Senate.","Recently, President Trump announced his intent to nominate two more commissioners, Richard Glick and Kevin McIntyre, with McIntyre expected to serve as chair. Once approved, Commission will have five members, which is fully staffed. We see strong bipartisan support for the nominees currently before the Senate, and are hopeful the Senate will schedule a vote on at least two nominees prior to its scheduled August recess. So, again, once we receive our FERC certificate, we will provide a more specific 2018 in-service date.","Moving on to slide 9, I'll give you a brief update on some of our projects we discussed on our first quarter call. We are excited about what's happening in the P&I space, and have made significant strides with our new project. We began operations with a landfill gas plant we acquired a few months ago. A second landfill gas project, the construction of a new plant is progressing very well. We signed a contract in May and expect the facility to be in-service in the first half of next year. As we previously mentioned, we are in advanced discussions for several additional landfill gas opportunities.","The other project we mentioned was construction of a new large-scale central energy plant. This plant is expected to be in-service in the second half of 2019, and will provide a large industrial customer with both combined heat and power as well as chilled and hot water. This project received board approval from both companies, we are currently in the late stages of finalizing the contract.","All of these projects fit really well within our P&I portfolio and help shore up our long-term growth plan, filling in earnings when a portion of REF earnings roll off in 2021. We continue to develop other opportunities and we'll provide updates on these projects as well as other projects as they progress.","And now, I'll turn it over to Peter Oleksiak, who'll provide a financial update for the quarter.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Thanks, Jerry, and good morning to everyone. Let's start on slide 11. This slide shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment. DTE had a strong second quarter driven by growth in our non-utility segments and unlike my Detroit Tigers who are struggling to hit the 0.500-mark and are rebuilding, DTE just keeps winning and outperforming.","Operating earnings for the second quarter were $1.07 per share and for reference, reported earnings were $0.99 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to slide 23 of the appendix.","Starting on the top of the page with our two utilities, DTE Electric's earnings were $148 million for the quarter, up $13 million compared to the second quarter last year. We've implemented new rates, which were partially offset by a return to normal weather in May this year. A further breakdown of DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter results can be found in the appendix on slide 16.","For DTE Gas, earnings were $1 million, down $12 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by a warmer than normal April, higher rate base growth, and O&M related to benefit expenses, partially offset by new rates implemented last November.","At DTE Gas, one thing we are seeing because of the last rate case is that the shape of earnings is different than what we have seen historically. As I mentioned on the first quarter call, earnings will be higher in the first and fourth quarter and lower in the second and third quarter, because rates are now more volumetric in nature.","The third quarter will be most affected, where earnings could be lower by as much as $10 million to $20 million quarter-over-quarter, including base rate increases. This change in timing of earnings has no impact on our full-year results, and we are still on track to hit guidance for the segment.","Now on to the non-utilities, our Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings were $40 million for the quarter, up $5 million over last year, driven by growth in our pipeline and gathering earnings.","Moving down the slide, earnings at Power & Industrial Projects were $30 million for the quarter, up $13 million from the quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher REF volumes at new sites coming online and steel-related earnings.","Earnings for Corporate & Other were negative $32 million for the quarter, $9 million unfavorable versus last year, largely due to timing of taxes. So earnings overall for our growth segments in the second quarter were $187 million or $1.05 per share compared to $177 million or $0.98 per share last year.","Rounding out our operating earnings, our Energy Trading business had a solid first half of the year. Second quarter operating earnings were $4 million. This is up $4 million from the first quarter (sic) [second quarter] of last year. And as always, we have an appendix on slide 22, our standard energy trading reconciliation showing both economic and accounting performance.","So, let's discuss guidance on slide 12. As Gerry Anderson mentioned, based on our financial results for the first half of the year, we are increasing the midpoint of our 2017 EPS guidance by $0.11 from $5.31 to $5.42.","Our EPS guidance range for DTE Energy now is $5.26 to $5.57 and $5.21 and $5.46 for our growth segments. Our guidance increases are indicated by the green arrows, and are driven by strong start of the year at our non-utility segments, which we believe will carry through the rest of the year.","For our Gas Storage & Pipelines, we are seeing favorable results across all business platforms. At P&I, we are seeing higher REF volumes as well as higher steel-related earnings. As I mentioned, on the prior slide, Energy Trading business is off to a strong start.","Now, I'll wrap it up on slide 13, then open the line for questions. Once again we had a strong second quarter. We're committed to transforming our generation fleet, and with our plans in motion to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80%. The strength of our utilities and the growth of our non-utility businesses gives me confidence, our management team confidence that we'll continue to deliver premium shareholder returns.","And with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So, Lisa, you can open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So, I just wanted to confirm that it looks like all of the increasing guidance is from the \u2013 mostly from the pipeline segments or mostly from the P&I landfill gas. Is that basically ahead of schedule? Is that why we're raising guidance at this point?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","You're talking about the increase we just gave in 2017.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","For 2017. Yeah.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Yes, it's for our both segments, for our Gas Storage & Pipelines segment. It is across the platform of businesses in both our gathering and pipeline, since it's had strong results which will carry throughout the year. And then for our P&I segment, it's a combination of steel-related, which is a coke battery volumes as well as REF volumes as well, which is tied to coal plants that we have our REF sites on.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And I think you mentioned that you're in talks to expand Link further with producers. Can you give us an indication how far along those discussions are? What point may you be able to discuss the natural expansion with some numbers around it?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","We're seeing the producers \u2013 it's Jerry Norcia. We're seeing the producers drill and fill their capacity positions, and we are on a number of conversations that could lead to an expansion. But we haven't secured any of those at this point. But we're feeling very good, both the volumes and the drilling ramp that we're seeing, and the reserves that these producers are drilling into. It's certainly proceeding well in line with plans.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","One thing to remember about that pipeline is it had capacity available for producers to expand into. So one of the key jobs was to fill up that volume, and as Jerry just said, we're feeling very encouraged by the pace of drilling and the level of activity in the area, and the growth we're seeing on the pipe.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And just to confirm also that we're still at 1.75 Bcf for the, it's the backlog of interconnect agreements, right, on NEXUS? Has that number changed, or are we still two-thirds contracted at this point?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Still two-thirds contracted, and, yes, the 1.75 Bcf of interconnect agreements is what we have.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, just let me ask you a follow-up question on NEXUS. What's the inflection point on the additional firm capacity? So what I'm \u2013 I guess what I'm trying to get at is, do you \u2013 knowing what you know now, do you expect additional interconnection agreements to transfer to firm as you get a FERC certificate, or do you expect the additional demand-pull to come when you're well under way in construction?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","We've got \u2013 as you mentioned, we've got significant interconnectivity along the NEXUS Pipeline, that I think will yield more firm contracts.","In terms of timing, a lot of the conversations are revolving around providing those potential shippers with certainty as when the pipeline will go into service. And I think the moment that we get a FERC certificate and we start construction, we'll start to move to close on some of those firm service agreements.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. And then, Gerry, I think we've discussed, you're pursuing a bit of a \u2013 some sort of a capital tracking mechanism on the electric side. Is there any status there, and when do you expect this study due? And then how does that sort of fit as far as your coal retirement and in your carbon reduction targets?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So I think step one in working with the commission is work we're doing on a distribution investment plan. So we were asked by the commission to file a five-year look at distribution investments. And we took that as a very positive collaborative effort. They understand that we need to invest to modernize the system, to automate the system, to improve reliability and so forth, and it's a significant investment. So, the filing is really for them to understand it better and for the commission and DTE to be on the same page. That's step one.","The second question is, how to fund that construction? And I think there is some interest on both sides for alternative mechanisms for the portions of that build that are straightforward and well understood, once the plan is well understood. But I guess I'd say, I wouldn't put the cart before the horse, so to speak. We want to get a good plan that's understood by the commission. And then if we can put a recovery mechanism in place that helps both sides, that's great; if not, we'll proceed as normal. I'd expect those sorts of discussions to be \u2013 about recovery mechanisms to potentially be playing out next year, after we work our way through the distribution plan this year.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And then in a successful, if you get a capital tracking mechanism under the assumption that it's something that's substantial, expect to stay out of a rate case for multiple years (25:17)?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Well, that would be one of the advantages, would be to spread out the time between cases and keep the cases focused on the things that really are out of normal, so to speak. So if we can have routine things covered in tracking mechanisms and the non-routine things covered in cases, that would be ideal. But, again, I think that's an agenda we'll work next year once we've got greater clarity on \u2013 an agreement on the investment agenda itself.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Terrific, guys. Thanks so much.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Peter, sorry about the Tigers, but all you got to do is get hot in August, right? 8.5 games is not that bad. Just quickly on P&I, do the stronger expected earnings at P&I also go away as the REF credits expire, or is there a higher expected ending point when \u2013 what's that (26:17) 2021?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah. Our REF units will expire in tranches, the first one is the end of 2020, so 2021, and the other one being 2022. So this is tied to those units and the credits that will expire in that timeframe.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So...","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","There's many additional (26:34) earnings in cash for us in the short-term, which is very positive.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay. More earnings in cash in the near term, but the uptick here also rolls off in 2021?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","That's correct.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks. I'm good.","Operator","We'll move on to our next question from John Barta with KeyBanc.","John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Peter B. Oleksiak - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Can we just talk about the \u2013 are there any drivers in the 3% or down 3% industrial growth here today or just some of the puts and takes there?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Yeah, some of its related to the auto production. There is some retooling as they move over to new models, that's part of it. The other is the steel-related earnings, which we make very little margin on, were down quarter-over-quarter.","John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly, I didn't see mention of the 5% to 7% EPS growth rate, is everything still intact there or is it just kind of lumpy from year-to-year just given the last two strong years?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","We're still on track for 5% to 7% that's the plan.","John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Fishman with Morningstar.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Gerry, I heard the other day that the Senate leadership was talking about putting all four of the nominees forward at the same time, even though only two have gone through committee. Have you heard anything like that or is it even worth wasting time in trying to figure out what's going on in the Senate?","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So I'd say a couple of things without wanting to be too specific. I'd say number one, we're very close to this. We've got not surprisingly many people who are working closely with our senators and with members of the Energy Committee and people close to the whole discussion.","Second, I can tell you that the discussion is very active. So the Senate leadership gets it that there's the country's business waiting to be done as not only these nominees, but other nominees sit out there unconfirmed. So they get it and that has led to very active discussions about deals and approaches that could move things along, hopefully move things along in packages and so forth.","But I guess I would say that the discussions are fluid, and I'm not going to try to be overly specific in terms of how it might play out. I think we've got to leave that to McConnell, Schumer and company. But hopefully I guess the last thing I'd say is, you'd be concerned if there was kind of radio silence on the other side as they dealt with some of the big issues that they're dealing with. That's not the case. Now the discussions are very active on this, and there's a lot of interest in getting this done, hopefully. And I think there is hope that that would be before the August recess, but if not quickly, after they come back in early September.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. That's a pretty fair answer. Thank you. That's all I had.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Good morning.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I wanted to go back \u2013 good morning. I wanted to go back to NEXUS. I know, you've already answered a number of questions about it. But is there any take away for NEXUS from what's going on with Rover?","I mean, I understand that there are delays on that pipeline, but it seems like a shipper might feel a little bit relieved that the delays are happening, because they actually don't have enough gas to feed in that pipe. I mean, is this the same phenomenon for NEXUS, and how do you think about the project if you were not to sign any additional contracts besides what you already have?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","So, we're very aware of \u2013 this is Jerry Norcia, very aware of the technical issues that Rover is experiencing. What I will tell you that Enbridge\/Spectra and ourselves have been involved in many pipeline projects and have a tremendous amount of experience in building pipelines, and we feel that we'll proceed in a way that's environmentally responsible and follow best practices in the industry.","So, we have not in our past experienced these types of problems, and we don't expect to experience any of them on this pipeline either \u2013 our pipeline.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","That addresses any construction issues. But I'm asking more about contracting concerns, simply given that the drilling activities actually not that intense around the area?","Jerry Norcia - DTE Energy Co.","So we've got \u2013 our current commitments are underpinned 50% by LDCs, so it's a demand-pull, and our LDCs are actively in the region looking to secure supply. We have not had any issues in that regard. The other half of our commitments is from producers, and as we converse with our producers, they are prepared when we go into service to build the pipe.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","So we're not seeing issues on that front. I mean, you really asked two questions. Construction, and Jerry said, look, we built a lot of pipes in the past and we are planning to do it the right way. We're planning to do it in an environmentally responsible, well-planned way.","And on production, they're going to put drilling activity in place when they need to, to meet their commitments on the pipe. They're not going to let a commitment on a pipe sit empty. So we are in active discussions. They plan to do that. And as Jerry said, we and the Canadian utilities are in active discussions to secure supply to fulfill our commitments and that's going well too.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And that is all the questions we have. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gerry Anderson for any closing or additional remarks.","Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.","I'll just close the way I opened, which is to say the year is off to a really good start, halfway through, increasing guidance by $0.11. And as I said, I feel very good about our ability to meet that and our ability to continue the pattern of the 5% to 7% earnings growth that we've demonstrated, and we look forward to doing that for you.","Thanks very much for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you soon.","Operator","And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"8016":["DTE Energy Co.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the conference over to Barb Tuckfield. Please go ahead.","Barbara Tuckfield - Director - Investor Relations","Thank you, Stephie and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind you to read the Safe Harbor statement on page two of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earning which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating cost provided in the appendix of today's presentation. With us this morning are Gerry Anderson, our Chairman and CEO; Jerry Norcia, our President and COO; and Peter Oleksiak, our Senior Vice President and CFO. We also have members of the management team with us to call on during the Q&A session.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gerry to start this morning's call.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Barb, and good morning, everybody. Thanks very much for joining us. I'm going to start with an overview of our results in the second quarter, as well as some key developments of the company over the past quarter. Then, I'm going to turn things over to Peter for a financial update. Then we'll wrap up and take some Q&A.","So moving on to slide five, we continue to make good progress on a number of fronts this year. So with a successful first half of the year under our belt, I feel really good about our year-to-date financial results. And based upon those strong results, we're increasing our operating earnings per share guidance. We'll talk a bit more about that in a minute. We also recently increased our dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which continues the over 100-year history of issuing dividends as a company.","Rachael Eubanks was appointed by Governor Snyder to serve the remainder of John Quackenbush's six-year term that expires about a year from now, July 2, 2017. Her experience is in the area of finance, so it includes project finance, municipal bond refinancing, credit-enhanced financing, variable and auction rate transactions and so forth. She also, over her career, has provided investment banking support on financial advisory and investment engagements for state government, government authorities, municipalities and non-profit organizations.","So as we look forward in Michigan to a really heavy period of investment in our infrastructure, I think that her understanding of finance will be a good complement to the skills of the current commissioners. And we certainly will have somebody there who understands cash flows, balance sheet issues and so forth as a company that goes through heavy investment period. Thanks to the hard work of our employees. For the third consecutive year, DTE was ranked second in the Midwest by J.D. Power in overall Electric Residential Customer Satisfaction, that's in the large utility category. And this was our sixth consecutive year of being in the top quartile of that survey.","We also achieved our best safety record in the company's history in the first six months, and that was by a wide margin, which I'm particularly proud of. I think it says something about where our employees' heads are, and if we can keep this performance, we may just be the safest company in the industry this year. And earlier this year, we won our fourth consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award, and our results placed us in the top 12% of companies worldwide in terms of employee engagement. On the NEXUS front, that pipeline continues to progress. The project reached another important regulatory milestone, which sets us up nicely, to meet our in-service fee late next year. So I'll talk a bit more about NEXUS and those developments in a few minutes.","So I'm going to move on to slide six and give you some color on our second quarter financial results. So in the second quarter, we built upon what were really positive first quarter results. We delivered second quarter earnings per share of $0.98, which I feel great about. As you know, we came into this year expecting warm weather, we planned for it, and that played during our first quarter results. And we, based on the first and second quarters, come out of the first half of the year, very well positioned. And we now have the potential to reinvest some of the weather-related favorability that may occur in the third quarter.","We're seeing a hot July. And there's a warm August projected as well. So given the strong results of the first half of the year, we're increasing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.12 from $4.93 to $5.05. And given that, we now have a solid path to achieving our 10th consecutive year of meeting or beating our earnings targets. We've also been growing our dividend along with earnings. And we just recently increased the dividend by $0.16 per share. And our balance sheet continues to be in great shape. So bottom line, I feel really good about our financial position as we head into the second half of 2016.","So moving on to slide seven for a little more color on earnings and dividend. We talked for years to investors about delivering 5% to 6% annual earnings per share growth, and then pairing that with healthy dividend growth. Now, on the right-hand side of the slide, in the ovals, you can see that our actual earnings per share growth over the past five years or so has been 6.5%. So really 1% above that 5% to 6%. And we have grown our dividends at 5% to 6% rate.","I also mentioned a minute ago that we're increasing guidance, from a midpoint of $4.93 to $5.05. Fundamentally, this is driven by a strong performance in our Electric business and in our Gas Storage & Pipelines business, as well as a very solid first half in our Energy Trading operations.","As I stated a minute ago, in keeping with the commitment to grow dividends with earnings, we increased our dividend per share from $2.92 to $3.08, which was a 5.5% increase.","So I'm going to move on to slide eight now, and discuss a significant development related to our power plant fleet that occurred in the second quarter. So in June, we announced closure plans for eight coal-fired-generating units. And this announcement, combined with our decision to cease operation at three coal-fired plants, which happened in April, means that we will replace 11 aging coal-fired generation units at three sites, totaling 2.5 gigawatts, on or before 2023.","Much of this coal baseload generation will be replaced with natural gas generation. But we also intend to continue to invest in wind and solar to ensure that we keep the mix in our portfolio that we want. This portion of what is a longer-term transition plan for our fleet will require about $3 billion of investment. By 2030, we'd expect to retire an additional 1 gigawatt of coal-fired generation, which would bring total retirements to 3.5 gigawatts. And in doing that, our reliance on coal would decline by about 60%. And we'd expect to roughly double our current 10% renewable capacity, and to use more gas-fired generation in a baseload role (8:26). Obviously, emissions through 2030 will be down fundamentally as well. So CO2, we project, would be down about 40% versus 2005 levels, and our conventional emissions would be down sharply as well.","Moving on to slide nine, NEXUS continues to move forward and make good progress. So NEXUS received its FERC Notice of Schedule on May 17 of this year. The project also recently received a favorable Draft Environmental Impact report, or EIS, from the FERC. We expect the final EIS by the end of November. And that would allow for a certificate of construction by the end of February of 2017, which would set us up nicely for the November in service date next year. We're progressing on right of way acquisitions and detailed engineering plans, and we continue to work constructively with FERC and other regulatory agencies.","In addition, in June, we received a letter of support for the NEXUS project from the Michigan Agency for Energy. So the Michigan Agency for Energy takes the lead on energy policy for the administration. We also received a letter of support from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which is the state's primary economic development agency. In addition, a recent Michigan Public Service Commission staff brief on our electric power cost recovery case, that's our fuel cost case, stated, and I quote, staff believes that DTE Electric's participation in the NEXUS pipeline project is reasonable as proposed in DTE Electric's application, its testimony, and its exhibits in this case. So we were gratified to have staff weigh in saying they think this project would benefit customers and benefit the state.","In addition, we had letters of support offered by both Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt, they are the Chairs of the Senate and House Energy Committees. So there's a lot of support in the state of Michigan for this pipeline moving forward. So look, we really believe in the fundamentals of this pipe. It serves arguably the best dry gas production geology in the country. It connects that geology directly to growing markets in Michigan and Ontario. And then, VR Vector pipeline connects into Chicago and Wisconsin as well. The pipe also connects directly to the largest collection of market area storage in the country in Michigan and in Western Ontario. The pipe has three strong utility sponsors, and up to 1.75 Bcf of signed interconnect agreements in Northern Ohio. And the pipe remains on schedule even as many other pipes serving the Utica region struggle with delays. And given this, we continue to think that NEXUS is going to be a valuable addition to our Gas Storage & Pipelines portfolio.","And with that, I am going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to cover our financial results in more details. Peter, over to you.","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with slide 11. Gerry mentioned DTE's operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.98 per share, and for reference, reported earnings were $0.84 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings, please refer to slide 24, in the appendix.","Slide 11 shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by segment starting at the top of the page with the two utilities. Now, we experienced unusual weather this quarter which gave a boost to both utilities. April was colder than normal, while May and June were warmer than normal. Now, this unusual weather in the quarter created both heating and cooling load causing earnings for both utilities to be up quarter-over-quarter. DTE Electric's earnings were $135 million for the second quarter of this year, compared to $111 million last year. Offsetting the weather in last year's rate case, DTE Electric's earnings were lower due to the absence of the revenue decoupling mechanism amortization in 2016.","You may recall, this revenue decoupling amortization was part of our strategy that extended the timeframe in between rate cases by four years. We've increased guidance for this segment given the warm weather through June. A further breakdown of DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter results can be found in the appendix on slide 19. For DTE Gas, earnings for the second quarter were $13 million compared to a loss of $7 million last year. The variance was due to cooler weather in April of this year, increased revenue related to our infrastructure replacement program, and planned initiatives in response to the warm weather we experienced in the first quarter.","As we discussed in our first quarter call, we entered (13:32) the year anticipating warmer than normal weather for the winter, and we planned for it. With this advanced planning, we were able to stay on track to meet guidance. Moving down the page, Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings were $35 million for the quarter. Earnings for the quarter were up $10 million over last year due to higher pipeline and gathering earnings from production that came online in the second half of 2015. We continue to see strength in this segment even in current conditions. We've adjusted the midpoint of guidance upwards for this segment, which I will discuss in a minute.","Moving further down the slide, earnings for our Power & Industrial Projects was $17 million for the quarter, down $1 million from the second quarter last year. This decrease is primarily driven by lower earnings in the steel sector offset by REF volumes from additional projects that came online in the fourth quarter of last year. Earnings for Corporate & Other were negative $23 million for the second quarter of this year, $10 million favorable over last year due to the timing of taxes. So earnings were $177 million for growth segments of the second quarter or $0.98 per share, compared to the $134 million or $0.75 per share last year.","To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, the accounting earnings were zero, down $3 million from the second quarter last year, driven by lower realized power performance. Trading's economic contribution for the second quarter of 2016 was $12 million. Trading is having another strong economic year, or actually $30 million year-to-date economic contribution. A portion of the year-to-date economic performance will flow through the total year operating income results. I will talk more in a minute on the new guidance for our Trading segment. Slide 22 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation showing both economic and accounting performance.","Let me now turn to slide 12 on the EPS guidance for the year. As Gerry Anderson mentioned at the start of the call, based on our financial results in the first half of the year, we are increasing our midpoint of the 2016 EPS guidance by $0.12 from $4.93 to $5.05 for DTE Energy. Our EPS guidance range for DTE Energy is now $4.91 to $5.19 and $4.85 to $5.08 for our growth segments. Our guidance increase for growth segments is driven by strong start to the year at our DTE Electric and Gas Storage & Pipelines segments. The warmer than normal weather continues for the remainder of the summer, we will initiate and invest plan at our DTE Electric to put the incremental revenue in cash back into customer-centric assets and activities.","For our GSP segment, the new drilling plants to Southwestern announced by (16:13) region may provide upside to 2016, and sets us up nicely for 2017. Operating earnings guidance for these segments increased from a midpoint of $592 million to $597 million at DTE Electric, and $110 million to $130 million at the Gas Storage & Pipelines segment. As I just mentioned on the prior page, our DTE Energy's business is off to a strong economic start. We've raised our earnings guidance from zero to a range of $10 million to $20 million up for this year. Energy Trading is not part of our growth segments, and we let the business be opportunistic versus setting a defined operating earnings target.","So we conservatively set the original guidance at zero, and typically update earnings guidance as we set the results for the first two quarters after we (16:56) recover operating cost. Given the strong results in the first half of this year, we are increasing the guidance for Energy Trading. We'll give another guidance update in the third quarter based on economic results for the first three quarters. Moving on to slide 13; in addition to solid earnings results for the year, our cash flow and balance sheet remained strong and will continue to provide the foundation for our long-term growth plans. This slide lays out our cash flow and CapEx to the first half of the year. Cash from operations was $1.3 billion. We saw strong performance across several business units, which is driving the increase over the same period last year, and puts us a little ahead of our plan this year.","We invested $1 billion of CapEx to the second quarter. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business units. DTE Electric CapEx decrease was due to the timing of operational investments, and lower new generation spend with the acquisition of large gas taker (17:52) back in the first quarter of 2015. And now utilities are higher than last year, driven by the timing of projects with particularly in our Gas Storage & Pipelines segment. To fund this CapEx program and refinance maturing debt, we have issued $600 million in long-term debt financing this year. We've been consistent in our messaging over the years that maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority.","Slide 14 provides the key balance sheet metrics we target and monitor, which is FFO to debt and leverage. This slide shows the projected level for each metric. Our 2016 financing plan is on track and we plan to issue up to a $100 million of equity this year. Now, however, given the strong strength of the cash flows we have experienced to-date, we are looking at the possibility of deferring equity issuance in the next two years. Our three-year projected equity needs remain at the $200 million to $300 million level, which is just a small fraction of the total capital spend over that timeframe. Our disciplined approach to maintaining a strong balance sheet across the years has proven to be valuable. It sets us up nicely as we enter a period of incremental infrastructure improvements, and investments at our utilities, and funding the growth plans at our nine utility businesses.","Let me wrap-up on slide 16, and then we can move to questions-and-answers. We've had a very good quarter as well as the first half of the year. We are able to upgrade (19:17) our EPS guidance, setting up nicely to extend our streak to 10 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our initial EPS guidance. This will be the 7th consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. This quarter, we announced coal plant retirements that will bring cleaner energy to our customers and considerable investments to our Electric utility. Maintaining a strong balance sheet will allow us to invest in the utilities and pursue growth opportunities at our nine utility businesses.","Before I open up to Q&A, our call would not be complete without a quick update on my hometown Detroit Tigers. The good news is that we won 50 games so far this year. The bad news is that we've lost about as many games as well. Justin Verlander is looking better recently, actually won last night in Boston, but Miguel Cabrera's bat needs to heat up for us to have a chance. So a lot of season left, so I'm remaining optimistic.","With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. So Stephie, you can open the lines up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you. We will now take our first question from Michael Weinstein (20:48) from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hey. Go Tigers. Good morning.","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","First question is about the $3 billion of additional investment from the retirement of coal generation by 2023. That's correct?","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The timeframe \u2013 so we're going to work through (21:11) process and work through, with our regulators, the phasing of both the retirements and the investment, but we do expect that to play out by 2023. Yes.","Unknown Speaker","Is that part of the $18 billion that you had previously announced for 10 years?","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. So that number of $18 billion doesn't change?","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And on NEXUS, I just wanted to \u2013 I think you mentioned this, but could you reiterate the level of interconnect agreements versus the capacity of the pipeline, and also how those interconnect agreements are being converted over to full contracts?","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The pipeline is 1.5 Bcf, and the interconnect agreements are 1.75 Bcf. Those interconnects are independent of what we already have contracted on the pipeline (22:00). Maybe I'll hand it over to Jerry Norcia to talk about \u2013 probably the process and timing for converting those to contracts.","Gerardo Norcia - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. Thanks, Gerry. So right now, the pipe is two-thirds full, and the environment, as we see it, is starting to improve significantly in that region, in the production region that NEXUS serves our gas pipes (22:21). So we're seeing renewed interest in terms of discussions from the producers, as well as, we're progressing a series of conversations along the pipeline in Ohio and in Michigan and other markets \u2013 in Ontario, as well as other parts of the Midwest, where customers are interested in (22:43) capacity. So we're confident that by the time the pipe goes into service, we will have more market commitment for this pipe (22:50).","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks. And now, hey, one last question. You're going to \u2013 you mentioned that you might push off the equity raise this year, but I noticed in the guidance, the share count isn't different. That's obviously just for convention, or...?","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. We are still planning on the $100 million, but we're really monitoring that the summer regular the (23:14) weather, we get additional revenue, also the cash flow is coming into the year. So we are looking at potentially deferring it, the material right now does reflect the $100 million (23:23).","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thank you very much.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So just on the NEXUS, the additional conversations you're sort of having in the Midwest, can you just maybe disclose whether that's with shippers or additional LDC or electric demand?","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I guess, primarily with other LDCs.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(24:00) Ohio also involves power producers as well.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And it's too early to figure out whether this thing can be upsized to a little over 2 Bcf?","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Correct.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That will be later. I think step one is, bring it in, get it well contracted for current capacity. And step two then is to take on expansions. And expansions, as we've talked in the past, they always bring good economic value.","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","One of the things that we're finding, that I'll add, is the \u2013 a lot of the pipelines that are greenfield pipelines, that are proposing to take gas out of this region, are facing significant delays and oppositions. And right now, our pipe is not faced with that. So we feel that we may be one of the first greenfield pipes to the market.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then, just on the coal retirements; is there any more upside to that retirement, because even if you shift to the latter part of the decade, you'll still have a little over 3.5 gigawatts of coal, or is that sort of you see that envision within the portfolio?","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So by the end of 2030, I think we'll have everything retired at our Monroe plant. The Monroe plant is the one plant that we invested in scrubbers and SCRs. It's a big plant, it's 3,000 megawatts. But that will be what remains, and essentially all the other coal will be retired and replaced through that plan of renewables and gas that I described.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, on the growth trajectory, on the earnings standpoint, how should we think about it off the higher base of $5.05? Is it sort of supportive? Are you comfortable at 5% to 6% growth off of $5.05, or still within that $4.93 is the base?","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We're indicating at this point it's off the original guidance. We'll continue to assess 2017 and beyond. But at this point, it's off the original guidance.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So that's been pretty much our pattern, is that our original guidance, if we exceed, we grow earnings off the original guidance than the prior year. But I guess, I'd just keep pulling you back to actual performance, which has been 6.5%. So I think, our pattern is pretty well established at this point.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Solid results. Congrats.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from Neel Mitra from Tudor Securities. Please go ahead.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Neel.","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Neel.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I had another question on the NEXUS pipeline. You expressed that there had been a lot of support from Michigan, (26:48) Attorney General come out with some opposition. Can you just remind us the process? Does the commission ultimately have to rule on the utility contracts, and when would that be?","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let me comment on the Attorney General first. If you watch sort of energy discussions and dynamics in Michigan, our rate cases and most things, it gets filed around energy. There's usually a challenge of some sort or another, put out by the Attorney General. You just need to understand whether or not the challenge really is fundamental. But it's still \u2013 that's just the way of saying not unusual or surprised (27:32) dynamics. Don, maybe you can talk about timeframe for inclusion. Don Stanczak is here with us. He heads our Regulatory Affairs. He can talk about how the inclusion of NEXUS would play out at the utility (27:46).","Don M. Stanczak - Vice President-Regulatory Affairs","So as Gerry indicated in his comments earlier, we've already put NEXUS in our PSCR cost recovery plan. I think it covers a five-year period, and of course, the first cost will actually incur within (28:02) 2017. So the real key will be our PSCR plan in 2017 and the reconciliation where we actually get recovery of those costs.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And that was a case being reviewed, that I quoted from earlier, where the staff was (28:20) their comments.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then my second question. Could you just generally comment on what's going on in the Power & Industrial segment? Is it seasonality, because right now, I guess, you're at $38 million of earnings versus $90 million to $100 million for the full-year, and then in the presentation, you commented on maybe some weaker steel offset by more positive REF earnings?","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Neel, there's two dynamics happening. Now, one of them you mentioned was the seasonality that will occur with our REF units, actually the first quarter with a little bit lower volumes given the warm weather, winter we're seeing actually reverse coming here in the summer with a hot weather we're experiencing. (29:08) there is back-end loading that will occur with our REF units. We did have some planned maintenance outages. We have wood waste renewable plant so that those planned outages did occur this year in the second quarter. So there is seasonality related to those earnings as well for the planned maintenance outages. We came into the year understanding the depressed steel market (29:32) into plan, and the onset was the REF units, and the volume related to REF, and that's playing out as designed.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I guess, one comment would be that, just as in the E&P sector, you're beginning to feel the turn there. Same in steel, that there you're beginning to feel the turn in the steel sector. So I think it begins to bode well for 2017 and 2018 as that sector gets some win behind it.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations on a solid quarter.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just kind of pick up at DTE Gas. Just wondering how much of that is kind of leaning out the business in response to the first quarter?","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It is. It is basically all of that. You look at the year-to-date results, year-over-year they're relatively flat. We knew going into the year, we're going to have a warm first quarter that did play out, and we plan for the rest of the year to make it up. And the second quarter, the O&M levels, in particular, were down quite a bit that helped offset those first quarter earnings. One thing we're looking at right now given the strength in our Electric utility, and we always like to manage typically on combined utility bases that we essentially will start investing back into the gas utility and getting those O&M levels back to normal levels.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So if we look for the balance of the year at gas, as far as O&M, have you caught up kind of where you want to be?","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We still have some investment we're going to making for the balance of the year. We are still committed to the guidance range as well for that segment.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then, if you were to expand NEXUS from 1.5 Bcf to 2 Bcf, that's just incremental compression. What would that involve and what's the capital opportunity?","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jerry, you want to take that?","Gerardo Norcia - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. It would involve, to get to 2 Bcf a day, would involve some compression and some looping (31:41) on the 36-inch pipe.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And any sense of the capital?","Gerardo Norcia - President & Chief Operating Officer","Not yet. That's something that we haven't worked out quite yet. We're trying to get to the 1.5 Bcf first, and then, I think, we'll quickly move to that 1.75 Bcf once the pipeline gets built, and people starts to get interested in more economic expansions.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then lastly, is there anything going on behind the scenes in Lansing with regards to energy policy and legislation?","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we continue to work this summer with some of the principles. I think what's likely come fall is that there will be activity again in the Senate. Kind of running out of time there with all the dynamics in the legislature between plants and roads and Detroit schools and things. So I think, there will be activity in the Senate. And then there'll be a chance that something could get passed in the Senate in the session in September, but we'll see. And then, I think, everybody will watch the election, and see what the election dynamics mean for the Michigan legislature, with the possibility that we would pick back up and pass legislation in the lame duck session at the end of the year. So if legislation is going to pass this year, would be in the lame duck. I guess I'd keep reminding folks that this is not so much a financial discussion, in fact it's not a financial discussion, really doesn't affect our five-year plan. But it is an energy reliability discussion. And at some point or another, we need to get \u2013 we need to be clear on who is building power plants for 10% of the market, and right now the answer is, nobody. And until we get policy in place that ensures that somebody does it, there's risk of reliability issues for the state. So if it doesn't happen this year, it'll happen at some point when it becomes clear that we need to take care of that.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you for the update.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. The higher guidance for 2016 for the midstream segment, I might have missed this, but can you just explain what's driving that for the full year guidance?","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Some of that \u2013 we are seeing a strong earnings coming across the multiple segments and sub-segments in it, and projects within that. It's tightening the guidance, pulling up that bottom end of the range. So we are seeing strong results for the year, and so we're feeling comfortable now of pulling up that bottom end of the range.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What it doesn't include, Steve, is the increased drilling activity that we now expect. So I think (34:38) for example (34:40) calls, they're now back drilling again. They have been completing ducks (34:45) and they continue that, but we'll be drilling again in our region. And so that has the potential to help with some strength for the balance of the year. But as Peter said earlier, and particularly \u2013 it particularly sets up well for next year.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. But, you noted that it does not include Southwest most recent announcement.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","(35:13) would be upside to this year.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, one of the areas you've talked about for growth at P&I is co-generation. So I'm wondering if there's any update on new opportunities there.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say that the portfolio discussions there on co-generation is as full and interesting as it's been in years. And we don't have one to tell you about that's popped yet, but I think we all feel that, out of that portfolio discussions, we're going to have some that do play through. So we hope to be able to give you a positive update sometime over the next six months.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. We move on to our next question now from Brian Chin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Brian.","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just piggybacking off, the Swinn (36:17) question. Is there a sense of sensitivity that you can give? We've seen how many rig announcements Southwestern has announced over the last few days here. But is there a sense of sensitivity that you might be able to help us calibrate a little bit?","Gerardo Norcia - President & Chief Operating Officer","We've seen two rigs move into the area that we're operating with Southwestern. So that's a very encouraging sign. So our expectation is that they'll continue to complete the ducks, as well as drill new wells with those two rigs.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And when you say sensitivity, you're talking about upside this year and what it means for next year. Is that what I'm hearing?","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That would be helpful. Yes.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think that what we probably ought to do is, let our team get a better sense for kind of the pace of completions, and what we're seeing there put a fence over that (37:10). Maybe we can be clear about what we see in terms of impacts this year and next, maybe on the next call.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then, just going back to the...","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(37:20) I don't think we played it all the way through.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. And then, just going back to the equity issuance question. So you gave a little bit more clarity on the equity issuance thoughts this time. Can you talk about, for the $200 million to $300 million equity issuance for the next two years to three years, should we be marginally shading our thought process on 2017 and 2018 as well, or do you still feel comfortable with the $200 million to $300 million in equity issuance over the next two years to three years?","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'm still feeling comfortable with the $200 million to $300 million in the next two years to three years. It really does relate to the amount of capital spend we're spending at both our utilities and our non-utility business. So (38:05) we really want to maintain the strong balance sheet, thus set us up nicely. It's good even in this period of time having a strong balance sheet, so it's $200 million to $300 million until we see other way.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. As there are no further questions in the queue, I will hand back to the speaker for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We had Gregg Orrill. Did he sign off? We had heard Gregg wanted to come in with a question.","Operator","He removed himself from the queue. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Removed himself. Well, great. Well then, we're out of questions.","Operator","Sorry for that. He just came back. Sorry for that. He just moved back to the queue. I will take his question now if you wish.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pretty good.","Operator","Perfect.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks Gerry.","Operator","(38:59) is open, please.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two quick ones. On the DTE Electric variance analysis for the quarter, there was a negative $8 million around rate base and other. What was that, was that bonus depreciation?","Peter B. Oleksiak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, it's standard actually (39:21) depreciation on the new capital spend come again in property tax (39:27).","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I got it. Okay. And then on the PSCR, when are you looking for the outcome on that? And are there any other \u2013 I guess, we've talked about the drivers in general. Is there anything else that you would point out that's noteworthy there?","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On the PSCR case?","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'll have Don answer that as well in terms of when that will play out.","Don M. Stanczak - Vice President-Regulatory Affairs","So in terms of the timing, I'd expect the commission order later this year, split (39:58) into next year. And again, as Gerry indicated earlier, having support from Michigan Agency for Energy and committee chairs of the legislature, all that bodes well for a good result (40:18).","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've spent a lot of time talking to the Energy committee chairs, the MEDC, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, and the agent, the administration, about NEXUS. So they kind of get how it fits into the gas supply picture here in the state is the state (40:35). Both we and consumers are transitioning off a lot of fuel supply from coal to gas. So they've taken the time to understand it. I think the letters of support, the statements of support are really based upon their belief that this is good for the customers, most importantly good for economic development and the state as well.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Gerard M. Anderson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, with that, we are done with questions.

We are hoping that the summer heats up, so do the Tiger bats and I\u2019m still holding out some hope for a play-off berth.","Unlike the Tigers here at DTE, we certainly have had a successful first half of the year, and I believe we are well positioned to continue the success in the balance of 2015. As all of you saw in our earnings release we are raising our 2015 EPS guidance on strong year-to-date results. Jeff and Mark will be going through the second quarter results in more detail, but before we move onto that, I\u2019d like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights what\u2019s happening at DTE and Michigan.","Slide five provides an overview of our business strategy, and investment thesis. Our growth plans for the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our electric utility growth is driven by environmental spend in the near-term and renewal of our generation fleet and upgrading the distribution system in the longer term.","Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments and the main line pipe replacement. Our two utilities are deploying capital in very -- in a constructive regulatory environment and we\u2019re working hard to earn this constructive environment every day. I\u2019ll be updating you on some of the regulatory proceedings our utilities are currently working through. Complementing our utility growth, our meaningful growth opportunities and our non-utility businesses which provides diversity in earnings and geography. ","Our highly engaged workforce continues to be the key to our success. Last quarter I told you about the third consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award and just recently DTE Energy received the Development by Design Award from the Gallup organization.","The award recognized DTEs focus on creating personnel team and organizational success through employee training programs. So we definitely continue to make strides in our employee engagement efforts. We have a strong focus on continuous improvement and feel we are distinctive in the industry on our approach and outcomes. The combination of these two employee engagement and continuous improvement enables us to deliver both sustainable cost, savings track record and to consistently earn authorised returns at both of our utilities.","We are also very focussed on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe also are distinctive in our industry. We have certainly seen positive results on this front, as currently DTE gas is ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for residential and business customer satisfaction.","And earlier this month, we found out that DTE Electric was ranked second in overall customer satisfaction with electric utility residential customers in J.D. Power\u2019s 2015 study. Our dividend continues to grow as we grow earnings and the goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides about consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.","Slide six provides some highlights of progress in 2015. First in our list is the announcement they will be increasing our operating EPS guidance for this year. We are increasing from an EPS midpoint of 460 to a midpoint of 472; this is driven by a strong performance in our gas storage and pipeline business as well as their energy trading operations. I\u2019ll provide a more detailed overview of guidance in a few minutes.","Keeping in line with our commitment to grow our dividend with earnings we have recently increased our dividend. Our annual dividend per share was increased from $2.76 to $2.92 which is a 5.8% increase.","Regarding Michigan\u2019s Energy policy, I feel there is positive momentum for the constructive legislation by the end of the year. This continues to be a priority of the Governor when he called up publicly the need to get legislation done this year.","Back in March, representative Aric Nesbitt introduced legislation and recently the Senate lead, Mike Nofs introduced legislation but the process is definitely moving along. I\u2019ll touch more on the Energy Policy in a few minutes. I also want to give a quick update on the various rate proceedings for our two utilities.","Our electric utilities self up [Indiscernible] rates on July 1 for the ongoing general rate proceeding. We expect to receive a final order by the end of the year.","We also implemented our new cost of service rates which resulted in a rate reductions for many of our business customers. For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for our expanded infrastructure recovery mechanism that, if approved will allow us to double our annual miles of our main line replacement program. We continue to make significant progress in our non-utility businesses.","In our gas stores and pipeline business, Millennium had a successful open season and we are working through final contracts now. We expect an expansion of greater than 0.2 BCF. In addition, we are constructing a new eight mile lateral off Millennium to serve a proposed 650 megawatts combined cycle plant with approximately a 0.1\/b day of natural gas. These projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is another major milestone that helps firm our future year growth.","The next is pipeline project. It is always moving forward nicely towards its fourth quarter 2017 in service date. The first FERC scoping meetings are complete and were relatively routine. We recently signed a number of Tampa Interconnection agreements that could provide potential aggregate load across northern Ohio upto 1.3 BCF per day. This demonstrates strong market support for the project and also strengthens the longer term earnings potential for the play.","We filed our resource reports in June with a focussed schedule, and our next major milestone will be to file the FERC application in the fourth quarter of this year. We are also now very focussed on optimizing our reduced emissions fuel business. Currently we have REF facilities operating at eight sites and are in a process of relocating underutilized facilities to a ninth site, which should be operational in the fourth quarter.","In addition, in this quarter we are operating a third party REF facility. This operating agreement runs -- will run through 2020. We continue to work towards further optimization of this business line as this has been a great return business for us which has generated significant cash flows to help fund our non utility growth projects.","So you can see, we\u2019ve had a successful first half of the year giving us confidence to reach our earnings goal in 2015. Let me now move to updates in the Michigan improvements and the economy.","Turning to slide seven, we are highlighting the progress the Michigan and the City of Detroit are making. I know many of you are interested in how the local economy is doing and we continue to see economic momentum in the state. Michigan\u2019s unemployment rate in June is 5.5% and this rate has been around 5.5% the last three months roughly in line with the national average.","Michigan\u2019s unemployment rate hasn\u2019t been at this level since 2001. Michigan is identified by the Site Selection magazine that been the seventh most competitive state for job creation as well as the number one state for new manufacturing jobs since 2009.","We continue to see and the other economic indicators including increases in residential customer and business customer accounts and our forecast shows this trend continuing. I do want to highlight the city of Detroit\u2019s economic progress. One indicator that we show on this slide is the Detroit\u2019s Metro area, its\u2019 ranking number eight in the U.S. for a number of new or expansion projects.","The City has come a long way since the bankruptcy and with a strong leadership we have in place I\u2019m confident that the city will continue to move forward. DTE as well as other city partners are working with them to help continue this momentum.","You will see on slide eight that the additional changes in state have taken place as the Michigan Public Service Commission has welcomed Norm Saari as the new commissioner replacing outgoing Commissioner Greg White whose term has ended.","Commissioner Saari has a deep background in public policy and governmental and community affairs, both in state government and direct utility experience. This is Governor\u2019s Synder third appointment and the Governor has been great at talent selection. The Commission has held Michigan regulatory environment Q1 the most constructive in the country. We believe, that Commissioner Saari will continue this supportive environment.","Moving onto slide nine, I\u2019m now going to turn to an update on the energy policy. We have mentioned earlier, Governor Snyder has made it clear that energy policy is an important legislative priority for him this year. He called off the need for legislation in his state address and provided more detailed goals in his energy message in March, highlighting this significant transformation and the generation sources that our state will undertake over the next 10 to 15 years.","And over the last few months, both the House and the Senate and Energy leaderships had introduced proposed legislation to address needed changes in the state. Representative, Aric Nesbitt, who chairs the House Energy Policy Committee introduced legislation in March that\u2019s consistent with the Governor\u2019s goals of reliability and adaptability. He also recommended the elimination of the retail access program we have here in Michigan which we support.","Senator, Mike Nofs, who chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, introduced legislation in June which is also similar to the Governor\u2019s goals. He is recommending to maintain a 10% gap on a retail open access, but with a onetime election to enter into long term capacity commitment with an alternative supplier or to return to the utility.","A customer could choose the return of the utility with three year notice and as the one time permanent election to return to the utility. We expect legislation to be completed this year and we are confident that Michigan has strong leaders in place that understand energy and utility dynamics and will provide constructive legislation for Michigan\u2019s future. All of the proposals on that legislative joint board represent a positive move forward.","In a moment, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff to review the quarter\u2019s results, but before that I want to highlight, provide some highlights of our outlook and guidance increase.","On slide 10, this slide shows our EPS history with our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings evidenced by our recent increase. The chart shows a revised 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.72 as well as our EPS guidance midpoint of $4.66 for growth segments. The 5% to 6% future growth that I mentioned is of a new guidance growth segment -- point of $4.66 per share. And our commitment is to grow both earnings and our dividends and we are just doing that.","Let me get into a little more detail on page 11. We are increasing our 2015 EPS guidance range to $4.54 to $4.90 for DTE Energy. This is a $0.12 increase in the midpoint from our prior range of $4.48 to $4.72. Our EPS guidance range for growth segments is now $4.54 to $4.78. Our guidance increase is driven by strong start of the year in our gas stores and pipeline segment with increased pipeline and gathering earnings.","2015 operating earnings guidance for this segment has increased from a range of $80 million to $88 million to a range of $90 million to $98 million. The majority of this increase is due to strong underlying performance in the business and therefore we expect the majority of this favourability to flow into 2016.","For Energy trading business, we\u2019ve raised our guidance, earnings guidance to a range of 0 to $20 million for 2015. Energy Trading is now part of our growth segments and our original guidance is set at zero as we do not rely on this business to achieve our earnings target.","As this year is progressing we are recognizing the strong economic performance and have adjusted our 2015 guidance accordingly. Trading does have seasonality tied to the physical part of its business and those contracts may mostly make money in the first and fourth quarter.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller to provide more details on the second quarter earnings results.","Jeff Jewell","Thanks, Peter and good morning, everyone. I will be discussing quarter to quarter earnings results on page 13 and on page 14; I will review our electric sales in order to provide more insight into what we are experiencing.","Now turning to page 13. For the quarter, DTE Energy\u2019s operating earnings were $137 million or $0.76 per share and for reference our reported earnings were $0.61 per share. You can find a reconciliation of the second quarter reported operating earnings on slide 26.","For the quarter-over-quarter results, our growth segments second quarter operating earnings in 2015 were lower by $4million or $0.03 per share. The electric segment was lower by $18 million. This was primarily due to increased costs associated with rate base growth cost and unfavourable weather partially offset by lower O&M.","The gas segment was lower by $3 million, driven by unfavourable weather in the second quarter of 2015. Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings were $7 million above the prior year. This increase was primarily due the volume growth in the Bluestone Pipeline and Gathering Assets.","Our power and industrial project segment was up $5 million versus 2014. Quarter-over-quarter favourability was primarily driven by strong performance across the business line. Our corporate and other segment came in favorable by $5 million versus last year. This variance is mainly due tax related timing differences. The overall growth segment results for the quarter were $134 million or $0.75 per share.","At energy trading, operating results for the quarter came in at a positive $3 million with economic net income of $19 million, both the power and the gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to page 24 of the appendix to review the energy trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.","Now let\u2019s turn to page 14 to discuss our electric sales results. For the first half of the year, temperature normalized electric sales were down 0.7%. We are very encouraged by the drivers of this change year-to-date and for the future. This net change reflects both the underlying economic growth in all sectors and that energy efficiency is making positive impacts to reduce customer average usage.","The economic increases are being driven by population growth, occupancy rate strength, income growth and manufacturing at auto production levels that have surpassed pre recession levels.","Energy efficiency which is producing positive results for our customers is a key component of our overall operational and financial plans and a key priority for the Governor. This efficiency translates into reductions in the average energy bill for our residential customers, which is one of the key components of our long term strategy to create affordability headroom as we embark on a very intensive capital investment program.","Therefore we are changing our sales forecast as we anticipate our load growth over the next few years to be close to flat as underlying economic growth and energy efficiency play off.","That concludes the update on our earnings and sales for the quarter. I\u2019d like to now turn the discussion over to Mark, who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics.","Mark Rolling","Thanks, Jeff and good morning to everyone on the call. In addition to the solid earnings results that Jeff just described, we delivered solid cash flow and capital investments for the first half of the year as well. And all of that is underpinned by the strength of our balance sheet ","Slide 16 lays out our cash flows and CapEx through the first half of the year. Cash from operations is $1.2 billion which is up slightly over last year and in line with our plan. We saw a strong cash flow performance throughout all the business units and are reaffirming our full year cash from operations guidance of $1.7 billion.","We invested $1.1 billion of CapEx in the first half of the year, and on the right side of the page you can see the breakout by business unit. DTE Electric is higher due primarily to the acquisition of the gas peaker back in the first quarter, partially offset by the timing of wind investments between years. And there are some year-over-year timing differences at our nine utility businesses as well.","The total year-to-date CapEx is on check with our plan and consistent with our full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Finally, to fund this CapEx program and to pay down commercial paper balances, we issued $800 million in loan from debt financing in the first half of the year.","Now I\u2019ll move to slide 17 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. In short, our balance sheet remains strong and we project ending the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. We issued $200 million of equity back in the first quarter which fulfilled our equity needs for the year. And there is no change in our plans to issue $800 million to $900 million of new equity through 2017.","We continue to take advantage of the low interest rates by issuing $300 million of 7-year debt to parent company which is where we fund most investments at our nine utilities. Earlier in the quarter, we met with the rating agencies and they all re-affirmed our current ratings and outlook which demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a strong BBB credit rating.","And lastly, after renewing our credit facility back in April we ended the second quarter with a comfortable $2.2 billion of available liquidity.","And now, I\u2019ll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks Mark. Let me finish the presentation with a quick summary on slide 19 and then we can open the line for questions. We had a very good quarter as well in the first half of the year and we are confident that this year\u2019s performance will allow us to achieve a increased 2015 EPS guidance, increase our annual dividend 5.8% to $2.90 per share keeping our dividend growth in line with earnings. We anticipate successful outcomes this year for both our utility regulatory filings as well as Michigan Energy\u2019s policy reform.","Our balance sheet and cash flow metrics remain strong, and our investments in our utility and non-utility businesses support our target 5% to 6% EPS growth going forward.","I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining our call this morning. And I invite you to join us for our Investor meeting in Detroit on September 28. We have a great line up of speakers for our meeting, and plan to give you insight and to continue the evolution of the Michigan Detroit development and the economic growth that supports our long term plan.","Formal invitations will be delivered in the coming weeks and our business update will be available at the webcast from our investor\u2019s site. Now I\u2019d like to open it up for any questions that you have, so Heather, you can open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien DuMoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning it\u2019s Julien.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Julien.","Julien DuMoulin-Smith","So first, a quick question here on the sale side. Just curious what is the nature of the idling you have alluded to here on the Industrial side just perhaps if you could expand upon what your expectations are there? And then perhaps related to that on the -- in terms of future rate case filings, how are your expectations for lower sales and efficiency driving expectations there as any changes?","Peter Oleksiak","So on the \u2013 for the idling that occurs mainly in our automotive related segments. There are model turnover, so they are creating brand new vehicles and new models and you\u2019ll see that from time to time. That is really what that\u2019s related -- that is really one time in nature and some as if -- that the level of new models that are -- which is great news for our auto companies that are being produced here.","For the energy efficiency, I guess, first I just want to talk about that a little bit. We\u2019re really pleased with the level of energy efficiency in our service territory. And we\u2019ve been really working hard at this over the last five years and I believe we are on the leading edge of some our some [Indiscernible] energy efficiency is special in delivering tools to our customers to save energy.","You recall if you actually saw the March energy addresses the Governor gave, he actually held up his Smartphone and have the DTE inside app there. So we\u2019ve actually kind of correct the code of our AMI technology and how do we deliver that real time to our customers to use yourself.","Even though energy efficiency increases, maybe over time the electric rate overtime but it does lower customer bills, which provides headroom for rate increases needed to cover new capital investments. So, I know your question Julien was what does that do from our rate case strategy?","Our rate case timing really tied to the capital investment we have over and above depreciation, so that\u2019s really going to be tied. It really doesn\u2019t impact the timing of that. And what we are seeing actually when -- that it will provide headroom for us from a total customer ball perspective to give recovery of that new capital investment.","Julien DuMoulin-Smith","Excellent. And just turning to the midstream side quickly. Can you talk about an update on your existing partnerships, specifically on the exit side? And then separately just broadly speaking, strategy as it relates to gathering versus perhaps pipes, etcetera, you have other partnerships and there as well. I would be curious how that is evolving and the nature of the business?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes on the ownership side and I know the private question is around on the Enbridge and the ownership of pipe. So Enbridge is still considering ownership, but they have been very public and very supportive of the pipe. You know our current disclosure assumes the one third ownership, so they don\u2019t participate in whatever larger ownership of a great project. So they are still in the process of considering ownership in the project.","On the gathering side and is evidenced by this year-to-date results and our guidance increase and we\u2019re seeing great results on our gathering business. This is a business that we started in 2012 with a partnership with Southwest energy, so as we\u2019ve been going down our learning curve and cost curve it\u2019s really helped us with that relationship and that\u2019s a business that we liked as well because as we get into new projects like Nexus the idea there is to do a very similar blueprint of what we\u2019re seeing in Millennium now that if you work with producers, get gathering and laterals, that will beat international.","So we\u2019ve continued to look at those opportunities and then I do believe in the future they will be there for us related to NEXUS.","Julien DuMoulin-Smith","Excellent. And sorry, just a clarification. In terms of Enbridge's timeline for a decision, do you have any sense?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. I really don\u2019t \u2013 I know they\u2019ve been public about it. They are mainly an oil based company, an oil pipe, but they are trying to grow their gas piece of the business and they\u2019ve been public around that. But I would imagine they\u2019re going through that process right now and they probably want to maybe making a decision at some point.","Julien DuMoulin-Smith","All right. Well, thank you very much. Congrats again.","Peter Oleksiak","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers","Hey, good morning, guys.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Eggers","On the guidance bump for the quarter and kind of resetting the baseline going forward, what structure are you seeing is giving you more confidence to lift the starting point for growth from here?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. On the midstream we are seeing and mainly within the gathering segment and the drilling related to Southwestern. So what we saw in the first half is that there is some upside. Some of this was acceleration of drilling which is positive as well, because Southwestern is allocating our capital and drilling to this region even with the relatively low gas price environment, most of the increase is tied to the higher well performance. That oil performance in volumes will continue to flow. So that is a permanent increase for us.","And the great thing about this and this is where we talk about our strategies of having these interconnect assets that it really amplifies income. So we\u2019re seeing those volume increases then occur on Bluestone then occurs on the Millennium Pipeline as well. So we\u2019re feeling really comfortable with those volume increases that are tied to the well performance there.","Dan Eggers","So that step-up is what is giving you confidence in the sustainability, it is not an assumption of sustained higher trading value?","Peter Oleksiak","No, no. That\u2019s tied to our midstream segment.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Got it. And then how should we think about what you guys are going to do to be able to earn your ROEs at electric given this lower demand growth or the flat demand growth outlook between rate case periods?","Peter Oleksiak","We will be planning that, so some of that is that we have a forecast that test year here. So we are forecasting and we\u2019ll continue forecast energy efficiency. One of the things we\u2019re looking at right now from a load perspective is that we are anticipating a flat load at this point in time. At one point in time we were anticipating probably 0.5% type of increase, but once again we\u2019re pleased with the results as we\u2019ve been really focus on energy efficiency, so we have upped our energy efficiency. And if you look at the legislation, that is proposed in the governors -- his areas of priority, energy efficiency is going to be a key component as we think to our generation planning and our integrated resource planning process. So we\u2019ll continue to forecast, so we really is getting the right dominator.","Dan Eggers","Just one more, sorry Peter, go ahead.","Peter Oleksiak","I guess the supplement that we have proven track record around cost management as well, but something it will continue to [Indiscernible] between rate proceedings as well.","Dan Eggers","Okay. And then I guess just one more on the NEXUS side. Can you walk through what you are seeing, quantifying the gathering opportunities, how much capital can go into that? And what is the level of interest for incremental projects you are hearing from customers at this point?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. It\u2019s far too early to say what the capital plans will be, but we do see they are out there. There was a recent report that came out that the Utica region reserve forecast has gone up again. So every forecast that\u2019s come out on the Utica Shale it goes higher and higher, so we know that there will be there. And as we\u2019re proving out our gathering business plan in Southwestern that\u2019s really helping us as we\u2019re talking to producers in the region as well. But its too early to say, but I would say that there is a lot of opportunity there and will help as you think through the midstream segment not only in this five-year projection we provided there, but beyond that five-year period gathering will be a piece of that.","Dan Eggers","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza","Just on the Enbridge ownership stake in NEXUS, is there a point when DTE makes a strategic decision to take on the additional ownership? So like the Enbridge ownership has been open for some time, is there sort of a deadline that you have internally within the Company?","Peter Oleksiak","We don\u2019t really have a firm deadline with them and as I mentioned we like them when they are in, if they are in the project and if they\u2019re not. So, its something that we don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not really pushing at this point in time from a \u2013 if they\u2019re not in the project we have a larger percent ownership of a great pipe. If they are in the project, it does from a strategic perspective they have ownership interest in Vector and they have demand that\u2019s off takes on the backend with their LDC, it helps from a long-term strategic perspective, but there is no firm deadline at this point in time for them.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And then as you approach year end with the Open Access Policy, any idea how it\u2019s going to shake out with obviously three different competing proposals?","Peter Oleksiak","Actually I would characterize the proposals as complementary and they are all focusing on the same thing. So, all the proposals on the table are really aimed at eliminating \u2013 there are two major flaws we have right now with the retail access program in Michigan, one of them is free option to move back and forth on utility to retail open access backed utilities, so all of the proposals address that. There is either one-time election to the utility if you\u2019re going out on to the market you need some type of capacity. The range right now is 3 to 5 years in the proposals.","The capacity does address the second flaw we have which is there is a heavy subsidization that\u2019s happening right now with our bundled customers to retail open access. So really does have put in more level fair playing field around that as well. So the economics with the customers on retail access will change and because of they really get into more of the true cost are being on the program. And this permanent, more permanent type of election as well will impact the decision. So it\u2019s really too early to know how much of the 900 megawatts will come back. And if there\u2019s election too come back you know the timing of that return will be tied to individual contracts with those customers.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it, got it. And just one last question on the guidance in Energy Trading, it looks like the top end of the guidance assumes an additional $5 million in earnings. Could we -- is it fair to assume that is sort of a fourth quarter recognition just given the way the segment recognizes earnings historically?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. I would say that, you actually -- from time to time you may experience even a slight loss in the third quarter, because lot of contracts and earnings are tied not to physical fields with gas and power delivery in the first and fourth quartet.","Shahriar Pourreza","Excellent. Congrats. Thanks ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. I have a question with regard to gas service area sales. If you look at the Q2, 2015 numbers versus Q2, 2014 numbers, you had a really big negative swing in residential, commercial, industrial, but then a very positive comp on end user transportation. Is the former just weather driven and what\u2019s the latter being driven by?","Peter Oleksiak","Jeff, do you want to handle that one.","Jeff Jewell","Yes. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s just a combination of -- from the weather, obviously the weather is what driving the quarter over quarter, year-over-year and in the end trend [ph] forward to seeing more volume on that front just from additional load in those things.","Greg Gordon","Okay. That was my only question. Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Tucker with KeyBanc.","Matt Tucker","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just noticed with the revised guidance that you widened the range a little bit, can you just talk about the key sensitivities you had in the second half and what kind of gets you to the high or low end of the range?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. The widening of range, a lot of that is tied with the energy trading segment, now that we do have a range for that, so that\u2019s really what that you tie there. The key sensitivities, for us just continued strong performance. On the utilities, a lot of that will be tied to what\u2019s happening on the weather fronts and then the weather would be load as well as storm related activities. The gas utility as well, there is fourth quarter heating load, some variability that will occur there as well, so the utilities, a lot of it at this point in time is tied to weather and weather-related type of income.","In our non-utilities just continued strong performance. For our midstream segment we have upped guidance for that segment, so we\u2019re comfortable now with that range for our Power and Industrial segment that you look at it from a year to-date perspective. They are roughly $50 million with the top end of guidance at 100, so they continue the performance. We\u2019ve seen in the first half, they potentially could be near the upper end of guidance for that segment.","Matt Tucker","Got it, thanks. And just a follow up to that. I guess we\u2019re about three weeks into July. How has the weather been I guess so far this quarter? And were you able to factor that into the guidance?","Jeff Jewell","Yes. We factor that into the guidance. And so far the first half like Peter mentioned in his opening comments, the first part of July was a little cooler, but then so far here in the last week or so its been above and so we\u2019ll just see how that plays out, but yes, all that\u2019s been contemplated in our guidance.","Matt Tucker","Thanks. And then just on the lower load growth expectations going forward, you\u2019ve kind of addressed this, but just big picture, how does that affect your long-term expectations? And does it affect your earnings guidance for DTE Electric, the long-term earnings guidance you\u2019ve provided and are there kind of offsets that we should be considering?","Peter Oleksiak","Now there\u2019s no impact at all to the earnings guidance for the utility. The utility business at this point and where the money and earnings are tied to with the new capital investment. Power generation replacement strategy we talked about that was on the coal retirement, but also our distribution company. We\u2019re going through a big replacement in upgrading plan. We\u2019re going to sharing some that at our Analyst Day here in September as well.","So the flat load for us and we are relatively modest even to begin with prior to this new change of 0.5% and one thing we\u2019re looking at right now is, and the metric we\u2019re really going to moving towards the total bill. What\u2019s happening with your total bill? The way it works for customers is -- this is power supply cost that is a past-through that goes away when the usage is down, right. We have a base rate increase tied to the distribution investment and charges. The customers are experience decreases in the total bills even when rates are increasing, if their usage is down.","Matt Tucker","And if I could just ask one more. How confident are you that there will be energy policy legislation this year? And are there any kind of key dates we should be thinking about?","Peter Oleksiak","That combination can be with a political process, but I know the governor has been pretty strong around signaling. He wanted to be done by the end of the year, even recently Senator Nofs has been out there publicly saying he wants it done by the end of the year. They are \u2013 so all the signals and momentum is for this to get done at this year.","Matt Tucker","Thanks a lot. That\u2019s all from me.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning everyone.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","First question on retail open access. You touched on this, but I want to ask in a slightly different way. If we take the Nofs proposal at face value, I am sure things will change. But if it were exactly as written, how much of the load do you think would come back and how quickly?","Peter Oleksiak","It\u2019s really too early to determine from the details of that. I would imagine for him, he did have \u2013 you need to \u2013 if you\u2019re going to stay on the program, first of all there\u2019s an election. If you take the election back to utility its one time, so that is this free option going away, we\u2019ll probably have some of the retail open access customers take a pause and wanted to \u2013 whether they return or not. And if they do stay in the program, they\u2019re going to have to get capacity and Nofs proposal I believe was that from a three-year perspective. So each customer has individual economics and the changes through economics. That and coupled with market prices and our sense is that market prices will be increasing as supply, demand and supply tightens as well.","So that\u2019s really I guess round about, Andrew, it\u2019s really too early to say. I can say I would imagine some of the 500 [ph] megawatts, but probably would be coming back given the changes, the structural changes that will be occurring with all the proposals that are out there. And the timing of that, it could be relatively quick, but lot of that will be tied to the individual contracts with these retail open access customers.","Andrew Weisel","And how long do those contracts typically run?","Peter Oleksiak","We don\u2019t really have insight into that.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Fair enough. Next question is on energy efficiency. The new expectations you have for load growth, is that based on the -- again the Nofs proposal, or is that some other DTE view of what energy efficiency programs will look like going forward?","Peter Oleksiak","It is the DTE Energy forecast. Some of that is -- we\u2019ve been working hard at this for five years as I mentioned. In many ways I think, in many cases I said, we\u2019re leading edge. So it is realizing the adoption of these energy efficiency programs. They are occurring even faster which is great for us and our customers. So it really tied to what we\u2019re seeing there and the projecting of that going forward.","Now both, the Nofs and the Nesbitt [ph] proposals versus having a mandate kind of working that and integrating that part of the integrated resource planning process. And the governors that\u2019s really public around energy efficiency. That\u2019s going to be part of our generation planning, will be what level will be covered off and energy efficiency. And as you know even the clean power plan, the EPA requirements gives you credit for energy efficiency.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, great. Then lastly, I know decoupling is something -- electric decoupling is something being floated in these proposal legislations. What are your views on that? And in light of what we just talked about with the load growth forecast, would your preference be for full decoupling or something only for energy efficiency?","Peter Oleksiak","We will work through those details, but I can say broadly that we are supportive of energy decoupling.","Andrew Weisel","Fully or partially?","Peter Oleksiak","We\u2019re still working through that. I\u2019d say that this first I think we\u2019re having some it is as we\u2019re thinking through there\u2019s probably merits to both either one of those different proposals.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Yes. Hi, good morning. Just one other question on the Gas Storage and Pipelines upside. So, you guys typically give kind of like a five-year look on these businesses, and I know you mentioned you expect this to continue into 2016. All else equals, is this something that you see as kind of benefiting the five-year look?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. It definitely helps. I would say firm up that five-year projection.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. When you say firm up, it was still that little bit of -- I guess it was the white part or whatever in the bar chart. Is that what you mean by that?","Peter Oleksiak","We are still going \u2013 we\u2019re in the midst right now where our longer term planning process, we\u2019ll be providing an update at our Analyst Meeting.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then I know going to the P&I business, I think in some meetings we\u2019ve had, you have talked about co-generation being maybe a potential growth area. Any updates on opportunities there?","Peter Oleksiak","No, it really is --we do see if you think through the opportunities set there -- this cogeneration is one, so we continue to work through those opportunities. There are some projects we have in place right now and are getting into service. They\u2019re probably not a lot of updates since the last meeting but we continue to be optimistic on this side and getting the projects for this segment to grow as we indicate in terms of this five-year growth prospects.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Peter Oleksiak","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Peter Oleksiak","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Just a few quick ones following up on the energy efficiency. With the flat growth, how much of this is based on sort of your efforts at energy efficiency? In other words, if we were to take out your efforts of energy efficiency, what would you guys estimate the impact of sales growth to be?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. Without the energy efficiency, it is roughly about -- Jeff, you\u2019d said, about a 0.5% ","Jeff Jewell","Yes.","Peter Oleksiak","We look through and what we\u2019re doing right now. We are in the new era right now with this energy efficiency, because historically you look at your load growth tied directly to economic activity. So we still look at that, but now with the energy efficiency that\u2019s after that. So our customer counts are increasing, so that\u2019s one thing we look at and the overall level activities within the businesses is really the usage that defining [ph].","Paul Patterson","Do you see any difference between an IRP versus the mandate in driving energy efficiency going forward? Those have been two differences in legislations.","Peter Oleksiak","I would say no, because the IRP really that\u2019s going to be like one-stop shop for us. Right now, really the movement is potentially away from these mandates where we have a mandate for RPS or mandate for energy efficiency which is all tied to generation-related spend to have it in one place. So in that IRP process they will discussions and agreements on energy efficiency as well as renewable spend. So I would say it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s really just change the location of where the discussions and the process for the discussions will be occurring.","Paul Patterson","Is there any -- of all the proposals and the legislation that you guys outlined very nicely in the presentation, is there any one that we should think of as being a significant difference in terms of what your earnings outlook would be or would change the -- where you would be in the range if you [Indiscernible]?","Peter Oleksiak","I think they are all are relatively close.","Paul Patterson","Okay.","Peter Oleksiak","Aric Nesbitt has the elimination of retail open access program. We support that the most. But all the proposals are addressing. And probably the one area that I think we\u2019re focus on as you are as well as the retail open access but all the proposals address the unfairness of the current program.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then with NEXUS there have been some suits associated with access for surveying purposes and what have you. Is there -- are those significant events? Or I mean, they seem to be happening in local courts. Are these sort of run of the mill stuff or is there\u2026?","Peter Oleksiak","It is. I think the FERC community meetings and that process is really going well, and so we feel pretty good -- really good about that process and it was relatively routine. A lot of that is really determining the final path of the pipe, so those meetings are necessary and as we finalize that path, it definitely help us as we drive towards our fourth quarter application filing.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just on the Gas Storage and Pipelines, it sounds like you guys were having a very good 2015 but that it may be a little bit of a slowdown in 2016. I don't know if I heard that correctly. Could you just elaborate that? That was in your prepared remarks. I just wanted to understand what the outlook is going forward with Gas Storage and Pipelines?","Peter Oleksiak","It is and what I have indicated is that we\u2019re seeing the first half of the year increase in our gathering and pipeline business that a majority of that will flow through. Some of that is acceleration of drilling which is also positive to the Southwest and is really resourcing and allocating drilling resources here in the region. But we have our new growth segment, our EPS midpoint we are now saying we\u2019re going to grow 5% to 6% off of that, so we\u2026","Paul Patterson","Okay. Okay, so although -- so in other words, generally speaking obviously you guys feel very confident in raising your guidance and also your growth rate. And we shouldn't think about anything I guess materially sort of dragging -- in other words it doesn't seem like -- you are not pulling anything from 2016 into 2015 that is going to affect your long-term growth rate, is that the way to think about it?","Peter Oleksiak","Yes. The growth rate is off our new growth segment guidance midpoint. So as we took a look at that 2016 and what we\u2019re seeing here in the midstream segment as overall what was happening in the businesses and we were feeling comfortable and confident of not only raising the midpoint of guidance this year, but saying their 5% to 6% will be on that new growth segment.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn it back over to our speakers for any additional for closing remarks.","Peter Oleksiak","Once again, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. And if you all could say \u2013 and I\u2019m trying to root on my Tigers a little bit, I would appreciate that. And also want to once again remind you on September 28 we have our event here in Detroit. So if you can kind of save that date, and look forward to seeing you there. Have a good day.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation."]}}
