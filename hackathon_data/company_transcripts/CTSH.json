All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer of Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasurer","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2015 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com.","The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This was a tremendous quarter. In fact, in dollar terms we have the strongest sequential revenue growth in our history, exceeding both our expectations and our guidance. This comes on the heels of strong performance in Q1. We have got a great portfolio of offerings, and as a result, we're seeing robust demand for services, a trend that has continued to accelerate from the first quarter. Our Q2 revenue was $3.09 billion, up 6% or $174 million over Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.2% slightly exceeded our targeted range of 19% to 20%.","Similar to Q1, we saw very robust underlying demand across the geographies and industries that we serve. Our pace of hiring throughout 2014 and during the first quarter of 2015 ensures that we were prepared to capture this demand as it emerged. This was a clear reflection of the strength of our business model that enables us to make investments in anticipation of evolving demand. I'm pleased to say that we are increasing our full year revenue guidance for the second time this year to at least $12.33 billion and our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to at least $3. Our performance in the first half of this year gives us strong confidence in this guidance despite the restructuring of our contract with Health Net.","The underlying drivers of our revenue growth in Q2 remain consistent with the trends that we've seen in prior quarters. As we've said before, market dynamics are creating a dual mandate whereby clients continue to push hard for operational efficiency while driving digital transformation and innovation at scale.","Our run better\/run different value proposition continues to resonate well with clients, and as a result, demand for our services remains strong. Dual mandate is also driving a fundamental change in the way IT and operations budgets are allocated. Clients are recalibrating their spending, moving dollars from lights on maintenance and operations projects to new digital initiatives. This shift is good for us because we're in a strong position to capture the enormous opportunities that are emerging from the transition to digital business. To grow our investments in new solutions and services, we're enabling clients to enhance efficiencies and productivity while simultaneously reimagining their businesses and building new capabilities to succeed in the digital era.","To fully address the run better\/run different needs of our clients, we're investing in four key areas. First, we are enabling our clients to be best-in-class when it comes to running and operating their core systems and business processes. As such, we're constantly optimizing our traditional services as well as investing in new services to enable clients to achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. We are doing this by finding new ways to simplify and automate clients' core processes, IT applications, and IT infrastructure. Across our applications Infrastructure and Business Process Services, we are creating new delivery models such a shared services and industry utilities. To help us enhance these delivery models, we're deploying automated software engineering, artificial intelligence, and other tools for advanced automation. Our home grown automation tools like ad pod and automatica (4:58) combined with tools that we obtained from the acquisition of TriZetto placed us in a strong competitive position to deliver these new models.","The second area where we're investing is in capabilities that enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. As digital technologies become mainstream, organizations must continuously innovate to deploy these technologies to drive market differentiation and performance. For Cognizant, digital is more than just technology. Digital for us means the ability to connect technology, data science, devices, design, and business strategy to change a business process or a customer experience. And given the pace of technology change, our clients not only want single point digital solutions, but have a need to innovate on a continuous basis and make innovation a part of the organization's DNA, what we refer to as innovation at scale. Cognizant is among the few companies that can provide comprehensive digital innovation at an enterprise scale. We do this with our Cognizant Digital Works accelerated methodology which is comprised of three elements.","The first is the Digital Works' idea lab where we work with clients to create an approach to imagine the digital future of a business process or a customer experience and to identify a series of specific digital opportunities or ideas based on their vision of the future. Once the ideas have been prioritized, the second step is to design and prototype specific digital solutions in our Digital Works' laboratory which is a physical space where Cognizant works directly with clients to bring together designers, strategists, and technologists to visualize, plan, and prototype the new digital initiatives.","And finally, in the Digital Works foundry, we work with clients to scale up their digital initiatives by re-architecting legacy environments, connecting new solutions to existing systems, and creating supporting capabilities in areas like rapid software engineering and security, which are necessary to bring digital ideas to enterprise scale. We find that our integrated Digital Works approach combining design, strategy, technology and industry expertise, coupled with the physical space for co-innovation plays to our strengths and is distinctive in the market.","Our third area of investment is in our consulting practice, which is an integral part of our value proposition. Cognizant Business Consulting continues to take a lead role in many of our transformation engagements by helping architect solutions and drive ongoing change management to ensure success in our clients' businesses. Our consultants bring tremendous expertise in industries and functional areas, and we continue to build on that strength. In addition, our consulting practice is deeply integrated with our technology capability and our Business Process Services. Across clients' business, technology and operating model transformations, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as IT, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, programming change management, and process redesign.","Our fourth key area of investment is platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new efficiency frontiers and at the same time deploy digital technologies more quickly. We've spoken to you in the past about the trend we've seen towards newer as a service utility models and platform-based solutions which distribute fixed cost across multiple customers in an industry. These models not only drive efficiency but can also enable enterprises to run differently by deploying digital technologies enabling more rapid time-to-value.","With that summary of our four key areas of investment, let me close by saying that our willingness to invest in and explore new commercial models make bold decisions about investing early in new technologies and our recognized strong leadership has provided us a solid foundation and a strong platform for growth. Given Cognizant's strong entrepreneurial culture and our ability to adapt to change, I'm confident that we're well-positioned for the next phase of our journey.","I'll hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance, and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return later for Q&A. Over to you, Gordon.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Thank you, Francisco. We're very pleased with our performance for the first half of 2015. As Francisco said, we have been well-positioned to take advantage of a strong underlying demand environment. The mix of services and capabilities within our portfolio enable us to benefit from the current shifts in clients' spending priorities. As noted previously, clients are focused on driving efficiency of operations and on driving down their cost of operations, in order to remain competitive and to fund their digital transformations.","Let me now provide some more context on performance within our individual industry practices. Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 7.7% sequentially, and 18.1% year-over-year, driven by strength in both banking and insurance. Within banking, growth was broad-based across our clients, who remain focused on cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance, and cyber security. In addition, there is an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service.","Within insurance, we continue to see strong demand for solutions which help transform both the claims and underwriting processes, delivering both greater efficiencies and improved customer service. For example, during Q2, Cognizant helped a leading U.K. bank to conceptualize, design, and build an innovative new solution for its mortgage business. This engagement involved creating new digital channels for mortgage processing by intermediaries. The end result was a significant increase in the volume of business from brokers, and as much as a 75% reduction in the time it takes for new broker on-boarding.","Our healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, grew 2.1% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase includes the impact of TriZetto. As the healthcare landscape is changing rapidly, we continue to see our payer clients take a cautious approach to spending. An increased focus on medical cost, consumerization, and a changing regulatory environment is driving consolidation, as well as an ongoing search for solutions that fundamentally change the business model and economics of healthcare management. Given our prominence in the healthcare industry and long history of helping healthcare clients during times of consolidation, we believe that we're well-positioned to partner with our clients as they navigate these transitions.","An example of industry consolidation is the proposed acquisition of Health Net by Centene announced in early July. As a result of the acquisition, we do not expect that the seven-year master service agreement with Health Net covering end-to-end administrative services will be implemented. However, with our existing relationship extended through 2020, we're pleased to say that Cognizant will remain a key strategic technology and operations partner to Health Net. In addition, we negotiated the right to license from Health Net certain intellectual property. We expect to leverage that IP, along with TriZetto software and Cognizant's assets, to continue to drive our platform-based solutions.","Moving on to our life sciences business, we continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals leveraging cloud technologies and platforms. Luminous, a world leader in medical devices, deployed Cognizant's proprietary platform MedVantage, a cloud-based, integrated, complaint management solution that we built on the Force.com platform. By seamlessly integrating with Luminous's existing salesforce.com infrastructure, MedVantage enables Luminous to provide its stakeholders improved service, efficiency, and reporting. The MedVantage platform is a good example of how we closely collaborate and work with cloud-based providers to enhance functionality.","Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 5.4% sequentially and 12.4% year-over-year. We continue to see an improving demand environment, particularly around modernizing supply chains, as well as driving digital and multichannel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing and logistics side, we're working with a major auto manufacturer to integrate Apple Watch and other wearables into their vehicles, providing better analytics and insight, and ultimately driving a better customer experience.","In designing this solution, we brought together our multidisciplinary capabilities, including product engineering, embedded systems and Internet of Things, as well as analytics for enhanced customer experience. Another example is the work we're doing for one of India's leading engineering conglomerates to modernize its technology landscape and help digitally transform its businesses to deliver innovative products, provide superior customer service, and drive growth. This is a good example of how we've leveraged our global expertise to penetrate new markets and drive new areas of growth. Our other segment, which includes high-tech communications, information, media and entertainment clients, was up 11.5% sequentially and 20.3% year-over-year, driven by strong demand across all areas.","Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the market traction we're seeing across all three service lines: Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services, and Cognizant Business Process Services. Each of these grew faster than the company average. As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. Today, in approximately 70% of consulting deals, CBC competes primarily against Tier 1 global consulting firms. In addition to standalone consulting engagements, CBC today leads many of our transformation deals, helping architect the deals, reengineer processes, and drive change management in our clients' businesses.","Reflecting our growing strength in consulting, Cognizant was recently named a leader in the Forrester Wave Business Transformation Consultancies report. Cognizant is one of just five global companies to be named a leader. We were recognized for the investments made in high-quality assets for large-scale business transformations, including building up software and other reusable assets that position us to exploit the long-term trend towards asset-based consulting.","Cognizant Business Process Services, or BPS, saw a continued success during the quarter, led by work in insurance, healthcare ,and financial services. Outsourcing of business processes is a crucial component of bringing operational efficiencies to our clients and increasing technology and automation and increasingly, technology and automation are an integral part of the solution. Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see robust growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations, and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, this is being delivered by combining applications and infrastructure, and enabled by newer technologies such as the hybrid cloud.","From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.8% sequentially and 25.7% year-over-year. Our European operations recorded strong growth. Compared to the first quarter, revenue from Europe was up 5.5% sequentially while the U.K. grew 4.4%. Continental Europe grew 7.3% sequentially. Despite recent macro headlines, our pipeline in Europe continues to be strong.","Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the Rest of World, which was up 10.7% sequentially. Growth was driven primarily by strength in markets such as India and Australia. For the second quarter, we were successful in growing our revenue by a record $174 million sequentially while keeping our global head count essentially flat. During 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, we hired aggressively. We did this hiring as well as significant workforce retraining to ensure that we would be ahead of the curve in having the right skills and resources in place to meet the growing demand \u2013 client demand for digital transformation. These investments have clearly positioned us to capitalize on the surge in demand environment leading to record revenue growth for the second quarter.","After the staffing investments in 2014 and Q1 of this year, totaling approximately 46,000 net additions, we have the opportunity to drive utilization back up to a more appropriate level while meeting client demand and we moved well down this path during the second quarter. This has freed up dollars to fund our annual compensation increments and key investments in our business while meeting our margin commitments we have set for our shareholders.","While attrition is historically seasonally higher in the second quarter due to the timing of bonus payouts and associates leaving for higher education, second quarter annualized attrition this year at 19% was higher than normal. Although higher attrition was an industry-wide phenomenon this quarter, we are working to improve our retention levels through a number of employee engagement initiatives. Due to our industry-leading growth, we know that we provide career opportunities that most others simply cannot. As we have transitioned more towards digital services these past few years, we've been working with our employees to provide clear career paths and role expectations as well as re-skilling our people for the next generation of demand.","We are implementing programs to ensure that we will have a highly motivated and engaged workforce who share in our success and understand the tremendous career opportunities that we offer. Over time, we're confident that our attrition numbers will trend down towards more historic levels. We're pleased with the strength of our performance across industries, service lines, and geographies that we serve during the second quarter.","With that, let me have Karen now provide more color on the financial details of the strong performance.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $3.09 billion represented growth of 6% sequentially and 22.6% year-over-year. While currencies were relatively stable on a sequential basis, on a year-over-year basis, we had a $75 million, or 300-basis-point negative impact to revenue growth due to currency. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related expenses, was 20.2%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb wage inflation and promotions that take effect in Q3 while still being able to continue to invest in the business. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.79 exceeded guidance by $0.07. The Q2 tax rate was lower than anticipated due to the favorable settlement of a discrete tax item during the quarter.","Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57% and 43% of revenue respectively for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were up 3% sequentially and grew 9% from Q2 a year ago. During Q2, we saw continuation of the trends that we have seen in recent quarters whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards discretionary spending, including digital and other transformational projects. During the second quarter, 35% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 285.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for a total cost of approximately $153 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 38 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.4 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $600 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count remained unchanged at 613.9 million shares in the quarter. Total receivables were $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 71.9 days. This is down from 73 days in Q1. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $387 million, down slightly from $388 million at the end of Q1.","We built approximately 50% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.57 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $217 million from the quarter ending March 31, and down by approximately $563 million from the year-ago period. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, including $100 million outstanding on our revolver. Operating activities generated approximately $456 million. Financing activities were approximately $149 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were approximately $76 million during the quarter.","Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics. During the quarter, we added approximately 300 net employees and we ended the quarter with approximately 218,000 employees globally. Approximately 204,000 of our employees were service delivery staff. As expected, utilization was up on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization increased by almost 300 basis points to approximately 73%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 78% and on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the robust demand environment and the strong over-performance during quarter two in spite of the anticipated loss of $100 million in incremental revenue from Health Net. We are revising our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.33 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 20.1% over 2014. This does anticipate slower growth in the second half of this year to cover additional downside risk or disruption due to potential M&A activity amongst our clients.","Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.14 billion. During the third quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Due to the impact of wage increases and promotions, which are effective in Q3, we would not expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be above this range for the remainder of the year. For Q3, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.75. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, and acquisition related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.9 million shares, and a tax rate of approximately 26%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.07 to at least $3. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.2%.","Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Nice job on the quarter. Just want to touch first on the overall upside to guidance in the quarter. Obviously, it was pretty strong. The guidance raise came despite Health Net again. So just when we look at the overall guidance, can you walk through some of the drivers and strengths specifically what actually drove the beat for the quarter? And I understand, Karen, you mentioned second half a little bit slower trend, but are there actually any deals you see happening besides Health Net that would impact that?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Hi, Darrin. This is Gordon. So for the quarter, the upside was very broad-based. It wasn't one customer, it wasn't one industry. The common theme, it was more on the discretionary and innovation and digital side, so if you think about our traditional outsourcing business versus our consulting technology business, it's clearly more on the innovation side. When we look at the rest of the year, obviously, we had the headwind of \u2013 we were expecting an additional $100 million of revenue from Health Net and that was baked into our pipeline plan. Even without that, we raised guidance $20 million beyond the Q2 beat. Nothing specific that concerns us for the second half of the year, however, obviously, there's a lot of M&A activity going on right now. So we certainly want to have an abundance of caution in case we get surprised by something as the year goes on. At this point, there's nothing that we know of that will surprise us, but it's one of these things you certainly want to be cautious of in this environment.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Could you just quickly mention what the constant currency growth rate is embedded in your guidance? And I'll turn it back in the queue, guys. Thanks again.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","So with \u2013 the guidance assumes that rates are essentially where they were yesterday, so no fluctuation of rates and they've moved a little bit since July, obviously, the euro and the pound, but that's not very significant for Q2. The constant currency growth was overall about 6% and on a year-over-year basis was 25.5%.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you and let me add my congratulations for the very strong quarter. Frank, I want to take you up on the digital transformation at scale comment. And the question is this, can the mainstreaming of digital services and sort of the demand profile that comes with it, is that enough of an offset to be sort of the lower growth and possibly even shrinkage of your traditional services? So how are you thinking about that?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Ashwin, it's a good question. I would start by \u2013 at the very 50,000 foot level and say, look, there's clearly a trend around the world across businesses and governments to become more technology intensive, not less technology intensive. So if you think about that as sort of the big proxy for demand, then I would say that, to the extent that we are enablers of helping our clients be more technology intensive, the demand environment is strong at the 50,000 foot level. When I look at the more micro level perhaps, what I would say, Ashwin, is that there are a couple of different things which I think are driving demand in digital, which I think are instructive to answer your question.","The first is that, as I said before, it's less now about helping a client with a point digital solution and much more about helping clients innovate at scale and sort of adopt continuous innovation. So that sort of creates for us an opportunity, and we're doing this with some clients around building an operating model around continuous innovation. So there's a revenue stream there, if you will, that we think we can leverage on a much more continuous basis. So that's point number one I'd make.","The point number two, which is I think very important is that, whenever we've seen these big technology shifts, whether it's the digital shift we're seeing now, the Internet shift that we saw about a decade ago, the client service shifts that we saw a decade before that, there is always a big imperative that clients have around integrating the new technology capability, digital in this case, with the legacy, and that means a lot of work around legacy modernization, a lot of work around new architectures, a lot of work around wrapping the legacy with the components that are necessary to support digital business. And so net-net, I do think that there's plenty of demand here, and the opportunity for us to offset the efficiencies that we're seeing in the traditional business with discretionary and new digital projects is definitely there.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. That's very helpful. Can I ask with regards to Health Net, you lose an anchor client opportunity? Can you talk about the pipeline in terms of the ability to replace that, and when can we return to a more normalized sequential growth expectation?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Ashwin, it's Gordon. When we look at the healthcare business, obviously, growth was a bit slow in the second quarter. There's a lot of change going on in that industry, whether it's M&A or regulatory change, consumerization, all that. When we look at our positioning in the market, we feel very good about that. We look at who our clients are, how our clients look to us for, not just execution but advice on how to both run their business better and for innovation. We feel very good about that. And equally importantly, the change in the Health Net acquisition does not in any way impact our strategy of \u2013 our belief that the industry, or portions of it, will move to end-to-end solutions, so the type of deal that we did with Health Net, we think those deals are still out there. We're actively talking to clients about that.","So certainly the Health Net change \u2013 restructuring was a little bit of a setback for us, but in no way changes our strategy, and everything we're seeing in the market, everything that's happening with the TriZetto integration, makes us feel that we are absolutely making the right decisions on our strategy, and the payer side is a little soft right now, for external reasons. But that's a cycle, and that's the reason we have a portfolio of businesses. So as one is a little softer, another is a little stronger, but long-term, we think healthcare is a terrific place to be in. We think we're better positioned than anyone else in the industry.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. Congratulations.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Dean Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi. So I was hoping we could get maybe a little bit more granular on healthcare. Is there any way to quantify the cross-sell opportunities at TriZetto, and maybe even the impact in that business from recent acquisitions? Anything on the outlook going forward?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Sure. So the healthcare \u2013 the TriZetto integration is right on track. We're feeling very good about it. The motivation levels within the TriZetto business are great, we've retained all the senior management, we still feel very good and confident about the $1.5 billion of synergy revenue we expect from the deal. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, we're already \u2013 that's already measured in hundreds of millions of dollars. We're now actively talking to clients about, as I mentioned, the end-to-end solutions, leveraging the TriZetto platform.","So I think things are right on track there. It's also reinforcing a product culture within Cognizant, so we're getting the strategic benefits of that. So we're moving ahead exactly as planned and the receptivity we're seeing from the industry, both for the traditional TriZetto business and the extra investment we've made, both in development as well as the capabilities Cognizant brings to the table in terms of hosting and BPO, clients are saying this is great, and we're winning deals.","Joseph Dean Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then just along that line, we've seen some healthcare acquisitions outside of just the TriZetto side of things. What's your thought of the impact on that business, the healthcare business in total for you, and any thoughts on the growth of that business going forward? Can we expect it to be above the aggregate growth rates, or anything that you can give us as we look towards next year?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Sure. So, clearly, the payer side of healthcare is going through a consolidation period. We've seen this in the past in other industries, banking is probably the best example. As that happened, we did very well in the banking consolidation. As we're looking at the healthcare consolidation, some of the deals that have been announced, those are our customers, and we expect those customers to look to us both to help with the integration work and also to help them think about how do they fundamentally transform their businesses. There's going to be a lot of pressure on the cost side, which we think will serve to our favor, but I think that pressure will manifest itself and look at how do you change processes, how do you change the way you do business and because of our consulting capability, we'll be very well-positioned for that.","So what we don't know, obviously, is there's some short-term freezes in decision-making. At this point, we've not seen any of that, but as I mentioned earlier, clearly we baked that into our guidance, so we have that cushion in case some of that happens. But if history is any indicator based on what consolidation in other industries, I think long-term, we'll be well-positioned particularly since these are the buyers that have been announced so far are customers with whom we have deep relationships and also with the target companies we do work. So we know those systems, we know those processes. So we'll stay close to our customers. But at this point, we think we're quite well-positioned to help them through the transition.","Joseph Dean Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Let me add my congratulations. I was just curious earlier I think Francisco made a comment about helping clients with their legacy integration during this major shift to digital. One of your major competitors seems to be very active in buying front end digital agency capabilities, and I'm sort of curious as you're (38:16) playing as well in the digital agency part of the digital world or are you more focused in the middle and back office? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ed, it's Frank. As I said, we've developed the Cognizant Digital Works methodology, which is really focused on taking a client from the very front end of ideation around digital all the way through the middle and back office of prototyping and then taking the solutions to scale through the legacy integration. So we're very much playing start to finish, if you will. And we believe that this approach that we have of integrating strategy, design, technology, altogether under the umbrella of the Cognizant Digital Works methodology is unique and differentiated. So we will continue to look to beef up our capabilities across the spectrum, but particularly in the front end design and strategy pieces, because that process is working quite well for us.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","My other question is comparing Europe, Continental Europe to the U.S., its focused on sort of run (39:38) the business work versus sort of the new digital work. Is there a different sort of feel into how the interest, demand in Continental versus the U.S.? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think you have to separate it out a little bit. If you look at the continent, I'm going to exclude the U.K. for a minute here, but if we look at the continent, I think there's still a very healthy pipeline of what we think of as run better kind of work. And that's, frankly, because the businesses in Europe, as you know, continue to face slow economic growth \u2013 macroeconomic growth environments. And so there is continued pressure there. And of course, as we've said in the past, Ed, the businesses on the continent, if I could make a generalization, haven't outsourced the run the business kinds of things as much as the counterparts in, say, the U.K. or in the U.S.","So there's upside there. Having said that, I would say that many of the countries in Europe are very digital, digitally aware, digitally savvy, and if you include the U.K., the penetrations of digital technologies like mobile and so and so forth in many of these countries and some of these countries are deeper than they are in the U.S. So there is a strong demand for digital in Europe as well. So we're really seeing in the continent this dual mandate of run better and run different playing out, and the demand there, I would say, is quite evenly based.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning and congratulations again on the quarter. I was wondering from a higher level of guidance perspective if you can give us a little bit of color on expected seasonality. It looks like historically the third quarter has been a much stronger quarter, but last year, you kind of accelerated in the fourth quarter off with (41:45) some pressure in the third quarter. It looks like this year you've got a little bit softer expectations for the second half. I guess question number one, is that more discretionary in nature and more caution on recent discretionary spending trend? And I guess the second question would be do you anticipate returning to more of a stronger 3Q seasonality eventually or is this a new trend in the back half?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Brian. It's Frank. I'll just give you sort of comments at the high level, then I'll ask Karen to give specific comments on the guidance. In general, if you look at our demand patterns, Q2 tends to be the strongest quarter. If you go back historically, and the reason for that is that our clients are by and large on a calendar budget cycle and clients tend to have their budgets finalized some time during the first quarter. So the second quarter is the quarter where you get essentially the full quarter impact of discretionary spending based on budgets that have been approved by the client. So generally speaking, Q2 tends to be the strongest quarter. Q3 is a good \u2013 historically has been \u2013 is a good quarter but not quite as strong as the second quarter and then Q4 tapers off as the year winds down.","So that's been our historical demand pattern. Last year was a little different because of the impact of the acquisition of TriZetto in the third quarter and fourth quarter, as you saw, some of that. So you have to strip that out from the numbers and I think if you strip out the TriZetto acquisition, you generally get the same kind of a demand pattern.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So I think I would just echo what Frank said, Brian, about historical seasonality being \u2013 Q2 being the strongest, Q3 tends to slow down a little bit, then Q4 being the slowest. Last year, we had two things. So in Q3, as you remember, is when we had to adjust our guidance and we had some one-time customer hits in Q3 of last year and so Q4 was a little bit of an anomaly. And then also we had the TriZetto acquisition which kicked in the \u2013 around November 20, so that was about $80 million of growth in Q4 of last year sequentially. So this year we would expect a much more traditional pattern with Q2 being the strongest, Q3 a little bit slower, and then Q4 will be a little bit different than our historical pattern. Historically, our core business slows down quite significantly in Q4, but we will have TriZetto. Obviously, Q4 is their strongest quarter typically given the nature of their business. So it will be a little bit more balanced this year than it would have been historically for us.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then on a discretionary side, any caution around spend or thoughts on customer budgets as we go into the back half of the year?","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","I think really other than the conversation we had around M&A earlier and just being cautious around whether there's any slowdown as customers go through some of that transition in the next few months, there's nothing other than that that we see on the horizon right now.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. So just wanted to ask about the head count growth, I know it was flat. So for us, looking at the model, it won't have an impact on 2015 head count growth as utilization increases, but just trying to figure out if the slowdown in head count growth will impact future growth rates outside of 2015 as we get beyond 2015. Thanks.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Hey, Bryan. It's Gordon. The answer is no, it doesn't. Let me explain why. First of all, with utilization, and let me just talk about blended utilization combined on-site and offshore, we're still two points below where we were at the beginning of 2014. From the beginning of 2014, we dropped about five points and that was a very conscious decision. And now as we had to shift our workforce and re-skill our workforce, we've now taken it back up but we still have some more room to take it up. So even when you think about the rest of this year, you'll still see some increasing utilization. We're doing our college hiring just as we normally would. So the college kids that come on board now through the end of the year, those people will be available for billing next year, and then obviously for lateral hiring, that's really just-in-time hiring, so we turn that on and off as we need. The key is having that pipeline of the college kids, because it's a long training period. So we'll be in good shape to support next year's growth.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just quickly, I might have missed this, but just what's the pipeline look like for tuck-in acquisitions or anything out there that could be more sizable? Thanks so much. Congrats.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me talk about it. We continue to actively look at acquisitions, and I think we've got a series of \u2013 as we always do, the pipeline of small tuck-in acquisitions continues to be strong. The screen is very much the same as it historically has been. I would say that when we look at technologies, new technologies, new solutions, the pipeline might be a little bit more weighted towards digital and looking at digital capabilities in different parts of the world, in particular, to give us footprint in those areas. We're also looking for acquisitions just in general to get us into certain parts of the world where we don't have as strong a footprint as we would like. I would probably single out or point to Asia as being one area where you'll see us potentially do some acquisitions to strengthen our position in key markets in Asia. We've already done, as you know, the acquisition of Odecee in Australia, which was both a digital acquisition and also helps us strengthen our presence in Australia. So that's the \u2013 I would say that's sort of the color that I can provide on the pipeline and of course we continue to be active and keeping our eyes open as assets become available. And as with TriZetto, we don't expect to do another large-scale acquisition until we feel that the TriZetto integration is well on track, which as Gordon said, we feel good about at the moment. But we're always looking in the market and seeing what's available out there.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you talk more broadly about how your talent and labor strategy is evolving, both as you scale the business and then also as you're meeting the shift in demand and need a more diverse set of skills?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Sure, Lisa. It's Gordon. I think you hit the key thing, as we need a more diverse set of skills. We do a wide range of businesses across multiple geographies. So first, from a sourcing standpoint, we now have college recruiting across the world, and here in the U.S., we recruit at close to 20 universities, plus another 10 or 15 business schools. We've dramatically expanded our European college programs and are moving it into Asia as well. From a lateral hiring standpoint, just as our scale and brand has changed dramatically over the last five years, people view us as an incredibly dynamic and attractive place to work. So when I look at all of our statistics in terms of quality of hire, yield rates on lateral hires, that all looks good.","Now, what we need to do, though, is in how we manage the people, since it's no longer one-size-fits-all. So we're very much, and we're well into it, making sure that people understand what the different roles are, what it takes to move up in the organization, so people can manage their careers. And we have a very transparent policy and program, so people from \u2013 everything from performance management to promotions, we call this Cognizant Career Architecture. So I think we're actually in quite good shape on this. This is not a place where we put our head in the sand, but we're being proactive, thinking about what's our workforce going to evolve to over time, how do we constantly re-skill people, how do we motivate millennials? Attrition was obviously up a little bit in this quarter, but when I look at the things we're doing, we're convinced we're doing the right stuff and it just takes a little time to kick in.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you. And then also, as the business shifts a bit, how is the competitive environment shifting, like who are you seeing more frequently, and who are you seeing less? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think \u2013 Lisa, it really depends \u2013 it's Frank. I think it really depends on what service line and what geographies you're talking about. As you know, our industry tends to be quite highly fragmented. And, particularly in the digital world, there are smaller boutiques that we sometimes compete with on the front end. But I'll make general broad statements. I think, given our end-to-end value proposition, the run better\/run different value proposition, we think that's really driving our growth. We tend to compete most frequently with the large global end-to-end providers that have both digital capabilities and the outsourcing capabilities. We tend to compete now much less with the traditional offshore or India-based pure play, I think of as run better firms. Although certainly they're still an important factor in the marketplace and so on. But we're increasingly competing more with the global multinationals who are \u2013 who have both the run better and the run different value proposition.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Given the Health Net\/Centene deal, could you help us think about the potential timeline for building the BPO as a service healthcare platform with TriZetto and some Health Net capabilities, and maybe when you might be able to bring on a new client?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's Frank. Let me try and address that, and Gordon jump in as well. We have a good pipeline of those types of deals at the moment. Now, let me also caveat that by saying that our pipeline of deals tend to be \u2013 are smaller than the Health Net deals. The Health Net was a very, very large deal, but we have a good set of clients that we're talking to around the similar model as Health Net. And the pipeline, I think, of those deals is good. I would remind you that, in our mind, really any client that is running the TriZetto platform is a potential candidate for this kind of model. So we think that, when you look at the value proposition from a client standpoint, and you say, what's the value proposition?","We think that our ability to run the software, host the software, run the business process, given our deep domain expertise in healthcare, plus the knowledge of the TriZetto platform, really is very, very compelling to clients. So I don't want to really venture a guess as to when we will be able to talk to you about another similar kind of deal, but my hope would be that, let's say, in the next four quarters, we'd be able to come and talk to you about a similar kind of deal structure, with a client similar to Health Net. But I want to be clear. I don't think we have anything of the size and scale of Health Net right now that we're discussing.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. And then, just on the wage increases for the third quarter, does the jump in attrition change anything about your plans for wage increases? And could you talk about magnitude of them? Thanks.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Sure Sara, (54:25) yeah, as we've said, for the last six months, and as we've practiced in prior years, we pegged our wage increases right in line with the industry and this year, that translates into high single digits offshore, low single digits on-site. The attrition doesn't necessarily change the magnitude of the wage increases, because people stay for \u2013 obviously, compensation is important, but it's also career development, it's the opportunities to move up on the organization to be empowered to take opportunities, the excitement and how dynamic is the organization. So it's a combination of compensation, but also a broad range of employee engagement programs and very importantly, the career architecture work that I mentioned earlier. So people understand our growth rate provides unparalleled opportunities for their long-term career growth.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question of the day is coming from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Great results all around. Just wanted to ask also on margins. Just \u2013 I know there's a lot of chatter in the press around Cognizant managing costs clearly wasn't demand driven. So I'm curious are you taking a different approach to cost and margins?","Gordon James Coburn - President","So the big thing obviously we did is we took utilization up. We slowed down hiring. I view that as that's good operational discipline. And what we want to make sure is that we have the dollars available to make the long-term investments rather than not having operational excellence. So clearly, we slowed down hiring. That's good for employees, because our bench is getting a little big. I think some employees were saying, hey, where's the learning if I'm sitting on the bench? So we've taken our bench down substantially, which I think is very good for employees. The other things such as travel, well, we need to walk the talk. We talk to our clients about being digital, being virtual. Our use of whether it's videoconferencing or other collaboration tools create great opportunities for people not to be on airplanes all the time. It's interesting. As we slowed down travel, our video usage went up 40%. That's great. We're interacting with clients on that. So part of that, it's not \u2013 yes, it's great to save the money so we can invest in the future, but it's also important that we're walking the talk on what the future work looks like.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. And then I'm just curious, just on the outlook on outsourcing versus the consulting tech piece, is this the new normal for now? I'm just curious if outsourcing can potentially accelerate given what you see in the backlog and pipeline. Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's \u2013 Tien-tsin, honestly, it's hard to make a forward projection on this one. I think outsourcing will continue to be healthy. If you look at the sort of dynamics of outsourcing, you have a few things going on. You have parts of the world, like I said earlier, like Continental Europe that are still first-time outsourcer, so that's one, I would say, on the positive side. The second positive driver is that you've got parts of outsourcing like Business Process Services and Infrastructure Services where penetration rates are still relatively low. So that's another positive driver of demand. So those are the positives. Then you look at what's offsetting that and you say, clearly clients are shifting budgets from lights on maintenance over to digital. And so that pulls demand down on the outsourcing side. But as long as you're well-positioned to pick it up on the digital side, which we feel like we're very strongly positioned, you pick up those dollars and potentially you pick up more because it's not always a dollar for dollar swap that happens there. So net-net, how does that all net out in terms of the trend line over the next few quarters? It's very hard to make a prediction but I think the message you should take away is that the outsourcing service line is still fundamentally solid. There's still a very strong value proposition there. There are segments of that space that are still underpenetrated, and that will continue to drive demand and then we'll just see how it \u2013 where it nets out in terms of the trend line over the coming quarters.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Congrats on the results.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thanks very much.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And with that, I want to thank everybody for joining us today and thank you for your questions and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Frank.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our Q1 revenue was $3.2 billion, down 0.9% from Q4 and within our guided range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. Revenue was up 10% from a year ago. The quarter developed exactly as we outlined when we provided guidance back in February. As we expected, we saw some softness in our Financial Services and Healthcare segments resulting in a slow start to the year. Macroeconomic concerns and market volatility weighed on the banking industry at the start of this year, resulting in some moderation in discretionary spending. We anticipate a return to positive sequential growth in our financial services practice for the balance of this year.","Industry consolidation within the healthcare payer space was a key factor in the softness of our healthcare practice during Q1. Going forward this year, we also expect a return to positive sequential growth in our Healthcare segment as the pressure from industry consolidation is expected to be partially offset by anticipated project ramp-ups and a strong pipeline including the recent signing of a significant multiyear deal with EmblemHealth, one of New York's leading health insurance and wellness companies.","Turning to guidance, we are reaffirming our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance within a range of $3.32 to $3.44 and tightening our full year revenue growth guidance to a range of approximately 10% to 13%. What's important to note is our Q2 revenue guidance reflecting a strong rebound in sequential growth is a range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion. This represents incremental revenue within a range of $140 million to $200 million and would make Q2 a strong sequential growth quarter putting us on a solid trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect broad-based momentum across service lines, geographies and industries in Q2. In support of our confidence in the business and the strength of our pipeline, we stepped up hiring adding approximately 11,300 net hires this past quarter. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected financial performance shortly.","Moving on, let me provide some color on the key factors influencing client spending in the current environment. As we've seen over the last several quarters, digital transformation continues to be a strong driver of demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors while innovating to create new areas of growth. We are in a strong position to capture the opportunities that are emerging from this transition. We believe that for true enterprise-wide digital transformation, clients need an interdisciplinary framework which brings together strategy, technology, design, data science and industry knowledge.","Cognizant Digital Works has been developed to provide this integrated approach in driving transformation. This quarter, we've added another dimension to our Digital Works approach by acquiring a 49% stake in ReD Associates, a human science consultancy that focuses on consumer experience and behavior and how these factors impact corporate strategy, products and services and go-to-market approaches. Together, ReD and Cognizant will provide a unique and compelling approach for businesses in helping them reframe their challenges for the digital era. Gordon will talk more about ReD later in his comments.","True digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes in customer experience, operations and business models that extend throughout the organization from the front office to the middle office and right through the back office systems. At the front end where enterprises engage with a myriad of stakeholders from customers to employees and business partners, our clients are looking to build capabilities that create personalized experiences across multiple devices that are well integrated with their business and technology architectures and can be deployed rapidly at scale.","In the middle office, clients are looking for operational agility and efficiency by combining people, processes and technology through platforms that have delivered as outcome-based models. These shared utility models sometimes called Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, can be enhanced with automation and analytics to bring additional value to client operations.","And in the back office, clients must modernize core IT systems and implement complex engineering development methods to create the technology backbone that's able to support the agility, scale and performance needs of a digital enterprise. It's through this lens that we've identified investments in three key strategic areas to take clients through this transformation journey. Let me now talk more about each of these initiatives in detail.","The first strategic initiative is building the digital capabilities to work with our clients on their front end systems. I spoke a few minutes ago about our Digital Works approach which seamlessly integrates five essential elements: strategy, technology, data science, experience design and industry expertise to develop and deliver digital solutions rapidly. We're finding great traction for this framework across the industries that we serve. For example, we're helping a leading life sciences company to improve diabetic care by implementing an Internet of Things, or IoT, infrastructure that enables remote upgrades to home-based glucose meters and insulin pumps. Doing so will improve customer satisfaction and adherence to testing regimes. This comes after we've already successfully developed an IoT monitoring framework for the same company to better maintain its thousands of surgical devices remotely.","The second strategic initiative is to help clients achieve new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in their core transaction processing operations by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, model that allows clients to shift from buying service to buying an outcome. By applying a series of levers including process optimization, digitization and large-scale efficiencies, we're able to bring clients levels of effectiveness which they would have been unable to reach on their own.","The third strategic initiative is to transform client's existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT. Clients cannot harness the potential from digital technologies without integrating with and upgrading their legacy systems and infrastructure. This requires a transformation of their IT backbone including a simplification of how applications are developed and delivered along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost.","For instance, under our agreement with the healthcare clients I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, over the next several years, Cognizant will help retire, upgrade and modernize their legacy infrastructure, software and development processes. We will replace legacy infrastructure with cloud-based virtual infrastructure, upgrade all software capabilities with Cognizant's TriZetto Facet software and implement agile methodologies to ensure and expedite the timely development and rollout of new products.","With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance, and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later to take your questions. Gordon?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Thank you, Francisco. Heading into the rest of the year, we have good momentum across the business as indicated by our Q2 guidance which anticipates very healthy sequential revenue growth. With that in mind, let me provide you with some additional color on our performance across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies.","Our Banking and Financial Services segment was down 1.7% sequentially and up 10.7% year-over-year. As we discussed on our first quarter call, macroeconomic concerns weighed on our banking practice at the start of the year. While we've seen stabilization in the markets and expect improved performance within our banking practice over the course of the year, several of our banking clients continue to take a cautious approach. Looking past these short-term challenges, it is increasingly clear that the FinTech revolution is driving our banking clients to invest in significant changes to their business model to meaningfully pivot towards becoming digital enterprises.","Moving on to our insurance practice, we continue to see strong demand for solutions which help transform the claims and underwriting processes deliver greater efficiencies increasingly through managed services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, there's an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service often through harnessing data and analytics to drive real-time decisions.","Let me give you an example. We are working with The Guardian Life Insurance Company to implement a next-generation IT solution for modernizing its big data infrastructure with Cognizant's BigFrame, a platform solution that leverages Cognizant extensive big data and mainframe expertise. Using the BigFrame solution, Guardian will fast-track its modernization program while minimizing risk and operational impact. The new platform-based environment integrates data from multiple sources providing comprehensive data as a service to internal teams for self-service analysis, improved decision-making and faster product development.","Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, declined 4% sequentially and grew 4% year-over-year. The seasonal impact of TriZetto's software business contributed to roughly half of the sequential decline as a large portion of software sales occur in the fourth quarter. As we've discussed for several quarters, the industry consolidation among several of the nation's largest payers is weighing on our healthcare practice in 2016. However, the payer sector continues to undergo fundamental changes. Over the medium and longer term, we believe these changes will create opportunities that we are well positioned to capture particularly through the combined Cognizant and TriZetto offerings.","As you recall, we had said that by acquiring TriZetto, we were acquiring IP in the form of software which, when combined with our traditional IT and business process services, would allow us to create revenue synergies that neither company alone would have been able to achieve. These synergies include increased systems integration, hosting and business process opportunities around the TriZetto software, and most importantly, end-to-end platform-based solutions. The integration of TriZetto and market acceptance of our combined capabilities has exceeded even our own expectations. As a result, we continue to feel good about the acquisition and our ability to create shareholder value through strong synergy revenues.","In addition to end-to-end BPaaS solutions in healthcare, we're also winning in digital. For example, Cognizant has been engaged by a division of a major healthcare player as their strategic partner in their digital business transformation. This client is experiencing rapid growth and has process systems and technology that cannot keep pace with their growth and strategic vision. We're helping them to re-imagine their customer experience, re-platform their operational backbone and redesign their operating model, ultimately resulting in an increased customer retention and operational effectiveness, improved customer insights and experience and lower cost of operations.","Moving to our life sciences business where the pipeline for deals is strong despite a muted start to 2016, we continue to see demand for multiservice deals combining applications and infrastructure in our midsize pharma clients while our large pharma clients are increasingly interested in managed services arrangements to help reduce operational risk and deliver cost savings.","Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 3.6% sequentially and 15.2% year-over-year, driven by strength in retail, manufacturing and logistics. One of the keys to the strength in our manufacturing and logistics practice in recent quarters has been our growing relationship with the engineering teams within our clients, leveraging our digital and IoT expertise to help them smart-enable products to improve instrumentation across their product portfolios. For example, for a global manufacturer of industrial machinery, we're helping the client who has faced a period of declining sales digitally enable existing equipment and create new digital products as a way to monetize data, improve the utilization of their equipment as well as reduce inventory in the supply chain.","Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information media and entertainment clients, was up 2% sequentially and 14.7% year-over-year, driven by our technology practice. With high-tech clients, we are seeing good opportunity around platform engineering for cloud services. Working with our high-tech clients enables us to do leading-edge technology work which is often applicable to other industries. For example, we are implementing this platform development for a client who is a leading provider of cloud computing services. Cognizant is creating a fully automated platform which will target the mid-market enterprise space to provide real-time and elastic capacity for their customers network and storage needs and to price this capacity accordingly. As a result, the client was able to significantly reduce cloud services provisioning time and launch new variable pricing models matching changes in market demand. This kind of experience is increasingly relevant to our corporate clients who are thinking about re-architecting their infrastructure by deploying cloud solutions.","Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 services: Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 services, which are approaching a $3 billion annual revenue run rate, have reached critical scale and have significantly increased our addressable market. They are essential to both the work we are doing around digital transformation and platform based solutions. The success and tremendous growth we've seen from these service lines over the past years demonstrates the power of the three horizon model as a way to manage growth and investment in the company.","Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a key competitive differentiator for us and is underlying much of the work we're doing across our strategic initiatives. As clients undergo enterprise-wide transformation, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as technology, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management and process redesign.","Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, there is a strong focus on automation and IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. For example, a manufacturer of medical devices, which saw an opportunity to improve performance and uptime needed to standardize and improve its global IT operations. We're developing a scalable and reliable IT infrastructure and offered an end-to-end solution, managing all the clients' hardware and applications, improving speed, predictability and customer satisfaction.","Cognizant Business Process Services saw a very strong growth during the quarter, led by work with our high-tech and insurance clients. Infusing technology and automation in core business processes is critical to helping clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while also enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. Cognizant recently commenced a multi-year agreement with Storebrand, one of the largest financial services firms in the Nordics, to transform their operations. Cognizant will combine business process with consulting and infrastructure services to enable Storebrand to reengineer business processes across the customer lifecycle, automate and modernize existing IT systems infrastructure and develop digital platforms with advanced analytic capabilities. As part of the contract, Cognizant will help Storebrand to move to a BPaaS model and deliver seamless omni-channel experience.","From a geographic standpoint, North America declined 1.4% sequentially. Adjusting for the seasonality of the TriZetto business, North America was broadly flat with Q4. Europe was up 0.9% sequentially after a 2.5% negative currency impact. The U.K. declined approximately 2.3% sequentially after a 4.5% negative currency impact and Continental Europe grew 5.4% sequentially after a slight positive currency impact. Finally, the rest of the world was up 30 basis points sequentially and almost 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as India, Australia and the Middle East where we're seeing good traction with clients' adoption of digital technologies.","Before I turn the call over to Karen, I'd like to discuss our recently announced 49% investment in and exclusive partnership with ReD Associates. How our customer interacts with his or her own world whether it's taking medications, driving a car, shopping or going for a jog has largely been the same for decades. Yet with the digital revolution and the merging of the physical and the virtual, these basic activities are now being rethought. This has become the new competitive battleground for many of our clients of revitalizing their products and services with digital technology.","ReD is a unique, highly specialized consultancy whose expertise in the human sciences is helping build businesses to address these issues. ReD specialists in sociology, anthropology, philosophy and political science work with market-leading blue-chip clients such as adidas, Ford and Novo Nordisk to create compelling experiences for their customers. The customers who now expect their workout equipment, car, shopping experience and healthcare to be every bit as personalized, engaging and insightful as their iPhone.","Our minority ownership model allows us to work together exclusively while helping us preserve the unique culture and processes that have led to long-term success of ReD Associates. This partnership will enable Cognizant and ReD to create an entirely new model for making sense of human behavior, connecting those insights to strategy, applying design-thinking to creating engaging digital experiences and then applying technology to achieve global enterprise scale. These critical elements add to the front office capabilities which we described earlier and enable us to address these challenges in a unique way.","With that, let me turn the call over to Karen, who will review our financial results.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenue of $3.2 billion met our guidance and represented a sequential decline of 0.9% sequentially and an increase of 10% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $15 million or approximately 50 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $34 million or 120 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 19.9% within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 was at the high end of our guidance range of $0.78 to $0.80.","Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.8% and 42.2% of revenue respectively for the quarter. Consulting and technology services declined 1.6% sequentially, reflecting the cautiousness of certain clients primarily in banking and healthcare to spend on project-based work, as well as the seasonality of TriZetto's software license revenue. Revenue from consulting and technology services grew 12.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue was flat sequentially and grew 6.2% from Q1 a year ago. During the first quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable.","We added eight strategic customers in the quarter defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue bringing our total number of strategic clients to 308.","As Frank mentioned earlier, we ramped up hiring during the quarter with approximately 11,300 net new hires, reflecting our near-term growth expectations and strength of our pipeline. Annualized attrition of 14.6% during the quarter including BPO and trainees was down by almost 450 basis points from last quarter and up slightly from the year-ago period. Throughout 2015, we put in place various employment engagement initiatives to improve our retention levels and are pleased with the progress we've made to date. We will continue to enhance these initiatives over the course of 2016. Total head count at the end of the quarter was approximately 233,000 employees globally of which approximately 218,000 were service delivery staff.","As a result of our strong hiring in the first quarter, utilization is down slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 75%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 80% and on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter.","Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $500 million from the quarter ending December 31. Borrowings under our revolver decreased during the quarter by $250 million ending at $100 million. Our cash and short-term investments net of debt were up by approximately $1.2 billion from the year-ago period.","Total receivables were $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 74 days. This is up from 73 days in Q1 of 2015. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was $432 million, up from $369 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 53% of the Q4 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver.","Turning to cash flow, operating activities generated approximately $68.8 million, financing activities were approximately $467.8 million use of cash during the quarter and capital expenditures were approximately $63.7 million during the quarter. During the first quarter, we accelerated our share repurchase activity, repurchasing 4.3 million shares for a total cost of $244.6 million and our diluted share count decreased to 611.8 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q1, we had repurchased approximately 45.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.8 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We had $193 million remaining unutilized.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we have tightened our revenue expectation to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $14 billion, which represents growth of approximately 10% to 13%, including an approximate 1% negative currency impact. The tightened range is primarily a result of our slower than usual performance in Q1. As Frank mentioned, we expect broad-based momentum across service lines, geographies and industries as we move into Q2 and the rest of the year, and expect the ramp-up of several deals including the healthcare deal mentioned earlier. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.","For the second quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion. During the second quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%.","For the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.83. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 611 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.","Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if maybe you could comment a little bit about your confidence in the back half of the year and the levers that you anticipate to achieve accelerated growth, particularly with regard to the BPaaS pipeline and deals which may materialize in the back half of the year.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Hey, Brian. It's Gordon. Thanks for the question. Let's talk about both confidence for Q2 and the back half of the year because they tie together. We have very good momentum going into Q2. Our guidance is for $140 million to $200 million of sequential growth. We expect to return to positive growth \u2013 positive sequential growth both in Healthcare and Financial Services, so sort of the headwinds that we had in Q1 on a sequential basis have subsided because it's in our run rate. When you think about the back half of the year, there are a couple wildcards and obviously that's why there's a guidance range. One is what happens with additional BPaaS deals and the timing on those, what happens with the timing of some of the big M&A and healthcare and we've \u2013 for the full year, we continue to be cautious in Financial Services. But even with that, given the pipeline both of new projects from existing customers and very, very healthy new logo wins in Q1, we feel good both about the sequential growth going into Q2 and that we continue to have healthy momentum in the back half of the year.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And maybe if I could follow up on the M&A comment, so obviously two very large M&A deals that we're all tracking, and one of them looks a little bit more certain than another to happen sooner. If one of those were to get pushed, could you maybe -- any color in terms of commentary and that how are those management teams and how that spending profile may look with a delay in one of those deals?","Gordon James Coburn - President","We haven't had any direct discussions about what happens if the deal is pushed or not pushed, but what we've seen historically and are certainly seeing now is during the time when people are waiting for \u2013 to see if a deal occurs, there are deferrals in spending because they're looking at what systems will be the ultimate system that's used and so forth and that's baked into our guidance. So our guidance assumes that these deals take a fairly long time at the low-end of our guidance. If they happen sooner, great.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I guess, the question is, can the demand and growth of your Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 offerings which are doing quite well, sufficiently offset the anticipated and ongoing weakness in traditional Horizon 1, so that net-net you can look forward to sustainable double-digit growth? And that's not just a 2016 question; it's beyond that as well. And then, I guess, do you then need to accelerate your inorganic investments in IP and software-based companies to either boost or sustain that growth?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Ashwin, it's Frank. I think since you asked a long-term question beyond 2016, I will answer it in that context. I would say that overall the world is becoming more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive, and that technology needs to be deployed, it needs to be integrated, it needs to be configured, it needs to be maintained and upgraded and so on and so forth. None of that activity goes away. So at a very macro level, I see very strong growth opportunities for us across all three horizons, frankly, because I don't see Horizon 1 declining; I think that as new technology gets deployed, you need to upgrade it, you need to maintain it, you need to take care of it and so on and so forth.","And so Horizon 1 services will continue to, I think, have healthy growth going forward. So net-net when I look at the portfolio across all three Horizons in the long run, I think that there's plenty of market opportunity. And I'll remind you, I don't need to remind you but I'll just say that it's a very fragmented market. We have 1% to 2% market share. So there's plenty of opportunity for us to go capture additional share in the market.","And to the second part of your question, I continue to expect that we will have an active M&A strategy as we have historically looking at the tuck-in acquisitions in the areas that we've always said geographic expansion, new technologies, deepening our industry expertise, and also now software and IP, I think, will factor into that. But I think our baseline is to do small tuck-ins and then from time to time if great opportunities like TriZetto present themselves that are bigger, we will obviously look at those. TriZetto has been, I think, as Gordon said in his comments, exceeded our expectations, I think, in what we've been able to achieve in a year and a half. And so we'll continue to look favorably at opportunities like that but also look at them very carefully to make sure that they meet all of the criteria for us.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I'm just trying to get a sense in the banking sector how much of the softness reflects to the mix of your particular clients or could it also be some market share losses given that some of your competitors reported fairly solid results in the financial services area? Thanks.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Hey, Ed. It's Gordon. So certainly, the bigger component of it is our exposure to financial services and just who our clients happen to be. There's one example where this share shift going on but that's a relatively small portion of the softness that we saw. We tend to work with the big \u2013 for the big money center banks. We do a lot of work for the European banks and those are the ones that have been hit harder than the midsize banks. And also, because we have a fairly large European exposure on a banking practice, FX was also \u2013 had some impact there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just curious how is the pricing environment out there. Anything unusual in deals won or lost?","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Tien-tsin, this is Karen. No, I mean, pricing has been very stable. I think obviously last fall we talked about some competitive environments that we were seeing in a couple of deals. But I think, frankly, that has mitigated itself. Pricing continues to be very stable. Clients right now are frankly looking for providers who can really bring the thought leadership and the value and the very strong consulting expertise and obviously that commands appropriate pricing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Cognizant's revenue guidance of 10% to 13% is in line to a little lower than some of the Indian IT peers for the next 12 months. And then historically, I can't recall a period that Cognizant didn't grow faster than peers and I know you guys keep margins lower because you invest for future growth. So just hoping to get your thoughts on maybe what's explaining the growth rates matching up with Indian IT peers and that you guys aren't significantly beating peers as usual and then when might you get back to historical norms. Thanks.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Hey, Bryan, it's Gordon. It has a little to do with the math. Q1 is soft for us. We're in a sequential decline but then actually have quite healthy growth and I would expect probably growth that shows favorably to many of our competitors sequentially going forward from there. But in Q1 \u2013 I think we had a couple of unique things in Q1 particularly in healthcare because we have such a strong position there. We were impacted by that and then in BFS once again because our big exposure to the money center banks. So full year, I think your observation is right. When you look sequentially after our soft Q1, time will tell whether that observation is correct or not.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. I just want to ask when we think about the setup as we proceed towards the second half of the year and it's 2017. I mean, some of these financial clients you talked about have seem to be re-accelerating a little bit at least and then if that were to stay confident and you couple that, I'm curious what post-merger integration looks like as compared to what you're doing with those clients before on the Healthcare side, in particular. I mean, is that something we could see potentially even up notably greater level of revenue in 2017 as these deals will close hopefully than we saw that with \u2013 currently to an acceleration?","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Darrin, this is Karen. And I think that's exactly the trend we have historically seen with mergers and acquisitions, right? There tends to be a lull before the deal closes as the clients sort of pulled back, evaluate what their plans are going to be. And then post-merger depending upon when the integration starts, there tends to be quite a bit of upside as you bring the platforms together or implement new processes and new platforms for the combined organization and that clearly in big healthcare deals like this would have quite a long runway. So as we said, depending on the timing of those deals, given the fact that we are a strong partner on all four or five of the equation in those deals, we would certainly expect to see at least our fair share of the integration work.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding the pipeline of new healthcare deals, you had talked about last quarter in the back half of the year, I think you talked about one of them but could you maybe talk about your confidence in those deals materializing or getting closer to signing several of them and maybe just talk about the overall pipeline in that space right now?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Sure. We're really pleased, Jim, with the pipeline in healthcare, particularly in healthcare deals that leverage the synergy between the TriZetto platform and Cognizant's IT capabilities. It's always difficult to predict when these deals will close. Obviously, we closed a deal this quarter that we discussed to really focus on modernizing, transforming and automating the client's environment. As we get later in the year, obviously, the impact it has in 2016 for additional deals closing is smaller but sets us up very well for 2017. So the way I think about it is we have clearly validated the market for this combined offering. We have a healthy pipeline. When exactly they close, don't know, but we're actively working on multiple deals right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Within Financial Services, I was hoping to get some more details on what kind of discretionary work is being pushed back and any more color on how you're performing with regional banks? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Sara. It's Frank. I would say that \u2013 let me answer the second part of your question first. I think the work that we're doing with the regional banks continues actually to be very strong. We saw good \u2013 we have seen, I think, for the last three quarters, four quarters at least great traction with the regional banks. That continues and we feel good about that. That's part of the return to positive sequential growth in Financial Services in the coming quarters.","And then I think in terms of color around what kind of discretionary work gets pushed or has been pushed in Q1, I would say it's across the board. Anything that's project oriented or discretionary, so things that \u2013 project work, new application development, some of the digital projects got pushed a little bit. Again, I don't know that this was a major push, big delays. I think this was sort of some slowdown in budget getting finalized in Q1 and then that translating into a relatively slow kickoff of new projects in some of the banks during the first quarter, which now I think we see starting to alleviate itself.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Mayank Tandon - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, Gordon and Frank. You've called out BPaaS. I just want to get a sense, is your BPaaS work healthcare specific? And if it is, what are some of the opportunities to leverage these capabilities into other verticals? Do you have to buy assets? And then just a related question is, what are the economics like on a BPaaS deal versus your traditional services?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Mayank. It's Frank. Clearly, the majority of our activity in pipeline right now is in healthcare around the TriZetto platform, but we have BPaaS both opportunities in the pipeline and also client engagements that are in other industries, in other sectors. In many cases, those are platforms that we've developed ourselves. In some cases, these are platforms that we have acquired, smaller platforms that we've acquired in the past. And in some cases, these are offerings that we've constructed on top of third-party products, software platforms, either commercial ISV platforms or sometimes we're having conversations about taking a client's asset and essentially wrapping a BPaaS service around that and taking it to market. So there are a number of opportunities and a number of irons we have in that fire, and a lot of, I think, positive momentum there.","I would say in terms of the economics, the economics on the initial BPaaS deals tend to be roughly in line with, maybe a little lower than a traditional deal but then the second, third, fourth time you do it because you've established the factory and the utility, the margins start to get very, very promising because you're essentially amortizing the fixed costs over larger volume.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering, can you comment on the progress you are making in digital? I know you shied away from giving numbers around what that looks like within your business, but if you could frame it for us that would be great. And if we hit an economic skid, how discretionary do you think those digital spending dollars might be? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The reason that we've \u2013 let me start by just reminding everybody that the reason that we don't quantify digital is that we think that the digital capabilities and offerings are really infused throughout all of our business through Horizon 1, Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 service offerings. And so really digital really is very much of the core operating fabric of all of our service offerings, all of our service lines. I think we continue to feel very good about the broad-based capability that we've built in digital.","We were out ahead, I think, of many on the digital opportunity with social mobile analytics and cloud from a technology standpoint. I think we are in \u2013 for Cognizant in the third or fourth generation of our thinking around digital with our Digital Works approach and methodology where we've gone well beyond technology to include design and data science in addition to strategy and technology and industry knowledge to combine those together, which is what you really need when you are deploying digital on behalf of clients.","We spoke a little bit about our investment in ReD Associates this quarter which is another dimension to the Digital Works approach. We feel very good about what the possibilities are in combining ReD, which brings a human approach to digital, from the social sciences standpoint. And so that's just another dimension to digital. So overall, I feel like we really have one of the leading digital capabilities out there. We are doing very deep impactful work with clients like the life sciences client that I spoke about in my prepared comments. So I feel good about the capability.","It's hard to say what to quantify exactly, what portion of this is discretionary in the sense of \u2013 in the event of an economic slowdown. But I would say that contextually the work that we're doing is largely very fundamental to the future of our clients' businesses and their strategy. Today, there is no strategy for business without some digital component. And so the work that we're doing tends to be very much in the heart of the future of these businesses. And so I would imagine that there would be some stickiness to that in the event of economic slowdown. Hard to quantify, though.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Operator","Jason, you're on mute. Mr. Kupferberg, your line is on mute.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Sorry, sorry. Can you hear \u2013 I'm sorry, can you hear me?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Yep. Go ahead, Jason.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Do any of the headwinds that you're experiencing this year feel like they could be anything more than temporary? I'm just curious why not take the low end of the guidance off the table here just given the momentum you've got going into Q2.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Jason, it's Gordon. The headwinds are temporary and are in the run rate now. But it comes down to the math. Because we were down sequentially in Q1, we expect healthy sequential growth going to Q2 and beyond. But when you look at the impact that Q1 had on the full year, we have to dig ourselves out of that hole. So, yeah, we think the tightening the range the way we did is appropriate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Louis Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you. I want to dig into the C in (48:08) SMAC, if we could. Some suggest that 1% of global workloads are in the cloud, mostly with AWS in 2013. Maybe here in 2016 we're up to 5%, but 2020, we could be up to 15%. And some are predicting actually 50% of all workloads maybe 10 years or 15 years out will be in the cloud. So I guess my question is, are you actually seeing this? Or we hear about a tipping point and many large companies, many of the ones that you deal with, the big financial banks are \u2013 want to move data whereas (48:38) want to move to the cloud. So are you seeing that? Are you helping with that? And how would it affect your business especially, I guess, I have about 7% of your business, I think, is in RIM, or remote infrastructure management?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, this is a multifaceted question. And so let me answer it in a couple of different ways. It's Frank. Let me say first of all that clearly large enterprises are looking at the cloud in multiple different ways. I would say that most of the large enterprises that we deal with are very much focused on hybrid cloud and looking at very carefully thinking about what workloads belong in the cloud and what workloads belong on-prem and how those balance off against each other. I would say that the \u2013 while the nature of workloads in the cloud requires a different maintenance profile, a workload in the cloud needs to be maintained and upgraded and monitored and modernized and all of those kinds of things, just like a workload on-premise.","There's much of the care and feeding of a workload in the cloud that still needs to be taken care of. And so, I don't think it's a fair assumption to just assume that when a workload moves into the cloud, it exists in the cloud without any support or care and feeding around it. So the implication that perhaps a workload moving to the cloud completely cannibalizes revenue is not entirely, I think, accurate. at least based on the technology that's available today and what we see.","I think more importantly, though -- so that's one dimension of the answer. The other dimension of the answer, I would say, is that, look, over the time horizons that you talked about, 10 years, 15 years, the amount of data and the number of devices that are going to exist in the ecosystem is going to explode. It's going to increase absolutely exponentially. And so all of that complexity is going to require, in my opinion, far more management, far more maintenance, far more deployment help. There's all of these other services that will be required to manage that degree of complexity as data and devices explode.","And so I think when you look over the time horizons that you're looking at, I'll come back to the answer I gave to one of the earlier questions, which is that the world is going to become more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive. It's going to become more data-intensive, not less data-intensive, and it's going to become more device-intensive and these devices are going to be much more heterogeneous than they are today. All of that complexity is going to require a lot of services to manage and maintain, and I think we're very well positioned as that transition occurs.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning. I guess going back to BFS, the weakness there and it feels to me like it's largely client-specific both domestically and Europe. So I guess I'm just wondering about the line of sight toward improved growth, if the trends at those clients specifically change and how do you have line of sight to the improvement?","And I'll just a follow-up question unrelated would be a little bit of color on the dramatic improvement in the attrition trends. I know you're at a comfortable rate as it relates to employee attrition.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey. It's Frank. Let me talk a little bit about Financial Services and then maybe I'll ask Gordon to comment on employee attrition. So I would say that if you think about our Financial Services portfolio, the bulk of our Financial Services portfolio are clients that we've worked with over many, many, many, many years. And if you look historically at our performance in Financial Services, I think you'll see that our Financial Services performance and portfolio has delivered very consistent results and solid growth year-over-year sequentially over many, many quarters. The reason for that is that, I think, we've got great relationships with these clients. We tend to be very embedded with these clients as they plan their annual operating budgets and their annual operating plans, their project portfolios and so on and so forth. And they worked very closely with us as they're planning that to make sure that we have the capacity and the talent available to meet their demands. So we tend to have very good visibility with these clients. We knew a slowdown in Q1. We told you about the slowdown in Financial Services when we gave you our first look into the first quarter and that was a result of the fact that we had been given that heads-up in working with a lot of these clients. And as we've gone through the first quarter, we continue that process with them, we now feel comfortable that we've got visibility that we will return Financial Services to positive sequential growth for the rest of this year.","So with that, Gordon, would you want to comment on attrition?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Sure. So, Glenn, we had a spike in attrition last year and the spike lasted longer than we would've expected and had in prior spikes. And that's frustrating for us because Cognizant has this incredible culture, unique culture, our growth rates create tremendous opportunities for career advancement for our people and the nature of the work we're doing and our leadership in digital provides for really interesting work. So we redoubled our efforts on employee engagement. We are very clear to our employees, we share the company success with them, we paid out very healthy bonuses for 2015. We've rolled out our career architecture, so people can understand what does it take to move up in the organization so they can self-manage their career. We've improved rotational experiences, we've invested \u2013 we doubled down again in investment and training for our people.","So I think what's happened is as people \u2013 as our employees have experienced what we've talked about and as we focused on it again, we've seen improvements, there's a little bit of seasonality in Q1 because of bonus payouts but clearly the trend is very much headed in the right direction and it comes down to \u2013 there are very few companies in the world that can provide the kind of career growth opportunities that Cognizant can for our employees.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. Following on, I guess the organizational question bent, can you comment on the comp plan changes you disclosed in proxy a few days ago? What the objectives are and behavioral change you're trying to drive there? And then also, from an organizational perspective, can you comment \u2013 we hear about the Horizons, and then we hear about Digital Works, and this front office, middle office, back office. Can you just clarify a bit kind of organizationally how you're structured to drive the shift and react to the shift in the marketplace?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Sure. Lisa, let me comment on the comp changes and then Frank can comment on your second question. I'm assuming you're referring to the PSUs, so there are two things that are going on there. One is, historically, PSUs have been 100% revenue. We've now shifted that to a combination of revenue and earnings to balance it out a bit more and in line with what other companies are doing. The second thing is for the grants that we've issued in early 2016, we're moving to a two-year measurement period instead of a one-year measurement period. So what this does, it further differentiates the measurements on the annual bonus from the measurements for the PSUs and obviously the PSUs, then there's a fairly long tail afterwards before they actually vest. But we wanted to make sure that the incentives are in line with revenue and earnings and that they're multiyear. So it's more aligning to what others in the industry are doing. That's the primary purpose of that.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Lisa, let me comment a little bit about how we're organized and how we're going to market. So I'll remind you that our primary access in going to market has been, for the better part of a decade maybe longer, the industry vertical. So we take everything to market through an industry vertical lens, we view that as being an incredibly important and significant part of our differentiation to have deep domain expertise around the industries that we serve and taking all of our services into a client through the industry lens. Behind the industry groups, we have essentially what you might think of as lines of service. The lines of service are \u2013 fall into different categories. These are the traditional services, the Horizon 2 services or rather the BPO IT infrastructure services and consulting and also the new digital services and all of these services go to market through the verticals.","The three Horizon model is how we manage investments across the business, so both across verticals and the horizontals, if you will, the lines of service, we apply the three Horizon models to say how do we allocate capital, how do we make investments across both the verticals and the horizontals. And actually there's a third dimension which are the geographies in which we operate. So the three Horizon model is a very clear and crisp way for us to say across the three legs of our matrix, the verticals, the lines of service and the geographies in which we operate, how do we allocate capital to the places where we're going to get the best returns, where the growth potential is the best.","And so three Horizons for us is less of an internal organizational construct. We don't have a Horizon 1, a Horizon 2 and a Horizon 3 organization. What we have is an investment model that follows the three Horizons and layers on top of the three vectors that I just talked about, which are the three legs of the matrix are the real organizational vectors, the verticals, the geographies and the lines of service. So I hope that clarifies it a little bit and I think that's our last question.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So with that, let me thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

These statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over the Francisco D'Souza. Francisco, please go ahead.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We delivered another strong quarter, continuing the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. Q3 revenue of $3.19 billion was up 3.3% over Q2, which exceeded our guidance for the quarter by over $45 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.4% was within our target range of 19% to 20%.","Much like the first half of this year we saw strong demand across our business this quarter. And as a result we're pleased to raise our full-year guidance for the third time this year. For revenue to at least $12.41 billion and for non-GAAP EPS to at least $3.03.","Our continued momentum reflects a healthy demand environment for Cognizant services that drive innovation, growth, and efficiencies in the digital era. The strong relevance of our services portfolio to clients is reflected in our results this quarter, our guidance for the full year, and the above company average growth in our consulting and technology services.","For a while now we've used these calls to talk about how we are at the cusp of a once-in-a-decade shift in technology that will drive a sustained period of technological transformation for our clients. Our clients recognize that becoming a digital enterprise is now a necessity, a matter of survival, as businesses, products, people, and devices become more connected. Therefore they are looking for innovative ways to combine their traditional business models and product sets with new and continuously evolving digital technologies. This is leading to a significant change in the way IT and operations budgets are allocated.","Clients are recalibrating their spending, moving dollars from keep the lights on maintenance and operation projects to new digital initiatives that create competitive advantage by enabling new levels of business performance.","We've talked about IT being strategic for years. And that is perhaps more true today than it has ever been, as management teams are looking to technology solutions to propel their businesses forward. Clients traditionally thought of IT as a means to drive productivity and efficiency, or what we referred to as run better.","Today the role of IT has evolved beyond that to reimagine organizations and business models for future growth, or what we call run different. This dynamic, where our clients have to simultaneously run better and run different, is what we refer to as the dual mandate.","Against this backdrop of changing client needs, the approach that services companies like ours need to take is also evolving. Effectively addressing the dual mandate for clients requires partners that can combine strategy, technology, and business consulting in one integrated model. However, equally importantly serving the dual mandate requires a partner that has a deep understanding of clients' legacy environment and business processes, so that these can be leveraged and integrated into new digital backbones.","Our strength in the market comes from the fact that we've built this breadth of capabilities at Cognizant. And we've integrated these together in our digital work methodology for maximum client impact.","Let me give you an example of a large financial services client of ours. I'll refer back to this client example periodically here in my remarks to illustrate the key investments we're making and the results we're seeing in the market.","We've been working with this client for over a decade now, supporting many of their mission-critical platforms, infrastructure, and business operations. Recently we restructured our engagement with them, where we will be taking them to a best-in-class operating model for their existing business with us.","As a result of this transition to best-in-class efficiency, we were able to commit to considerable savings for them on our traditional application management business. This is the run better part of the dual mandate. They in turn committed not only those savings back to us in the form of a long-term contract, but also increased their discretionary spending with us considerably. This is the run different part of the dual mandate.","The result is that we have a 10-year contract with them for an annual contract value that's almost 50% higher than their current annual spend with us. This extended partnership also presents opportunities for Cognizant and the client to develop and sell joint go-to-market solutions, leveraging our deep expertise and market presence.","Last quarter we outlined our investments in four areas to fully address the needs of our clients to help drive both efficiency and transformation. Let me update you on the progress we've made since then.","First, we are building capabilities to enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. As I mentioned last quarter Cognizant is among the few companies that can provide comprehensive digital innovation at an enterprise scale.","We do this with our Cognizant Digital Works Accelerator Methodology, which comprises three elements, the Idealab, where we work with clients to identify big themes and prioritize opportunity areas; the Collaboratory, a physical space where we design prototype and iterate specific solutions, so clients can visualize the impact on their end users and businesses; and the Foundry, where we take these pilot programs and switch them to enterprise scale by utilizing new technology options and integrating them with existing legacy systems.","Our clients appreciate this interdisciplinary approach. And across the industries we serve we are finding great traction for our Digital Works framework. We recently engaged the financial services client I mentioned a few minutes ago in a custom workshop at the Collaboratory for their business and technology leaders. We jointly identified a set of potential opportunities and long-term strategic initiatives that digital is presenting to this customer's business.","Second, consulting is a critical component of our services portfolio. Increasingly consulting has become an integral part of our comprehensive approach to helping clients drive digital transformation, as over 60% of our consulting pipeline is focused in this area. Our matrix structure deeply integrates our consulting team with our technology and business process services delivery organization. This synergy between our consulting and delivery organizations helps the teams work closely together, driving business model change, the re-engineering of business processes, and organizational change management for our clients' businesses.","We continue to invest in both people and capabilities to deepen our industry strength and have over 5,500 consultants globally as of today. For the financial service client that I talked about, our consulting practice played a critical role in driving thought leadership into the 10-year deal. Our consultants worked with the client to identify existing assets that could be extended to address significant business opportunities in an adjacent industry where they currently don't have a presence. This will potentially drive substantial revenue upside for the client.","Third, we are optimizing traditional services to enable our clients to achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. Today digital technologies are driving changes in the traditional outsourcing business. The focus in core traditional IT services business, what we call our Horizon 1 services, has shifted from people and processes to people, process, and automation. These services are important, because clients rely upon them each day to run their businesses. These services are also integral to our ability to drive digital transformation and legacy integration for clients.","This means we have to solve today's problems differently by applying innovation and creativity to reorganize and run core processes at an enterprise-wide scale. Sometimes it also means moving clients to radically different operating models to improve their cost and at the same time ensure a high-quality accelerated delivery.","For the financial services client that I've been talking about, we will convert our existing arrangement to an end-to-end managed services engagement to streamline their various customer-facing platforms and processes. At the same time we will transform and digitally enable their core platforms, processes, and infrastructure to support digital business while managing their existing IT platform for optimal efficiency.","And fourth, we are building platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new levels of efficiency, and at the same time deploy digital technologies more quickly. Last year we took a very definitive step toward strengthening our platform-based solutions portfolio by acquiring TriZetto. We're pleased with the pace of integration of TriZetto and Cognizant capabilities. The combined stack of software products and services from TriZetto and Cognizant has helped open new market segments, allowing Cognizant to bring an integrated solution to the healthcare market.","We've also seen good traction with our internally developed platform solutions. One such example is a cloud-based big data analytics platform called BigDecisions that brings together our clients' traditional enterprise data and digital data, such as voice, device, sensor, social, and mobile, under a single umbrella. BigDecisions includes business applications across multiple industries, which help our clients use analytics when making key business decisions. In the case of the financial services client referenced so far, we anticipate leveraging BigDecisions to enable this client to monetize their data assets by delivering actionable insights to their clients.","In closing I'd like to say that Cognizant's culture of innovation and adaptability, coupled with our commitment to continuous investment in the business, has positioned us to be the partner of choice for our clients as they navigate this tremendous period of change.","With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later as always to take your questions. Gordon?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Thank you, Francisco. We had another solid quarter and saw strong demand across the business, with particular strength in consulting and technology services, as clients continue to focus on implementing digital technologies to drive business transformation. Let me now provide additional color on our performance across industries, Horizon 2 businesses, and geographies.","Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 2.7% sequentially and 18.6% year over year, driven primarily by strength in banking. Growth continues to be broad-based across our banking clients, who remain focused on cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance, and cyber security.","We're seeing increased interest in managed services deals with both banking and insurance clients, as they continue to look for ways to increase efficiencies in their operations. In addition there is an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service, often through harnessing data and analytics to drive real-time decisions.","For example, during Q3 Cognizant was chosen to help one of Asia's largest private banks manage the future roadmap for a consolidated digital platform to sell personal loans, credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages, all of which are currently being managed on separate platforms. The consolidated platform is expected to significantly increase conversion, reduce platform costs and empower the bank with better customer insights.","Another good example is the work we're doing for the National Stock Exchange in India, one of the world's largest exchanges by transaction volumes, to transform its futures and options derivatives trading platform. Given the complex nature of exchange environments, new regulations and business requirements must be quickly absorbed and integrated to eliminate failures in transaction processing. The platform that Cognizant developed and deployed for tasks such as order matching and message transfers allowed the exchange to successfully process an unprecedented 1 billion orders in a single day.","Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, grew 4.7% sequentially, and including the impact of TriZetto grew 43.3% year over year.","As the healthcare industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, healthcare organizations are looking for new ways to deliver customer centric care, while simultaneously looking for ways to drive operational efficiency. We recently announced that the New England Healthcare Exchange Network, NEHEN, a consortium of regional players and providers in the Northeast, selected Cognizant and TriZetto to digitally transform and manage its technology infrastructure.","NEHEN consists of over 55 hospitals, eight health insurance plans, and tens of thousands of practitioners. Cognizant and TriZetto are enabling NEHEN to deploy an infrastructure that allows members to share costs and improvement administrative and clinical processes.","This win highlights the synergy opportunities brought by the combination of Cognizant and TriZetto. Together we've won a number of similar deals across payers and providers combining TriZetto's products and platforms with Cognizant's capabilities in IT, BPO, and hosting.","As we approach the 1-year anniversary of the TriZetto acquisition, we could not be more pleased with how the integration is progressing. TriZetto employee retention remains high. And we have a strong pipeline of opportunities leveraging the synergies between Cognizant and TriZetto.","Moving on to our Life Sciences business. We had a strong quarter as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Additionally we saw continued strong demand among our medical device clients. We see an increasing interest in deals which combine cloud technologies and platforms, including our proprietary MedVantage, a cloud-based integrated complaint management solution we built on the Force.com platform. We've had a number of our medical device clients implement MedVantage this year to improve efficiency, reporting, and overall service level for their customers.","At the recent Dreamforce event Salesforce named Cognizant the recipient of the 2015 Salesforce Partner Innovation Award for Healthcare & Life Sciences for our work with Johnson & Johnson. Cognizant helped J&J Medical launch their customer digital engagement model. This digital platform focuses on driving value to J&J sales team through omni-channel and business function integration, empowering them with the information they need to better understand their customers' and patients' needs.","Our retail manufacturing segment was up 4.8% sequentially and 13.7% year over year. Clients are focused on modernizing their technology environment, particularly around supply chain and omni-channel commerce solutions.","On the manufacturing side in particular we're seeing strong demand around product transformation. For example we're helping a global packaging equipment manufacturer to transform the packaging equipment they're manufacturing to smart and connected products, leveraging sensors and the Internet of Things and connecting them with a big data analytics platform. This engagement involves organizational change management, business model innovation, and machine-to-machine connectivity. And will help our client reduce operating costs and deliver new value to their customers.","Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications, and information media and entertainment clients was down 0.5% sequentially and up 15.2% year-over-year. We saw a pause in spend with clients in the communications sector on the back of a wave of M&A deals in that space.","Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the above company average growth we're seeing across these three businesses, Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services, and Cognizant Business Process Services.","As Frank mentioned earlier Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a critical, competitive differentiator for us. As clients undergo enterprise-wide transformation, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as technology, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management, and process redesign.","Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations, and accelerated delivery. Increasingly there's a strong focus on automation and IT operations driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions.","Cognizant Business Process Services saw continued success during the quarter led by work with our high-tech insurance and banking clients. Infusing technology and automation in core business processes is critical to helping clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies, while also enhancing business outcomes through data analytics.","Let me now shift to geographies. From a geographic standpoint North America grew 3.6% sequentially and 26.7% year over year. Europe was up 1.4% sequentially and 7.8% from last year after a 10.4% negative currency impact. The U.K. grew approximately 1% sequentially and 8.3% year over year and Continental Europe grew 2.2% sequentially and 7.2% over prior year. Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the Rest of the World, which was up 5.3% sequentially and 31% year over year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in our key markets in Asia, such as Singapore and Australia.","I'll now provide some color on our business operations. Similar to last quarter, quarterly annualized attrition remained at 20%, which is above our desired range. We're committed to improving our retention levels through various employee engagement initiatives. Faster company growth, well-defined career paths, unique learning and reskilling opportunities, and our practice of sharing the rewards of our strong company performance with our employees continues to make Cognizant a very highly-attractive employer.","Delivering strong revenue performance this year, combined with our continued success in driving higher operational efficiency, was only possible through the efforts of our incredible staff around the globe. And we believe that they should share in these accomplishments. Our performance during the quarter enabled us to increase our year-to-date bonus accrual to levels well above last year.","In fact our brand, which is a reflection of our attractiveness as an employer, has never been stronger. This was validated by the success we've seen in our global campus recruiting program this year. We've extended our campus footprint, recruiting now from over 30 leading universities and business schools in the United States, as well as another 30 top schools across Europe.","This campus hiring program has helped us expand our in-country and near source centers. In India this year we saw tremendous success in our campus hiring across premium engineering campuses. On campuses where students receive multiple offers from Cognizant and other tier 1 companies, on average 75% of those students chose Cognizant over others.","Throughout this call we've highlighted how we're winning in digital, driving leadership in industries and markets we serve, and how we are seeing good traction for our platforms and as a service models. We're proud of our performance and are pleased that this is being recognized by leading industry analysts, sourcing advisors, and other influencers. In the past few weeks Cognizant has been recognized by these industry analysts as a leader in Internet of Things, business intelligence consulting, robotic process automation, and Insurance as a Service.","With that let me turn the call over to Karen to review our financial results.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. As Frank mentioned we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter. Third quarter revenue of $3.19 billion exceeded our prior guidance by over $45 million and represented growth of 3.3% sequentially and 23.5% year-over-year.","On a year-over-year basis we had an approximately $72.4 million negative currency headwind, which impacted revenue growth by 280 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 19.4%, within our target range of 19% to 20%.","As expected the non-GAAP operating margin declined from Q2, as we absorbed the impact of compensation increases beginning July 1. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 exceeded guidance by $0.01.","Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58% and 42% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 4.6% sequentially and 34.2% year over year. Outsourcing services were up 1.5% sequentially and grew 11.1% from Q3 a year ago. During Q3 we saw a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters, whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards project-based work, including digital and other transformational programs.","During the third quarter 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. And as expected overall pricing was stable.","We added seven strategic clients' customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 292.","During the quarter we had approximately 1,300 net employee additions, and we ended the quarter with approximately 219,300 employees globally. Approximately 205,000 of our employees were service-delivery staff.","As expected utilization was up on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization increased by almost 300 basis points sequentially to approximately 76%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 81%, and on-site utilization was approximately 94% during the quarter, up 100 basis points from Q2.","Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with just over $4 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $484 million from the quarter ending June 30 and down by approximately $568 million from the year-ago period. Total receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter. And we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 70.6 days. This is down from 71.9 days in Q2. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $421 million, up from $387 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 55% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables and ramp-up of certain fixed bid contracts.","Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $950 million at the end of the quarter. And during the quarter we repaid the $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver.","Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $818 million. Financing activities during the quarter were approximately a $249 million use of cash. And capital expenditures were approximately $65 million during the quarter.","During the third quarter we repurchased 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $156 million. And our fully diluted share count decreased approximately 1 million shares to 612.7 million shares for the quarter. To date we have repurchased approximately 40.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.5 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have $480 million remaining unutilized.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. As Frank mentioned we are increasing our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the healthy demand environment and the over performance during quarter three. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.41 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 21% over 2014. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year.","For the fourth quarter of 2015 we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.23 billion, representing sequential revenue growth of at least 1.3%. As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice, and fewer billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth.","During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For Q4 we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.77. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, and acquisition related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares. We are raising our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03 to at least $3.03. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.5%.","Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. One moment please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Can you just clarify for us what the organic growth was in the quarter when you back out TriZetto and the ODC acquisition, and also both the impact on the quarter year over year and the benefit to the full year for 2015? Thank you.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","So, Ed, on a quarter-over-quarter basis TriZetto is about 7 points of growth \u2013 or year over year rather, sorry, year-over-year basis for the quarter. And what was your second question regarding full year?","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Then the same question but for the full year.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","So for the full year if you remember, we had said that TriZetto was about $720 million of revenue last year, growing low single digits.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Hey, Ed, just as a reminder, there was a small portion of TriZetto revenue last year as well, so be sure to adjust for that.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And Q4 of last year had about $80 million of TriZetto revenue.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Next question, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Good quarter here, no big surprises. I guess just the fourth quarter, I know fourth quarter is a little tricky. Karen, you mentioned a few things like the client furloughs and the billing days. Maybe can you quantify some of those factors on what makes 4Q unique? And any considerations around budget flush, et cetera?","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So the big thing is really the billing days, Tien-tsin, so it's about \u2013 almost 3.5% fewer billing days in Q4 versus Q3, which roughly translates to about a $75 million sequential negative revenue impact. That's the biggest component. And then obviously as you mentioned some furloughs on top of that. And then the typical seasonal pullback in retail. But those are less impactful than the bill day impact.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. So it was really just the billing days. And just maybe as a quick follow up, just thinking about visibility in general. I know we're all going to be thinking about 2016 here pretty soon. Just given the bigger mix of consulting versus outsourcing, do you feel like the visibility has changed or improved or gotten tougher?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Tien-tsin. This is Frank. I would say it's about the same. We're going through clients' budget cycles at the moment. We feel like those conversations are right about where they would typically and traditionally be at this time of the year. So we don't either quantitatively or qualitatively feel like there's any difference in that process this year.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks as always.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations on the solid results. So we've had this view for some time that the two-speed economy, which translates to your mandate has an inherent assumption that a large portion of the growth initiatives are partially paid for by savings on the cost optimization side. So while companies indicate a good growth on the digital side, you have got to temper that optimism with what needs to be done to deliver productivity gains. The question really is, what sort of pressure are you seeing on revenue growth on the traditional side? Can your Horizon 2 and 3 traction, which is great, continue to safely offset Horizon 1 pressure, if there's any? And how does it change your notion of revenue visibility and impact on margins?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Hey, Ashwin. It's Gordon. I think you're right that clients are trying to fund spending on innovation and on digital by optimizing the cost on run the business, which a lot of that is the traditional outsourcing. And you've seen that in our numbers now for many quarters, where our technology and consulting business is growing faster than the outsourcing business.","But let's be clear. We continue to do very well and take market share on the maintenance side. What customers are looking for is they're interested in how can we become more efficient, lower their cost of ownership on maintenance, so they can free up those dollars to move elsewhere. And we \u2013 Cognizant just has this incredible track record of delivering very high quality services, while continuously delivering productivity and efficiency.","So I think we're probably better positioned than most others in the market in terms of lowering cost of ownership on maintenance, while delivering high quality services. And then capturing \u2013 because we can assert both sides of the dual mandate, and capturing that freed up spend over on the technology and innovation side.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And so when you lower the cost are you using new tools like RPA? And what impact does that have?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Ashwin, it's Frank. I would say that there's a lot of conversation right now about these \u2013 what I would bucket together in sort of the category of advanced automation kinds of tools. But I would say that the bulk of the productivity that we drive in the core business is through traditional means of driving productivity and efficiency that includes process kinds of things like Lean and Six Sigma and so on, and also more traditional tools in automation.","I think that the promise of artificial intelligence and machine learning and robotic process automation is certainly substantial, but it's early days in that area. And I think we are making very solid investments. I think you heard Gordon say in his prepared remarks that we've been recognized by industry analysts in areas like robotic process automation as being leaders.","So we continue to drive that aggressively. But I think this is a longer-term journey to really see the impact of that \u2013 of those technologies on a broad basis across our business.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Understood. Thank you for the comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could touch on a little bit in terms of capital allocation? And how you think about growing the businesses, particularly in areas of focus, such as Healthcare and Digital? And with that in mind, perhaps with competitors in mind, as we've seen quite a bit of capital markets activity ramping this year.","So from the perspective of investing organically versus perhaps pursuing acquisitions, how you think about growing the business? And what you expect heading into next year?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Hey, Brian. It's Gordon. We're going to continue with the strategy that we've been executing successfully on, which is making long-term organic investments is the key \u2013 the core of our business. We said we're a 19% to 20% margin business. We reinvest everything above that. And as a result of that we should deliver revenue growth well above industry average. And we've delivered that year-in and year out. And so that's working.","We will always supplement our organic growth with acquisitions, either to strengthen a geographic presence, industry strength, or technology and service line. These largely are tuck-under acquisitions. Obviously the TriZetto acquisition was a outlier. But we continue to look at tuck-under acquisitions to supplement that.","From a capital allocation standpoint as you've seen both this third quarter and second quarter, each quarter we repurchased about $150 million worth of stock to target share neutrality. We'll continue to target share neutrality. One of our challenges is the majority of our cash is overseas, so we have a little \u2013 we have some limitations here. But we're going to \u2013 the capital allocation strategy we're doing is resulting in industry-leading results, so we're going to stick with it.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And on the pipeline it seems as though at least you've been quiet year-to date on M&A front. Is that pipeline accelerating? Or might we see more activity as we head into next year and you digest the TriZetto acquisition?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Brian. It's Frank. It's \u2013 as you know it's very hard to predict timing and volume of M&A activity. I would say the pipeline is as robust as it has ever been, maybe even a little stronger. We're looking at different kinds of deals. There's a lot of digital stuff we're looking at. We're looking at some geographic stuff in other parts of the world to give us presence in markets \u2013 geographic markets where we feel like we need a stronger presence.","But I'd hate to predict, because it's just inherently difficult to predict timing of M&A. But we haven't slowed down. We continue to look at as many if not more transactions. And I would say that if you look over a long period of time, I wouldn't expect to see any material slowdown. Maybe a little bit of an acceleration in the pace of us doing things, as we become bigger and we're able to move faster on multiple fronts as we \u2013 particularly in the area of tuck-ins.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Helpful color. Thank you for the insight.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Gordon, I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the bookings environment over the past couple months? And specifically address the financials vertical? I think you talked about banking being relatively strong for you. But is that you think still the case in the next couple quarters? And especially relative to what some of your peers have called out in terms of incremental weakness in financials? I was wondering if you could also maybe address any of kind of the incremental sub-verticals, where you've got more strength or more weakness relative to what you've seen the past couple quarters?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Yeah. So the bookings across the business are solid. We're seeing solid interest in banking. And a lot of that is because we can serve the dual mandate, because we have deep expertise in banking, we feel good about that. There will always be an anomaly here and there. But when I look at the overall portfolio of our Financial Services segment, we certainly feel good.","I don't know if I would point to that has greater strength than other business units, because I think \u2013 and you saw it this quarter, other than a little bit of weakness in the communication sector, solid growth. So it's very well-balanced right now. And I think we are pleased with the bookings. And particularly on the technology and innovation side, because there's really only a handful of companies that can serve that dual mandate.","So there's a lot of people fighting for the maintenance side of the business. But on the development side there's only a few of us who can really deliver. And I think we're very well-positioned there, and our investments have paid off.","James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up, could you maybe address your hiring plans short term over the next quarter or two? And what you plan to do specifically to kind of address the attrition rate and kind of get the head count back up to the extent you think it needs to over the next couple quarters?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Yeah. So the slow growth in net head count is not driven by attrition. That's driven by a very conscious decision we had this year to significantly improve our operational excellence and take our utilization up, which we successfully did while maintaining customer satisfaction.","So and we're largely done with that process. I think we're pretty \u2013 I mean give or take pretty much at the utilization levels that we want as we go into 2016. So we don't guide to quarter-to-quarter head count growth. Still, I think we still have a little bit of room offshore on utilization, which you might see in the Q \u2013 in Q4. But then it starts to level out over that.","On attrition. Attrition being up is not just us as you know. It's the industry. But it's one where when I look at the opportunity for us, clearly we should have lower attrition, given we have unparalleled career opportunities for our employees, given the success we have on the digital side, the overall growth rate.","So we're redoubling our efforts there to make sure that employees have the career growth. That we share the rewards as I have said. And I'm sending a note out to our entire company right after this call, saying that because of what they've delivered on revenue growth, what they've delivered on operational performance, we're going to share those rewards and pay out bonuses well above last year. So we'll keep working on it. I'd be concerned if we were an outlier, but we're not an outlier on the attrition.","James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time we ask that all callers limit themselves to one question. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you. Some questions on the pricing environment. There has been some discussion of cases of competitors being aggressive. Could you talk about what you're seeing in the market? And then maybe a bigger picture pricing question, which is you're seeing an evolution of your pricing models towards more fixed-price contracts and perhaps do more transaction-based pricing over time. How do you see pricing models and maybe pricing mix evolving?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Sure. Let me comment first on the pricing environment. And it's we've spent a lot of time looking at what's going on. We're clearly seeing a bifurcation in the market. And that's at leading competitors who can compete on both sides of the dual mandate and those who can't compete on both sides of the dual mandate. And therefore focus more on price.","What we've seen, and I'm sure some of you have heard about it, there have been some isolated instances of irrational pricing in the market. But let me be clear, overall pricing remains stable. This spots of irrational pricing is consistent what we've seen historically in the market, as there have been big technology shifts. And some players are having trouble with that shift, and therefore act irrationally in their core market.","We also want to be very clear. We believe this is a short-term phenomenon. The fundamentals of the industry, input costs, facilities, travel, have not shift \u2013 haven't shifted enough to warrant this change. And we're also seeing some of the competitors make considerable assumptions about productivity gains driven by new automation technologies, which we don't think are yet enterprise reality. Frank has touch base on that earlier. We think some people out there are making assumptions that we scratch our head a little bit about will they be able to achieve that? Or is it wishful thinking?","Often when you see these sorts of unrealistic assumptions about productivity built into bids, what you see is players shore up their profitability by cutting corners. And historically this has resulted in unhappy clients.","And we're already beginning to see that in the market. Some of \u2013 in some instances where there has been irrational pricing, that client is actually pretty unhappy now, as they're getting service from one or more of our competitors. And that competitor is cutting corners. And it also impacts the employee morale, because of how you have to squeeze the employee.","So when we step back and look at it, when we look at our overall book of business, things are very stable and we feel fine about pricing. We're watching these pockets of irrationality. But we're not particularly worried about it, because what we're seeing is very quickly the customer understands you get what you pay for. And we're seeing dissatisfaction where customers have gone with someone who has bid irrationally.","So we got to watch it, but at this point we don't think it's a long-term trend. We don't think it's impacting our book of business. And ultimately I think it may be good for our reputation, as clients have the dissatisfaction with some of the other competitors.","Operator","Your next...","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me just follow up with the second part of your question. Just building on what Gordon said a minute ago, it is absolutely true that on the run better side of our business, clients are still looking for greater levels of efficiency and effectiveness. And so we're focusing clients on looking at total cost of ownership and looking at the output and the outcomes that we deliver. And driving output and outcomes to best-in-class, world-class levels.","And so as a result of that you will see a continued shift in our business towards more output- and outcome-based models. And the fixed-price metric that we report to you I suspect will creep up over time as a result of that trend.","We think that that's the far better, more thoughtful approach to working with clients is to focus them on the total cost of the outcome that we're providing, as opposed to the comment Gordon has made earlier about somewhat irrational pricing on the input side, which is really a zero-sum game.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just want to get an update on the Healthcare sector. We've seen some volatility there. Your results seem fine this quarter. But what's the outlook in Healthcare going forward?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think at a macro level \u2013 I'll let Karen comment. Bryan, it's Frank. I think at the macro level I think if you break it into the two large component pieces, we feel pretty good about Life Sciences going into next year. Drug pipelines are healthy again across the industry. We're seeing good traction. So we feel pretty good about the Life Sciences side of the business.","When I think about the Healthcare business, as you saw we had a reasonable quarter in that \u2013 actually a strong quarter in that business. And I think the fundamentals continue to be strong. The one cautionary note I would have there is as you know there have been a number of mega mergers that have been announced but yet to be approved by the government in that sector.","And so as we go into next year, as we've seen in other M&A environments, you could see a pause in spending, depending on the \u2013 I can't exactly predict when that'll be, because it'll depend on when the government approves it and so on and so forth. But that's the one thing that I'm keeping an eye on. But fundamentals are strong. The need for change in that industry continues to be very, very strong. Lots of opportunity for technology to bring competitive advantage to the industry to drive greater degrees of efficiency.","So over the long run I continue to be very optimistic about Healthcare, both sides of Healthcare. And particularly so, because we've got a very strong set of assets with the TriZetto acquisition combined with the traditional Cognizant strength. So we're well positioned in the industry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. I would like you to talk, if you don't mind, a little bit about the growth challenge as you go into next year, and how you are thinking about that and addressing that both \u2013 and I'm just observing that to maintain your organic growth rate, you're starting to push adding $2 billion in revenue a year. So how are you thinking about that, both on the labor side as well as on the customer acquisition side or expansion into new vertical side? How are you thinking about that? Thanks.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Hey, Lisa. First of all, be careful with the $2 billion number. That includes TriZetto obviously. So it's \u2013 if you look at organic, yeah, it's \u2013 Karen gave some of the numbers earlier. It'd be less.","So from a supply side I think we're in good shape. We've taking utilization up. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments our brand for recruiting across the globe, both in college and lateral, is the strongest it has ever been. There are always going to be pockets where supply is constrained, like on digital right now. But even there we're getting more than our fair share of people wanting to work for us. So I feel good from the supply side.","From the demand side, obviously clients have to finish their planning cycles and all that. But I think we're well positioned in terms of \u2013 assuming that clients continue to shift more towards innovation. That's all the good news. The bad news is the law of large numbers. As you get bigger each year on a percentage basis the growth number becomes more challenging, even if you're growing around similar dollar amounts and so forth. So the math long term works against us.","But as I've said many times, that's not a straight line. You have some years where you're up in growth rates, some years where you go down and so forth. But we feel good about supply. We feel good about our pipeline going into the year. But we do have the headwind of the law of large numbers.","And as Frank mentioned there has been some M&A that may close next year. And we've just got to keep an eye on that. And we'll certainly plan for the worst, hope for the best. And historically the best has happened for us. But you always want to be cautious on that, so you know the best is going to happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much. I was hoping you could comment on the puts and takes associated with operating margins as you look at Q4 and perhaps even a bit further. And included in your response, does the desire to lower the attrition rate by it sounds like taking up the bonus levels, does that suggest that the 19.5% might be a level that you seek over the next couple quarters and as you try to combat attrition? In other words, might it be an impact over the next couple quarters?","And, Karen, I just want clarification. Could you also comment on what you see FX impact, given current rates in calendar year 2016? So the analysts can adjust their models as they get prepared for what will presumably be the guidance in the January quarter.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Sure. Let me take the first part of it a little bit. Then Karen will pick up on it. Very importantly, remember, 19% to 20% is the range. Okay? So we're right smack in our range.","And the other thing to remember, for Q3, we delivered the midpoint of the range with two things happening. One, our annual salary increases kicked in July 1. So Q3 is always the most challenging quarter, because that's when your salary increases kick in. And we did a year-to-date increase in the bonus accrual. So with both those things happening, we're still at the midpoint of our range.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And then in terms of FX, Keith, obviously for 2016 we'll be planning based on the current rate environment, which in terms of revenue, has been fairly stable lately, right? The pound and the euro are the two biggest currencies that impact us, and they've moved a little bit but not enough to be material.","The big impact to us has really been the 2014 versus 2015 growth, which we talked about, is about 280 basis points this quarter. But sequentially the last couple of quarters the pound and the euro haven't really had much of a top line impact for us. And so we wouldn't \u2013 at least right now based on rates wouldn't expect a huge FX impact going into next year. That answer your question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Louis Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you. When you look at digital programs it seems like there is some discussion about whether the way companies both have to approach that, which you're obviously doing, but also implement that is changing materially, in that the programs are getting smaller with a lot more on-site help. How are you positioned for that, given obviously you've got a very attractive but big staff over in India? And would you possibly end up needing more resources on-site locally in the U.S. or Europe? Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Lou. It's Frank. I would say that it's actually \u2013 in some senses the more things change, the more they stay the same. If you think back to other big technology shifts, when there are big changes in technology, you tend to see two things happen. First, a wave of as you correctly pointed out smaller projects that are more pilot and prototype in nature, which in the digital world also have the characteristic of requiring more than just technology skills. They require design, they require strategy, they require data science skills, and of course deep consulting and domain expertise. And those also by their nature tend to be more if you will on-site in nature.","But after this initial phase of prototyping and piloting, those then have to be switched to enterprise scale. And when you get to enterprise scale, that's when you actually have to do the heavy lifting of integration with legacy, scale to hundreds of thousands or millions of users, very high transaction throughput, some significant amount of performance testing, and so on through the lifecycle. And that part of the engagement, it very much lends itself to the traditional on-site offshore delivery model.","So we feel very good about the fact that we have such a strong on-site presence and capability in those new areas, like strategy, like consulting, like design, like data science. And we're able to actively and very seamlessly combine that with our offshore delivery model, so that we can take a client through all three phases of the Digital Works methodology from what we call Idealab through Collaboratory and then through Foundry to create a seamless end-to-end scale experience for clients.","David Nelson - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasurer","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Look, the Healthcare segment was obviously strong. And just as a follow-up question on the integration of deals next year, just what would you expect we should look for in terms of impact, when you have a number of clients going through an integration like that?","And I guess on a related topic, TriZetto, I mean again, you said it, a great example of that. Where are we on synergies now? And then do you have a pipeline of other types of deals like that that can make up for the \u2013 what could be potentially maybe slightly slower trends on integration in Healthcare for 2016?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's always difficult. And hey I wish I had a crystal ball. I don't on M&A. But if you think about historical M&A patterns, Darrin, traditionally M&A creates a substantial amount of technology and business process integration opportunity for us. And I feel like in many cases in the big mergers that have been announced, we serve both sides of the mergers. And so we are extremely well-positioned to be able to help with the technology and business process integration when those mergers come to pass.","And so I think that you might see \u2013 my best assumption is that you might see a temporary pause during the phase of integration planning. But then I think it'll result in significant M&A integration work for us, once integration kicks off and is in full swing. That's my best hypothesis at this point. Again no crystal balls here.","I would say that the pipeline of synergy opportunities between Cognizant and TriZetto is very strong. There are \u2013 I would say the synergies largely fall into a couple of different categories. We have great opportunities to take the TriZetto clients to \u2013 and offer them a broader range of Cognizant services around for example things like BP \u2013 the Business Process Services on top of the TriZetto platform, Cognizant Infrastructure Services to host and run the TriZetto platform.","And then in the medium and longer term we also have opportunities around Health Net style deals, utility type deals where we can work with TriZetto clients to take full end-to-end responsibility like we had proposed to do with Health Net some months ago. So we feel very good about the pipeline of opportunities that we have in around the TriZetto synergies.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And with that I think we have to bring the call to a close. So I just want to thank everybody for joining us today and thank you for your questions.

Our Q3 revenue was $3.45 billion, up 2.5% from Q2 and 8.4% from a year ago. This is within our guided range of $3.42 billion to $3.47 billion. These results were driven by growth across all of our industries. This was encouraging given the weakness in the pound sterling and the softness we've seen this year in our Financial Services segment stemming from macroeconomic concerns and in our Healthcare payers segment due to industry consolidation.","Turning to guidance, we're trimming the high end of our full-year revenue expectation and now expect our revenue to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion. This guidance include the absorption of an incremental $18 million negative impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling.","We're tightening our full-your non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $3.38 to $3.41. I'll talk more about the business in a moment and why we're well positioned going into 2017.","I'd like to take a moment to update you on the internal investigation we announced at the end of September. The investigation is focused on payments relating to permits for certain company-owned facilities in India and whether such payments were made improperly and a possible violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws.","First, I think it's important to note that we do not anticipate any impact on our ability to continue to provide the quality services our clients expect from us. Second, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q we filed this morning, we've identified approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments to-date. We've evaluated the effect of such payments and concluded that they are not material and do not require a restatement of our historical financial statements. Karen will provide additional details on this in a few minutes.","Third, and also disclosed this morning, we discovered in the course of the investigation that certain members of senior management may have been aware of or participated in the matters under investigation. Any such conduct would be inconsistent with our core values. Based on the results of the investigation to-date, those who may have been involved are no longer with the company or in the senior management position.","Finally, I would like to reaffirm our strong commitment to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We voluntarily disclose the matters under investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in September, and we've been fully cooperating with both agencies. Based on the results of the investigation to-date, we have already started and will continue to enhance our internal controls and compliance programs.","Let me now turn to the rest of the business. Today and moving forward, what remains most essential to Cognizant's success is our unwavering focus on our clients. Their changing needs are the inspiration for our strategy, and we are actively executing that strategy.","As we look ahead, we believe our market opportunity has never been greater. That's because with more technology in every product built and behind every customer experience and more data generated at every turn, our clients' businesses are and will continue to become increasingly technology-intensive.","Our opportunity then is to work with these clients to help them win by making the fundamental technology-enabled changes throughout their organizations that are required for them to compete in this new technology and data-intensive world.","We have spoken to you in past calls about our three strategic initiatives designed to enable this kind of work across our clients' businesses from front to back. We recently took an important step in executing this strategy by aligning and branding all our capabilities into three practice areas, Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations, and Cognizant digital systems and technology.","Our Cognizant digital business practice works with clients to reshape their products and business models and the resulting impact on how organizations interact with their customers, employees, and partners. Our approach combines data science, design thinking, and deep industry and process knowledge with solid technology capabilities to unite the physical and virtual aspects of a company's offering seamlessly across every channel. Together, we identify insights, develop business strategies, and design prototype and scale meaningful experiences.","Our Cognizant digital operations practice helps clients reengineer, digitize, manage, and operate their most essential business processes, lowering operating costs, improving user experience, and delivering better outcomes and top line growth. Across the practice, we are creating automated data-driven platforms and industry utilities. We help clients run better by applying traditional optimization levers, and we help them run differently by creating competitive advantage through process excellence which often leads to more effective operating models and corresponding top line revenue growth.","And our Cognizant digital systems and technology practice works with clients to simplify, modernize, and secure IT infrastructure and applications, unlocking the power trapped in their technology environments. We help client create and evolve systems that meet their needs in the modern enterprise by delivering industry-leading standards of performance, cost, and flexibility.","Now, the names of these practice areas reflect our belief that digital technology must be embedded as an integral part of all our offerings. All three practice areas work in close partnership with our vertical and geographic businesses and with Cognizant Business Consulting to ensure tight alignment and market relevance.","Let me underscore how central this is to what differentiates Cognizant. When we say digital, we're not talking just about building user interfaces or implementing digital marketing, but about creating industry-specific solutions woven deeply into the workings of an organization to create new levels of value enterprise-wide.","In summary, our clients are finding it unique and differentiating that Cognizant can consult with them to build digital businesses, operations, and systems. For example, we're helping insurance companies go beyond managing claims to preventing losses with the power of predictive analytics. We're working with healthcare companies to bring payers, providers, and patients together on an integrated platform that reduces waste and improves health outcomes. And we're helping manufacturers evolve from using stand-alone goods to orchestrating entire ecosystems of smart connected products.","But as much as we're focused on the opportunities of today, looking ahead of evolving clients' needs is one of Cognizant's core strength. We continue to develop innovative products and services, part of what you've heard us refer to as our Horizon 3 capabilities, through an internal investment program that powers long-term growth opportunities for Cognizant and our clients.","First, the Cognizant Global Technology office identifies the emerging technologies with the potential to create real business value. Then, Cognizant Accelerator scales the most promising technologies, productizing services, solutions, and business models and speeding them to market. Together, these teams have spearheaded our entry into SMAC and IoT for example. And today, they are working to realize the potential of developing technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and to incubate new IT-based offerings.","As we planned for 2017 and beyond, in addition to continuing to scale our comprehensive services portfolio, we're expanding our vertical and geographic focus as well. We're seeing increased traction with clients across Continental Europe, Asia-Pacific and the public sector who are finding our comprehensive capabilities unique in their markets.","In closing, it's clear that today our clients realize digital should be an enterprise-wide endeavor and that they need a comprehensive partner like Cognizant, capable of working across every aspect of the organization that technology should enrich: business, operations and systems.","Let me now turn the call over to our new President, Raj Mehta. On our last earnings call, we introduced you to Raj, a long-standing Cognizant leader. He's been a Cognizant associate since 1997, building strong relationships with clients throughout his 20 years at Cognizant, and leading many of our market-facing and delivery teams in driving industry-leading growth.","Now, as President, he has direct responsibility for the overall P&L of Cognizant's operations. Raj will talk to you about the success we're already having in executing our strategy from his perspective running these businesses. Raj?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad to be here and honored to be taking the role of President at this important time in Cognizant's journey. Anyone who has followed the company over the years knows that we stand for three things: our relentless focus on our clients; making sure we have a world-class teams that deliver consistently for them; and scaling our capabilities to address new client needs. I know we're succeeding when clients tell me that working with us feels different.","As we help clients with the shifts they need to make in the digital era, I'm doubling down on the principles that have made us successful, so far; client focus, world-class teams, and scaling capabilities while maintaining our flexible, collaborative way of working.","In working closely with clients across our industry businesses, we see that we face many of the same underlying challenges. They need to deliver the convenient experiences people expect today across their complex organizations. They need to develop an operational agility to respond to fast-changing business needs. They need to free up dollars to invest in innovation and transformation by optimizing and modernizing their legacy IT systems. It's these challenges that are practices Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technologies are focused on, helping clients answer. Working closely with Cognizant Business Consulting and domain experts from our industry businesses, we're creating frameworks, platforms, and solutions that clients are finding valuable as they pursue next-level savings and new revenue streams.","Now, I'll review the performance of each of our industry verticals, highlighting key trends and some of the areas we're focusing on with our clients.","Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 7.1% year over year. During Q3, the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the prolonged low-rate interest environment that we have commented on throughout 2016 continued to moderate spending at several of our larger banking clients. Our super-regional banking businesses continue to perform well as many of those clients look to us for solutions which both optimize cost and generate revenue.","While we've seen a slowdown in spending in recent months with several of our insurance clients who are also pressured by the low interest rate environment, demand has remained solid over the past year. Clients have been particularly interested in Cognizant digital operations solutions that transform underwriting and claims processes through managed services or other outcome-based delivery models.","Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, grew 3.5% sequentially and 5.7% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several of the largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our healthcare payer practice. Still, we remain positive that the fundamental shifts under way in the market will create long-term opportunities. Through solutions from our Cognizant digital operations practice that combine TriZetto software and Cognizant services, we are well positioned to help clients deal effectively with this disruption.","In our life sciences business, demand has picked up steadily over the past year as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In particular, we're seeing a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging analytics, cloud technologies, and platforms.","Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 2.8% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Strength in manufacturing helped to offset ongoing softness in retail. A number of retail clients have moderated their discretionary spending over this past year as consumer spending has been weak. Cognizant digital business has seen growing demand among manufacturing clients who want to help in transforming the products they make through sensors, IoT, and analytics. They are also looking for solutions that increase the productivity of core IT infrastructure and application services.","Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.7% sequentially and 13.6% year-over-year. Last quarter, we highlighted that macroeconomic uncertainty was causing a slowdown in decision making for our information, media, and entertainment clients. This has largely been offset by a rebound in our communications business.","Let me give you a few examples how Cognizant is partnering with clients in engagements that are pivoting their businesses and shifting their industries in meaningful ways. Let's talk first about KeyBank. Cognizant has partnered with KeyBank on a variety of different initiatives over the past 10 years, assisting in significant projects like the recent integration of their acquisition of First Niagara Bank.","Today, KeyBank wants to leverage digital to compete and lead in their category, and they started that journey with Cognizant. We are working together to simplify the way they do business and offer their customers streamlined experiences, financial wellness tools, and digital product offers and services.","Cognizant is helping with implementation of a transition to the Oracle Banking Platform. As part of our work, we're helping in delivering improved digital experiences on web and mobile interfaces, reengineering business processes, and enabling new technology architecture for the banks' retail digital channel. This retail digital channel modernization is the first wave of the transformation, but we'll expand the use of this platform to manage other core processes and to deliver new differentiated services to customers within the coming year.","Let me tell you about another project we're doing in the manufacturing space, helping a top five auto manufacturer change what people expect from their cars. As sales and developed markets plateau, our client is looking to serve new needs of their customers by offering a range of transportation services and solutions. We are their strategic partner helping to develop their strategy and user experiences and to build a platform that will be the backbone of an evolving new ecosystem of offerings.","While this platform will initially focus on areas such as parking, vehicle health, and retail and awards program, the data captured by their platform will eventually be used to model how people will move differently in the future. We will work with our client to develop this and other potential opportunities to expand the services that they offer to their customers.","Finally, I would like to highlight a growing part of Cognizant digital systems and technology where our deep knowledge of client legacy environments enable us to modernize their IT by migrating to cloud-based solutions, utilizing providers such as AWS. A couple of recent examples. We recently worked with LexisNexis to develop a cloud-based solution on AWS that supports search capabilities on a database of over 2 billion searchable documents on their news archive platform. For Sotheby's (18:39), we migrated their critical business applications including their flagship website from on-premise data center to AWS. For both clients, this is a major step forward towards the modernization of their IT infrastructure.","In future calls, you'll continue to hear more from me about what Cognizant and our clients are focusing on together, how we're building world-class teams to serve them better, and how we're scaling our capabilities to meet changing needs.","Now I'll turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial performance.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. As Raj mentioned, the business performed within expectations as third quarter revenue of $3.45 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 8.4%. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $24 million or approximately 70 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $42 million or 130 basis points.","Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.3% within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 was $0.01 above our guidance range of $0.82 to $0.85.","As a reminder, the remittance of cash from India to the U.S. that occurred in the second quarter had an incremental tax impact of $24 million in quarter three and is expected to have a similar impact in the fourth quarter. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.04 per share impact on our Q3 GAAP EPS that was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the nonrecurring nature of the transaction.","Before I provide a detailed commentary on the quarter's performance, let me provide some additional color on the ongoing internal investigation, which is being overseen by our Audit Committee. As Frank noted, based on the results of the investigation to-date, we are not restating our historical financial statements. At present, the investigation has identified a total of approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments for certain company-owned facilities in India. Of that amount, based on the preliminary results of the investigation to-date and as disclosed in our Form 10-Q and earnings release, we determined that it was appropriate at this time to record an out-of-period correction of $3.1 million related to certain of these payments.","Also, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q, we announced a determination of a material weakness as of December 31, 2015 and the subsequent interim period. As based on the results of the investigation to-date, certain members of senior management may have participated in or failed to take action to prevent the making of potentially improper payments by either overwriting or failing to enforce the controls established by the company relating to real estate and procurement principally in connection with permits for certain facilities in India. We have already taken and continue to take remediation measures in the areas of procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in India.","Now turning to third quarter performance. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.4% and 42.6% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 2.4% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 2.6% sequentially and 10.3% from Q3 a year ago, driven by strength across digital operations and the infrastructure portion of Cognizant digital systems and technology.","From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 3.3% sequentially and 7.9% year-over-year. Europe declined 1.7% sequentially after a 4.4% negative currency impact and grew 5.6% from last year after an 8.3% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp of work coming from recent wins particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The UK declined 5.7% sequentially and 2.3% year-over-year after a 7% and a 13.9% negative currency impact, respectfully. Continental Europe grew 3.5% sequentially and 17% over the prior year. We have established a solid foothold on the continent and expect this to continue to be a driver of future growth.","Finally, we saw a continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 3.8% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year. During the third quarter, 37.5% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 322. We added 11,500 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 16.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 350 basis points from the year-ago period. While attrition remained slightly elevated, we are pleased with the year-over-year decline as we continue to enhance our various employee engagement initiatives.","Total head count at the end of the quarter was 255,800 employees globally, of which 239,500 were service delivery staff. Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates in our training program, was 79%, and on-site utilization was 90% during the quarter.","Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was up by $390 million from the quarter ending June 30 and up by $861 million from the year-ago period.","Moving on to receivables which were $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 74.5 days. This is roughly flat with the last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $424 million, down from $451 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 58% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October, and the decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $900 million at the end of the quarter, and there were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility.","Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $594 million. Financing activities were a $119 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were $74 million during the quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased just over 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $145 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.5 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q3, we had repurchased 48.8 million shares for a total cost of $2 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $3 billion, we had approximately $1 billion remaining unutilized.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. For the full-year 2016, we are trimming the high end of our revenue expectations to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.51 billion including $18 million of incremental negative currency impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling.","As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice, and fewer billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth. During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.88.","Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 609 million shares.","For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.38 to $3.41. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 609.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 35%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.","Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you for releasing your 10-Q. Could you talk a little bit about the Financial Services vertical? And how much of the Q3 and particularly Q4 pace of business is sort of unique to this year and unique to the current challenging environment for your clients? And how much of it may be more secular in nature? Thank you.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Edward. This is Raj Mehta here. Look, we've talked about Financial Services in terms of some of the macroeconomic trends, especially around the low-rate interest environment. But I think it's important to note, it's not just banking, but it's across many of our industries we serve that technology is becoming more intensive to our clients, and our clients are becoming more dependent on technology and the data to compete. We continue to believe that the benefits of outsourcing, including the ability to attract talent, scale efficiently and bring deep technology and domain knowledge, have not changed, and the benefits clients can \u2013 they can't replicate that on their own.","So \u2013 in summary, right, the range of skills that are required, and the technology is broadened and not narrowed, and we're still very looking forward in terms of continuing to growing these businesses in that respect.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. Thanks for the FCPA update and the materiality stuff there. So, has the FCPA issue had any impact on the client side and on the investigation itself, what needs to happen from here for the issue to be resolved? Could there be any additional costs to remedy the internal controls, for example? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hey, Tien-Tsin. It's Frank. Look, I would say, it's business as usual in terms of serving clients at this point. As I said, we expect no impact on our ability to provide high-quality services to clients, and in fact, haven't seen any. The fundamentals are we've got great associates doing good work every day on behalf of our clients, and I think our clients recognize that. The investigation is ongoing. I don't want to speculate on how long it's going to take or the costs that may be associated with it going forward, but our commitment is to conduct a thorough investigation and we're committed to doing that.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment at least on the Healthcare vertical. You've had some pretty large customers there that have throttled back on spending all year. Any conversations with them that might indicate the tenor or demeanor of their spending in the next year, should those investigations be resolved? I understand they're right around the corner, so I don't know what their spending intentions are or if you'd talked to them with regard to contingency plans one way or the other.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah, it's Frank. Let me try to take a stab at that. Look, I think the Healthcare business at Cognizant \u2013 before I talk about the specifics, let me just back this up, right. I think that Healthcare particularly as it relates to the Healthcare payers is really a core area of deep, deep strength at Cognizant. It has historically been one of our strongest verticals and with the addition of the capabilities from the TriZetto acquisition, I think it further strengthened our position there. The combination of Cognizant's services capabilities with TriZetto's platform capabilities has enabled us to create a truly unique platform-based offering in that marketplace, and we continue to see good traction in services and solutions that combine TriZetto's software and Cognizant's core services capabilities.","The pipeline of opportunities around that area remains robust, and I continue to be optimistic about the opportunities there. Offsetting that, as we've said to you over the course of this year, is some slowness in the spending from the biggest payers who are particularly the ones that are involved in the potential large combinations. It's a little too early to forecast what happens with those payers as we go into 2017, but as a general matter, I would say that we have seen them slow spending, discretionary spending, through this period of uncertainty. And so, as though situations get resolved one way or the other, my expectation is that we have a great portfolio of services to offer that group of customers, and we will be as relevant if not more relevant than we've ever been to serving those needs of those customers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about Cognizant Business Consulting? Just an observation that many of the winners, so far, in digital have been some of the very high-end private consultancies. And I'm curious to know, kind of I know you've got Cognizant Business Consulting, kind of what you're doing to continue to develop that business as well as how you're seeing demand for digital evolving and whether it's kind of moving beyond kind of the high-end consulting tip of the spear and into more, I'd say, mainstream IT services at this point.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Lisa. It's Frank. Let me try to address that. So, let me start with the three practice areas that we discussed on the call today. We've refocused and rebranded our offerings under these three broad practice areas. Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations, and Cognizant digital systems and technology. And it's not an oversight that the word digital appears in all three of the practice names. The reason is that as we've said to you for quite some time now, our core and fundamental belief is that digital technology is really embedded in all areas in all aspects of our business in some way, shape or form.","And so, Cognizant digital business uses digital technologies to create and deliver meaningful business experiences for clients. Cognizant digital operations uses digital technology to enable and automate core business operations in our clients' core transaction processing areas. And then, of course, Cognizant digital systems and technology is focused on modernizing, securing, and scaling legacy technology environment. Digital exists in all those places, and to your question about CBC or Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Business Consulting is really an enabler across all three of those practice areas. The Business Consulting capability is woven in across all of those three practice areas, and really a lot of the work that we are doing today in Cognizant Business Consulting is what I consider to be tip of the spear kind of work that then leads to downstream work in one or more of those three big practice areas. We've clearly seen digital move beyond just high-end consulting to implementation.","Raj, for example, spoke in his prepared comments about the work we're doing to migrate \u2013 that we've done to migrate two big clients to a cloud-based AWS environment, that's an example of sort of what I think of as core technology work that's enabled by new digital technologies, and like that across all the practices we're seeing, not just tip of the spear consulting work, but also downstream implementation work that relates to digital.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Just wanted to ask about the impact of business due to departure of former President, Gordon Coburn, any big reaction out of clients? And then just secondly quickly, Karen any impact to the non-GAAP tax rate due to the internal investigation? Thanks so much.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Let me talk about Gordon's departure. I would say that Raj has been a Cognizant veteran for 20 years. Raj has run most of the business operations of the company, the business development, front-end sales and also the delivery operations for several years now. And so, I would say the transition has been seamless. Raj is supported by a very strong team of Cognizant veterans who have been around the company for many, many years. And so, I would say that transition has been seamless. Our platforms business or what we are now referring to as Cognizant digital operations business reports to me at this point, I have direct oversight on that part of the business. And let me turn it over to Karen on the tax rate question.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Sure. So, Bryan, there was certainly no impact on the non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter based on the investigation. So during the quarter, there were two things that happened related to the investigation, we talked about the out-of-period adjustment of $3.1 million that we've recorded. And then, obviously we had some professional fees in conjunction with the investigation that's ongoing, but those were recorded both in our GAAP and in our non-GAAP financial statements. The tax rate did come out a little bit lower than we expected for the quarter, but that was just based on the settlement of some discrete items in the quarter. Nothing to do with the investigation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. I understand digital can be seen across the business, but just given how much of a driver it is now, is there any way to quantify the actual percentage of your revenue you'd consider digital and kind of what the growth rate is relative to what we've seen in some of your competitors? And then, just for Karen, can you just revisit the strategy again over margins, the stability of margins and the capital return strategy around potential buybacks, given \u2013 in light of what's now a somewhat slower top line trend? Thanks, guys.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Sure. So, Darrin, I'll take both of those. So, on the first one, on digital, as we've talked about, and I think we demonstrated in our conversation today around the script, right, we think that digital is becoming really an enterprise-wide initiative. And as we've said, we think that the definition of digital and how people think about digital revenue will continue to evolve in the coming months and quarters. And so, we have been reluctant frankly to define digital because we don't think there is a clear digital definition across the industry today. And we've talked about this notion of digital, started in the front-office and now has increasingly moved to the mid-office and the back-office, and hence, the alignment of our three practices that we talked about around digital business, digital operations, and digital systems and technology, which I think starts to get at that notion that it really has become an enterprise-wide initiative for both clients and ourselves.","And increasingly, we think it will impact all of the segments of the business. In fact, it already is today. So, we have been reluctant to break out what's digital because how do you define a project, whether it's got a digital component to it or is the entire project digital? So, I think those definitions in the market will continue to evolve, and we'll continue to focus on that. I think in terms of margins, clearly, we have talked about staying in the 19% to 20% range. We have done that historically, and I think certainly for the foreseeable future, people should expect that that is a comfortable range for us to operate in.","Obviously, it gives us room to make investments to grow the business. Those investments continue to shift as we look at more platforms, as that business continues to expand, as we continue to expand new skill sets and new offerings to support the digital marketplace. Those are most of the investments that we continue to focus on, but I think from a modeling perspective, you should expect us to stay in the 19% to 20% range. From a capital allocation perspective, there's really no change in our strategy there. I think as we said in the past, people should expect that over the course of a year, we will essentially maintain share neutrality. We have the buyback program available to us, and we will use that as and when we think it's appropriate to do that, and obviously, we demonstrated that with the number of shares that we bought back in Q3. And we still have about $1 billion left under that program as we look forward into Q4 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Given the Q4 growth rate you're guiding to implicitly in around 8% or so, can you kind of give us a sense about based on the backlog of business you see heading into say Q1 or in the beginning of 2017, whether you see that as a kind of a sustainable growth rate at least in the short term given some of the pressures near term that you mentioned before?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Jim, this is Karen. I think it's premature to comment on Q1 or 2017. Clients are just getting under way with their budgets, and so we will obviously work with them on those budgets as we get further into this quarter. And when we release earnings and provide full-year guidance in February, we'll provide an update at that time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. I want to ask a question, Frank, similar to past question. But if I look at Wipro, Infosys, TCS, and Cognizant both for the reported results of September and guidance and Street numbers for December, it suggests that the industry is growing around 8%. And part of that, ADM is growing less than 5%. And so, as we begin to reflect on calendar year 2017, I'm wondering what's different as we look at 2017 that's going to allow Cognizant to grow at something better than 8%. And part of the question is driven by for the past number of years, probably five years, Cognizant has provided guidance for a full calendar year that's below the Street expectations. So, Frank, I was wondering if you wanted to make any comments on the industry. And the second part of that is how willing would you be, Frank, to pursue M&A that would pressure margins in order to capture some incremental revenue growth? Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hi, Keith. So, there were a number of \u2013 I think a number of questions, and I will try to get to each of them. I would say that at a macro level, our industry is one \u2013 well, first of all, the world continues to become more technology and data intensive. So, that's sort of the 50,000 foot view. Technology is becoming more complex to implement the skill set, as Raj pointed out in his I think Q&A a minute ago, we have a much broader range of skills that are required to implement new technologies today.","And so, we believe that that makes services firms like Cognizant as relevant if not more relevant than we've been in the past. It's also a fragmented industry, so the opportunity to gain market share and the opportunity to capture markets is very much there.","And we believe that if you drill down further that when you look at our footprint of industries that we serve, if you look at the footprint of geographies that we currently operate in, there remain significant growth opportunities in places where we are underpenetrated.","And so, when you put all of that together, we believe that we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us, that our ability to invest to capture those growth opportunities exists in the company with our financial formula, and so that forms a core thesis and a core basis for how we think about the business going forward.","As it relates to acquisitions, we've said that we will continue to focus. We have a robust M&A program. We look at traditionally smaller tuck-in acquisitions. That's been the primary focus. We will continue to do that. I would expect that as we go forward, you'll see us focus on those kinds of acquisitions.","I would expect that we would be more focused on digital and making digital acquisitions as we look to the next few quarters to bolster our digital capability. I think we've got good strong digital capabilities, but particularly as we look to new industries and geographies, I think you'll see us using inorganic means to grow faster there.","Typically, when we do small acquisitions, the margin profile of those companies may not be where the Cognizant margin profile is, but through our ability to largely keep to cross-sell their services into our core business, we're rapidly able to bring them to Cognizant average margins.","And so, I expect we'll continue to do that. For the small tuck-ins, if there's an acquisition that, when we buy it not at Cognizant margins, I'm not too concerned about that because we've shown that we can bring those back up to Cognizant levels through our ability to cross-sell.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I wanted to come at the digital question a little differently. Maybe you can give us some color on how you're measuring success in that business internally and how you're staffing for it. I think the Street has heard some others frame their exposure, and it would be helpful just to be able to measure how you stack up or to have a little bit more information so we can understand your positioning in that business. Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","I think the primary measure that we are using \u2013 Joe, it's Frank \u2013 is what portion of our existing client base is engaging us on digital capabilities in some way, shape or form. Now, as Karen said, there's a question of how we define digital. What we are doing is looking at our newest service offerings and making sure that as our clients define digital \u2013 and each of our clients define digital in a slightly different way \u2013 that we are engaged with them in their most important and strategic engagements.","That's always been the way that we've defined success at Cognizant. We define success really through the eyes of our customers, and our primary goal is to make sure that with our customers that we are engaging with them in the technology-driven, technology-enabled initiatives that are most important to them at any given point in time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Frank, I want to go back to a previous response that you'd given where you kind of said that the ability to provide high-quality services continues and so on, but that really has never been in doubt. I think maybe the real question is, are there clients who are sort of in a wait-and-see mode because of the ongoing investigation, because they maybe want some sort of an external approval of your processes and so on. Are you seeing any impact from the client side? And is that potentially \u2013 because I haven't heard you mention the ability to add $1.5 billion of revenue next year, which you've mentioned the previous couple of calls, perhaps at least in the last call. Could you comment on those?","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","I would say, Ashwin, that we haven't, as I said \u2013 let me be more specific. We haven't seen clients beyond what I would consider to be the normal course of business slowing down in any way. I would say that it's a little too early to look at 2017 as we've said. And so, I don't want to be providing a view of 2017. As Karen mentioned, right now, we want to get through our clients' budget cycles. Those are just beginning as you know. That's been our traditional pattern. There's no difference from prior years, and once we get through that process, I think we'll be in a better position to give you a sense of where 2017 lands. I think we'll be looking at Financial Services and Healthcare in particular as we go into 2017 since those were the two industry groups that for reasons that we've discussed with you at length, didn't perform as we would have liked this year, and so we'll be looking to those as we go into 2017.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. I guess, it relates to the full-year guide. You obviously lowered the high end of the guide perhaps as a combination of sort of being in the midpoint of the range this quarter, but more broadly, I just want to get a sense for the business environment both fundamentally and overall from a macro perspective relative to let's say three months ago. And maybe at a high level sort of, maybe Karen can describe why the high end of the guide comes down. Obviously, we got the incremental FX in there, but any other factors? And as it relates to the FCPA investigation, are we confident at this point that it's been fully scoped at that kind of $5 million or so range? And I guess, I was surprised at how quickly you've sort of gotten clarity on this.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Glenn, let me take a stab at that. I think in terms of the business environment, I wouldn't actually say there's really been any change in the last three months. So, obviously, earlier in the year, we had talked about sluggishness in Financial Services and Healthcare, and then over the summer, post the Brexit vote, while we haven't seen disruption I would say specific to Brexit, we certainly saw some concern among insurance clients as well as Financial Services, and we talked about that on our last call. I wouldn't say there's really been any change in that environment or deterioration in that environment. I think it continued as it was in the quarter or in Q3. Obviously, the pound has deteriorated and so that resulted in an additional $18 million negative headwind as we went into Q4 based on that.","And if we had left the range where it was for Q4, obviously, it would have been a very broad range and certainly, more significant growth than we'd ever added in Q4. And we thought it was appropriate to taper the top end of the growth range down into something that we thought was more reasonable based on typical buying patterns in Q4 given the fact that there are lower bill days, there are furloughs, the retail practice, as you know, shuts down quite significantly in Q4 as retail clients get ready for the holiday. They shut down all discretionary spending typically right about now. So, I think what we're seeing in Q4 is a very typical seasonal pattern for the business other than the impact of the FX. And I'm sorry. Can you repeat your question about the FCPA investigation?","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Are you confident that you fully scoped it at the $5 million and how did you get clarity so quickly?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. My apologies. So, it is early days in the investigation. I think, as we've said both in the Q and on the script today, we are continuing to pursue the investigation. We've obviously been working very, very hard to get our arms around this as quickly as we could. And as we said, we've identified to-date $5 million of potential improper payments. We were able to get to a place where we thought it was appropriate to record the $3.1 million of the $5 million as an out-of-period adjustment in Q3, but we will continue the investigation until we're confident that we've tracked it all down.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Okay. I think we're just about out of time, folks. So, I want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology third quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasurer","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2016 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com.","In addition to the traditional speakers on our earnings calls, Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer, we are delighted that Raj Mehta, CEO, IT Services, will join our calls beginning with this quarter. Raj is a long time key executive at Cognizant who leads our industries, geographies and delivery operations on a global basis. Adding Raj to the call will enable us to provide you with additional color on our operations and business opportunities.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our Q2 revenue was $3.37 billion, up 5.2% from Q1 and 9.2% from a year-ago and was within our guided range of $3.34 billion to $3.40 billion. Against the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment and market environment and a slow start to the year, we executed well last quarter and we continue to gain market share.","The quarterly sequential dollar growth was one of the strongest in our history, as we added incremental revenues of almost $170 million. This performance represented broad-based growth across service lines, geographies and industries. As we had anticipated after a slow start in Q1, our financial services and healthcare segments turned in positive sequential growth in Q2.","As we enter the second half of the year, we see certain macroeconomic factors as well as some softness in clients' discretionary spending that'll affect our revenue growth primarily from financial services and healthcare clients. Additionally, we anticipate a further negative revenue impact of approximately $40 million for the second half of the year due to the weakening of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote.","For these reasons, we're revising our full-year revenue growth guidance to a range of $13.47 billion to $13.60 billion, while maintaining our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance within a range of $3.32 to $3.44.","Gordon, Raj and Karen will expand more on the cyclical weakness that we are facing in the short-term. As you listen to their comments, I'd like to emphasize that the medium-term to long-term fundamentals of our business are strong. We continue to see significant market opportunity; and more importantly, gain market share.","Digital transformation continues to be a strong driver for demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors, while innovating to create new areas of growth and differentiation.","Given this context, we continue to invest in three strategic areas based on the conviction that true digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes throughout their organizations, from the front office through the middle office and to the back office systems. These three areas will provide the framework for how we think about growing our business going forward.","The first strategic initiative is to help our clients build new frontend capabilities, enabled by digital technologies that create personalized experiences for their customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. Clients recognize our strong digital capabilities, having called out the trend in SMAC over five years ago. We continue to see great success in building out our digital capabilities through investing organically as well as through select acquisitions.","We just announced the acquisition of Idea Couture, which will become part of Cognizant Digital Works. As you will recall, Cognizant Digital Works brings together human insight, strategy, design, technology and industry expertise to create innovative solutions at enterprise scale to help clients succeed in this new digital economy.","Idea Couture is a digital innovation firm that operates at the intersection of strategy and technology and specializes in designing and prototyping products, services, and business models for growth and competitive advantage.","Idea Couture serves some of the largest firms in the world including Samsung, ConAgra Foods and Pepsi. This was our sixth investment in the digital space, building on prior acquisitions of Cadient, KBACE, itaas and Odecee, in addition to our recent strategic investment in ReD Associates. Collectively, we have deployed over $200 million in capital across these digital investments.","The second strategic initiative is to drive new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the core transaction processing operations of our clients, by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in a Business Process as a Service or BPaaS model that allows clients to shift from buying a service to buying an outcome.","We've developed a number of platform-based solutions across our industry practices, and the result of these investments is best illustrated by our significant progress in the healthcare vertical, where we've been able to successfully combine TriZetto software with Cognizant's technology and operations capabilities.","Since our TriZetto acquisition, we have signed several large platform-based deals with a combined TCV, or total contract value, approaching $2 billion, including the program at EmblemHealth that we spoke about last quarter. And we're pursuing a number of additional similar opportunities in the market.","The third strategic initiative is to transform clients' existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT to help them harness the potential from digital technologies. This includes a simplification of how applications are developed and delivered along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost.","We're making good progress in each of these areas, and we're confident that this framework will differentiate our services and solutions in the marketplace now and in the future. In closing, I'd like to emphasize that we've been through periods of market volatility in the past. While macroeconomic factors such as what we experienced this quarter are not within our control, we're confident that we will execute well through this cycle and continue to gain market share.","So with that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss the current demand environment; to Raj to discuss our business performance; and then to Karen to provide more financial details. Gordon?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start by providing some additional context on the specific short-term headwinds that are leading us to revise this year's revenue guidance.","First, as we indicated on our last two earnings calls, discretionary spending in the banking sector remained soft, weighed down by macroeconomic concerns and a prolonged low interest rate environment. While we did see a return to healthy sequential growth in the second quarter, we expect banking discretionary spending during the second half of 2006 (sic) [2016] to be slower than we anticipated three months ago.","Complicating the situation, of course, is the uncertainty arising from the Brexit vote in the UK. Economic growth forecasts and short-term to medium-term interest rate projections have generally been revised down since the vote.","Given this new development, we see the banking sector being more cautious in spending over the near-term, and therefore, we believe it is prudent to err on the side of caution in banking and financial services revenue planning for the remainder of this year.","Second, the sharp weakening of the pound sterling will have a negative impact on our second quarter revenue of approximately $40 million, assuming the currency holds at current levels. As you know, the pound sterling has seen a 12% depreciation since the Brexit vote.","Third, as we indicated to you at the beginning of this year, consolidation within the U.S. healthcare industry has impacted the revenue growth of our healthcare practice. Given the status of the M&A regulatory approval process, we anticipate that project spending will continue to slow for clients involved in these consolidations for the remainder of the year.","Finally, we're also seeing customer pullback on discretionary spending in other pockets of our business. For example, some clients within our information services practice are taking a more moderate approach to spending as we go into the back half of the year.","While we're taking a cautious approach to our revenue expectations for the remainder of 2016, we believe that the medium-term to long-term outlook for our business remains as strong as ever. The pipeline is healthy, and we continue to make investments in skills and capabilities that will help us meet our clients' evolving need to simultaneously run-better and run-different.","I'd like to take a moment to outline three trends that are driving client demand and our optimism for the medium-term and long-term outlook for our business. You'll see that these trends are the basis for the investment areas that Frank described a few moments ago.","First, in the shift to digital, there's a greater sense of urgency among CXOs to build new innovative models to drive revenue growth and create differentiation in the market. I see this in almost every client meeting I attend, regardless of industry. These conversations have evolved from a discussion of SMAC, which is now table stakes, to the exploration and execution in areas such as artificial intelligence, IoT ecosystems, augmented reality, adaptive manufacturing and blockchain, just to name a few.","Digital is no longer about deploying new technologies. Rather, it's an integration of insights, strategy, design, technology and industry knowledge to create new capabilities that can distinguish a client in the market. We've invested heavily over the past several years in building true leading world-class digital capabilities, an achievement which has now begun to become well-recognized in the market.","Second, there's a growing realization that there's a difference between doing digital and being digital. For example, clients understand that the mobile enablement of an enterprise app, while necessary, is not sufficient to take on digital disruptors in their industry. Digital transformation requires a fundamental change not just to clients' front office capabilities, but across their entire business and technology architectures in both their mid and back offices to create nimble, efficient and innovative ways to meet customer demands.","Given the existing infrastructure investments of our enterprise clients, we believe that the winning model for many is a hybrid model, combining aspects of their heritage or legacy infrastructure with new digital technologies. This belief is core to our strategy going forward. Our intimate knowledge of core business and legacy infrastructure and business processes across our clients' mid and back offices, combined with our leading-edge digital capabilities, as required in the front office, give us a highly differentiated offering and value proposition in the market today.","Finally, the drive for getting continued efficiencies from existing IT infrastructure to be able to fund innovation projects remains absolutely essential to almost every client. This in turn leads to a demand for more automation, simplified application development methods, process efficiencies, platform-based solutions and industry utilities.","Our strong vertical presence and investments in building sharply focused industry-specific platforms allow clients to obtain these efficiencies by shifting from buying a service to buying an outcome. These trends will continue to open opportunities for us over the coming years.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Raj to provide additional details on our business performance.","Rajeev Mehta - CEO-Information Technology Services","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to be here today and look forward to interacting more with the investment community going forward. Let me now provide some additional color on our performance across industries and geographies.","Our banking and financial services segment was up 5.1% sequentially and 8.1% year-over-year. As expected, banking and financial services returned to positive sequential growth in Q2. Due to the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the prolonged low interest rate environment, we expect spending within banking to be sluggish during the second half of 2016 and revenue for our BFS segment to be up slightly sequentially for Q3 and Q4.","Within our insurance practice, demand remains solid, particularly for solutions which help transform the claims and underwriting processes and deliver greater efficiencies, increasingly through managed services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, we've seen an increasing demand for solutions which help clients rationalize and transform their infrastructure landscape.","Our healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients grew 4.9% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our healthcare payer practice.","However, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment, as the industry embarks on a fundamental change in the business model. This is driven by the Affordable Care Act, and changing regulatory environment, consumerization of healthcare, and an increased focus on medical cost.","In this rapidly changing environment, it is critical that payers have solutions in place that can both drive efficiencies and adapt to ongoing regulatory and technological changes. We're able to offer clients such solutions through our combined TriZetto software with Cognizant services. Last quarter, we spoke about a large healthcare deal that we launched with EmblemHealth, leveraging the TriZetto platform. This program continues to ramp up as expected.","Moving on to our life science business, we saw strong demand in the quarter driven by a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as advanced data analytics. As drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, we expect this to drive demand in our life sciences practice.","Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 4.4% sequentially and 14.2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in manufacturing and logistics. We're seeing growing demand for solutions, which leverage our ability to integrate multiple service lines as front-end digital technologies such as IoT are being scaled and integrated across the organization.","We are building deeper partnerships with many of our manufacturing clients by proposing innovative solutions, which harness the power of data from connected products to help them optimize their product portfolios, addressing key business problems and driving sources of revenue growth. For example, our client one of the world's largest auto manufacturers is rolling out the deployment of telematics across all new cars by next year.","As you know telematics tracks a variety of items relative to driving, including maintenance, driver safety and road emergencies. While the client is looking to enhance its relationship with its customers, they're also concerned with the risk associated with the rollout of this new digital technology at an enterprise scale.","Cognizant will combine its design, technology and business process expertise to create a scalable solution that manages both customer satisfaction and helps to run the transaction processing and telematics operations efficiently. Additionally, we will leverage predictive analytics to anticipate issues and create valuable insight to support future product development.","Our other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients was up 8.1% sequentially and 11.2% year-over-year, driven by both telecom and technology clients, as we continue to expand our range of services.","Let me now quickly turn to our Horizon 2 services lines. Cognizant business consulting, infrastructure services and business process services. Our Horizon 2 strategy has worked with all three service lines having reached a critical mass at a combined $3 billion run rate and continuing to grow faster than the company average. These services are an integral part of the digital platform and next-generation IT solutions we are building out for our clients.","From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.1% sequentially and 8.3% year-over-year. Europe was up 4.1% sequentially and 8.9% over last year after a 2.9% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp-up of work with recent wins, particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The UK grew 4% sequentially and 4.4% year-over-year and Continental Europe grew 4.4% sequentially and 15.5% over the prior-year.","Finally, we saw continued traction in the rest of the world, which was up 10.8% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in the key markets such as Singapore, India and Australia.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Karen.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $3.37 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of almost $170 million, or 5.2% sequentially. Revenue increased by 9.2% year-over-year, including a negative currency impact of $25 million or 80 basis points.","Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 20.3%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb our compensation increases which will take effect during the third quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 was also above our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.82 due to a slightly lower tax rate and stronger operating margins.","During the quarter, we executed a one-time remittance of cash from India to the U.S. and to other international markets. This will provide additional financial flexibility in funding our strategic investments to drive long-term growth for Cognizant.","Let me provide you some additional color on this transaction. In May, our India subsidiary received approval to repurchase stock worth $2.8 billion from certain of its shareholders, which are non-Indian Cognizant entities. This repurchase resulted in a one-time remittance of $1 billion to the U.S. net of taxes, with the other $1.6 billion to other non-India overseas locations. This buyback also resulted in a one-time tax impact of $190 million in the second quarter with approximately $24 million incremental tax impact expected in each of the third and fourth quarters this year. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.31 per share impact on our Q2 GAAP EPS, but was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the non-recurring nature of this transaction.","Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.5% and 42.5% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 4.6% sequentially and 9.3% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 6.2% sequentially and 9.1% from Q2 a year-ago.","During the second quarter, 37.6% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 315.","We added 11,300 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 17.1% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 200 basis points from the year-ago period. Total head count at the end of the quarter was 244,300 employees globally, of which 229,400 were service delivery staff.","Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was 79%, and on-site utilization was 91% during the quarter.","Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by $30 million from the quarter ending March 31. In addition to a payment of $134 million for withholding taxes related to the aforementioned share repurchase of our India subsidiary, we also paid down the $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver during the quarter. Our cash and short-term investments, net of debt were up by $1.1 billion from the year-ago period.","Moving on to receivables, which were $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74 days. This is flat with last quarter and up from 72 days in Q2 of 2015. Our unbilled receivables balance was $451 million, up from $432 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 55% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $909 million at the end of the quarter. There were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility.","Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $360 million, financing activities raised $143 million use of cash during the quarter and capital expenditures were $75 million during the quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased just over 840,000 shares for a total cost of $50 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.8 million shares for the quarter.","As of the end of Q2, we had repurchased 46.3 million shares for a total cost of $1.9 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. Our board of directors has approved an increase of the company's stock repurchase program by $1 billion, from $2 billion to $3 billion, and an extension of the program until December 31, 2018. This reflects our confidence in our business and our commitment to driving shareholder value.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full-year. In the weeks since Brexit, there have been significant fluctuations in global exchange rates and particularly the British pound, which has declined 12% versus the U.S. dollar since June 23 and 14% year-over-year.","The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not consider potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year. For the full-year 2016, we have revised our revenue expectations to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.60 billion, which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%.","For the third quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.43 billion to $3.47 billion. During the third quarter and for the full-year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%.","For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.82 to $0.85. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization.","For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a one-time incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 30.5%, including an approximate $24 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.","For the full-year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44. This guidance anticipates the full-year share count of approximately 610.2 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 36%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.","Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question only. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. The prepared remarks were helpful, but just wanted to ask about the outlook. I guess not surprised with the lower revenue outlook but it's the second cut here this year. What I wanted to ask, is the business just getting harder to predict for maybe secular reasons, or is the macro just getting really tough on some of your larger clients? Just trying to understand the secular versus the cyclical side of things.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Tien-tsin, it's Gordon. It's a bit both. Certainly the macroeconomic environment has gotten tougher to predict, both \u2013 certainly the UK vote and not necessarily the direct impact but the indirect impact of a more sustained lower interest rate environment, was certainly a surprise to us and it would have been tough to predict, and it was a surprise to our banking and insurance clients, and you're seeing the impact on that. So that sort of thing is tough to predict. Obviously some of the uncertainty around the U.S. elections creates some uncertainty.","In terms of structural things for us, the business, when you think about digital and so forth tends to be more \u2013 a little bit more project-oriented. But those are swings we go back and forth on. So, I wouldn't argue that there's any long-term structural change in the ability to predict the business. Short-term, there is a bit.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Yeah \u2013 no, certainly, a lot of surprises going on. Just as a quick follow-up, just the repatriation of cash, is the priority there to buy back stock, or are there some larger acquisitions maybe you want to do in the U.S. or Europe?","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","So, Tien-tsin, this is Karen. So, I mean I think as we've talked about, we do want to ramp up the volume of M&A, not necessarily large-scale deals, but certainly more transactions. And you've seen that with Idea Couture and our investment in ReD and so forth this year. So certainly, we will look to deploy that cash effectively, looking to use it to invest in growth for the business.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And on share repurchases, as we said historically, our target is to maintain share neutrality. But we are also opportunistic depending on valuation of the stock.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the update.","David Nelson - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasurer","Operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Karen, I know recently at some conferences, you stated that Cognizant is likely only to grow organically a max $1.5 billion in any given year. So, I guess that limits your top line growth rate as Cognizant gets larger. So trying to figure out what else you guys can do to grow EPS. Is it time to expand operating margins? Because essentially, I mean \u2013 we're only going to grow EPS at about 10% at top line so looking to grow that level, and then as we get larger, it's only going to get smaller. So, what are we going to offset that to be able to grow EPS? Is it margins or buybacks or what else can we do?","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","So, Bryan, I think what we've been saying is, if you look historically, right, we've been averaging roughly $1.5 billion over the last several years. And that's true, if you look at all large services organizations, right. There aren't many organizations that have grown organically, consistently, more than $1.5 billion a year. Now that's not to say that there won't be years where you can and that's not to say that organizations can't do that. We've sort of been referring to what we've done historically. And particularly as people try to think about long-term growth rates and percentage growth, which obviously comes down over time due to the law of large numbers.","I think, certainly we will look to continue to drive growth both organically and inorganically. As we've said, we clearly look to increase the volume of M&A transactions that we're doing. We continue to believe there's significant opportunity in the market for us to grow and continue to take market share. And certainly, at this point, we believe that the 19% to 20% non-GAAP operating margin that we've historically provided will continue to be an appropriate range for us. It gives us the flexibility to continue to grow the business, while maintaining a strong financial performance.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Bryan, it's Frank. I'll just add to that and say that, I don't think there's anything inherent or magical about a $1.5 billion number, particularly given the structure and dynamics of our industry. If you think about our industry, it's highly fragmented. Nobody has a dominant market share. The ability to take share from each other, and not to mention the fact that technology overall in the economy is playing a much larger role, I think the growth opportunities are significant. So, I think you should look at the $1.5 billion as in the historical context, but I wouldn't necessarily use that as a rate limiter for our growth going forward.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Frank, and just as a follow-up, you mentioned that you guys are taking share, but if I look at your growth rates for 2016, they do appear lower than peers. So, just want to make sure what you mean by that comment. Is that a going-forward comment, or is that something else you guys are looking at that says you guys are taking share? Thanks so much.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's important when you look at the taking share comment, to look at a couple things. First of all, over a long period of time, I think we have been taking share and if you look at the long-term trajectory as we continue to invest in the business, we create disproportionately larger growth opportunities for ourselves, which allows us to take share.","I think looking at percentage growth rates is only one part of the equation, because that doesn't adjust for size of organization. I think a very interesting number to look at in that context is incremental dollars added. If you look for example, this quarter, we added close to $170 million of incremental revenue in the quarter. And so if you, in a sense, think about that as being a proxy for market share gain, I think it tells the story that supports our thesis, that we can continue to grow and take market share ahead of competition by investing in the business.","David Nelson - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasurer","Operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Frank, Gordon, Karen, and welcome to the call, Raj. I want to talk about healthcare and the EmblemHealth deal that you announced, do you need additional regulatory approval to continue to ramp that? And I recall you had mentioned another similar deal in your pipeline. So, can you provide insight into that, as well as other deals that you may be looking at, in terms of forward growth trajectory?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Ashwin, it's Gordon. Happy to answer both those questions. In terms of regulatory approvals, Emblem's really best positioned to discuss regulatory requirements for their business; but from our perspective, for the work we're doing for them, we've obtained all the necessary approvals to move ahead with our work.","When we look more broadly at healthcare and end-to-end solutions, we're seeing a lot of interest in the market. And the reason why is, health plans are under tremendous pressure right now to keep rate reductions as low as possible. And we can really help them with that, with regulatory compliance, with not having to make investments on their own. So, we're seeing increasing interest as we roll out our healthcare platform-based solutions. We talked about the two big deals this year, one of them obviously we just discussed.","The other one continues to move along. I think in terms of when it will close, that's probably towards the very end of the year. But since we talked last three months ago and I look at the pipeline of activities, that continues to increase very nicely, obviously that will be revenue for next year.","But as we just recently sat down and did a review of our healthcare strategy and we concluded \u2013 we really have identified a market with the need in it, based on the changing dynamics in the industry and based on the unique capabilities that Cognizant has with a combination of the leading healthcare administration platform and just incredible domain expertise and technical expertise, so we feel really good about healthcare over the medium-term to long-term. Obviously, there are specific payers in the M&A process that are a headwind in the short-term.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And with regards to financial services, how much of your commentary has to do with specific dialog that you're having with your clients, that says that demand will be down versus your peers that demand could be down? And then is pricing a part of this discussion, as well?","Rajeev Mehta - CEO-Information Technology Services","Yeah. Hi, Ashwin. This is Raj here. Look, financial services was, obviously, we had a good quarter in Q2, but we've guided for a slower growth in Q3 and Q4. And part of that is, as we discussed right, some of the low interest rate environment of Brexit, so we do have many of our larger clients looking at in terms of how do we continue to drive efficiency and optimization?","So, I think it's actually a great opportunity for us, because it allows us to look at a greater percentage of the portfolio for our financial services accounts. It takes time to put all of these pieces together, but we think long-term that's a good opportunity for us to continue to drive synergies.","But, more importantly, in the financial services sector, we're seeing great traction right now in digital, especially around customer experience and the data analytics behind that. In addition to that, many of our clients now are looking at the private cloud and we're helping many of these large financial services customers in that effort. So, longer-term, we're seeing good traction there.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Ashwin, I would just say that, to your question about speculation versus certainty, you have to remember that our model is, our people are on the ground with our clients in financial services and in all the other sectors every day, we have people on the ground, at the client sites day-in and day-out. And so, the feedback we tend to get, tends to be relatively real-time and it tends to be relatively or rather it tends to be based on real conversations and real feedback we're getting from clients as opposed to hypothesis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Given just the relatively high exposure to the financials and healthcare verticals, where it looks like most of the macro deceleration is coming from, and I guess sector-specific. When considering just an overview of your overall assets, is there anything that Frank or Gordon, you can say you point to strategically that may be able to help reduce volatility associated with year-over-year revenue in any given quarter?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, Darrin, what I would say is, it's a great question. I would say that we continue to \u2013 I would say, if you look at the medium-term, the playbook is to really build out the three broad areas that I spoke about. Digital is a macro theme that I think has a lot of wind under its wings, I think we'll continue to invest organically and inorganically. The platforms business that I spoke about, we think there's a tremendous potential to take the success we've seen in healthcare to all of our other industries \u2013 all of the other industry groups that we serve.","I would say that, the TriZetto experience has been ahead of anything that we would have imagined it to be. We've ramped up TriZetto faster than we anticipated when we did the acquisition and I think that gives us a sense of confidence that the model works, that we can execute against the model. So, there's opportunities to take that to other industries.","And then, of course, the third area is so-called neXgen IT, where \u2013 as Raj said, we continue to feel like there's opportunities for us as our clients face tough macro environments for us to continue to optimize and bring new ways and innovative ways for them to be more efficient in how they run IT. So, that's where I think our focus is in the medium-term.","If you look out over the very long run, clearly our objective is to continue to build out in the non-healthcare and financial services parts of the economy. So, if you look at our manufacturing and logistics business, that's been doing well. We'll continue to invest there both inorganically and organically, and I would say, over the very long run this business needs to have a reasonable representation of our revenue coming from the sources of global GDP. And so, we have to continue to shift the business model, but obviously that's not something that happens overnight. That's a five-year to 10-year journey.","Gordon James Coburn - President","And Darrin, it's Gordon. Let me just add one more thought on that around platforms. As we ramp up our platform business, both within healthcare and into other industries, remember most of that, we're going to be bringing to market as a service, and this is core transactional work. So that over time will become a nice recurring revenue stream as it builds up. So, that's clearly part of our strategy as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could follow on to Tien-tsin's question regarding the repatriation of cash and prioritization of usage. Could you comment a little bit on M&A pipeline, and what that might look like? Certainly, we've seen the deals in the quarter and they seem to manage the limited cash in the U.S. And maybe as a follow-on to that, how much cash does this repatriation put into the U.S. as a percentage of total?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Let me have Karen comment on how much cash in the U.S. And then, let's spend a few minutes talking about M&A pipeline and strategy.","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, Brian, the repatriation resulted in $1 billion net of tax coming back to the U.S. And as you remember, we at the end of Q1 had $300 million, $400 million in the U.S. that was available for operating needs.","Gordon James Coburn - President","And from an acquisition perspective, our strategy remains consistent. We look at acquisitions for industry expertise, we look at acquisitions for geographic footprints and we look at acquisitions for service line and technology capability.","We have a healthy pipeline of opportunities in the digital space. These will tend to be smaller tuck-under acquisitions. We also have a nice pipeline of opportunities in the consulting space across industries as well as strength in our geographic footprint, particularly in Europe.","So, what I think you'll see is, you'll see a pickup in the pace of acquisitions; but I want to be clear, these continue to be small tuck-in acquisitions. We're getting really good at integrating these and capturing the value from acquisitions. We really have that down to a science now. So, we've expanded the team in these areas, but the core Cognizant growth will continue to be organic. But when we look at where acquisitions can supplement our capabilities to make us stronger in the market, we'll clearly do that.","And the final thing just to comment on is platform acquisitions. There \u2013 we'll look at those absolutely. We did the TriZetto acquisition almost two years ago. And platforms \u2013 certainly you have to make sure if you're going to do a platform acquisition you get enough that you have a base to build off of. So, those probably won't be as consistent or steady, but we'll certainly look at opportunities because we know in particular areas we want to be a leader in platforms.","Now some of that will be, we build it ourselves; some of it is, we'll partner with customers and take their systems and commercialize them and some like TriZetto will be, we'll go out and buy a leader in the market. So, you'll see all that happen, but certainly in the tuck-unders, you'll see a pickup in the pace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. The choppiness in the top line growth rate inevitably brings back in the more secular concerns around compression in IT services. So can you just describe, as you're having these strategic discussions with clients around the transformation they're trying to drive in their business, what are the implications for their overall IT budgets? Like up, down? And then also the component of budgets that they're expecting to be spending on services, like third-party services?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Lisa. It's Frank. Let me try to take a crack at that. Look, I think we've seen no evidence that IT budgets overall are coming down. If anything, I would characterize IT budgets as flat to moderately up over time. There may \u2013 in some clients, as we've said in our prepared comments, there might be sort of short-term pressure, discretionary spending gets put off because of something going on in the macro. But as a big picture, I don't see any evidence that says that budgets are down. I would characterize them as flat to up.","I think if you look inside of that and unpack it a little bit, there is a shift going on. We are seeing the clients looking to be more efficient, drive better total cost of ownership on what I consider to be the run-the-business kind of activities, so that they can redeploy them into the change-the-business or digital or cloud kinds of activities.","I think that that shift benefits IT services firms, frankly. When you look at the landscape on digital, the technology landscape in digital is very fragmented. There are no clear leaders in digital right now in the technology landscape from an underlying stack standpoint, and so that requires almost every digital deployment to be \u2013 requires it to have very heavy integration kinds of work.","And so, when you look at the digital landscape, there's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done both from an upfront strategy, design, human sciences standpoint to envision the future with the client; but then equally importantly on the downstream, build, integrate, test, deploy. All of that creates tremendous opportunities for services firms.","So, I think that net-net, there's a shift going on. Budgets aren't shrinking meaningfully. There's a shift going on inside of budgets, and I think firms that have capabilities on both sides, the what we've been calling run-the-business and change-the-business or run-better, run-different sides of the business really stand to benefit from that migration.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. I would like to direct this question to Gordon, if I could. Gordon, and the question really surrounds run rate. This year, pursuant to guidance, you're guiding revenues to increase $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, just rough numbers. Current Street estimates for 2017 are increasing by almost $1.7 billion. And given the issues that you've identified surrounding healthcare, and unclear when those deals may or may not clear, and investment banking, I was wondering if you'd like to give any anecdotal or at least directional comment related to a $1.7 billion bogey. And the context is, it's occurred in the last few years where we've crossed over new year and sell-side estimates have proved to be too high. So, I just wanted to hear any \u2013 given the current issues that you see surrounding the business, would you like to give any directional comment, at least related to 2017, and current Street estimates?","Gordon James Coburn - President","Keith, thanks for the question. It's just too early to know 2017. What are the things that'll influence revenue next year? Certainly, what happens with healthcare M&A, that's one piece. What happens with the interest rate environment for our financial services clients will be very important, because financial services clients know they have to spend a lot on innovation, but are under tremendous cost pressure right now; and that's both in insurance and banking. The pace of which we actually close these new end-to-end services deals will be important, and all those can be big drivers or big variables in revenue growth for next year. It's just too early to know. I think the election will have some impact, general macroeconomic trends and then some regulatory stuff.","But as we've all mentioned, when we look at the medium-term and long-term prospects for the business, we remain very bullish. The strategy of looking to front, middle and back office and really building up our capabilities to serve clients across all three of those dimensions, I think is going to position us very well. But what will both overall macro spending look like and a couple specific customers' things look like for us for next year, just too early to know. Obviously, as we get more color, we'll share it with the investment community.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on your overall head count plans. You added a little over 11,000 this quarter, and it was a relatively strong head count add last quarter as well. Can you maybe talk about what you expect that to do for the remainder of the year? And just broadly speaking, what it reflects in terms of your pipeline of longer-term business? Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So, utilization came down a little bit in the first quarter. That was intentional, we added, I forget, 10,000, 11,000 people in Q1 as well, even though revenue was down, because we wanted to position ourselves to make sure as client demand shifts a little bit, we have the capabilities as we finish up retraining our workforce.","Certainly head count additions will slow in the back half of the year from the front half. We don't give specific head count guidance, but our goal would be to keep utilization in the ballpark that it currently is. And certainly that gives us enough bench capacity for potential ramp-ups and certainly for positioning ourselves for next year.","You get a little bit of seasonality quarter-to-quarter, just because of the timing of bringing college kids in and so forth. But the way I think about it is, we're managing utilization to be fairly constant with where it currently is.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Bergin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to kind of expand on the other vertical pullback that you cited within information services. Is that broad-based or more limited to a handful of clients? Thanks.","Rajeev Mehta - CEO-Information Technology Services","Yeah. Hi, Bryan. This is Raj. So, it's limited to a handful of clients. Basically, some of those clients reevaluating in terms of some of the discretionary spend that they have. We feel still very optimistic about those clients, because we're having broader conversations in terms of, how do we look at the broader platform and to continue to drive some of the cost optimization that they need. But overall, the industry for us is still quite bullish for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. This is Amit Singh for Jason. Just on the cash repatriation, considering the historic low interest rates that are going on right now, why repatriate cash and pay taxes on it, versus just raising debt over here?","And also just related to that, sort of the timing of the repatriation. If you look at your full-year guidance, I don't think you're modeling a lot of share buyback, considering too what you were expecting last quarter, so a lot of M&A, should we expect that to happen over the next couple of quarters, using most of the cash that you repatriated?","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","So, Amit, this is Karen. The repatriation was a one-time opportunity. There was an opportunity that closed as of June 1, so we had a time limit as to when we were able to do that and we wanted to obviously take advantage of that opportunity to repatriate cash in a relatively tax-effective way. From India, as you know, it's typically very expensive to do that and we don't get many opportunities, so we certainly want to take advantage of that.","And I think as we've mentioned, the guidance assumes that we maintain essentially share neutrality which has been our stated position recently. Obviously, if there are opportunistic opportunities to buy back shares, we will take advantage of that. But clearly, we look to use that cash net additional flexibility to drive investment in the business, both organic and inorganic.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And it's also important to remember, the question has been focused on cash brought back to the U.S. Additional cash was also brought back to non-India locations, which is more advantageous for us, both in terms of efficiently doing non-U.S. acquisitions and if there's ever any sort of repatriation holiday in the future.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen...","David Nelson - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasurer","And, operator, this will \u2013 operator, this will be the last question.","Operator","Due to time constraints, our final question will come from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering, could you talk about in this particular quarter, the breakdown of the revision of guidance between some of those concerns that are out in the market, which include obviously healthcare, the banking sector and discretionary spending. Because it seems like the FX was maybe a minor part, and then I've got just one follow-up.","Gordon James Coburn - President","Sure. As we said, the FX impact of the revision guidance was $40 million of the change. When you look at the other pieces, it overlaps a bit, right. Certainly, the single biggest impact was our financial services segment. Whether it's the Brexit vote or the general macroeconomic environment, it's tough to parse that and the low interest rate environment, but certainly our forecast changed the most in that sector. And after that, the next one would be healthcare with some of the regulatory approval issues that are going on right now for M&A. And then the little things are out there.","The other thing we wanted to make sure is that when we adjust the guidance, we learned a little bit last quarter, you don't want to keep adjusting, so we want to make sure we adjusted it enough that we're well positioned for any additional surprises that may happen because of uncertainty around the elections, Brexit and so forth, so we want to be conservative when we cut, so we cut just once, or at least just this one additional time.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And then just as you look at kind of heading into 2017 and beyond, I guess the question for investors are, how much of this is a short-term 2016 phenomenon versus what we've seen over the last couple of years with the changes in the way that you've given guidance, and now, of course, today's cut. So, maybe you could just talk about your outlook briefly heading into next year, and help us understand how this is a short-term thing versus a long-term?","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Joe. It's Frank. Maybe I'll try to take that. And I'll answer it \u2013 obviously, as Gordon said earlier to one of the earlier questions, it's premature for us to comment specifically on 2017; but what I will say is that, we continue to remain very optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry and of our business.","From an industry standpoint, as I said many times, the key I think factor to look at is that the world is becoming more technology-intensive not less technology-intensive. Across the industries we serve and also industries where we are less present, more energy and attention is being focused on technology than ever before. Technology has become not just a way of driving efficiency and operational effectiveness for businesses, but it's become a core to most clients' ability to differentiate, to grow revenue and to survive in the marketplace.","So, given that backdrop, we feel that there's a tremendous opportunity for IT services, in general, and for Cognizant, in particular. Given the tremendous investments that we've been making. We feel that the investments that we've made in digital on the frontend, process and platforms in the middle office, and our next-generation IT services in the backend, really position us well.","And I'll just finish by saying that we feel that the portfolio of businesses that we have, whether you look at the industry portfolio or the exposure we have in different geographies of the world, represent some of the most progressive and advanced users of digital technologies. And so, we feel that the fundamentals remain strong as we look to the medium-term.","Francisco D'Souza - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So on that note, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. Thank you very much for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury at Cognizant.","David Nelson","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter 2011 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; and Gordon Coburn, President, both of which are slightly under the weather, recovering from colds.  And we're also delighted to have with us Karen McLoughlin, our new Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This morning, I'm joined by Gordon Coburn, our newly appointed President; and Karen McLoughlin, our newly appointed CFO. As we announced this morning, Gordon and Karen have taken expanded roles within Cognizant, which I will talk about shortly. I'm pleased to announce solid fourth quarter results for Cognizant that capped very strong 2011 performance. Our revenue grew nearly 4% sequentially and nearly 27% over the year-ago quarter to $1.66 billion. This brings full year revenue to $6.12 billion, more than 33% growth over 2010, once again demonstrating the strength of our value proposition, the depth of our client relationships and the exceptional execution of our strategy.","As I look back on 2011, I'm proud of Cognizant's many accomplishments. First, we continued our track record of industry-leading growth. 33% growth is all the more significant when considered against the backdrop of an economy that was more volatile than we expected at this time last year. Europe grew slower than expected during the back half of 2011, but demand throughout other geographies remained solid, fueling strong annual results and reinforcing confidence in our approach and our value proposition.","Second, we strengthened our client relationships by delivering on our unique value proposition that pairs intimate domain expert client teams with a robust seamless global delivery network. Throughout 2011, we added 317 new clients and increased the number of strategic clients by 25 to 191, the largest increase in our history. Strong results from our recently concluded third-party annual customer satisfaction survey showed that clients continue to see high levels of service quality even as we scale. And perhaps most significantly, 13 accounts contributed more than $100 million in 2011 revenue, illustrating the depth of our client relationships.","Third, we, again, hired and retained an outsized share of the talent marketplace. We grew our team by more than 33,000 this year and closed the fourth quarter with an attrition rate just over 10%, amongst the lowest in our industry. The fact that associates see Cognizant as a great place to work and to build long-term careers is reflected in record-high satisfaction scores from our third-party annual employee survey. Fourth, we stayed true to our reinvestment strategy by maintaining stable operating margins, and reinvesting in the business. Our approach of distributing investments across 3 horizons strengthened an already robust services portfolio. As a result, we are well-aligned to help clients with the dual mandates of simultaneously reducing costs and innovating for growth and competitiveness.","Within our Horizon 1 services, offerings such as application development and maintenance, testing and packaged application services, our emphasis has been on driving ever-greater levels of productivity for clients through best-in-class methodologies and a more aggressive move to variable pricing models, so-called managed services. We also continue to strengthen our offerings with tuck-under acquisitions such as Zaffera, which bolsters our SAP capabilities.","Within our Horizon 2 offerings, we have achieved critical mass across consulting or CBC, Business Process Outsourcing or BPO and IT Infrastructure Services or ITIS. Our focus is now on scaling them across industries and clients. Our business consulting ranks have grown to over 2,900 consultants that are increasingly working with senior members of the CXO suite to deliver large-scale, end-to-end transformational programs.","Within BPO, we executed on our strategy of focusing on vertical processes that require deep domain and functional knowledge and then benefit from the integration of consulting, IT and BPO services. This included enhancing our mortgage processing capabilities through our acquisition of CoreLogic's India operations. And within ITIS, we continue to win and manage a growing pipeline of large deals, launching one of the biggest projects in practice history with a European investment bank and beginning an end-to-end infrastructure outsourcing program for a retailer with more than 1,000 facilities in over 75 cities.","And finally, within Horizon 3, we are seeding investments in emerging offerings that lay a foundation for our long-term growth. Though these practices remain in their infancy, we saw strong traction amongst clients. This was partially a result of the mind share that we have captured through our thought leadership campaign that highlight the changing nature of the Future of Work. I'll speak more about Horizon 3 shortly.","Before moving on, I'd like to take a moment to thank our associates around the world for their contributions to making 2011 another stellar year for Cognizant. We could not continue to deliver strong results quarter after quarter without their support.","I'd now like to shift gears and turn to our outlook for 2012. Two weeks ago, I attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, and I had an opportunity to speak with and hear from global leaders in government and business. While there was universal acknowledgment that tough challenges lie ahead, the overall tone was optimistic. As we look to our future, we share that sense of optimism. While the macro environment, especially in Europe, will remain volatile in the coming months, our optimism stems from our strong conviction that our value proposition is more relevant than ever. As clients seek a partner who can drive cost savings and innovation on one integrated platform, they are increasingly turning to us.","In North America, our largest market, recent economic data has been encouraging. Close examination of that data shows that while overall unemployment remains high in the U.S., it is only 4% for those with a college degree. This is creating an acute talent shortage that will only be exacerbated by the growing intensity with which clients use technology. Our ability to provide clients with global access to talent is a key enabler of their competitiveness and will be a long-term driver of our business.","At the same time, we continue to be strong advocates of immigration and education reform as solutions for long-term U.S. competitiveness. In Europe, the protracted volatility is more concerning. While some clients have slowed their pace of discretionary spending for the short-term, they continue to seek out cost savings. In addition, shrinking populations in many European countries create a talent gap that is arguably more intense than that of the U.S. We have seen some European financial institutions relocating technology and operations activities to geographies such as Asia-Pacific in order to address these issues. This trend will fuel our growth in those regions.","Europe remains attractive over the long term, especially as economic pressures create additional demand for our services. The demand is reflected in the 14 new logos we signed across the U.K. and Continental Europe in Q4 and a growing pipeline of work at existing clients. As an example, we recently signed a multimillion euro contract with a large European multinational to provide a broad range of IT services. This global strategic partnership will see increasing scope of IT services over time.","When we look at spending patterns for 2012, we continue to see normal budget cycles in North America and Europe. Our view remains that 2012 IT and operations budgets will remain flat with a slight upward bias in the U.S. as the recovery continues. While we expect long-term prospects for our European business to be strong, we have assumed that growth could remain muted during 2012. In light of these assumptions, we are confident in our ability to deliver revenue of at least $1.7 billion for the first quarter of 2012 and at least $7.53 billion for the full year, an annual growth rate of at least 23%.","Our success in 2012 will rely on strong execution in 3 areas. First, we will strengthen our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 offerings by expanding their reach across clients, industries and geographies. Second, we will invest heavily in Horizon 3 offerings to stay ahead of changing client needs and to build a strong foundation for future growth. And third, we will continue to scale our operating model and expand our senior leadership team.","Let me briefly touch on each of these 3 areas. Offerings from Horizon 1 and 2 will continue to deliver the lion's share of Cognizant's revenue and revenue growth in 2012. In each of these core areas, the global delivery model remains under-penetrated. When combined with relentless economic pressure to continuously lower costs, we see robust expansion of an addressable market where we have routinely captured market share.","Turning to Horizon 3. We will continue to invest in emerging opportunities that keep Cognizant on a trajectory of long-term market-leading growth. While these offerings are unlikely to have a material revenue impact in 2012, they represent areas of high importance for our clients where we will differentiate ourselves.  ","Horizon 3 investments will fall into 3 broad areas.  First, our investments in new markets. These involve adapting our global delivery model around existing offerings to serve new industries, including targeted areas of government and new geographies such as Latin America. Second, our investments in services around the new IT architecture, namely, enterprise analytics and cloud, mobile and social computing. And third, our investments in new delivery models, primarily nonlinear models that are based on proprietary intellectual property and allow us to decouple revenue and headcount, most notably will be investments in platform-based, business process solutions, where we leverage our people and a multi-tenant technology platform to process clients' transactions.","And finally, we recognize that our continued success depends on scaling the business and managing with equal vigor and discipline across all 3 horizons. In recognition of this imperative, this morning, we announced an expansion of our management team of which you have no doubt already read. Gordon Coburn, our long-time Chief Financial and Operating Officer, has promoted to President. Gordon will work closely with Raj Mehta, who's been promoted to Group Chief Executive of Industries and Markets, overseeing our industry vertical teams; and Chandra Sekaran, who has been promoted to Group Chief Executive of Technology and Operations, overseeing our service lines that span across industry groups.  Together, Gordon, Raj and Chandra will oversee all aspects of our current business operations. Each is a tremendously accomplished Cognizant veteran, who has been with the company for well over a decade. I have the utmost confidence in their continued success.","Karen McLoughlin, an 8-year veteran of Cognizant, has been promoted to Chief Financial Officer. Karen has most recently led our financial planning and analysis team, a group that she architected and built during her time here. In addition, Karen has spearheaded critical transformation initiatives that have contributed materially to the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. This includes the role she has recently played, leading the team responsible for the execution of our Cognizant 2015 program, an enterprise-wide initiative that is examining every aspect of our business to ensure continued success as our clients' most trusted partner.","Malcolm Frank, who joined Cognizant in 2005, has been promoted to Executive Vice President of Strategy and Marketing. During his tenure, Malcolm has made extraordinary contributions to Cognizant's position as a Tier 1 provider. An industry-recognized thought leader, Malcolm has been the Chief Architect of our corporate strategy and built an award-winning marketing approach that he has -- that has made Cognizant's success possible.","I will retain the role of Chief Executive Officer and continue to oversee Cognizant's strategic direction with a special focus on our long-term growth agenda. Specifically, I'll lead a group comprised of a few senior executives responsible for working hand-in-hand with our core business to develop profitable, sustainable and scalable new offerings around the Horizon 3 areas I outlined earlier.","Over time, our goal will be to increase the share of revenue that Cognizant derives from recently introduced offerings and to increase the proportion of clients that consume those offerings. I will now turn the call over to Gordon Coburn, our new President, to review our detailed financial and operating metrics; and Karen, our new CFO, who will take you through 2012 guidance, after which, we'll open up the floor to questions, and I'll end with a few closing remarks. Gordon?","Gordon J. Coburn","Thank you, Francisco, and good morning to everyone. 2011 was a great year for us. We grew over 33%, while maintaining stable margins and a healthy balance sheet. While we did not see any budget flush in Q4, we saw broad-based growth across industries and service lines through the quarter.","During the fourth quarter, we experienced continued growth in our financial services segment, which includes our practices in insurance, banking and transaction processing. This segment grew 3.7% on a sequential basis and 22.6% year-over-year. It represented 40.9% of revenue for the quarter. For the full year, this segment grew over 29%. Q4 growth within financial services was driven by ongoing traction for IT infrastructure services and high-end BPO services such as securities processing, mortgage operations and underwriting and claims processing and continued ramp-up in regulatory work including initial development assignments in addition to consulting.","Healthcare continued its growth during the quarter with 6.3% sequential growth and 34.7% year-over-year. This segment represented 27.5% of revenues. For the full year, healthcare grew almost 38%. The continued solid growth within this segment was driven by reform-related work including ICD-10 and consumerization of health plans, ramp-up of pharmacy benefit, management providers and initial traction in Horizon 3 offerings such as business process as a service, cloud-based CRM and mobile technology.","Retail manufacturing and logistics continued its growth during the quarter and grew 2.8% sequentially and 30.9% year-over-year. It represented 19.2% of revenues. For the full year, this segment grew over 40%. Demand within this segment was driven by ramp-up of transformation projects and large strategic accounts as well as growing demand for services such as e-commerce integration.","The remaining 12.5% of revenue came primarily from other service-oriented industries of communications, entertainment, media and high technology, which as a group, grew 1.3% sequentially and 20.1% year-over-year. For the full year, this segment grew 26%. Application development represented 51% of revenue and application management, 49% for the quarter. Development grew 30.9% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially. Management grew 23.1% year-over-year and 3.5% sequentially. We saw fairly balanced growth between development and management as clients expanded outsourcing projects to address their 2012 savings objectives. For the full year, application development represented 51% of revenue and grew 41%, while application management represented 49% of revenue and grew 26%.","During the quarter, 79.8% of revenue came from clients in North America. Europe was 16.5%, and 3.7% of revenue came from our clients in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America. For the quarter, North America grew 6.1% sequentially and 31.1% year-over-year. For the year, North America grew 34%. For the quarter, all of Europe declined 5.6% sequentially and grew 8.8% year-over-year. For the year, Europe grew 28%. Continental Europe declined 8% sequentially in Q4, and the United Kingdom declined 4.2%. European revenue was negatively impacted by currency movements of approximately $8.6 million compared to the third quarter. On a constant-dollar basis, Europe declined 2.7% sequentially and grew 8.6% year-over-year. The macroeconomic issues in Europe continued to result in some volatility and constraints on discretionary spending, particularly in life sciences and financial services.","As expected, on a sequential basis, our pricing was flat during the fourth quarter as most of our 2011 price increases were reflected in our run rate coming into the quarter. We closed the quarter with over 785 active customers, and a number of accounts which we consider to be strategic increased by 6. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 191. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic clients, embracing a wider range of Cognizant services at an earlier stage in the relationship. ","Turning to costs. On a GAAP basis, cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was approximately $971 million and included $4.1 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional staff both on-site and offshore required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by over 7,200 during the quarter and ended the quarter with over 132,000 technical staff.","Fourth quarter SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was $385 million on a GAAP basis and included approximately $21.9 million of stock-based compensation expense. Our GAAP operating margin was 18.5% for the quarter, and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 20.1%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. The average rate of the rupee was 50.7 in Q4 versus 45.7 in Q3. $225 million of rupee-denominated operating expense cash flow hedges were settled in Q4. This resulted in a $14.3 million loss, which was recognized in operating expenses. We have further extended our India rupee expense hedging program with over $3.5 billion in outstanding hedges of our rupee expenses, which will mature each month through 2015 at an average rate of approximately 50.9. We had $10.9 million of interest income. In addition, we had $4 million of other nonoperating income. This included a net foreign exchange gain of $3.8 million.","Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% and, for the full year, 24.4%. Our diluted share count for the quarter was 308.8 million shares, down slightly from Q3, primarily due to the full quarter impact of the share repurchase we made in late Q3. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 40,000 shares at an average price of $60 for a total cost of $2.4 million. Within our currently authorized $600 million repurchase program, we have purchased approximately 5.6 million shares at a cost of $380 million.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with over $2.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated $285 million of cash. Finance activities generated $21 million of cash. This was comprised of net proceeds of $23.7 million related to option exercises and related tax benefits as well as our employee stock purchase program, partially offset by expenditures of $2.4 million towards our share repurchase program.","We spent approximately $124.6 million on capital expenditures during the quarter. Our full year capital expenditures for 2011 were approximately $290 million, slightly above our original expectations of $285 million. During 2012, we expect our capital expenditures to total approximately $370 million.","Based on our approximately $1.3 billion receivables balance on December 31, we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 73 days, unchanged from third quarter and up slightly from 71 days in the fourth quarter of last year. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance is approximately $140 million, down from $163 million at the end of Q3. Approximately 66% of the Q4 unbilled balance was billed in January.","32.3% of our revenues came from fixed-price contracts during the fourth quarter and 31.7% during the full year. Net headcount increased by over 7,300 people during the quarter. 56% of gross additions for the quarter were direct college hires, while 44% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. We ended the quarter with over 137,700 employees globally. During 2011, we added over 33,700 employees globally. One of our goals for 2011 was to achieve an improved balance between college hirings and lateral hires. I am pleased to report that we were successful in achieving this goal, with 48% of our 2011 hires coming from campus.","Attrition in the fourth quarter was 10.1%, lower than Q3 attrition of 13.4%. Our attrition rate for Q4 was the lowest since the first quarter of 2003, barring the first quarter of 2009, which was the aftermath of the financial crisis. As we have discussed in the past, there's no consistent methodology in the industry to report attrition. We have historically reported attrition by annualizing the turnover, which occurs within the quarter, including both voluntary and involuntary. Our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO and employees in our training program.","Utilization decreased slightly on a sequential basis during Q4. Offshore utilization was approximately 68%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who were in our training program, was approximately 80%. On-site utilization remained flat at about 94% during the quarter.","Our operational focus for 2011 was centered around our ability to scale our people, processes and infrastructure to support the increasing complexity of our business and to capitalize on opportunities that the market presented. We made significant progress against these goals through the year, particularly in the area of talent management and community relations, which we expect to build on further in 2012.","On prior earnings calls, we highlighted various initiatives to sharpen and enhance our employee value proposition. These efforts resulted in the highest employee satisfaction scores in our history during 2011. Our associates believe that we are winning the war for talent and are proud to work for us. They see value in the long-term opportunities our industry-leading growth offers for them. The relevance of our employee value proposition is also reflected in our Q4 attrition rate of 10%, among the lowest in the industry.","We continue to be regarded as the #1 employer of choice in India for graduates of top business and technical schools and enjoy top placement at every one of the schools we target. Our university campus -- our U.S. Campus Recruiting Program, which kicked off in 2010, has yielded dividends as our first class is now serving our clients in various parts of the country. We've expanded the program to add 3 additional undergraduate institutions and 7 more business schools.  Our next class starts work next month. We have also launched similar programs in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. We accomplished all this while actively giving back to the communities in which we live and operate. In India, our grassroots Outreach program started by associates in 2007 logged more than 80,000 volunteer hours, a 200% increase over 2010. This is now being replicated globally in Argentina, China, the Philippines, the U.K. and the United States.","This year in the United States, we unveiled our Making the Future campaign, an education-based initiative designed to promote programs that support stem education. We believe that stem education can have a long-term impact on the economic development in the U.S. through a promotion of innovation and the concept of creating and building.","Before I turn the call over to Karen McLoughlin, our new CFO, to discuss our 2012 outlook, I'd like to wrap up by saying that I am excited about my new role at Cognizant. As I move into the President role, I do so with confidence that we have a world-class financial organization in place. Karen is an outstanding finance professional with a deep understanding of the importance of a CFO being tightly aligned and involved in the business, and she has a solid knowledge of the Cognizant business.","With Karen reporting to me in her new role, I plan to stay actively involved with our ongoing investor communications programs and look forward to seeing many of you at future investor events. I'd like to now make the hand off to our new CFO as I turn the call over to Karen for discussion of our 2012 guidance.","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. I am very excited about the opportunity to serve as Cognizant's new CFO and look forward to meeting many of you over the coming months through our investor Outreach programs. I would now like to comment on our growth expectations for Q1 and for the full year 2012.","For the first quarter of 2012, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.7 billion. For the full year 2012, we expect to continue delivering industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we are projecting revenue of at least $7.53 billion, which represents full year growth of at least 23%.","During Q1 and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target operating margin range of 19% to 20%, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.79 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.85, which excludes estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.06. This guidance anticipates a Q1 share count of approximately 310 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25%. Our guidance excludes any nonoperating FX gains or losses.","For the full year 2012, we expect our GAAP EPS to be at least $3.43 and our full year non-GAAP EPS to be at least $3.69, excluding $0.26 of estimated full year stock-based compensation expense. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 312 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25%. It also excludes any nonoperating FX gains or losses.","Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Sanford C. Bernstein and Company.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the demand environment in Europe and some of the challenges you guys apparently had late in the year in Europe. When you look at the results of some of your large competitors in India, TCS, Infosys and HCL, they all showed quarter-to-quarter growth rates in Europe of late that were actually above North America. So it seems to imply that European companies are moving to offshore outsourcing, given the need for more austerity in that region. Are you seeing that as a boost to your demand, but with that boost potentially being offset by cuts in discretionary spending? Is that the situation that you're seeing in Europe? And can you elaborate on that?","Francisco D'Souza","Rod, it's Frank here. Thanks for the question, and certainly, Europe continued to show -- Q4 was impacted by short-term volatility in Europe, but I think you put your finger on the trend we're seeing. What we're seeing in general in Europe is that there's a mix shift going on as clients come under economic pressure. The discretionary spending is coming under pressure there, pushing projects out a little bit but, at the same time, shifting emphasis to a more cost-containment-type of initiatives around our more traditional outsourcing and managed services types of services. So as that mix shift continues and we shift the pipeline from discretionary spending more to the outsourcing or managed services types of engagement, we expect that in the coming quarters, there will be some continued volatility in our European results, and we've baked that into our 2012 guidance. So we are not assuming any recovery from here in our European results in our 2012 guidance.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, so on the discretionary spending side in Europe, are you seeing any encouraging signs early in 2012 that discretionary spending is somewhat recovering? Or are you still worried that there's more downside on that front? And then if you -- just to help a little bit, I mean, when you look at our your 2012 guidance, can you help us understand what type of growth assumption you have for Europe versus the rest of the world?","Francisco D'Souza","Let me comment on what we're seeing with discretionary spending, and then I'll ask Gordon to talk a little bit about our assumptions for Europe and guidance. On discretionary spending in Europe, particularly, we don't see -- we are seeing some discretionary spending delays with clients. We -- I don't think there's a tremendous amount of downside from where we are right now to discretionary spending. But I think discretionary spending will continue to be lumpy for at least for the coming 2 quarters in Europe as that mix shift continues to play out from discretionary spending moving more towards outsourcing.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, and let me just follow up on that. Rod, our guidance assumes continued healthy growth in North America. Q4 was great. We grew over 6% sequentially in North America. Obviously, Europe was weak. Our 2012 guidance assumes that Europe stays weak. We're not betting on a rebound in revenue for us. So I view it as that we expect North America to be healthy and Europe to be stable at a weak level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So congratulations to everybody on the moves here on the promotions. I just wanted to start off, I guess, to the BFSI expectations. As you think about that vertical and all of the puts and takes that are kind of going on, but maybe just frame the same commentary question about your expectations for BFSI as a vertical as you move into 2012, application development spending versus application management spending.","Gordon J. Coburn","Yes, BFSI looks okay for 2012. We expect it to have good growth, certainly, not company average, given its deeper penetration rates of lower large numbers, but we expect it to be quite respectable. I think it will be more weighted towards health in North America than Europe. No question about that. But when I look at BFSI overall, we're feeling okay about it.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just in the AD spending versus the apps management or outsourcing spending?","Gordon J. Coburn","That, I think, will be balanced. Our guidance assumes that there's a shift more towards maintenance, and as in similar years, we always want to be conservative on our expectations for development in a volatile economy. So our guidance assumes that maintenance is stronger than development.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Would you mind touching on just what you're seeing around market share and how many bids are actually coming out there in Europe in particular? I mean, I know there was a question earlier around some of the trends on discretionary. But maybe on the outsourcing side, you're saying you're expecting a shift towards more on the maintenance projects. Do you expect to continue to gain share in that area?","Francisco D'Souza","We do. When we look at our pipeline around the world, North America and Europe, obviously, being our largest markets, we don't have any significant concern about the size and health of our pipeline. We continue to see a strong, healthy pipeline of opportunities, both with new clients and with existing clients. As I said, during my prepared comments, our European new customer wins were healthy during the fourth quarter. We saw 14 new clients in the quarter in Europe. So we feel pretty good about both the health of our pipeline and our continued ability to take share from competition as we execute on what we think of as our differentiated approach broadly. But particularly, in Europe, where having strong local teams in the countries particularly in the continent, that's very important for local language and cultural issues.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, so just to kind of -- when you think about the actual opportunity from an outsourcing standpoint in Europe, given the shift you're seeing, I mean, I guess, do you see there's enough there to really offset any shift away from discretionary so that your revenue can be pretty strong or at least as strong as you're expecting in guidance? Or do you need to see some discretionary spend increase? Or is the discretionary spend increase all upside from your 23% guidance?","Francisco D'Souza","Let me just give you sort of the macro picture, and then I'll ask Gordon, again, to comment specifically on the guidance topics. At the macro level, Europe is probably less penetrated from an outsourcing standpoint than from a discretionary spending standpoint. Historically, in Europe, over the last, let's say, decade or so, European customers have tended to outsource development in discretionary spending first and have not taken the more traditional application outsourcing or other kinds of managed services to an offer of global delivery model. So from an opportunity standpoint, I think that the opportunity in outsourcing in Europe is actually very, very large. And we're starting to see clients now turning their sights as they come under pressure to that opportunity and moving some of those types of activities to a global delivery model. In some countries in Europe, that shift takes a little bit of time because some of the European regulations and laws make that shift a little bit more tricky, particularly, the labor laws, and so it takes a little bit of time to work through those issues. But overall, I'm very optimistic about the opportunity and the trend we're seeing in outsourcing in Europe.","Gordon J. Coburn","Let me just add to that a little bit because this is really an important point. Over the past 15 years, every economic downturn served as a catalyst to expand our addressable market, but there's a timing. There's a timing lag, and I think the timing lag may be a little bit more significant in Europe due to some of the labor and cultural issues. And that's why in our guidance for 2011, we assumed we don't see the benefit of that catalyst. But when we look at -- maybe if we get lucky, we start to see it late in the year, but we're not counting on it. But when we look over time, it's very clear to us that the economic challenges that the European community is facing right now is leading to an openness to global sourcing, and we are clearly a player in that. It's just a question of how quickly does it kick in and ramp up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arvind Ramnani with UBS.","Arvind A. Ramnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to find out, did Q4 turn out as you were expecting to play out when you provided guidance? Or was December weaker than you were expecting? The month of December, was that weaker than what you were anticipating?","Gordon J. Coburn","The end result came pretty close to where we were expecting. At the conferences in late November, early December, we were being very clear, there's no budget flush. If I parse it out a little bit, North America was a little stronger than I expected. Europe was a little bit weaker, but the net outcome was within a tolerance level in the ballpark that we were expecting.","Arvind A. Ramnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And within BFSI, can you provide some color on specific areas in terms of kind of demand such as investment banking, retail banking, risk management and regulation because the segment of [ph] BFSI, there\u2019s probably kind of different areas of strength and weakness?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So I think the one area where you're seeing a general trend towards weakness is in the pure-play investment banks and the investment banking divisions of the multinationals. Once you go beyond that, demand's actually reasonably healthy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the attrition number being at an amazingly low 10% and what that implies, whether that's a signal of superior execution or really is an indication of a slowing demand outlook because it is coming down at the other Tier 1 firms as well.","Gordon J. Coburn","Yes, Ed, this is an issue we've spent a lot of time looking at because we were surprised at how favorable Q4 attrition was, and I think the answer is it's a little of both. So overall, the industry has come down a bit, but we're running with -- once you kind of normalize how everyone counts it, we're running with about as big a gap between us and the rest of the field as we've ever had. So I think part of it is just supply catching up with demand, and some of that is everyone shifting back towards the college hiring. But then I think what's unique to Cognizant is our growth rate. We promoted a far more significant percentage of our population in 2011 quite simply because we were growing faster. So people are seeing that their career growths can be more positively impacted at Cognizant. So I think it's a little of both, part the market, but I think the bigger part of is what's specifically happening at Cognizant.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The other question is the rupee has moved sort of against the dollar here. It's strengthening against the dollar so far this year, suggesting sort of a negative item in the other income line. Is that baked into your assumptions for the Q1 EPS? Or do you have a 0 number in the below line FX impact?","Gordon J. Coburn","Yes, so let's break it into 2 pieces. For operating expenses, the cash flow hedges, which is a big part of our hedges, that is reflected in operating income. We actually had a loss in Q4. Obviously, that loss will either be smaller swing to a positive in Q1. So the movement in the rupee does not have a particularly significant impact on our operating margin because we're so heavily hedged. We're by far the most heavily hedged in the industry. It does generate some gains and losses below the line, but those tend not to be material. And as I mentioned, our guidance assumes that there is no FX gain or loss below the line, but our guidance does include the cash flow hedges which show up above the line.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just looking at the 2012 guidance, it looks like a little north of 2% sequential revenue guidance for 1Q '12, which is a little bit of a slower start, but that's pretty seasonal. And then followed by a significant sequential growth of probably something in the order of at least 7% in 2Q and maybe even in 3Q. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the visibility and the ramp-up that's probably likely to happen in 2Q and 3Q.","Gordon J. Coburn","Yes, so Bryan, I think you're thinking about it absolutely correctly, and you said the key thing. This is a normal pattern. If I look at last year, we jumped from about 4% growth up to 8% growth between Q1 and Q2, and it stayed about 8% for Q3. So to have Q2 be substantially stronger than Q1 is a normal pattern. Let me explain why. Clients tend to finish their budget cycles in early February, which means January tends to be weak because they don't release the new budget dollars. And what you see is a pattern. January weak, February is modest and March tends to be good, and then, obviously, you have the full quarter impact in the second quarter. So this -- when we look at reaching the 23% growth, this, I would view as a very normal pattern.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, but it doesn't feel like just as a result of that ramp. It doesn't feel like there's a lot of upside maybe compared to the last few years for the full year outlook just to hit the at least 23%?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So to exceed the 23%, that really will be driven by discretionary spending, and we've been conservative on our assumptions, and we've been very conservative on our just assumptions for Europe, obviously. But even in North America, we've been conservative about our assumptions for discretionary spending. So that's one that'll play out or not play out as the year goes on. And as you know, discretionary spending is one. If it happens, it can ramp-up fairly quickly, but we certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves on discretionary spending because we don't have the visibility on that yet, simply due to the economy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company.","Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Frank and Gordon, just one question on sort of the budgeting cycle. As you talk to your customers both here in the U.S. and in Europe, maybe just talk a little bit about the allocation of the budgets between the regulatory and compliance opportunity versus mobility and cloud, which I believe is your Horizon 3 offering, and then the traditional application maintenance business.","Francisco D'Souza","So a couple of points of color, Mayank, around budgets. First of all, as I said during the comments, we see this year as being a completely normal budget cycle. We're not seeing either in the U.S. or in North -- in Europe, excuse me, any significant delays in clients' budget cycles. So we view that at the start as being positive. When we look at the magnitude of budgets, overall, we're starting to see -- we expect them to be flat with a slight upward bias, particularly, in North America. So again, we consider that to be good. In terms of the composition of budgets, a few things. First of all, the share shift that we've been seeing for a long time of budgets increasingly towards the global delivery model continues. We're starting to see that, as I said, in Europe on the traditional IT outsourcing application maintenance side of the business, and we are continuing to see it around the world in operations budgets as clients start to look at Business Process Outsourcing more seriously from a global delivery model and, of course, from the IT infrastructures side of the business as well in the ITIS side of our business. So the share shift continues towards the global delivery model. In terms of the Horizon 3 offerings, as I said, many of our clients are starting to do what I would consider to be pilots or early deployments of Horizon 3-type of services, whether those are mobile or social or cloud or advanced analytics types of things, but we don't expect those to be significant revenue drivers for 2012 or beyond -- excuse me, for 2012. There'll be revenue drivers beyond that. The reason is that these are still relatively small clients who are dipping their toe in the water. But for 2012, while I expect to see a lot of activity in those areas, I don't think they're going to be significant revenue drivers.","Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And what about the regulatory and compliance work?","Francisco D'Souza","I think regulatory and compliance work, it really depends on industries. Our 2 biggest industries, financial services and healthcare, continue to see a fair degree of impact from regulatory compliance. I think, in particular, we, in healthcare, we see a-- we've seen for some quarters now quite a lot of work relating to ICD-10, 5010 remediation, those types of things, and I think we'll continue to see some of that going into 2012 in healthcare. In financial services, I think it's still a little early to tell. We're starting to see the consulting work that we did with clients around the impact of regulations starting to translate into some work, but my expectations right now for revenue from regulatory compliance work and financial services is modest for 2012. That may change as we get more certainty around the regulations themselves, but at this point, we're making modest assumptions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a question about Europe again. This is the second consecutive year where we're starting the year with Europe kind of weak. As Rod said earlier in the call, some of your competitors showed some very strong numbers coming out of Europe. I think it will be helpful maybe if you can talk about whether we're having some issues with a number of legacy customers that are having some performance issues internally that's impacting their ability to spend on discretionary work or not, or maybe there's an execution issue on the sales side as well. I think that will be helpful if you can talk about this a little bit.","Francisco D'Souza","Let me try and put some color around this. I think we were disappointed with our results in Europe over the course of this year. We saw more volatility than we expected coming into 2011. During 2011, we saw more volatility than we expected coming into 2011. If you pare it back, I think there are a couple of different elements to it and may -- that sort of are overlaying each other. In the early half -- in the early part, let's say, the first half of last year, we were impacted by the ramp down of some M&A projects that we spoke to you about over a few quarters last year in a couple of the financial services institutions that we serve in Europe, and those -- in particular, in one client, which was a very large ramp-down situation. So that impacted our results. As we came into the back half of last year, what we saw was that with particularly with financial services clients, but to some extent with -- even with our life sciences clients. As the economic volatility in Europe became more intense, we did see cuts in discretionary spending. We saw our clients pull back a little bit. And as I said, we saw the start of that mix shift from discretionary spending over to more outsourcing or managed services types of work. We also saw, as I briefly mentioned in my script, a little bit of a shift of work with our large multinational, particularly, financial services clients of work outside of Europe. So clients shifted their base of operations from Europe largely to Asia Pacific when that happened in order to address some of the talent shortages issues in Europe. And so when we report that, we report that as Asia Pacific revenue to you, not as European revenue in those situations when that happens. So I think that was the second trend. We've looked at this in a lot of detail. I don't think we have fundamental execution issues in Europe. Clearly, we continue to build out some parts of Europe and continue to build out the front-end capability that I've talked about. But in the major markets of Europe, I think we're well-positioned. I think our teams on the ground are strong. Our pipeline is strong, and our win rates are good. So I think that beyond the build-out that we're continuing to do in places like the Nordics and so on, where we continue to invest, our presence is smaller in some of those countries, and we need a little bit more investment to beef those up. In the major markets, I think we're strong, and we continue to compete well.","Gordon J. Coburn","And Moshe, very importantly, in 2011, obviously, when we were early in the year, we were expecting a rebound in Europe in the back half of the year, and that was baked into our guidance. Fortunately, North America really stepped up, and it covered the fact that Europe did not happen. As we look to 2012, we are not expecting a rebound in the back half of the year for Europe. If it happens, great, but we learned our lesson a bit last year. We realized it's a volatile economy, so we\u2019re taking a fairly conservative view of Europe coming into this year.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just as a follow-up, Gordon. Some of your customer -- some of your peers, actually, have indicated that they've seen ramp-up delays in discretionary work in North America during the December quarter, actually, also during the March quarter. Is that something that's kind of relevant here for Cognizant? Is this something that's kind of maybe you can comment on that as well?","Gordon J. Coburn","We grew 6.1% sequentially in Q4. That exceeded our expectations. It was huge. North America is very healthy for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan Chase.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Congrats, everyone, on the new roles. I'll say that upfront. I just wanted to ask, Frank, I guess the acquisition pipeline and your appetite, I suppose, should we expect the same kind of deals as we saw in 2011? Or maybe something bigger to accelerate Horizon 3 because, I mean, I asked because there's a lot of cash on hand, so trying to get a sense of how loose you might be with that money this year.","Francisco D'Souza","I think you'll see our overall approach to acquisitions continuing to be as it's been in the past. We're focused on the tuck-in acquisitions. They work very, very nicely for us. We like that approach to doing acquisitions, to accelerate particular parts of the business. Of course, as we get bigger, as we've said in the past, our definition of what constitutes a tuck-in also gets larger. So in absolute terms, you might see us doing tuck-ins that are a little bit bigger than what we've done in the past. We're focused principally on the same areas that we have in the past, broadly looking at acquisitions that will accelerate our entry into new geographies, deepen our penetration in the industries that we serve. And then the third area would be acquisitions that will bring us into a new service line or deepen our penetration in an existing service line. I expect that in that third category, the new services, we would do acquisitions focused on the Horizon 3 services. So we're looking at areas like mobility, cloud, big data, analytics and so on, enterprise, social, and also acquisitions that have nonlinear characteristics to them. So this is, as I said, something that I personally plan to focus a lot of my attention on during 2012. And I think it's fair to say that we're taking a close look at acquisition opportunities in those areas.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, good. Maybe just a quick business question. Just been hearing themes like vendor consolidation, obviously, changes in pricing or overall economics. What are your expectations in those areas, pricing, vendor consolidation in 2012?","Gordon J. Coburn","I'm sorry. Can you repeat that question?","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sorry, Gordon. We've been hearing some vendor consolidations coming back in vogue with some of the clients. So how do you think you'll fare in that, historically, that's been favorable to you? And then secondarily, just pricing on the back of vendor consolidation, how do you expect pricing to change this year?","Gordon J. Coburn","So historically, vendor consolidation has been very good for us, and I think that's a trend that will continue. Customers more and more are seeing the value of strong offshore delivery with a competitive price point combined with very deep domain knowledge. And you saw that in the number of accounts that we had that were north of $100 million. We got up to 13 accounts. We grew it by 30%, so we're feeling very good about vendor consolidation. Pricing, obviously, will not be as robust as 2011, as we've said, on the last couple of calls because coming into 2011, everyone was eligible. Clearly, not everyone is eligible now. So yes, I view pricing as stable with an upward bias, but I would not want to set expectations that it will be average price across all clients will be anywhere close to where it is. And with that, I see we're a little over 9:00, so let me turn it back over to Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza","Thanks, Gordon. I think we'll wrap up here. Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and thank you, Gordon and Karen. Congratulations to both of you in your new roles. I'm excited to work closely with our expanded leadership team as we continue to drive our long-term strategy of industry-leading growth.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2014 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll start with the highlights of our third quarter results and outlook for the rest of the year. And also take some time to share with you some of the broader industry trends that we\u2019re seeing. Gordon will then discuss our detailed operating results and Karen will provide further details on our financial metrics and guidance before we open up the line for Q&A.","Our results this quarter was solid and slightly ahead of the guidance we provided to you at the end of last quarter. For the third quarter, we delivered revenue of $2.58 billion. As expected our non-GAAP operating margin was within our guided range of 19% to 20%. We now expect full year 2014 revenues to be between $10.13 billion and $10.16 billion, reflecting our performance this quarter and our improved outlook for the reminder of the year. This provided guidance excludes any impact of the pending TriZetto acquisition.","As you are aware, last quarter we reported some weakness in certain clients and longer than expected sales cycles for certain large integrated deals. We see the impact of those two factors abating and expect them to no longer be a concern as we go into next year. We\u2019re confident in our strategy and as we start planning for 2015 we find that our run better, run different value proposition is firmly in step with the needs of the market. This was first evident in industries such as healthcare and financial services. We can now see it playing out across all of the industries that we serve, as it\u2019s apparent in the number of end-to-end integrated deals in our pipeline today, as well as in the demand for solutions based on new digital technologies.","Let me explain this a little bit more. Many quarters back we saw signs of significant technology shift and a corresponding business model change driven by the ongoing volatility in major economies on one hand and the advent of new digital technologies on the other.","We said that the only way for businesses to adapt would be to simultaneously execute on efficiency and scale with existing systems, while driving business innovation through newer technologies. We refer to this as the dual mandate. And one way to understand it better is through the lens of what\u2019s happening in the healthcare industry. Although I\u2019m going to speak specifically about healthcare here, we see the effects of the dual mandate playing out across multiple industries and geographies.","Healthcare, especially in the U.S. is seeing significant disruption on account of regulatory reforms, aging populations, new technologies, greater need for transparency and increasing price competition. As a result healthcare clients are increasingly demanding end-to-end solutions that help them drive efficient operations, while investing for future growth to deal with the challenges facing the healthcare industry today.","We believe our acquisition of TriZetto and our transformative deal with Health Net, the two biggest transactions in our history bring us significantly closer to being able to create and provide this type of end-to-end solution in the healthcare industry. With TriZetto platforms serving half of the U.S. population and a quarter of the providers in the United States, coupled with the operating expertise and technology of Health Net, there\u2019s really an opportunity here for us to reinvent healthcare in very fundamental ways.","With an underlying software platform running on infrastructure provided by Cognizant, delivered over the cloud, combined with the services required to run the business process, we will be able to offer a fully-integrated service to our clients and charge them on a per transaction or per user basis.","On one side of the dual mandate solutions like these allow us to work with healthcare peers and providers to optimize existing G&A spend, while improving the quality of their service. And on the other side of the dual mandate we\u2019re actively working with healthcare clients on digital technology based innovation, creating for them increased agility in launching new products and participating in new markets to drive new sources of revenue.","The great example of how by enabling clients to be more efficient in their use of capital resources we are creating new opportunities for innovation in products and services for the healthcare industry. We have spoken at length about Health Net and TriZetto in previous calls, and Gordon and Karen will provide updates for each of them in a few minutes.","Before I close, I would like to spend a few minutes talking to you about the demand environment as reinforced by our client conversations from our recently concluded Cognizant Community Event.","As you know, we have invested over the past three years to build our digital capabilities, and as previously indicated have seen significant traction of our social, mobile, analytics, and cloud offerings with clients. Across industries, we are seeing business reinvention, driven by the rapid consumerization of technology. This is bringing the physical and the digital worlds close together, and as a result, almost every physical process is being instrumented and digitized. Against this backdrop, we see four emerging needs and corresponding opportunities for Cognizant across the industries. Let me catch upon them briefly.","First, we are seeing an integration of SKUs combining new skills like data science, design, instrumentation, and embedded sensors, with traditional skills like consulting and technology. These SKUs then work closely with client teams to produce rapid, short cycles of innovation.","Second, distilling and applying meaning from the digital data surrounding every person, process, organization, and device, or what we call a Code Halo, is leading to an urgent demand for interdisciplinary skills around data science, artificial intelligence, and mathematics.","Third, digital technologies are becoming prevalent throughout our clients businesses, which is resulting in opportunities to expand beyond the CIOs office to departments such as marketing.","And finally, we see a need for deep, scalable expertise and foundation of technologies of social, mobile, analytics and cloud, which when combined with appropriate security models will be critical for enabling clients to realize their digital ambitions.","In order to quickly realize value from digital technologies, we are working across our business units and bringing together strategy and industry knowledge, design, process thinking, and technology and data science.","In the coming quarters, we will talk in more detail about our go-to-market model for our digital business, but we are making investments in all of the areas, I just spoke about. This quarter we acquired Cadient, a full-service digital marketing agency that caters to the nuances of the life sciences industry. Gordon will share more details on that in a few minutes.","I'm very excited about the new areas of growth and ways of working, which I believe fits very well with our entrepreneurial culture.","With that, I will now hand it to \u2013hand the call over to Gordon to share more about our performance, and to Karen to provide financial details. I will be back for the Q&A. Gordon?","Gordon Coburn","Thank you, Francisco. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I'll first provide some additional color on the current demand environment, update you on the large transformational deal with Health Net, and the status of planning for integration with TriZetto, as well as briefly discuss our recent acquisition of Cadient.","Similar to what we indicated three months ago, the overall demand environment remains strong. This is reflected in our strong order pipeline and our record number of new hires during Q3. We are pleased to have achieved these results slightly ahead of our Q3 revenue guidance and our confident in our increased guidance for the full year.","As expected, the client specific weakness and delays in project ramps that we spoke about last quarter, will continue to impact results through the remainder of this year, but as Frank said, this should abate as we finish the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we spoke about our transformative engagement with Health Net, which is the largest contract value in our history.","As recently announced by Health Net, the contract has been signed. Health Net has begun the process of securing regulatory approval and we anticipate that we will begin to ramp up this engagement once regulatory approvals are completed in the first-half of next year.","Moving onto TriZetto. We are preparing to close the $2.7 billion acquisition of TriZetto. Karen will comment on the financing of this acquisition in a few minutes. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, but I can share with you that detailed integration plans are well underway within our healthcare practice, as well as at the corporate level.","Importantly, the response to the pending TriZetto acquisition from clients in both healthcare and our other industry verticals has been positive and is generating excitement around what this can mean for their businesses.","Finally, our recent announcement of the acquisition of Cadient further expands the scope of digital marketing capabilities we can bring to our clients. Cadient is a full-service digital marketing firm serving the life sciences industry.","As Frank mentioned, we see an increasing opportunity to expand beyond the CIOs office. And Cadient further strengthens our ability to participate in the brand marketing budgets of life sciences clients. Additionally, we fully expect to leverage the IP that comes with Cadient and pursue industry segments beyond life sciences.","From an industry perspective, our banking and financial services segment grew 2.2% sequentially and 13.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in insurance, where there is growing interest in end-to-end managed services. On the banking side, underlying demand drives from regulatory compliance, real-time risk monitoring, and fraud and trade surveillance support longer-term growth.","Additionally, our financial services clients are looking to us to build and integrate SMAC solutions. Projects to include implemented solutions to enhance the customer experience in areas such as mobile banking and card application processes, or analytics, where we provide end-to-end solutions in areas such as mortgage model implementation, monitoring and validation, or digital and multichannel analysis.","Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payor, pharmaceutical, and medical device clients, grew 1.5% sequentially, and 9.2% year-over-year. Within the pharmaceutical sector for a second quarter in a row, we experienced above the average sequential \u2013 above the average company's sequential growth, as clients look to us to help optimize their IT applications and operations.","In addition, we are pleased with the net new business we are winning from our existing clients, as well as several new clients. We believe that we are well positioned in the coming year in multiple areas of importance, including M&A integration on some key deals we closed for our clients \u2013 that we\u2019ll close for our clients in the coming months and new product launches with the capabilities we acquired through the Cadient acquisition will be applicable.","To help the demand from our pharmaceutical clients and help to offset the continued softness in our payor sector, something that we highlighted in the first-half of this year. The payor industry has taken a more cautious approach through investment this year, and specially off to a significant level of investment and tying in with public health insurance exchanges during 2013. However, our confidence in the longer-term opportunities in the healthcare market is demonstrated by the acquisition of TriZetto and the engagement with Health Net","Our regional and manufacturing segment improved sequentially up 3.6% compared to the second quarter and up 8.6% over Q3 of 2013. On the manufacturing and logistics side, we saw good growth from both increased spend at existing clients, as well as the addition of new logos.","Clients in these industries continue to focus on solutions to drive operational efficiency by modernizing their existing systems, sampling their supply chains, and embracing SMAC solutions such as Internet-enabled devices to improve supply chain visibility and logistics operations.","Our retail practice also saw a good growth in Q3 after a slow start in the first-half of this year. Our other segment, which include high-tech, communications, and information, media, and entertainment clients showed solid growth in the quarter, up 3.8% sequentially and 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by further penetration with our existing clients.","Let me now turn to a detailed discussion of our Horizon 2 service lines, where we continue to be pleased with the market pressure we are realizing. Our BPS practice saw continued traction during the quarter, largely on the ramp up of a number of wins in prior quarters across financial services, insurance, and healthcare. Demand for our vertically aligned business processes such as membership enrolment and revenue cycle management in healthcare, and claims processing and mortgage services in insurance and financial services remains strong.","We believe having an industry focus BPS practice is critically important in driving future utility like delivery models based on what we refer to as BPaaS or business process as a service. Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continued its pace of above-company average growth. CBC is the key differentiator for us as we compete, win, and execute transformational engagements across various industry segments.","Clients expect us to bring industry specific thought leadership to them and we do so through CBC. Just one example, working with one of our pharmaceutical clients, CBC led a consulted approach to a large post-merger transformation \u2013 the transformation deal from sourcing and financial modeling to change management expertise and ensuring minimal disruption to clients business operations.","Today\u2019s hyper connected world requires both sides of the dual mandate; efficiency and innovation to be brought to market in accelerated manner. And CBC's strategic focus aligns perfectly with this expectation. We believe CBC's role will continue to grow in importance, as our clients look to our consultants to drive process \u2013 business process innovation to transform the organizations and lead the adoption of digital solutions.","IT infrastructure services had another strong quarter. We\u2019re seeing solid demand from clients looking to simplify, optimize, and automate their infrastructure through newer delivery models or integrated solutions requiring both IT infrastructure management and application management.","From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 2.7% sequentially and 11.1% year-over-year. Revenue from Europe grew 1.3% sequentially and 13.9% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, Europe grew 2.7% sequentially.","Following some client specific weakness in the second quarter, the UK grew 4.1% sequentially, or 4.8% in constant currency terms. Continental Europe declined 2.6% sequentially and it was roughly flat in constant currency terms. We expect solid growth in the continent over the coming years. As we anticipate that the structural shift towards larger multiyear outsourcing programs drives expanded opportunities. The rest of the world continued to show good growth of 4.4% sequentially and 18.2% year-over-year.","Now, let me turn the call over to Karen to provide more details on our numbers.","Karen McLoughlin","","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $2.58 billion represented growth of 2.5% sequentially, and 11.9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.5%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.66 exceeded our previous guidance by $0.03.","Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 53.5% and 46.5% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 5.1% sequentially, and 18% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were flat sequentially and grew 5.7% from Q3 a year ago.","During the second quarter, 35% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We closed the quarter with 1,255 active clients and added seven strategic customers, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 264.","Today, we have repurchased approximately 34.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.13 billion under the share repurchase authorization of $2 billion, and have approximately $870 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count remains flat at 612.1 million shares in the quarter. Due to our knowledge of the TriZetto announcement, we were restricted from repurchasing shares during the third quarter.","Receivables were $2.1 billion, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 76.5 days, essentially flat with last quarter. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $338 million, up from $298 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 57% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables and the ramp up of certain new long-term fixed-bid contracts.","Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the third quarter with approximately $4.6 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $489 million from the quarter ending June 30, and up by approximately $1.3 billion from the year-ago period.","During the third quarter, operating activities generated approximately $583 million of cash. Financing activities were approximately $8.4 million use of cash, and capital expenditures were approximately $55.6 million during the quarter. As mentioned previously, we are preparing to close the acquisition of TriZetto. The funding for this acquisition will come from approximately $1.7 billion of cash on hand, and $1 billion debt facility. This debt is expected to be in the form of syndicated term loan. Additionally, we anticipate securing $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility.","Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics for the quarter. During the quarter, we added approximately 12,300 net new hires, and ended the quarter with nearly 200,000 employees globally, approximately 187,500 of which were service delivery staff. 43% of our new hires were direct college hires, while 57% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. Annualized attrition of 15.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down by 350 basis points from the year-ago period, and over 100 basis points from Q2 of this year.","Attrition levels are something we continue to monitor very closely, and we\u2019re pleased by the sequential and year-over-year decline in this metric. Utilization declined on a sequential basis as we on-boarded the net new hires. Offshore utilization was approximately 72%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates during our training program, was approximately 80% and on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for the rest of the year. This guidance excludes any impact from the acquisition of TriZetto. We now expect our full-year revenues to be in the range of $10.13 billion to $10.16 billion. We\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re able to increase guidance by, at least, $50 million, despite having to absorb a currency headwind of approximately $40 million since our previous guidance.","For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect to deliver revenue of between $2.61 billion and $2.64 billion, including approximately $4 million of revenue from the Cadient acquisition.","During the fourth quarter, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Also for the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of, at least, $0.63, our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 612 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.5%. We now expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of, at least, $2.57 for the full year. This guidance anticipates the full-year share count of approximately 612.3 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.3%.","Now, we\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","","Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask about the two things of weakness that you guys have kind of said, called out as improving. One, I think, last year the weakness was longer sales cycles, sounds like that close, just want to get some color on what\u2019s happened in the pipeline?","And then two, client weakness, it sounds like you\u2019re not seeing or not worrying about that as we head into 2015, so just one extra color on those two things? Thanks.","Gordon Coburn","","Hey, Bryan, it\u2019s Gordon. So on longer sales cycles, those comments were related to on these very large deals, they are just more complex and they take longer, it\u2019s really tougher to project. And we talked about three deals last quarter and those took a little longer to sign.","In terms of our normal deals, sales cycles have been normal all year. So I don\u2019t see any change in our sales cycle from earlier in the year. But let me be clear, that our sales cycle earlier in the year on, normal deals is absolutely fine and complex deals, it takes longer, and I would expect the future complex deals, those will be \u2013 those will continue to take long and that\u2019s baked into our planning.","In terms of client weakness, when we took our guidance down at the end of the second quarter, we pointed to \u2013 it was a handful of clients that was impacting that not overall demand environment. I think that continues to be the right statement. The overall demand environment is healthy. Those four clients \u2013 four or five clients did impact us. The impact of that fully washes through the system by the end of Q4.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","","Okay. Just a quick follow-up on outsourcing still flat sequentially, I think on growth. What's the outlook in the outsourcing business and congrats on the quarter.","Francisco D'Souza","Sure, so the outsourcing business is alive and well. When I think about some of the large deals that we\u2019ve won, such as Health Net and such as the deal we won with a large high-end financial services segment, those will be heavily weighted towards outsourcing, so there is a little bit of a low there, but when I look at the pipeline of deals that I won that start to ramp up next year certainly I would expect growth in outsourcing as well.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi, good morning. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 more about Europe, particularly the variance in the sequential growth in United Kingdom versus the continent? Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza","Hey, it\u2019s Frank. I think when we spoke \u2013 last quarter when you looked at the UK, we had a sequentially down quarter. Part of that was because some of these specific client situations to which we referred last quarter were in the UK, as that as Gordon pointed out, as that starts to flush through the system the underlying growth of the UK, which we think is still \u2013 which is still help these coming, it\u2019s showing in the numbers now.","I think the continent will continue to be \u2013 it\u2019s a great opportunity right now. We are underpenetrated in the continent, both at Cognizant level, but as an industry, global sourcing, I think there\u2019s still a lot of opportunity in the continent, but historically the continent has been a more \u2013 market has been more focused on discretionary spending. And so as we see the shift from discretionary spending to our outsourcing in the continent you\u2019ll find that that it will be somewhat lumpy and I think you saw that this quarter, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything fundamentally to read into that beyond the normal what I think of as continental European lumpiness.","Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Can you talk a little bit about the success of the India-centric firms in continental Europe and getting them to embrace doing their outsourcing work in India as opposed to doing it maybe more regionally? Are you seeing a shift there and is that a factor in both your current numbers and your outlook.","Francisco D'Souza","I would say, we\u2019ve said for years now that the model in continental Europe will require us to have very strong local presence, combined with a very solid near-shore delivery center and then, of course, with the global delivery model. You need all three pieces. You need a very strong local presence in country. You need a regional delivery network and you need a global delivery \u2013 a set of global delivery locations to serve continental Europe and all three of those pieces need to be in place.","Now we feel very good about our presence in continental Europe because of that, as you know, we\u2019ve invested very heavily both organically and inorganically to build out the local presence, going back to the acquisition that we did several years ago in Benelux of Infopulse, more recently Equinox in France and C1 in Germany. And then, of course, we\u2019ve also built the regional delivery network with regional centers in several locations, including our most recent regional delivery center in Spain.","We also have in the South of France and in Eastern Europe, and so on, that will continue to build out the regional delivery centers in Europe, and then, of course, the global delivery mechanism. So we feel very strong about our presence there and we think that you need all three of those pieces to succeed in continental Europe.","Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Mayank Tandon \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to focus on the SMAC side, what percent of Horizon 3 are SMAC today, Gordon or Frank? And then as you look at the business are you winning that from new customers or is most of the growth coming from clients where you already have very long term relationships with? And then finally on that, competitively are you seeing more niche players competing for the SMAC work or is it till the large SIs that you typically compete with for outsourcing type projects?","Gordon Coburn","Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Gordon. So a couple of things, we\u2019re seeing very healthy demand for SMAC and Digital within Horizon 3 and certainly that becomes the biggest component of Horizon 3, just given that\u2019s what customers are buying today. And we have just tremendous capabilities to deliver in the SMAC and Digital area. Who we\u2019re doing the work for? Certainly, it\u2019s weighted towards projects at existing customers, because we have the relationships those can kick in faster, but we are also successful at using it as a foot in the door with new clients, because clients are looking for innovative ideas in Digital and SMAC.","And we have some really good thought leadership. I\u2019m sure many of you\u2019ve read Code Halo book that we had published. People read that and they say come on in and talk to us at the C-Suite level. Who do we see competing? It\u2019s more weighted towards the fully integrated SI, but certainly there are bunch of niche players out there, so we compete with both, but when you look at the where the lion\u2019s share of the revenue is going, it\u2019s going to the larger SIs including us.","Mayank Tandon \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Ellis \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, I have a couple of questions about TriZetto. Gordon, you mentioned that the integration plans are well underway. Can you talk a little bit about what the plan is for continuing the innovation on the underlying TriZetto product in continuing to improve and modernize that product?","Gordon Coburn","Sure, Lisa. We\u2019re just thrilled about the technology and the capabilities, the subject matter expertise, the relationships we\u2019re getting as part of the TriZetto acquisition. We are planning \u2013 we want to make sure we continue to have best-in-class products and so certainly we\u2019re going to invest in the TriZetto platform and equally importantly remember, we also now have a really world class platform that we \u2013 as part of the Health Net acquisition and we\u2019re going to invest heavily in that.","So we\u2019ll have a range of platforms that as we invest in them, we believe will be best-in-class depending on what the specific needs are of the clients. So we\u2019re taking something that\u2019s good and we plan to make it even better.","Lisa Ellis \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Perfect. And then I think when you first announced TriZetto, it looked like sort of from the charts on the revenue synergies that the majority of the synergies expected in 2015 were likely to be systems integration work related, which I guess interpret to mean Cognizant selling your services into a lot of TriZetto\u2019s base.","Can you just talk about a bit of like tactically what\u2019s the plan is there to kind of drive quick revenue synergies in 2015?","Gordon Coburn","Sure, so obviously we\u2019re only in the planning phase, right now. We haven\u2019t begun any of the execution and we wouldn\u2019t until the transaction closes, but certainly there\u2019s synergy opportunities where clients are interested in broader range of services that Cognizant has the capability to offer at scale, where TriZetto on its own would not have had at scale. So clearly that opportunity exists and those are near term.","Longer term obviously, the big opportunity in our mind is the \u2013 having a fully integrated offering, similar to what we\u2019re doing to Health Net where we do that with the TriZetto platform, but obviously that\u2019s a much longer sale cycle. So I think you\u2019re right in thinking about the synergy on the IT services near term and longer term is the full stock opportunity.","Lisa Ellis \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi, I think you talked about on maybe the last call $200 million of incremental revenue. I was wondering is that still a relevant number for 2015. And how should we look about that \u2013 at that given the visibility on Health Net and the acquisition has probably improved as well?","Francisco D'Souza","I think that the $200 million number is the right number, that\u2019s certainly \u2013 that\u2019s certainly what that we\u2019re focused on. That reflects the timing of when we think that Health Net deal will close. So yes, I think our prior thoughts on that are still applicable.","Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then just sort of a two-part question if I could, in some of the contracts that you had some issues with this year, has \u2013 what can we expect for those to \u2013 from a comeback perspective in 2015, do you think you\u2019ll get half of that business back and some of it. And then the second part of that is, did seasonality change at all, now that you\u2019re doing a little bit more. It sounds like transaction based work on the healthcare side?","Francisco D'Souza","So let me start with seasonality. Certainly, in the platform business or the TriZetto business there is more seasonality than in our traditional business weighted towards the fourth quarter. But given the overall size of the company, I don\u2019t know if it significantly moves the needle on overall company revenue, but for that, that piece of the business certainly there's more seasonality. Sorry could you repeat the first part of the question?","Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yes, I was just wondering some of the business got pushed delayed, or maybe even you lost it heading into the back half of this year cause you to change your guidance. I was just wondering, what can we expect, is that going to be fully recovered in 2015, or will we get half of it back? I\u2019m just trying to gauge sort of, how that works out into next year\u2019s numbers?","Francisco D'Souza","Sure. So I would not think about it as pent-up demand, where they just defer the project and therefore they\u2019re going to give us that plus normal business. So I think that the revenue that we got hit with this year, that is \u2013 that revenue is lost now. Will some of these accounts start to grow, and I think the answer is yes, some of them will \u2013 but certainly not all of them. But remember, put it in perspective, we are talking about a single handful of accounts.","Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Right, great.","Francisco D'Souza","So we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are and with those accounts is playing out, just as we expected.","Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi, thank you. I had two, also, the first is, perhaps for you Karen. Could you talk a little bit about the puts and takes in operating margins for this quarter relative to last year? Your non-GAAP operating margins were down about 90 basis points. And as part of that discussion for both, the September and December quarter, the variance between GAAP and non-GAAP has widened a bit, both from acquisition-related charges, as well as stock-based comp. Is that going to be a relatively static spread, as we look at the December quarter? And then I have a follow-up please.","Karen McLoughlin","","Sure, Keith. So on the operating margin versus last year, two big things, one is obviously raises kicked in Q3 as we had expected them to. And then the second thing is utilization. So utilization with the 12,000 hires that we did in Q3 is up or is down rather quite considerably over two points from last year.","So it\u2019s really that combination of utilization and then raises and promotions, which took margins down into the 19.5% range, frankly as we had expected we said the margins would come down from where they had been running in Q2 and generally right in line with what we expected. Then in terms of the GAAP to non-GAAP spread, that will fluctuation. So obviously once we close the TriZetto acquisition, acquisition and amortization will increase quite significantly. We'll obviously have better color on that when we actually close the deal and can provide guidance on those numbers.","But what you did see in Q3 was some of the acquisition-related expenses due diligence and so forth, and that will obviously spill over into Q4 as well moving forward. So, certainly over time, we would expect that debt to grow, which is one of the reasons, frankly, why we\u2019ve been moving towards this non-GAAP definition and non-GAAP guidance moving forward.","Gordon Coburn","And let me just add to that. We clearly think the way to think about the businesses on a non-GAAP basis, particularly as the spread widens due to the purchase accounting on TriZetto.","Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Related to that, Gordon, is my second question. When you think about closing TriZetto and Health Net, could you just confirm how we should be thinking about that as we look at calendar year 2015? I know you don\u2019t want to give us specifics, but philosophically, is there any reason why you would maintain in that 19% to 20% range, as you approach FY'15, including even the beginning of the year as you are trying to integrate these assets?","Gordon Coburn","Certainly, on a non-GAAP basis, I think, it is a very good assumption that we would stand on 19% to 20% non-GAAP operating margin range, including the impact of both Health Net and TriZetto.","Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Thank you. Karen, could you provide a little bit more detail on wage and pricing trends you referenced the wage increase in Q3, and then earlier in the call you talked about stable pricing. Can you just flash that out a little bit more?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. So let me start with pricing and then I think ask Gordon to cover up on the wages. So in terms of pricing, generally, it\u2019s been stable, obviously you will have mix shift that happens so BPO is stronger than consulting, for example. But I think, we\u2019ve seen a very consistent trend over the last several quarters of stable pricing clients and much more focus now on the total cost of outsourcing and looking for partners that can provide real value and provide both the \u2013 as we talked about the run better and run different side of the equation.","So help them drive down their cost of doing business, but also help them drive innovation, and that balance is what frankly allows you to maintain stable pricing as long as you\u2019re providing appropriate value. But I'll let, Gordon, talk about the wage increases.","Gordon Coburn","So wages landed right in line with what we indicated last quarter, which was a bit above 2013, and I was expected and we talked about that last quarter. So offshore wages were right around the 10% mark, on-site wages were low-single digits, but about a point higher than it was last year. So a little bit up from last year, but no surprises compared to what we thought three months ago.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners","Thanks. And just could you quantify the revenue from Cadient?","Karen McLoughlin","It\u2019s about $4 million in Q4, there was none in Q3. That deal closed in October.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore Partners","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with question.","Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the discussion about four to five large clients that pulled back. Are some now indicating that the ramp growth backup in early 2015, and not pent-up demand, but just the normal course?","Gordon Coburn","Both four of those clients and all our clients in general, obviously we\u2019re smack in the middle of the budget process this year. So it\u2019s a little too early to know what each client\u2019s going to do, some \u2013 I would expect some of those to have growth next year, that\u2019s probably not all depending on where they are. So it will be mixed bag and that\u2019s \u2013 and that, and we\u2019re very comfortable with that.","Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then separately back on utilization, you\u2019ve done a nice job of improving utilization over the last 12 months. I know it\u2019s impacted by turning around new hires, but as you look out to next year do you see that as an area where we could get continued margin leverage?","Gordon Coburn","I don\u2019t think there will be a meaningful leverage off of utilization, clearly, we have opportunities in our pyramid. And so we\u2019ll certainly look at that lever a bit. Three is a little of room offshore, on-site we are at our target utilization. But as, I think, Karen mentioned, we certainly have ramped up our hiring of college students.","We\u2019re just getting the top, we\u2019ll get such high quality college students right now because of the brand that we\u2019re enjoying both and that\u2019s college hiring in the U.S., in India, as well as Europe, across the globe. So I would think more about pyramid as the level for 2015 less so about utilization.","Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys. So I know it's obviously preliminary to give any specific numbers for next year, but conceptually given the fact that demand condition seem to be fairly healthy, and you have Health Net as well as a couple other deals ramping up next year. Is there any conceptual reason why organic growth can't be in a similar range next year as it is this year?","Gordon Coburn","Look I \u2013 what I'll say, we feel good about the demand environment, right now. We \u2013 the dual mandate that we talked about, it\u2019s truly playing out across the industries we serve. We see a large number of, what we think of it multi-tower integrated deals in the pipeline. I look at that as a proxy for one side of the dual mandate or the efficiency effect in the side of the dual mandate.","And then as we\u2019ve said many times, we feel very good about how we're positioned for the demand for new digital technologies. So, fundamentals of the demand are strong. Having said, if you step back and you look at macro environment right at the big market, highly fragmented, lots of geographic growth opportunity for Cognizant, when we think about our presence in the Continental Europe and Asia, those are small, but \u2013 small market for us, large market opportunities.","So I think the fundamentals are strong, demand remains strong, and we\u2019ve got a great client base. We were impacted this year by the small handful of very specific client situations. Those we believe abate by the end of the year, so going into next year, we feel good about the environment, early conversations with clients don\u2019t give us cause for concern at this point.","","Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies LLC","And my next question about the demand environment, I mean, in terms of the integrated deals, which obviously are larger in terms of the (inaudible) presumably longer in terms of their sales cycle. Is that something that we should think about being semi-permanent, at least, part of your pipeline? In other words could there be more lumpiness going forward?","Gordon Coburn","I think it\u2019s fair to say, you will see more of these in the pipeline. But just keep it in perspective, this is still a small number or a small number of the overall \u2013 our pipeline of the overall opportunity that we have. The vast majority of our business still comes from the old land and expand that we've always talked to you about. So, yes, would I expect to see some more Health Net life deals, certainly we talked about that in the context of the synergy opportunities we see from TriZetto, for example.","So I think those will be in the pipeline and the sales cycles there will be longer, but I think that the core base business will continue to be as we have historically been sort of the land and expand kind of work.","Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Essex \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to touch a little bit on your balance sheet philosophy. As you introduced into the balance sheet and you closed on few acquisitions, what is the longer-term philosophy is maintaining on the balance sheet and, perhaps, also the mix of cash offshore, and what kind of flexibility you anticipate to maintain going forward?","Francisco D'Souza","So, Brian, you touched on the key issue there. A good chunk of our cash is offshore, certainly we can use it for non-US acquisitions, but it is quite expensive to bring home. When we look at our cash flow characteristics for the company, as excluding future large acquisitions, and as we said, we are not planning to do any future large acquisitions until TriZetto is well integrated.","The \u2013 our cash flow characteristics in the U.S. do enable us to do some \u2013 continue to do some share repurchases in the U.S., obviously we couldn\u2019t do that in Q3, because we were blocked out. Longer-term, the key is, we want to make sure, we have the flexibility to take advantage of the quickly changing market, yes, we still have a lot of work to do in various geographies.","So we have not laid out a specific mix of how much the share repurchase versus dividends, versus acquisitions. We want to make sure that we continue to take as a \u2013 act as a leader in the market and stay ahead of our clients in terms of where they want to \u2013 what type of services they want. But certainly, we do have both the authorization for additional share repurchases and we'll have the cash flow to resume doing some of those going forward.","Brian Essex \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just to kind of touch a real quick on TriZetto, it looks relatively vertical specific, particularly with regard to the packaged software side of the business, and how do you think about translating that technology over to adjacent verticals or different verticals and leveraging them across other industry groups?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes, it\u2019s Frank, Brian. Look, I think, as you pointed out, the vast majority of TriZetto is very focused, very specific to the healthcare vertical. So I don\u2019t see opportunities to take their technology to other verticals once we close the transaction. There are couple of exceptions to that.","One is that TriZetto have some very interesting advanced automation, software robotic kind of technology that we've acquired in the healthcare space, which we think could be relevant across the industries. We think that advanced autonomics and robotics \u2013 software robotics are very important advanced automation technologies that will be very relevant to our business going forward, across the industries and in particular lines of business like our BPO, BPS service offerings, our IT infrastructure service offering. So there are some pockets of TriZetto technology that we think will apply to other industries.","Brian Essex \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. I want to sort of touch on the 4Q guide, and the actual increase in the guide on the context of pretty meaningful FX headwinds, so it\u2019s actually a pretty strong uptick in the guide, maybe, Gordon, if you could give us a little bit color around that and the thinking being was the client specific headwinds coming out of 2Q, is that somewhat less than you had thought, any potential for year-end budget flush, but just a little bit more color around the uptick in the 4Q guide, which is kind of unusual for you?","Gordon Coburn","Sure, Glenn. First of all the $40 million FX headwind that Karen mentioned, about half of that hit us in Q3, compared to when we gave guidance half is in Q4, so it\u2019s not all Q4 and I think Q3 was a little bit better than the reported numbers it shows. When I look at Q4, I wouldn\u2019t point you that the clients where we are having some challenges that that\u2019s what made the difference. I think it\u2019s just broad-based across really across industries, across client base, a little bit here, and a little bit there, and it all adds up.","If I look at what's \u2013 what people are spending on, there is just tremendous interest in digital and SMAC services and people is trying to get their feet wet with that. So I would not think about it as the handful of clients flushed out sooner than we expected, those are playing out just as we expected. But across the rest of the customer base, we are seeing a little bit stronger performance than we would have originally thought.","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","And no budge flush issues?","Gordon Coburn","We are not seeing anything, we are seeing some furloughs actually, not seeing any material budget flushes.","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","And then just finally on the head count hiring, which is pretty aggressive both year-over-year and Q-to-Q, is that somewhat of a catch-up from slower head count growth during the year, or how do we sort of think about that in the context of sort of heading into 2015?","Gordon Coburn","So little bit of a catch, obviously we are taking the utilization up quite a bit. The skills that we need to shift a little bit, so we wanted to make sure we don\u2019t have any skills mismatch, or so we sacrificed a little bit of utilization just as we get that all aligned. We also wanted to bring all of the college students on board by the end of this year who are graduated in May. We thought that was important, so about 45% of the hiring in Q3 was the college students. So you put it altogether, it enables us to make sure that we are going to have the right skills for the change in demand and position ourselves well, so we don\u2019t have revenue leakage as we go into next year.","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with the questions.","Steven Milunovich \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Thank you. Regarding the SMAC revenues, are you willing to update how much they are this year? And I guess, my question is that Accenture claims that about 17% of its revenue is in the SMAC category, you appear to be quite a bit less than that, why is that?","Karen McLoughlin","So in terms of \u2013 so, Steve, in terms of the overall revenue, we have not provided an updated detail, we've talked last year about it being about $500 million, but it is as Gordon mentioned previously, it is certainly growing very fast right now, and certainly faster than company average. I will let Frank actually add a little bit more color around what he sees in the marketplace.","Francisco D'Souza","To your second question, I think, part of the issue is that, so much of what we do now is across the business, is what I would broadly categorize as digital or digital related that it really depict, comes down to sort of a definition of what you are defining digital to be. The \u2013 when we gave you the number, we did about a year ago, of about $500 million of SMAC, that was a relatively pure definition of technology, services related to social, mobile, analytics, and cloud.","Digital has expanded well beyond that right now, and I would say it touches almost every aspect of Cognizant's business. And so from a definitional standpoint, I think that, comparing across the industry to say, how much of revenues digital becomes somewhat tricky, because it really depends on making sure that you are looking at apples-to-apples and I'm not sure there is a good way to do that at this point.","Having said all of that, I feel very confident, the measure I use that I think is most relevant is, how we are doing in the marketplace and what are our win rates and how our customers telling us we are doing with respect to digital technologies, and I feel very good about that. Our win rates are solid. The work we are doing for clients is transformational and digital, and we feel good about how we are positioned going into next year from a digital standpoint.","Steven Milunovich \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","That\u2019s helpful. I agree, it\u2019s not clear, it\u2019s apples-to-apples. And then I want to ask about BPO or BPaaS, I hear investors having some concern about looking back historically how many will successful BPO platforms can you point to? What's the margin going to be on this business versus your historic business? It sounds great to generate your own IP and so forth, but what comfort can you give us regarding the profitability for the BPO business going forward?","Francisco D'Souza","So when we look at what we mean by BPaaS, a combination of infrastructure platform, our people doing the processing clients behind the outcome, leveraging both the global delivery model and obviously very deep IT capabilities. Certainly, we have to make assumptions about productivity gains and so forth. But as we have a lot of track record of understanding of what we can achieve in terms of productivity on these, so I actually feel quite comfortable with it.","Now, obviously the timing of profitability differs on these deals. The profitability tends to ramp up as you go through the transaction, but as long as you have enough of them in the system and stagger it out I think it should be fine. And the reality is, this is the way the market is shifting. Clearly, this is what clients want to buy, so we have to make sure that we have a highly competitive offering and an offering where we make the margins that we want. And we\u2019re very focused on that. We think it\u2019s quite achievable.","Steven Milunovich \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in. Gordon, is there anything different that we should look at in terms of our assumptions for Health Net next year and specifically in focusing on the regulatory approval process? And I think you\u2019ve indicated in the past, I thought that it happens. I mean, we\u2019re talking about four states, and we thought that this thing probably gets completed by the middle of next year. Do you feel that this thing actually happens earlier than that or this is still middle of next year?","Gordon Coburn","I think your assumption is correct. Health Net has stated publically that they would expect to receive regulatory approvals in the first-half of next year. So I think the assumption that you\u2019re making is probably an appropriate one.","Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","So the contribution to the income statements starts following through in Q3 or sometime in Q2?","Gordon Coburn","It gets phased a little bit, because there\u2019s some preliminary setup work and so forth, but the significant impact happens once we have regulatory approval and we go live.","Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","I\u2019m assuming starting in Q3 and then maybe getting a bit stronger in Q4 of next year.","Karen McLoughlin","Moshe, so the contract actually ramps over the first two to two-and-a-half years, so it will ramp up over time in 2015 and 2016 and in 2017.","Francisco D'Souza","Yes, we\u2019ll give more color on how to model it as or we\u2019ll give a little more color on seasonality when we talk about our guidance in February.","Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","All right. Thank you.","David Nelson","Yes, thanks, Moshe. And thanks everybody for joining us today and for your questions. We look forward to speaking with you again, next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s Cognizant Technology Solution\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines."],"6343":["Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call February  5, 2020  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Katie Royce - Global Head-IR","Brian Humphries - CEO","Karen McLoughlin - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Edward Caso - Wells Fargo","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Rod Bourgeois - DeepDive Equity","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America","Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions' Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Katie.","Katie Royce","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the Company's fourth quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures, can be found in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.","Brian Humphries","Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody.","As I stated on prior calls, Cognizant is in the midst of a multi-year project, whose aim is to re-position the Company to realize its full growth potential. And today, I'd like to briefly cover our Q4 performance and then turn our attention to 2020.","After a challenging start to 2019, we're seeing higher levels of engagement from our leaders and optimism as we rally behind client centricity and revenue growth. We're making progress, but there is more work to do in the quarters ahead.","Q4 revenue grew 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency, or $4.28 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.07 and we delivered strong cash flow. Macro demand remains stable, but challenging. There is a distinction between traditional work versus digital. Legacy services are subject to meaningful pricing pressure at renewals, competition and indeed in-sourcing.","Meanwhile, clients continue to invest in digital to become modern, data enabled, customer centric and differentiated businesses. These trends are set to continue to our strategic posture and operational and financial initiatives are aligned to address this market reality.","On a geographic basis, Q4 revenue in North America grew 3.1% year-over-year, while revenue in our growth markets region grew 7.4% in constant currency. In both geographies, we are determined to accelerate growth, but the opportunity is especially significant in our international business where we remain under-penetrated and we must do better.","From an industry segment view, in Q4, our Financial Services global revenue grew 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Both banking and insurance were weak throughout 2019. Full-year insurance revenue growth slowed primarily due to a modest decline in North America, albeit with a return in the second half of the year, where we saw growth in Q3 and indeed Q4 year-over-year.","In banking, we continued to see particular weakness in capital markets and commercial banking, offset by growth in payments and retail, with retail having benefited from the Samlink deal. Both global accounts and local accounts declined for the full-year.","North America performance, while still declining, has been improving throughout the year, and we see that trend continuing. Europe remains weak, with some macro uncertainty and some Cognizant specific issues.","In Healthcare, we reversed two quarters of decline, with constant currency growth of 1.8% year-over-year. I remain pleased with our performance in life sciences, which delivered double-digit growth.","However, this was offset by ongoing declines in our Healthcare vertical, which continues to be impacted by contract renegotiations at some of our largest clients following industry consolidation and by in-sourcing at a large client.","Our other two segments Products & Resources and Communications, Media & Technology, posted high-single digit revenue growth in constant currency year-over-year. Down from double-digit in prior quarters.","Revenue growth in the Technology segment slowed meaningfully in the quarter following our recent announcement to exit a subset of this content services business over the coming quarters. Later in our call, Karen will take you through the details of the quarter.","Let's now turn to 2020, including executing the recommendations that the transformation office as they relate to strategy, operating and commercial model, our cost base and more. We enter 2020 with a two-pronged strategy that aims to expose Cognizant to faster growing market categories.","The first element is to protect and optimize our core business while scaling internationally. The second part is to invest to compete and win in four key digital battlegrounds; data, digital engineering, cloud and IoT. Our strategy leverages our technology services heritage whilst accelerating our position in digital where our brand recognition and commercial momentum can improve.","The strategy resonates well with our clients who've always cited our strength in the run and operations side, who want us to further strengthen our digital portfolio to assist them in their innovation agenda.","We're determined to help our clients become fully digital, data enabled, customer-centric businesses. We will continue to use M&A to execute this strategy. This week, we announced two acquisitions focused on expanding our cloud capabilities.","On Monday, we announced the acquisition of Code Zero Consulting, a firm that specializes in helping companies digitally transform by providing strategy, implementation and migration capabilities to evolve legacy systems to cloud-based configure price quote and billing systems.","And earlier today, we announced that we've entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire the French operations of EI Technologies, a Paris-based, privately-held digital technology consulting firm. Cloud has changed the way that IT is delivered across infrastructure applications and platforms, and both of these acquisitions are Salesforce Platinum Partners and will help us build upon one of our most strategic and fastest growing practices. In addition, in Q4, we closed our previously announced acquisition of Contino, a leading consultancy that specializes in enterprise DevOps methodologies and advanced data platforms.","The transformation office also recommended changes to our operating and commercial model. After months of detailed analysis, on January 1, we implemented a series of measures to accelerate our commercial momentum as part of our sales transformation initiative.","These include a new customer segmentation that prioritizes account and ensures we get the right resources, underwrite account at the right time, new sales compensation plans that reward overperformance, encourage greater up-sell and cross-sell in our existing accounts, and increase our focus on new logos, and the alignment of our specialist sales team to our service line to increase our subject matter expertise by key practices.","To-date, I'm pleased with what we've seen in our sales force initiative. We have renewed energy and our win rates continue to improve. Our previously announced hiring of 500 revenue generating associates is on track, and in line with modeled assumption. In addition to these 500, we plan to double the number of associates supporting our more strategic alliances, with all three leading hyperscale companies and SaaS vendors.","Complementing these commercial changes, our recently appointed Chief Marketing Officer has been working diligently to better align our marketing spend to a growth priority. This includes, strengthening our point of view by industry segments, including targeting the account-based marketing and digitizing our customer engagement strategy. Our marketing spend will increase in 2020 as we aim to support our revenue aspiration and better position Cognizant as a leader in digital.","In parallel, we've also worked to simplify the organization, empowering our client partners with speed of execution and account P&L ownership, and clarifying responsibilities and decision rights for all roles across the sales lifecycle. To ensure we have the right digital skills in a supply constrained environment, we doubled our investments in Cognizant Academy in 2020 to reskill and redeploy talent towards our digital imperative. To accelerate our digital momentum, we believe we need to hire or reskill approximately 25,000 resources in 2020 alone and we started to operationalize it.","Finally, as we make these investments in automation, training, marketing and sales, we've been diligently reducing our cost structure to ensure we can be fit for growth. Karen will bring you through the details of our restructuring program later in the call.","Engagement and confidence are essential in a people business. Therefore, we have been energetically communicating and contextualizing the reasons for the changes we're going through and engaging the organization to rally everyone behind our goal","I'm pleased to see the mood in the Company continue to pick up, both at an executive level and throughout the broader organization. Our annualized attrition rate fell 3 points sequentially to 21%. Some of this can be accounted for by normal seasonality, but the fact that voluntary attrition rates declined year-over-year is actually even more encouraging. Of course, as we execute our restructuring program, we will remain diligent and stay focused on increasing employee engagement and reducing attrition.","We also recognize that we need to rally the organization behind a common purpose that goes beyond financial return. We've, therefore, spent a great deal of time in recent months defining a compelling Company purpose statement, which will serve as our North Star that guides and inspires us to make the right strategic move in the years ahead. We've also refined our Company's values and behaviors that define what will be celebrated and tolerated. We will unveil this to the broader organization in the coming months.","We determine to stay true to the heart and soul of our Company. And having recently attended our Annual Global Planning Summit, one held in Dallas the other in Dubai, where the executive team and I spoke to thousands of associates about the Company's strategy and expectations for 2020, I can tell you that I came away from these summits filled with optimism about our collective ability to move the Company forward.","Let me conclude by saying that after a challenging first quarter, we've become a more focused, determined and confident Company as we move through 2019. There's a great deal of urgency in Cognizant these days. It starts with me. Any distractions we've had are now behind us. Our team is energized with the clarity of our strategy, the magnitude of the market opportunity, our renewed client centricity and our increased employee value proposition focus.","While our hard work in the past year will serve us well in 2020, there remains some important areas that require progress in the years ahead. Pricing in our heritage business continues to pressure gross margins. We have efforts underway to address renewal pricing strategy as well as our cost of delivery efficiency, including pyramid management, automation and other measures.","Meanwhile, as more work shifts to project-based digital engagements, we are implementing refinements in our digital pricing strategy and continuing to optimize resource planning and allocation.","The leadership team and I are fully aware that we have a multi-year project ahead of us, and we are united in our resolve to work with rigor and tenacity to achieve our goals and once again, make Cognizant the industry bellwether.","Before I turn the call over to Karen, I want to acknowledge the Cognizant Co-founder, former CEO and long-time Director, Frank D'Souza, has let us know if his plan to resign from Cognizant Board of Directors effective March 31.","Along with his remarkable track record of success as Cognizant's CEO for a dozen years, Frank has served with distinction on Cognizant's Board since 2007 and Vice Chairman since June 30, 2019. On behalf of the entire Board, I want to extend their deep gratitude to Frank for his pioneering leadership and quarter century of dedication to Cognizant.","Today, we also announced that Vinita Bali will be joining our Board of Directors later this month. I look forward to her contributions and partnership.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will give you an update on our operational and financial performance, as well as a view of how we see the year ahead. Karen?","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.","For the full-year 2019, revenue increased to $16.8 billion and represented growth of 4.1% year-over-year, or 5.2% in constant currency. Fourth quarter revenue of $4.3 billion was above the high end of our guided range and represented growth of 3.8% year-over-year, or 4.2% in constant currency.","The revenue out-performance versus guidance was broad-based across our industries. Digital revenue continues to grow above 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 38% of total revenues for the quarter.","Moving to the industry verticals, Financial Services growth was up 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency driven primarily by insurance. However, the project-based work that we benefited from in Q3, did not extend in the Q4.","We saw a modest slowdown in Banking sequentially, reflecting typical year end seasonality and furloughs. As Brian mentioned within Banking our performance continues to be negatively impacted by a few of our global accounts, as well as some slowness in certain regional and other clients.","While macro uncertainty persists, we expect budgets within Banking to be broadly stable in 2020, with North American banks better positioned relative to UK and Continental Europe given continued Brexit uncertainty and our ongoing challenges with a few of our largest accounts.","Against that backdrop, we continue to have a muted outlook for Banking. However, we are confident in the initial steps our new Head of Banking has taken to re-position us for growth. We expect this client centricity to drive deeper and more robust account planning and marketing.","By partnering well with digital business to ensure we increase our relevance to banks, we have also implemented a solutions team to bring ease of repeatability, ensure we develop more compelling thought leadership and better align with key partners.","Moving on to Healthcare, which returned to year-over-year growth up 1.8% in constant currency. Life sciences again grew strong double digits year-over-year benefiting from demand within digital operations and the contribution of Zenith Technologies.","Additionally, we see continued momentum within our industry specific platform solutions such as the shared investigator portal for clinical trials, which has users in over 80 countries across 14,000 facilities covering over 400 active trials.","Within our Healthcare vertical, revenue declined mid-single-digits year-over-year as performance continues to be impacted primarily by large clients involved in mergers and the continued shift of work to the captive at a large client.","We expect similar year-over-year trends in Healthcare in Q1 and improvement in the year-over-year trends in the Healthcare vertical beginning in Q2 as we lap the headwinds that impacted the business in 2019.","We expect continued cautious spend with healthcare payers, as we approach the elections in the US later this year, and so we're maintaining a cautious growth outlook for the Healthcare vertical.","Products & Resources grew 8.6% year-over-year in constant currency. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, the expected slower growth on a year-over-year basis in Products & Resources in the fourth quarter as we lapped the ramp up of work with new logos and the contribution of acquisitions made in Q4 2018.","We were pleased that the growth in the quarter continued to be broad based growth across our industries. Results reflect demand for core modernization services of enterprise applications, and for digital engineering, cloud and IoT solutions. And we expect these trends to continue in 2020.","Our Communications, Media & Technology segment grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency, where we saw an acceleration in the Communications and Media vertical driven by an increase in demand for services in core modernization and cloud transformation services. We expect to continued solid performance of telecom clients as traditional telco companies look to transform into digital service providers.","Additionally, we see convergence across media and communications companies driving investments in technologies and services and hyper personalized consumption and create new and engaging experiences for consumers.","In Technology, growth was negatively impacted by our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. This negatively impacted the year-over-year growth of the CMT segment by approximately 200 basis points, or $11 million. I'll provide more color on the expected impact from our decision to exit certain parts of the content services business in my Q1 and full-year 2020 guidance.","Now, turning to geos. We were disappointed with growth in Europe, which grew 5.3% year-over-year in constant currency, reflecting a slowdown in both the UK and Continental Europe. A more cautious macro environment continues to weigh on spend across industries in the UK, while we also have some Cognizant specific challenges in a few large banking clients.","The rest of world grew 14.5% year-over-year in constant currency, the strongest performance in seven quarters. While our global banking relationships continue to pressure growth in Asia-Pacific, we have seen improved traction in countries such as Australia and Japan in insurance and life sciences.","Moving on to margins, in Q4, our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 14.6% and $0.72, respectively. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring charges, was 17% and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.07.","Before getting into more details on margins, I want to provide an update on the enactment of a new tax regime in India that enables domestic companies who elect to be taxed at an income tax rate of 25% compared to the current rate of 35%. The company electing into the lower rate is required to forego any tax holidays associated with the special economic zones and certain other tax incentives, including MAT credit carry-forward.","Our current intent is to elect into the lower rate once our existing MAT assets are substantially utilized. As a result, we recorded a one-time net income tax expense of $21 million due to the revaluations to the lower income tax rate of our existing India net deferred income tax asset. This had a negative $0.04 impact on GAAP EPS in the quarter.","Our adjusted operating margin was flat year-over-year, reflecting SG&A discipline, offset by continued pressure on gross margins, including a $25 million write-off of certain capitalized set up costs for a large healthcare customer. The write-off negatively impacted gross margins by 50 basis points and EPS by $0.04.","Over the last several quarters we have taken steps to start to right size our cost structure, primarily focused on reducing overhead in the business, with those benefits evident in the year-over-year improvement in SG&A.","These savings are necessary to fund the planned additional investments in areas such as sales resources, branding, talent and lean and automation enhancements across the Company.","However, gross margins declined year-over-year as we continue to face pricing pressure in the legacy parts of our business that require us to take additional actions in 2020 around pyramid optimizations and pricing levers such as COLA and aligning bill rates with promotions.","We expect our 2020 Fit For Growth Plan that we announced last quarter to drive improvements in these areas. I'll provide an update on the actions taken in Q4 under the 2020 Fit For Growth Plan as well as additional details on the expected execution of this plan later in the call.","Turning to our balance sheet, our cash and short-term investment balance as of December 31, stood at $3.4 billion, up approximately $315 million from September 30, but down $1.1 billion from the year ago period, reflecting the over $2.2 billion of share repurchases completed in 2019 and approximately $620 million deployed on acquisitions.","As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $414 million related to the ongoing dispute with the India Income Tax department.","We generated $845 million of free cash flow in the quarter and DSO of 73 days improved 3 days sequentially due to strong collections. On a year-over-year basis DSO improved by 1 day. In the fourth quarter, we made a change to our accounting policy related to DSOs to better align with industry practice and better reflect the amounts due from our customers on our balance sheet.","Beginning in Q4, we started to net certain amounts due to customers such as discounts and rebates with trade accounts receivable rather than reflecting those amounts as a liability on our balance sheet. This change does not have any impact on our operating results or cash flows.","Our outstanding debt balance was $738 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the fourth quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for approximately $150 million and our diluted share count decreased to 548 million shares for the quarter. In 2019, we repurchased over 34 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion.","Today, we are announcing a 10% increase to our quarterly cash dividend, the second increase since we initiated the dividend in 2017. Additionally, the Board has approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization.","Before I turn to guidance, let me provide an update on the progress of the 2020 Fit For Growth Plan as well as the content work that we are in the process of exiting. Our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan is expected to run for two years. This program is designed to simplify the way we work, improve our cost structure and fund investments aimed at accelerating our revenue growth.","As previously announced, we expect to remove 10,000 to 12,000 mid-to-senior level associates from their current roles. We will make every effort to identify productive roles based on client demand and continue to assume that approximately 5,000 associates will have the opportunity to reskill for new roles within the Company.","In Q4, we incurred $48 million of charges, including $42 million of severance charges as part of the Fit For Growth Plan. These charges relate to approximately 550 associates, most of whom we expect will exit the Company by the end of Q1 and we expect will result in a cash impact of approximately $40 million in the first quarter, with full run rate savings not achieved until Q2 for these associates.","We continue to expect the majority of the remaining associates to exit the Company by mid-2020. We are managing this process carefully and any time we make decisions that impact our employees, we take it very seriously.","Additionally, we continue to review our real estate portfolio as part of the Fit For Growth Plan and expect to take further action related to real estate rationalization in 2020. These actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2020 and are expected to result in 2020 in-year gross savings of over $450 million and annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in the year 2021.","Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we began the exit of a subset of our Content Services business. Approximately $5 million of the $48 million Fit For Growth charges in the quarter related to retention and severance for approximately 1,100 of the expected 5,000 to 6,000 total associates to be impacted by the wind down of this work.","We have updated our estimate of the number of associates to be impacted by the wind down from 6,000 to a range of 5,000 to 6,000, as we expect to retain more work with these clients in other Content and Technology services than originally estimated. We now estimate that we may lose revenues of $225 million to $255 million, down from our previous estimate of $240 million to $270 million on an annualized basis within our Communications, Media and Technology segment.","We continue to anticipate revenues will ramp down over the next one to two years, with an expected impact of $20 million to $25 million of revenue in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. This is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted operating margin rate subject to the timing of the ramp down and other factors.","We also continue to expect to incur wind-down charges related to the transition of these associates and any related assets such as real estate and equipment. We are working with our partners to transition this work, while continuing to meet our contractual obligations and providing impacted associates with a number of transition assistance programs, including retention bonuses, severance packages and the opportunities to participate in various reskilling programs.","At the time of our Q4 earnings call, we provided an estimate of $150 million to $200 million in total expected charges associated with this Fit For Growth cost transformation plan, including the wind down of certain content work.","Based on our actions to-date attrition at the senior levels of the pyramid being slightly higher than our expectations and less impact from the exit of certain content services, we now expect to be towards the low-end of that range, while maintaining the annualized gross savings estimates of $500 million to $550 million.","Before turning to guidance, I want to comment on the potential change in the dividend distribution tax that was announced as part of the India budget a few days ago. We are currently analyzing this proposal, but believe it can, once enacted, significantly lower the cost of repatriating funds back to the US. The proposal is not yet law but the expected date is April 1, 2020.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full-year 2020. For the full-year 2020, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year to $17.11 billion to $17.45 billion on a reported and constant currency basis as based on the current exchange rates we are not expecting a material impact from foreign exchange.","This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 110 basis points year-over-year growth from our decision to exit certain content work within our CMT segment. This guidance continues to reflect a muted outlook for financial services and healthcare.","We expect first quarter revenue growth in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year to $4.21 billion to $4.25 billion on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to constant currency growth in the range of 2.8% to 3.8% year-over-year, or $4.23 billion to $4.27 billion, reflecting our assumption of a negative 30 basis points for foreign exchange for the first quarter.","This includes our estimate of the negative impact of approximately 60 basis points to year-over-year growth from our decision to exit certain work within the content services business, which will be reflected in the CMT segment.","Revenue guidance for both Q1 and the full-year assumes a cautious macro outlook in the UK, continued slow growth in financial services and healthcare, as well as the previously mentioned impact of exiting certain content work.","For the full-year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margins to be between 16% and 17%, which is assumes incentive compensations to be at target payouts. We expect Q1 margins to be slightly below the low end of the range as we are investing in sales hiring, training, tooling and automation and marketing and branding while the timing of the savings from the actions taken under our Fit for Growth Plan and the return on our sales investments will not have reached the full quarter run rate.","As a reminder, our full year 2019 margin rate reflects lower incentive compensation payouts given our underperformance versus target. Our guidance assumes that in 2020, we will perform at plan, and therefore, incentive compensation will reflect target payout rates. This is a margin rate headwind of approximately 120 basis points year-over-year that we plan to absorb. The midpoint of our 2020 margin guidance of 16% to 17%, therefore, reflects approximately 100 basis points of improvement over the 2019 margins normalized for incentive compensation.","We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.97 the $4.13. Our EPS guidance anticipates a year-over-year decrease of approximately $30 million in interest income, reflecting a lower cash balance and reduced interest rates in both the US and India. This is expected to impact EPS by approximately $0.04. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 548 million shares and the tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%.","Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes restructuring charges and other unusual items, if any, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, clarification if any by the Indian government as to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India Defined Contribution Obligation, and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes, such as immigration or tax policy.","With that, operator, we can open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan Keane","Want to ask about the cadence of revenue growth in 2020. Looks like you guided 1Q 2020 revenue guidance, 3% to 4% constant currency. Full year of fiscal year 2020 growth is pretty similar at 2% to 4% constant currency. So is Cognizant expecting kind of steady revenue growth with no fluctuations or do you expect maybe a little bit of a drop in the middle of the year and a pick up in the fourth quarter?","I guess another way to ask this is, do you see an inflection point in revenue growth on the horizon? Thanks so much.","Karen McLoughlin","Bryan it's Karen. So the one think I would say is, nothing particularly unusual. There is no large deals there is no - nothing unusual right now from a seasonality perspective. So, I think it will be relatively a typical seasonality - that will start to ramp as we get into Q2 and then Q3. The one thing I would say, well the back half might be a little bit stronger because of the sales investments that we're making now right.","So we launched that hiring program late last year. So folks are coming on board as we expected. And certainly, while we said we would expect it to take about a year for them to start to ramp, but we should start to see a little bit of that benefit as we get into the back part of the year.","Brian Humphries","Yes, and maybe the only addition I'd make to that Karen, is obviously the content moderation ramp down will offset that somewhat as it grows throughout the course of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Brian I was hoping you could give more information about the sales force transformation, where do you stand on hiring? You mentioned the words on track, but a little bit more color on what on track means would be great?","And on the flip side is there perhaps any heightened attrition you expect to see for the traditional sales force that was already there given maybe they new compensation schemes or any changes there, so sales force update?","Brian Humphries","It's very interesting because as I said, we were at our Global Planning Summit in the last month or so. And the sales force were actually very motivated by their compensation changes because they can actually make more money than they could in prior periods. So actually on the contrary I actually feel there's a great deal of optimism in the sales force. People are - when the CEO visits clients every single day, it leads to a certain cultural demand in the organization. ","And I think people are motivated to get the company back to an accelerated growth rate, but I feel good about where we are. I'm not overly concerned about attrition in the legacy sales teams. We've had great look, I would say fulfilling the pipeline of opportunities. We don't break out on a quarterly basis where we are versus at hiring. We're less than halfway through the 500. I will tell you that.","There is a lot of work still to do, but I track it on a monthly basis at Executive Committee and we're pretty much in line with what we anticipated in terms of costs. I've also been keeping an eye, not just on the accounts that these folks are assigned to, but also the pipeline that they are building and in some cases, I've been pleasantly surprised that the early pipeline builds have even been ahead of my expectations.","So look more work to do to continue to review that, but there's a lot of energy and urgency in Cognizant in these days and I think we're all very clear what we're setting out to achieve. And I feel very good in terms of where we are to to-date. So the broader sales force update is consistent with what I said last quarter, that's not going to change. We've implemented a RAD model, which is retention, acquisition and development.","That's all about trying to get the right folks on the right accounts at the right time, aligning specialist resources, which are by practice, such as big data or cloud, with a generous client partner. The client partner is the quarterback on the accounts, they have decision rights, they own the P&L for the accounts. They can move with speed and accountability within the framework of authority that we have delegated to them and they are complemented by subject matter expert solution architects and the like.","We implemented that model on January 1. So far so good, and we obviously got to continue to push that out in the course of the year ahead. But I feel good about where we are.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Ellis","Brian, one of the things you mentioned was that you're doubling the number of people supporting Cognizant's major strategic alliances and I know that that is also somewhere where you have been spending your own time as well. Can you just provide a little bit more richness on where your focus there, where maybe Cognizant is already strong? Where you think there is opportunity to improve and how that sort of fits into the overall updated strategy and fit for growth plan? Thank you.","Brian Humphries","Yes, I will and look we have Lisa, some really strong alliance partners and partnerships by key verticals, whether that's Temenos in Financial Services, Pega, Adobe, or otherwise. But I've really spent a huge amount of time in the last nine months trying to build out and foster a business plan behind Amazon, behind Microsoft. We are now working through Google Cloud Practice as the hyperscale players and indeed really selectively aligning Cognizant to some of the leading SaaS type players as an example, such as Salesforce or ServiceNow or indeed Workday.","To make sure that we go to market with the companies that are growing 20%, 30%, 40% year-over-year. Not to say we won't continue to obviously partner with others, but we are putting - allocating even more capital to the winners in today's environment. That invariably means for us just to be very clear, it doesn't mean hiring more alliance partners and having a bunch of coffee drinkers sitting around feeling good about hosting meetings.","This is lot about building our business plans with solution architects and big data experts and the like. Align to each and every one of those companies I talked about. It involves putting an operational cadence together on a rolling four-quarter basis. So I know in a certain date, I'll be sitting in a room with the CEO of that company, review not just what we're setting out to achieve as a company, which has dollar targets against it, which are intersected by country and vertical.","But also looking at the pipeline shape, where we are in the funnel and really operationalizing that strategic alliance vision into day-to-day reality, which includes joint customer calls, joint - in person visits to clients with the leadership of those companies, joint emails to clients, or letters to clients and the like. So it's strategic, but to be very clear, it's also very operationally inclined and pragmatic with a view to successfully driving acute cadence going forward with these clients and partners and making sure we show up better than we ever have in the past.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-tsin Huang","Everything looks in line a little bit with what we had. It was just gross margins that was a little bit different. I know you mentioned Karen the 50 bps or the $25 million healthcare write-down. Can you maybe quantify some of the pricing pressure you're seeing coming from the heritage work or anything else on delivery cost that might have surprised you?","I know the fit for growth piece is coming in to. So just overall try and give some more color on the quarter and then maybe how the year is going to play out here in 2020 for gross margin? Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin","I don't think in the quarter Tien-tsin I wouldn't say there was any real change in pricing trends, but as we talked about on the prepared comments, we certainly are continuing to see pressure on renewals in the heritage or for legacy IT side of the business. Right now that's being offset by higher pricing on the digital side of the business. But certainly we think we can do better on pricing in digital services and really to make sure that we are pricing to the market and for the value that we are providing to clients.","So that is certainly an initiative we have underway, as well as do a far better job on things like COLA and getting adjusted bill rates and people are being promoted or rotating our staff to take effect of a more optimal pyramid. Certainly the savings that we've seen so far has been primarily in the SG&A buckets, as we've been focused on the top end of the pyramid, mostly which is done in SG&A.","But as we move into Q1 and Q2 and further into the fit for growth program, we would certainly expect to see improvements in the middle to upper middle of the pyramid as well, and also be able to drive improvement in some of these revenue levers, which will hopefully start to stabilize in gross margins.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Edward Caso","Brian, is your team now in place? I know you had one of your execs cycle out not that long ago, but do you have the people that you need down a level or two at this point to drive the transformation?","Brian Humphries","Look, I'm a big believer Ed that A players attract A players and the more we upscale and make sure we have the right team around meet those people in turn we\u2019ll make sure that they replicate that trend through the organization. I will say we have gems in Cognizant, really, really strong leaders. I talked about life sciences growing double-digits that's an internal promotion that happened in the last year.","So it's always going to be a combination of complementing excellent internal talent with excellent additions from the outside and putting a system of meritocracy and a performance culture in place. So everybody knows what we celebrate and what we condone versus what we don't tolerate.","So of course, in the years ahead, there will always be refinements. I want to drive a performance culture, and we're getting there, but of course, there will be, even in the foreseeable future, ongoing refinements as we continue to attract better people from the outside to complement internal talent.","I will say one thing that's very pleasing to me, there is no shortage of people reaching out to Cognizant at this moment in time, feeling both from clients and otherwise that there is a new vigor in the Company, a new urgency in the Company and a confidence that we can get back to been the great Company that we have been in the past. So it's very encouraging to me to know that we can still attract great talent from the outside.","And in the same vein, with a new Chief People Officer, Becky Schmitt, who joined this Monday, who almost had two decades in Accenture, and most recently had been in Walmart. We have a very strong people agenda program lined up in the coming years to attract, motivate, develop, retain and put very sophisticated talent management programs in place internally. And I believe that will not just make us a very appealing place to come and develop your career, but it will also have intrinsically a direct impact on our attrition rate, which as I said in the call, I'm pleased with, but we can always do better.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with question.","Keith Bachman","Karen, just for clarification, could you tease out the guidance from a revenue perspective in terms of isolating what M&A contribution is expected to be? And particularly the M&A contribution, does that include some of the very, very recent deals? And then, Brian, for you, if you could just revisit on healthcare and how we should be thinking about healthcare cadence, both this year and frankly exiting this year? As the deals we anniversary in earnest in the June quarter in particular, has the price activities of the M&A client, has that already played out or will that continue to play out for the year, but just more broadly talk a little bit about healthcare, both this year and kind of exiting the year? How you see the opportunity there for Cognizant? Thank you.","Brian Humphries","I'll start with the healthcare question Keith, because actually ironically I have been on the phone with the leadership team of - as it happens, both of those combined companies as recently as this morning. So I'm pretty current in terms of where we are on the accounts, and indeed the opportunity.","And I will say. I continue to be pleased that we show up a little bit better than we have. And both executives and companies reassured me that the merger integration work is still there and as they think about consolidating to preferred vendors we are firmly and squarely in a go-forward strategy as well.","So I do feel there's lots of opportunity for us, even in those larger accounts, where we've seen consolidation from four to two in the last year and we have seen some pressure on rates as part of that, but we do want to get back once we anniversary that into a stronger growth trajectory in healthcare.","In the same vein, I just want to caution the amount of work that needs to be done. We've also had our healthcare team today here in New York, about 20 people in a room reviewing last year, reviewing revenue, pipeline, win rate, margin trends, a very strong call to action in terms of what we need to do in the coming year.","So we're not out the other side on that yet, but I choose to be glass half full here in terms of a lot of the actions we are doing are not specific to one vertical. Better aligning marketing spend, making sure we have the right customer segmentation strategy in place, up-skilling our client partners, making sure we have the best specialists in the world to complement them, going to market with some of the hyperscale players in financial services or healthcare, et cetera, et cetera, because that will bear fruits in each and every one of our industries healthcare included.","We do expect still some, I would say, modest - we still have modest expectations for healthcare in the coming year, but as we go through the course of the year, I'd like to think that we will start to make some progress.","Karen McLoughlin","And Keith, it's Karen. Let me just comment on the guidance. So for the first quarter, there is about 120 basis points of inorganic revenue baked into the guidance. That includes only the transactions that have already been completed. So that would include Code Zero, but not the EI Technologies transaction. As that has not closed yet. And then on a full-year basis, the guidance similarly, only for deal closed, is about a 100 basis points of revenue growth year-over-year. And that's down from, if you recall in 2019, the impact was about 200 basis points.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Bourgeois","So on the last earnings call, you talked about a set of growth investments that would cost you about 150 basis points on margin. So I'm just looking at the further needs to build into the digital era. And besides the growth investments you've already articulated, are there additional growth related investments that you'd like to start making in 2020, such that if you had more room in your margin plan, are there additional investments that you would like to make besides the ones you've talked about?","Brian Humphries","It's Brian. So listen, the way I think about this, this year, if you normalize for, let's say, target bonuses as Karen has articulated in this call and prior calls, margins would have been roughly mid-15%. We've guided 16% to 17% for next year. So call the midpoint 16.5%. And we're assuming, by the way, next year that our bonus structure is a normalized part of our cost base. So hence organically, if you will, a 100 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year.","Now, to your point, we've made reference before of $250 million plus of investment back into the business, a lot of that we called out explicitly like 500 headcount related to this revenue generation. We're doing more on sales and marketing, we're doing more on training, et cetera. So that's approximately 1.5%. So had we not done that, margins naturally would have been higher.","But I'm not here to try to operationalize Cognizant from $17 billion to $20 billion. We're trying to make this a $25 billion, $30 billion, $35 billion company in the years ahead. And as part of that, I think, it's always wrong to look at one element on a continuum and trying to spotlight there and think, well, Brian had you not made those investments, could you deliver higher margin rates. And Rod, I know your investment thesis on the stock.","I certainly know that's not your intent either behind your question. What I want to do is continue to reinvest into the business. So if we can prove a strong return on these investments we're making, including the sales force hiring, we get win rates higher. If we get a good pipeline that we convert to TCV and revenue, my inclination will be to continue to deliver and apply more of the upside back into the business and get us back into the Cognizant that was tried and tested for many, many years that made this company a great success story over the years.","So that's the intention that we're setting out to deliver here in the next five years to 10 years. I'm confident we're doing the right thing. I will tell you, I'm really pleased and I spent a lot of my time with clients and partners. Our strategy is resonating. They see the renewed energy in the company. We have lots of work to do, but I'm very pleased and optimistic with the progress we're making and nonetheless that we still have more work to do in the year ahead.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Kupferberg","Just a two-pronged question on M&A. First, I know that EI Technologies you just said is not in the guide at this point, but assuming that closes in line with the timing you're expecting, roughly how much revenue would that add this year? And then can you just comment more broadly on your M&A strategy? It feels like the frequency and intensity of M&A is picking up a little bit, Brian, under your watch over the past years. Is that an accurate assessment in terms of where you intend to take that strategy as well? Obviously these kind of tuck-in size digital assets really stand out.","Brian Humphries","Yes. So listen, a good question. I wouldn't say to-date that the frequency has picked up that much. February 6, last year I was announced as the new CEO, so I started in April 1, and since then, we've done until this week two acquisitions, Contino and then prior to that Zenith Technologies. It just so happens that we were diligently working to review our strategy and finalize that and only with that behind us, that we absolutely go - now, let's go and put our balance sheet behind us to make sure we position ourselves strongly behind our strategic intent.","And I as said earlier, that's a lot about protecting and optimizing the core including scaling internationally, but it's also about winning in key digital battlegrounds. And both acquisitions we made this week are firmly behind the cloud ambition that we have and you'll see more of the same on a go-forward basis behind each and every one of those digital battlegrounds.","To be very clear, I view M&A as a means to an end to achieve the strategy. And while I'm pleased with the $2.2 billion we spent on share repurchases last year, you will see an absolute conviction to return capital to shareholders in the form of periodic dividend increases, as well as share repurchases, with a particular eye to offset dilution, but also potentially opportunistic. I will say that you will see us more towards accelerating M&A on a go-forward basis as long as it is supportive of the overall Company strategy.","Share repurchases, while adding value, do not reposition the company against the strategic intent. M&A can enable us to do that. So with almost a year behind me, under my belt here in Cognizant, getting my head around the Company, the industry better, the operational rigor and control we have with the team around me, we're absolutely inclined to accelerate M&A a little more in the years ahead and make sure we use that as a means to accomplish overall Company strategy.","With regards to the details of the EI Technologies, look we've entered into exclusive negotiations. Deal is not closed. It is material for France, but it's absolutely immaterial from a company perspective in terms of the dollar additions, so its basis points in terms of growth as opposed to anything else.","But as I said, that with Code Zero is firmly behind our Salesforce ambition and we've been spending a lot of time. I personally have met with Salesforce CEO I think probably now five times in nine-months. And these are very symbolic moves to make sure that we strengthen our capabilities behind the Salesforce practice that we're building out.","Operator","We have time for one final question today it's coming from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities.","Moshe Katri","Brian, you spoke about the need to potentially accelerate growth in International where you feel that the company is under-penetrated. Can you talk a bit about what sort of actions you are taking to get there maybe some color there would be helpful? Thanks.","Brian Humphries","Yes. It ultimately takes three portions, one is organic investments, one is partnership and another one is M&A. To be very clear is Zenith Technologies, which was at the intersection point of life sciences as one of our really strategic vertical, as well as IoT, was a perfect illustration of hitting many birds with one stone geographic expansion strengthening European footprint, aligning to our IoT digital priority and aligning to one of our strategic vertical.","We also announced and closed Contino, which has got a very strong international footprint in the form of DevOp and data in Q4. So those are good illustrations, and of course, EI Technologies that we announced earlier today, will be another good illustration of strengthening our footprint in Europe, in this case in France.","Organically, of course, we're strengthening our capabilities by building out more footprint, and supporting that footprint with better allocation of resources globally. As an example, we will modify our marketing mix this year to shift much more towards our international expansion. In prior years, out marketing spend was actually less in our international business than the actual current revenue mix, notwithstanding the fact that our growth opportunity was bigger there.","So that seems to have been something that we wanted to rectify on a go-forward basis. And of course, part of the 500 revenue generating headcount that we've approved, a good chunk of that is in Europe and we want to continue to grow scale there to make sure we have a bigger footprint in those geographies.","And then, on the partnership side, whether it's with AWS or Salesforce or otherwise, we've been building out those linkages throughout the world and Europe is no different, with a view to go to market in a digital ecosystem aligned country-by-country. I firmly view partners - Lisa asked the question earlier as an extension of our sales force. We are working on some core banking deals at this moment in time where the CEO of Terminus has actually actively in they engaged and brought us into deals and been a huge proponent of Cognizant, given our world-class capabilities behind seminars.","So it's wonderful when a client here is not just for the CEO of Cognizant, but also the CEO in this case of terminals as to our capabilities and our referenceability in that regard. So we're full speed on Board full speed ahead to go scale or international capabilities. It was a little bit disappointing this last quarter, some with self-inflicted we get that right going forward, and it's certainly an area of focus for me, in the coming years.","Katie Royce","Okay. With that, I think we will conclude today's call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2014 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com.","The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Cognizant's first quarter revenue came in right where we guided at $2.42 billion, a sequential increase of 2.8% and an increase of 19.9% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin at 20.8% was higher than our target range for the quarter.","So, this morning, I will provide an overview of our performance, the demand environment and the long-term outlook before turning the call over to Gordon and Karen to provide further details on the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.","We remained confident in the overall demand environment and in our revenue guidance of at least $10.3 billion, which translates to growth of at least 16.5% for the year and we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS outlook for the full year 2014.","Our Q1 performance reflected the strength of our portfolio across industries, services and geographies. Our investments in Europe and SMAC yielded good results and counted some softness in parts of the North American market, which Gordon will address in his comment in a few minute.","Based on our client discussions and our sales pipeline, we expect to have a strong year. We have ramped up hiring across many of our service lines and we continue to invest in growth.","I am optimistic because the fundamentals of the business remains strong, an increasing number of CEOs around the world are asking questions about how new technologies can be leveraged to build competitive advantage. Technology is clearly a CEO level agenda item today.","You know we have spoken to you before about being in the midst of once in a decade shift in the technology landscape, driven by things like social, mobile, analytics, cloud and other digital technologies. That technologies are redefining industries and their prevalence is throwing up vast amount of rich data and information around people, devices and organizations.","At Cognizant we call this digital information the Code Halo, extracting information from Code Halos and using that for driving strategy and new business models has become the basis for competitive advantage in many industries.","We have recently published detail findings of -- from our research and our client engagements on Code Halo and this has served as an additional catalyst for our digital business offerings.","But even as companies build new models for a digital economy, we have to stay focused on their core business by driving greater efficiency and building scale in their existing operations. It\u2019s typically the core business that provides the resources to invest in new systems, processes and business models that will create market differentiation and fuel growth.","The two simultaneous trends are what we call the dual-mandate will continue to drive market demand for the rest of 2014 and into nest year. Let me explain this in some more detail.","First, what clients are looking to run better by becoming more efficient, we continue to see demand for our core application, IT infrastructure and outsourcing services. CIOs and other business leaders are demanding better performance and cost effectiveness. They often need talent, smooth and processes to further optimize areas of their operations that are mature and standardized.","The second part of the dual-mandate is where clients are looking to run different by re-imagining and redesigning part or all of their business models. This is fueling demand for Cognizant business consulting and many of our Horizon 3 offerings related SMAC.","As client move legacy IT systems and applications to the cloud, we expect to see more demand for these services. Demand will also come from new applications, services and products to build around the SMAC stack.","The investments that we have made across are three horizons of services has put us in a strong position to address each of these different set of demand drivers. We have invested to build consulting services, industry-specific business knowledge and scalable model for technology and service operations, which combined with our culture of customer focus and entrepreneurial spirit have made us a strong partner for our clients.","And with that, I will now hand it over to Gordon to share more about our performance and to Karen to provide financial details. I will be back for the Q&A. Gordon?","Gordon Coburn","Thank you and good morning. We had a solid start to 2014. During the quarter, we accelerated our recruitment with 7,200 net hires. The strongest hiring we\u2019ve experienced in any quarter during the last two and a half years. This strong hiring is a testament to our continued confidence in the demand environment and our ability to continue to post industry-leading revenue growth.","We are also pleased with our annualized attrition during the quarter, including BPO and trainees continued to trend down to 14.1 annualized. As mentioned in our prior earnings calls, we put in place a series of employee engagement programs that are paying off nicely.","We achieved our Q1 growth and prior guidance despite facing some headwinds in North America. There is no single cause for these headwinds. Rather it was a confluence of several factors, none of which are particularly impactful or concerning on their own.","There were major structural changes that took affect for many of our healthcare related clients at the beginning of the year. This contributed to a slow start in spending for the sector as they adjusted to changes, occurring both in the commercial market and through the Affordable Care Act.","As an example, true consumption of healthcare services was down in January and February as people adjusted to the evolving healthcare reimbursement structure. In addition, a few of our clients experienced leadership transitions. When companies go to such transitions, they typically conduct a review of their strategic priorities and associated spending, which can delay some programs or cause a shift in balance of outsourcing and development work.","And finally, there were some general economic and weather-related disruptions in the U.S. as we started the year that had some minor impact. Despite of this sluggishness in North America, we are generally pleased with the growth across most of our industry segments and the solid growth in Europe and rest of world.","We remain well positioned to harness opportunities in this dynamic market environment. Our confidence stems with strength across all three of our growth horizons, driven by our investments and differentiated value proposition. Within Horizon 1, we saw good traction particularly in consulting and technology services due to the ramp up of deals we won in the latter part of 2013.","Specifically, we saw good traction in testing, enterprise application services, a complex development projects. Across Horizon 1, in addition to helping clients run better, we are clearly enabling clients to run different or to re-imagine and redesign their businesses to deal with the broad secular technology driven shifts across their industries.","As an example of a recent Horizon 1 win, Cognizant entered into a multi-year agreement with a leading biotech company to support its information systems organization and meet and needs of its expanded product lines and geographic footprint. We will provide a application maintenances to support services across the entire life scientist value chain from research and development and manufacturing in supply chain to commercial operations and other enterprise solutions.","Within Horizon 2, we continue to see good traction across business consulting, business process services and IT infrastructure services. Cognizant Business Consulting or CBC saw strong quarter. We are increasingly incorporating consulting advisory work as a key driver for larger transformational deals.","For example, recently CBC brought thought leadership and served as the lead business architect for a benefit adjudication monetization project at a large healthcare payer. Cognizant Solution will provide core adjudication functionality to support the client\u2019s next-generation products. This is an example of how we are building stronger and more strategic partnerships with our clients.","Our BPS practice continues to show healthy growth driven by cross-selling or vertically align business process solutions into our existing customer base as well as winning new logos. Ongoing investments in financial services at healthcare have recently resulted in a number of strategic wins, including work in claims and end-to-end back office processing and new business underwriting in property, casualty insurance.","Mortgage services in banking at pharmacovigilance services in life sciences. IT infrastructure services also had a good quarter with wins across multiple industries including insurance, banking, healthcare and retail. Our ITIS value proposition of simplifying, optimizing and automating our client\u2019s IT infrastructure is compelling and is allowing us to capture client demand for integrated deals such as applications plus infrastructure and a shift towards new enterprise IT models aligned with the SMAC stack.","The three subsegments within Horizon 3. New technology architecture is driven by SMAC. New delivery and markets such as -- new industry and markets such as public sector and new delivery models that drive non-linearity continue to gain traction. Awareness and investment in SMAC has clearly gone mainstream across most of the industries we serve and is an investment priority for many of our clients.","Our ability to offer clients an integrated value proposition by combining the capabilities across the three horizons of our business is emerging as a critical differentiator for Cognizant in the marketplace.","From an industry perspective, our Bank and Financial Services segment grew by 2.7% sequentially and 19.7% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in banking. The key drivers of growth in this industry span regulatory compliance, real-time risk monitoring, stress testing, and fraud and trade surveillance. In addition, as indicated in prior quarters, our Financial Services clients are embracing SMAC driven solutions for strategic differentiation and growth.","Healthcare, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical and medical device clients was relatively flat sequentially, but up 20.8% year-over-year. While our payer clients are looking for ways to get cost under control, as we have discussed in the past, a number of our key pharmaceutical clients are going through challenges related to the patent cliff and their drug pipelines.","Despite these business challenges, we are seeing these clients becoming more active around multi-channel marketing and utility-based cloud solutions, supporting everything from clinical trials to commercial operations. This is partially offsetting some of the short-term sluggishness that I mentioned earlier due to the uncertainty in the healthcare market.","We continue to further strengthen our leadership position in the healthcare space. During the quarter, IDC positioned Cognizant as a leader in life sciences solutions for IT and BPO services and for strategic consulting. These services span the entire life sciences value chain including research and development, manufacturing and supply chain, and sales and marketing.","Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 4.4% sequentially and 20.2% year-over-year. Retail showed a nice sequential improvement following the soft holiday season. Manufacturing and Logistics benefited from client demand to enhance supply chain management. Our other segment, which includes communications, information, media and entertainment, and high tech also recovered 6.3% growth sequentially and 18% growth year-over-year primarily driven by technology and telecommunications.","Finally, we continue to broaden our portfolio with tuck-in acquisitions. We just completed a small acquisition of a digital video solutions company, itaas, which will help extend and complement our existing capabilities serving the communications, media, and high technology industries. The expanded capabilities will also support other industries such as banking, retail, and healthcare which are rolling out advanced customer and business platforms centered on video.","From a geographic standpoint, North America had a slow start to the year growing 1% sequentially and 16.1% year-over-year. Europe overall grew 9.6% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. The U.K. saw a strong 12.8% sequential growth and 28.2% growth year-over-year, hitting the $1 billion run rate for the first time. The strength in U.K. revenue came from multiple clients across several industries, including financial services and high technology.","Continental Europe saw 5.2% sequential growth and 46% growth year-over-year, partially attributed to our 2013 acquisitions. We are encouraged by the structural trends we\u2019ve seen over the year as clients are increasingly engaging us in larger multiyear programs spanning service lines. The rest of the world showed good sequential growth of 6.4% sequentially and 28.4% year-over-year.","Before I hand the call over to Karen to comment on our financial performance and guidance, let me conclude by saying that I believe Cognizant is well positioned to benefit from client\u2019s need to simultaneously run better and run different. This is a direct result of the strategy we have followed since our initial IPO of investing for the long-term and evolving our capabilities and service offerings in anticipation of change in client demands.","Now let me turn the call over to Karen to provide details on our numbers.","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Gordon and good morning everyone. First quarter revenue of $2.42 billion represented growth of 2.8% sequentially and 19.9% over last year. Non-GAAP operating margins, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 20.8%, above our target range of 19% to 20%, while our GAAP operating margin was 19% for the quarter.","Our non-GAAP operating margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year in part due to improvements and utilization executed over the past years, which bodes well for our ability to continue hiring and building capacity throughout 2014.","In the quarter, we generated $0.62 of non-GAAP EPS. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 51% and 49% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Outsourcing, consulting and technology services was up 5.5% sequentially and 23.7% year-over-year. Outsourcing services was essentially flat sequentially and up 16.1% from Q1 a year ago.","As we have said, clients are facing a dual mandate as how to run better and simultaneously run different. This was particularly true in Q1, where we observed certain customers optimizing their run better spend to further invest in their run different initiatives.","Additionally, during Q1, we continued to see expansion of application development work in our public sector services business. During the first quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts. As expected, pricing was essentially favorable during the quarter. We closed the quarter with 1,223 active clients, and added seven strategic customers bringing our total number of strategic clients to 150.","Adjusting for the two-for-one stock split that was completed in March, our fully diluted share count for the quarter was 612.9 million shares, an increase of approximately 2 million shares from Q4. In Q1, we repurchased 600,000 shares for total cost of $29.3 million. We expect to accelerate the opportunistic repurchase of shares throughout the year.","Today, we have repurchased approximately 32 million split adjusted shares for a total cost of just over $1 billion under the current share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion.","Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the first quarter with approximately $3.86 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $118 million from the quarter ending December 31st and up by approximately $1.1 billion from a year ago.","During the first quarter, operating activities generated approximately $157 million of cash. We utilized approximately $7 million of cash in financing activities and capital expenditures were approximately $43 million during the quarter.","Receivables were $1.97 billion and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 73 days, essentially flat from last quarter. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $267 million, up from $226 million at the end of Q4. We build approximately 64% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April.","Let me now provide some color on our business and operational metrics for the quarter. Our key delivery in operating metrics are improving due to our efforts to drive best-in-class execution. Our focus on optimizing operations continues to free up resources for longer term investment in the business.","Despite the ramp up in hiring during the quarter, utilization improved slightly on a sequential basis. This was primarily due to the fact of the on-boarding of new hires was skewed towards the back half of the quarter.","Offshore utilization was approximately 76%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 83%, and on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter.","We ended the quarter with approximately 178,600 employees globally, of which approximately 167,300 were service delivery staff, 44% of our new hires were direct collage hires, while 56% were lateral hires of experienced professionals.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 2014 and for the full year. Based on current conditions and client indication, we expect to continue delivering industries leading revenue growth of at least 16.5% for the full year and generate revenue of at least $10.3 billion in 2014. In addition, we are increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03.","For the second quarter of 2014, we except to deliver revenue of between $2.5 billion and $2.53 billion, we are providing a range for our second quarter outlook to better align expectations for the anticipated quarterly pattern of revenue growth in 2014, reflecting our strong pipeline of deals across our three growth horizons particularly for the second half of the year.","During Q2 and for the full year 2014, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.62.","Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization.","This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.5%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to at least $2.50 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.5%.","Now, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ed Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Ed Caso - Wells Fargo","Hi. Good morning. There has been a series of acquisition announcements in the pharmaceutical industries, has that or do you expect that could have an impact on your outlook and I think pharma is about 10% of total revenue, is that right? Thanks","Gordon Coburn","Hey, Ed. That is Gordon. Historically, acquisition has been fine for us because we tend to -- because we work for most pharmaceutical companies. We tend to be on both sides of the transaction. We pick up the integration work. We tend to displaces others. So we\u2019ve got, obviously, we did very well as all the acquisitions happened in banking industry, acquisitions have happened to date in the pharmaceutical industry have been positive for us. So based on what we are seeing, we are not particularly concern about acquisitions at this point, that may actually be an opportunity but longer term.","Ed Caso - Wells Fargo","Thank you","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Thanks, guys. Just two-part question. First off, just on the second quarter guidance, you are calling for sequential growth of about 4% maybe not much better than that, kind of limited acceleration versus the Q1 sequential growth? So if you can just comment on the reasons for that?","And then just relating question, do you feel that the probability you are delivering upside to the full year revenue outlook is any less than it would have been a quarter ago when you first issued the full year outlook?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. This is Karen. I will take the first part of that question and Gordon will answer the second part. In terms of the Q2 guidance, as you said, the middle of the range will be about 4% growth. That\u2019s primarily driven by the fact that we saw such strong discretionary spending or consulting and technology services growth in Q1. Typically we wouldn\u2019t have seen that pattern until later towards the end of Q1 going into Q2.","But this year in fact we saw some early discretionary spending which obviously then didn\u2019t lead to as big an increase as we move into Q2. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the shift in the seasonal pattern from that perspective and right now just talked about, we see a very strong pipeline as we move into the back half of the year and some recovery in the outsourcing growth.","Gordon Coburn","And let me hit there. This is Gordon. Let me hit the second part of your question. Q1 clearly started little softer than we want it. Obviously, we still hit our guidance. We still feel very comfortable with our full year guidance. But, the math, the simple math is, it does takeaway some of the upside opportunity for the year given we started a little bit slower.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Okay. Thanks. Good morning. I was glad to hear that pricing is stable. But I\u2019m curious, a lot of your peers, I guess, pricing in the quarter thinking about IBM and Accenture and others. What\u2019s the delta there? What do you seeing on pricing globally amongst your peers? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza","I think you have to be careful with the pricing question. Customers want to lower their cost of ownership. They are far less concern about what is the rate card. So if we through operational excellence, through productivity, through automation, can provide the services for less without impacting our rate card, customers are very happy.","So, as a result, we are seeing relatively stable pricing. Clearly, we are reducing cost of ownership and what\u2019s happening is and you saw that our numbers even Q1, people are taking the savings coming from the outsourcing work. But and the lower cost of ownership there and taking those dollars and spending on running -- what we refer to as the running different the innovation topline growth.","So the key is to make sure that, for us, make sure we have capabilities to deliver on where customers are shifting their spend and that\u2019s a meaningful -- it won\u2019t be a steady shift every quarter, obviously. But it\u2019s a meaningful shift that\u2019s happening. So you be sure to separate rate card from cost of ownership.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Steven Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Peter Christiansen - UBS","Hi. This is Peter Christiansen filling for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about any pattern changes that you are seeing in the decision-making process outside of healthcare and also talk about how -- you talked about how discretionary spending is a bit early this year. Is that going to affect the normal spending cycle on the discretionary side?","Francisco D'Souza","Hey, Peter, it\u2019s Franc. Look, I think, we have covered the changes that we saw in the quarter. There was some slowdown as we said in healthcare as our client adjusted to the structural changes in that industry. We had some seasonal stuff related to the economy, the weather in the Northeast, nothing that I would be overly concern about for in a structural way.","And then, I think, the one that Gordon alluded to a minute ago is, probably, the most important is that, we are seeing this balancing that we talked about as client redeploy dollars from what we think of as the run better initiatives to the run different initiatives, right.","So kind of optimizing on core operations and using those savings to invest in these digital technologies and new capabilities that we have been talking for sometime. That shift is happening. We saw that happened in the first quarter, which is why we saw what we call consulting and technology services grow faster than outsourcing in the quarter. It\u2019s also not a typical Q1 pattern for us and typical Q1 we tend to see outsourcing grow a little faster than consulting and technology services.","So I think that\u2019s probably the most interesting change, or, now we saw it in one quarter, I am not sure that, one quarter makes a long-term trend, but that\u2019s something to keep an eye on there as we go forward.","Peter Christiansen - UBS","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. Hi, guys. Just kind of a two-part question here. I guess, first on headcount growth, good to see that accelerated a little over, I think, it was 4.2%, sequentially? Year-over-year, I think the number is still had about 10%. So just trying to make sure I understand the delta sequential headcount and year-over-year, and is that continuing to ramp up to match closer to the year-over-year revenue guidance of 16.5%.","And then, secondly, just on the EPS raise of a few pennies, I think, it was about $0.03, what cause that raising guidance? Thanks.","Gordon Coburn","Let me touch first on headcount. The reason that year-over-year number looks odd is last year we took our utilization up quite significantly, so we were able to deliver revenue with slow headcount growth. Obviously, you saw us accelerate our headcount growth in Q1. We don\u2019t provide future looking headcount guidance, but you certainly would not see a bigger delta between revenue growth and headcount growth that you did last year, because last year was the year where we materially increased our utilization. There is still some tweaking we will do and it will be variable quarter-to-quarter. But we are more in a stabilized range of utilization now. Karen, you want to touch base on EPS?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. Bryan, it is Karen. Regarding the EPS guidance, the raise by $0.03 is really due to the over performance in Q1. So you remember our original full year guidance on a non-GAAP basis with $2.51, we exceeded our Q1 guidance by $0.03 and so we\u2019ve added that to the full year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","David Ridley-Lane - Bank of America","Sure. This is David Ridley-Lane in for Sara. Could we get an update on Cognizant\u2019s expansion into data centers? A little over year ago, you announced $25 million investment build I think about for data centers. How many do you have up and running today, how is the client\u2019s perception been and most importantly, do you feel that owning the data centers is a competitive advantage in winning cloud services work? Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza","So, infrastructure services, I\u2019ll refer to as ITIS, is a very important strategic area for us and as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are making really good progress. A component of infrastructure services is to have some data center capacity for clients where they want that capacity along with other services within infrastructure management.","So we\u2019ve brought four data centers on line. They are up and running. Clients are utilizing them as part of broader ITIS deal. So the strategy is generally working. We will continue to tweak a little bit. Obviously the market is shifting quickly in some of those areas. The investment I think we emphasized for people before is not massive. I think it was $25 million, $30 million. That investment is essentially all done at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company","Hey, thanks. Another two-part question. Going back to your Q2 guidance, it\u2019s definitely softer than usual in terms of the sequential uptick you usually see from March to June. I think some color on there will be helpful in terms of what\u2019s embedded in that? Is that further weakness in North America healthcare, discretionary or all of the above and then the U.K. had a huge sequential uptick in growth, can you comment on that? Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. So, Moshe, I mean, I think as we\u2019ve talked about consulting and technology services which is typically the driver of growth going from Q1 to Q2, actually kicked in a little earlier than we expected. So we saw strong sequential growth there in Q1 and so to some extent that limits the ramp up as we move into Q2 and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the change there.","And then as we talked about, we do think there is a little bit of shift in the way outsourcing is performing this year where it had a slow Q1 relatively speaking, 1% sequential growth. But we expect to see increasing growth there, as we move into the back half of the year. So that was really the only change there.","Francisco D'Souza","And Europe, at a macro level, Europe is embracing our model a lot more. The catalysts in the economic crisis in Continental Europe served as a catalyst for people to think very differently about how they acquire and utilize technology and business process services. In the U.K., our brand has become very strong. Obviously, I don\u2019t think we are going to have this sort of sequential growth in Europe every quarter going forward. But clearly we are feeling good about our position in Europe, our customers in Europe and I think Europe, particularly Continental Europe is ready to embrace a global delivery model.","Gordon Coburn","And, Moshe, you will get -- three of us answering your question here. Let me just jump in as well. I think one of things about this quarter is it just speaks of the strength of the portfolio, right. We\u2019ve got a really good portfolio of -- that we\u2019ve been investing and we have been talking to you over many years about the investments we were making across the industries, geographies and services.","And I think you saw that play out this quarter. Yeah, we had some softness in some parts of North America. It was offset very nicely by things like discretionary spending in SMAC, social mobile analytics and cloud. It was offset nicely by the performance in Europe, both in the continent and the U.K. As we mentioned in the prepared comments, the U.K. hit a $1 billion run rate in the quarter which is terrific and we have several other businesses including the SMAC business, Continental Europe and really all of the H2 services, BPO, IT infrastructure services and consulting. All of those are, in general, growing faster than company average and are well on their way to becoming billion dollar businesses in the coming year. So we feel good about the portfolio that we built.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer","Good morning. I wanted to go back to the headcount ramp in the quarter. And if I heard Karen right, it sounded like it happened right at the tail end of the quarter and it seemed to be skewed toward the laterals as well. Is that -- was that sort of a suggestion of sort of a pick up in demand that maybe takes a little bit of a while to sort of build on and convert, or is there any way to sort of read into that?","Francisco D'Souza","So let me start first of all with the laterals versus ELTs. Not heavily skewed towards, that\u2019s actually kind of a normal mix. So I wouldn\u2019t view that as in anyway unusual, the mix that\u2019s exactly what we want. In terms of the timing, when people join, what I wouldn\u2019t read a whole lot into that either that part of that is when the college students want to come in and so forth.","I think the key to read here is one, last year we took utilization up quite a bit and now it\u2019s -- we are kind of at the right level where we want to be, so you will see it more stabilize. We are able to attract or recruit just absolutely great talent. Our brand is probably the strongest it\u2019s ever been, not just in India but in North America and Europe as well. So we are getting the people and they are staying, so the attrition has come down nicely. So we are feeling very good in terms of our resource and capability. In fact, we added 7200 people, obviously means we think there are growth opportunities for us.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joe Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead with your question.","Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Hi. Can you quantify the headwinds in 1Q? I know you talked about them, are they fully behind us? And can you give us update on the SMAC stack as a percentage of revenue and expectations for this year?","Francisco D'Souza","Sure. So I am not sure I would say the headwinds are fully behind us. When you think about what\u2019s happened, clearly the weather is behind us, but once again I don\u2019t want to point to the weather as a material. There still people are worried about the economy, no question about that. Healthcare, there is still uncertainty, but I think the uncertainty has settled down a little bit from where it was in Q1 and the leadership changes for the ones that happened, those are largely behind us. I am sorry, Joe, what\u2019s the second part of your question?","Joe Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","I just want to get an update on the SMAC stack as a percentage of revenue and your expectations for this year? I want to see if that changed at all.","Francisco D'Souza","Sure. So as you know, we did about $500 million of SMAC revenue last year. We\u2019ve not given -- we don\u2019t give guidance on what it will be for this year, but certainly SMAC is a growing area.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead with your question.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","I want to ask about how do you get there for calendar year \u201914, given guidance for the June quarter and for the March quarter, and it calls for some -- September to be, called it 5.5% to 5.7% and maybe December to be 2.5% to 2.7% sequential growth. It seems like a little bit -- calling for a little bit of a revenue acceleration compared to what you\u2019ve just delivered and guided to for June. Is the assumption that the U.S. which had very weak sequential growth that that comes back to more normal sequential patterns? I was wondering if you could speak specifically to the U.S. and what you\u2019re assuming there. And then also if you could just provide any dimensions around what Horizon 2, what you anticipate particularly in the consulting and BPO areas on how you see it filling or providing the guidance for the balance of 2014? Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza","Sure. So at a macroeconomic level, it assumes no improvements, basically things stay the same. A lot of the seasonality is based on stuff we won last year and stuff we recently won that takes a little while to check it, so it\u2019s more the parent tends to be a little bit more client specific, but it is not based on miraculously GDP growth will increase. We are assuming status quo from a macroeconomic environment. And the second part of your question?","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Well, just to come back, you are assuming that North America specifically returns to more for Cognizant more normal growth patterns as you look at the second half of the year, so those headwinds are gone you think in North America specifically for Cognizant?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes. So specifically for Cognizant, we would expect the sequential growth to be better in the second half of year than first and some of that\u2019s related to specific stuff that we won and will be ramping up.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please go ask your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Thank you. So I guess two part question also. On the run better side, when you talk of flattish outsourcing and you just mentioned some of the leadership issues transitions are behind you. Can you talk about vendor consolidation, how much of an impact that is? And typically you guys do tend to have either 2Q or 3Q or both and obviously in this 3Q should be a good ramp. Is that based on the wins that you had that you can start ramping, so if you could talk about the ramps as well? And then separately on the run different side, is that more inherent quarter-over-quarter volatility in this part of the business?","Francisco D'Souza","So, Ashwin, it\u2019s Franc. I\u2019ll try to address several of the points you made. And if I omit some, come back. Look, in terms of the broad sort of vendor landscape, vendor consolidation and so on, clearly we\u2019re seeing a little bit of that going on. We\u2019ve talked about this for a while. In general, we tend to be the beneficiaries in those situations. And the reason for that, Ashwin, is that, as you may know, historically, we\u2019ve had a very explicit and deliberate strategy with our clients, focusing on small number of clients, small number of industries and serving our clients very deeply.","And so we tend to have strong positions with our clients. We tend to be, in general, after -- obviously after client has reached some level of maturity, we tend to be one of the larger providers in a client\u2019s ecosystem. And so when there is a vendor consolidation exercise that takes place, we tend to generally benefit from a consolidation exercise. So overall, I think that when vendor consolidation is taking place, there is a little bit of a benefit to that.","In terms of looking at the pattern of outsourcing for this year, as Gordon said, a lot of our outlook is based on stuff that we\u2019ve won and we expect to ramp. I think that you\u2019re starting to see, you\u2019re seeing -- we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ve seen this for about the last year or so is that outsourcing deals are also becoming a little bit larger, as clients tend to bundle things together. We\u2019re starting to see the bundled applications and infrastructure deals happening out there. Those take a little bit of time to win. The sales cycles are a little bit longer, but obviously revenues are also larger and so it has that dynamic. As opposed to say five years ago when our outsourcing contracts were more sort of penetrate and expand kind of contracts where we win a small deal with the client and then expand from there.","And then on your third point, yeah, I think, you will see that on the digital work or more generally the discretionary work in the consulting and technology services area, that has always been and will continue to be somewhat more volatile quarter-to-quarter because it is more discretionary, it is more subject to client annual budgeting process, annual budgeting cycle. And I think that volatility might be a little bit more pronounced this year and next year because you have this period when clients are really adjusting to these new digital technologies. And you\u2019ll see starts and stop in spending related to that, perhaps a little bit more than you would have seen, say five years ago when technology was a little bit more stable. Gordon, do you want to add anything?","Gordon Coburn","I think you covered the key things.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Thanks, guys. You mentioned that you saw structural changes around the healthcare as there\u2019s a pause from both companies and consumers adjusting to the change, the legislative changes and obviously there\u2019s also patent cliffs remaining. However, Obamacare does seem to be still in the early stages of rolling out across states. And I guess as the market is accustomed to these changes, should we expect to see this still become a more meaningful tailwind maybe in the second half of the year, given that the insurance payers still need to get connected to the news feed coming on? And I guess just a follow on that point, I mean if -- before you\u2019re saying about the management changes as one of the headwinds in the US also was completed and healthcare were to come back. I mean, is that just upside to what you\u2019re incorporating year in your outlook now?","Gordon Coburn","Let me start with the management changes and Franc can touch on healthcare. On the management changes, those are pretty much flushing out the system at this point, so we understand where those are and that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019ve got into the timing. So that\u2019s built into the guidance because their comments level on that\u2019s quite high. Franc, do you to mention on healthcare?","Francisco D'Souza","Look, I think you\u2019re potentially right. I think as you long-term, healthcare is going through -- healthcare is going through a period of structural change. And I am referring -- we\u2019ve talked about the structural change going on in life sciences for many quarters now. I am referring more to, sort, of the payer provider ecosystem now. If you look at that space, there is clearly the Affordable Care Act. There are other changes going on as well. If you look at the commercial market for example in the United States, we are seeing more and more employers moving to high deductible plans and so on, which is changing consumption patterns for healthcare in the United States. In the first quarter, if you look at consumption -- true consumption metrics for healthcare services in January and February, they were down. True healthcare consumption in the United States came down in many places in the first month of the first quarter.","So you are seeing the sort of structural adjustment at. My guess is that what will happen is it will take sometime for us to reach somewhat of a new normal in healthcare, and through that there will be opportunities for us at Cognizant to capitalize on opportunities. But I don\u2019t want to be too bullish on this because the reality is I don\u2019t know how long this industry takes to adjust, and that\u2019s hard to predict at this point. So we are watching it very carefully. As you know, we are extraordinarily well-positioned in the healthcare. We feel like we\u2019ve got the leading franchise out there serving healthcare, payers providers and the global pharma companies and the medical device companies. So we feel like we\u2019ve got a very, very strong play in healthcare. Our position is strong. Competitiveness is great. Our teams are out there everyday talking to our clients. And so as these opportunities arise, I feel very good about how we are positioned to capitalize on them.","But as industries go through these periods of change, it\u2019s hard to get a good fix on exactly how things play out quarter-by-quarter. So we watch it very carefully and obviously keep updating you as our views change.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning. It\u2019s Brian Essex for Katy. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if maybe you could dig into Europe a little bit, 52% growth on a trailing 12-months basis year-over-year. How much of that is organic and what is your outlook in terms of how you think about the sector, where you are investing for headcounts, is there any concentration with vertical or product line that would give us some kind of read into the sustainability of growth, although that\u2019s pretty impressive growth, both in Continental Europe as well as the U.K.?","Gordon Coburn","Sure. Let me take the second part of the question. We are trying to see if we have handy the first part and if not, we\u2019ll get back to you with it offline. We feel good about Europe quite simply. Part of it is our execution and part of it is the market. In terms of our execution, we\u2019ve really build out our teams in the continent, both through some acquisitions that we\u2019ve done as well as organically. We now have the model that works in terms of the combination of local presence and multi-national capability so. And the type of services that we are providing, the combination of run better, run different are resonating.","So that happened at the same time that the market is becoming more open to global delivery, to outsourcing in general. So the combination of those two factors, together make us feel good. When you look at it by industry, obviously the one big difference from North America is you don\u2019t have the same spend levels in the payer sectors due to nationalized healthcare over there. But certainly our financial services, insurance, pharma, retail, manufacturing, telecom, we are feeling quite good about it.","Obviously, continent is going off a small base which makes the percentage growth numbers a little bit easier to tackle. But even when you look at in terms of dollar growth and as an increase in percentage of revenue, clearly we think there is continued opportunities both in U.K. but more importantly in the continent and the Nordics. So we will keep investing there. The strategy is working out. Part of what we are doing is we are expanding our investment strategy.","We are increasing our investment in markets in Asia. We\u2019re starting our investments now in the markets down in Latin America, so similar to what we did in Europe. We\u2019re now going to other parts of the world and the good news is as we do that, we now better understand the model between local and foreign nationals and how they act locally while at the same time having global delivery. So, I think we\u2019ve got the model down pretty well and we\u2019ll continue to roll that out.","Karen McLoughlin","And this is Karen. Regarding the organic growth in Europe so and the continent for the quarter grew about 46% year-over-year on a reported basis and about 30% growth was organic growth. About 15 points was due to the C1 and the Equinox acquisitions that we closed last year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC. Please go ahead with your question.","Dan Perlin - RBC","Thanks. I wanted to just go back to this comment earlier about the rate card versus cost of ownership. But I also wanted to add mix a bit into that discussion and as you\u2019ve talked a lot about these investments going into run better and run different from your clients budgeting side but reconciling that with the margin profile of 19% to 20% in the back half of the year. So, is the message here that it really is a function of incremental investments as you were somewhat highlighting in Europe, or is there a mix issue as well that we need to be mindful of as you go into these other markets and technologies? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza","So there is a mix issue but the mix takes you both ways. So as we are shifting more to run different, people are less price sensitive and billing rates tend to be a little bit better. But at the same time, I\u2019m growing my BPO business, where just the nature is more heavily offshore and obviously rates in general are lower for that because the costs are lower. So when you mix it all together and you look at the average blended rate across the company, you have a couple of things taking in opposite directions, which is the way it should work.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.","David Togut - Evercore","Thank you. Financial services put up pretty solid 20% year-over-year growth in the quarter but that\u2019s below the trend we\u2019ve seen actually over the last two to three years, which has been materially higher. Can you flush out some of the underlying drivers, the financial services growth in the quarter and in particular did anything change significantly versus what we\u2019ve seen over the last six to 12 months?","Francisco D'Souza","The main change during the -- last year insurance was a bit stronger than banking, we actually -- in parts of last year. This in Q1 banking -- core banking did quite well and for some of the reasons I articulated in terms of spend that they have to do on compliance, on regulatory, on risk management, while at the same time, they are investing to run things different and interact different with the customers. So you will see some back and forth.","Obviously, the financial services segment is our biggest segment. So the law of large numbers says, it should, it should not grow materially faster than the overall company and I certainly would not have that expectation. So it will be a little different quarter-to-quarter. But core banking in Q1 did nicely. I think, Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yeah. Thank you. That question is coming from line of Mayank Tandon of Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company","Thank you. Good morning. Franc, you talked about some of the large multiyear type outsourcing contracts where you are competing. I just wanted to get a sense, are you seeing different players then you have seen in the past on some of these opportunities and also would it require you to change your capital intensity, but if you want to be competitive on some of these large infrastructure type engagements?","Francisco D'Souza","Yeah. Mayank, let me answer the last part of your question first then I will come back to the beginning. So, clearly not, we are not playing and in fact candidly the market generally moving away from the traditional large scale capital intensive, what I think of is more traditional hardware and asset-heavy infrastructure deals. So, I think, that somewhat the model of the past at this point.","We are playing in, what I think of is bundled outsourcing deals, where you are seeing clients bundling together, applications and infrastructure management quite common to see that bundle happen. But we are also starting to see BPO and apps and infrastructure or some combination of all three of those being bundled together and so that\u2019s really the bundling I am talking about.","When we look at those bundles, I think, we\u2019ve proven out time and time again at this point that there are true synergies that you can drive, that we can drive on behalf of our clients, when we combine those things together.","When you are combining BPO and IT, for example, you do get technology and operations synergies, when you combine infrastructure management and application you do get technology synergies that you can leverage a so those are the kinds of transactions that I\u2019m talking about when I refer to these bundle deals.","Having said that, we continue to work on the traditional single tower deals as well and that\u2019s a very healthy part of the business. So we are competing across all of those.","I think in terms of competitive set, I don\u2019t think its changed, we compete against, the usual suspects here in the space, including the folks that who traditionally have been the -- done the bigger -- what you might think of as bigger outsourcing deals and of course, also the global services player. So that competitive set hasn\u2019t changed meaningfully.","I think that was really all we had time for. So let me just close by thanking you all for joining us today and for your questions. We are looking forward to a good 2014 and we look forward to seeing you next quarter to discuss our results. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."],"6087":["Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call May  2, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Katie Royce - Head of Investor Relations","Brian Humphries - Chief Executive Officer","Karen McLoughlin - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Rod Bourgeois - DeepDive Equity","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research","Bryan Bergin - Cowen","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ms. Royce. Please go ahead Ms. Royce.","Katie Royce","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website cognizant.com.","The speakers we have on today's call are: Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","Before I pass this to Brian, let me address one issue. We understand that there was some inadvertent communication of our release and other materials this afternoon shortly before market closed. Obviously we are going to take a look into what happened here. We simply wanted to let you know that we are aware of the issue and we will undertake a review.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. ","Brian Humphries","Well, thank you, Katie and good afternoon, everybody. I'm pleased to join you today on my first earnings call as Cognizant's, CEO. I've long admired Cognizant from my vantage point at other leading technology companies. Since moving into the role five weeks ago, I've been busy getting into the heart of the company's operations. I traveled across three continents to listen directly to our clients and partners. I've conducted more than two dozen deep dives into our industries, lines of service and regions. And I've met with nearly all of our global executive leadership team and talked to hundreds of our associates in person.","I can tell you that the initial reasons for my enthusiasm about Cognizant have been strongly confirmed. I'll share some observations later in the call. This is a great company and I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the company forward.","That said, we had a disappointing first quarter performance. We have a lot of work to do to get back to what I believe this company is capable of achieving to seize the market opportunity in front of us.","In Q1 our revenue grew 6.8% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.1 billion. This fell short of our guidance and resulted in an earnings shortfall. Our softness in top line growth resulted from a weak performance in Banking and Financial Services which was flat year-over-year in constant currency and slowing growth in Healthcare, excluding the contribution of Bolder Healthcare Solutions.","Our revenue performance reflects both external factors including in-sourcing among a few large Financial Services clients and the spending pullback in Healthcare clients that are in the midst of merger integration, as well as Cognizant-specific execution issues that we need to get behind us. Offsetting this weakness in Financial Services and Healthcare, we delivered strong double-digit growth in two of our other major business segments; Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology. Later in today's call, I'll let Karen take you through the details of the quarter.","Beforehand I want to offer three observations: First, notwithstanding a disappointing Q1 the foundation and capabilities of business are solid and the market opportunity is robust. I've spent enough time reviewing the business and meeting with clients and partners over the last five weeks to know this to be true. I want to stress that our customer centricity is as strong as ever. Having met face to face with hundreds of our associates over the past five weeks, I can attest to their passion for clients, incredible resourcefulness, innovation and desire to win. Their winning spirit derives from decades of commercial success. This kind of spirit is hard to create, but once it becomes the core culture -- cultural attribute as it is in Cognizant, it's also hard to break.","Second, we know we can and must do better. We are committed to delivering consistent financial performance that aligns with the expectations that we set and communicate. And third, we also recognize that the first quarter revenue weakness follows a loss of top line momentum over the past 18 to 24 months. One of my top priorities is to act to restore top line momentum. Restoring our momentum goes to a question I've been asked many times by associates and others about revenue versus margin trade-offs. I've long believed that it is possible to achieve solid revenue growth and drive margin expansion simultaneously. I've seen nothing to-date at Cognizant that changes this belief. To do both, we must be fit for growth. And by this, I mean establishing a healthy cost structure that allows us to be cost competitive whilst enabling us to make investments that create value for our clients.","Investments, of course can take many forms including marketing, demand generation, partnerships, re-skilling, increased sales coverage or increased spend in platforms tools and automation. I believe cost equals growth. They are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, as we said about reviving top line momentum, we will improve our cost structure as a means to invest in growth and unlock higher levels of performance. One example is our cost of delivery. During my recent trip to India, I saw firsthand how important our delivery teams are to our strategy. Through our customer engagements, our teams in India not only deliver, but also develop solutions and drive customer innovation that bring our digital capabilities to life for clients. This is a prized asset and a valued competitive advantage, but we must also be more efficient to ensure we can accelerate growth.","As we set about getting fit for growth, change management, clarity of roles and responsibilities and communication are critical. We will ensure that all of our associates understand the connection between top line momentum and a healthy cost structure and that everyone is clear about our go-forward priorities and their role in making this happen. For example, I want our sales and delivery teams focused on customer acquisition, up-selling and cross-selling within the existing clients, co-creating innovative solutions to customer pain points and maximizing customer satisfaction. Meanwhile Karen and I will focus on ensuring a rigorous approach to non-investment costs, while prioritizing investments related to growth. Once we get the balance right in steady state, I believe we can accelerate growth and deliver margin accretion simultaneously.","That aside in the meantime, I'm doing what you would expect a new CEO to do. I will dig into every part of the business to fully understand our strategy, market structures competitive dynamics, client buying behavior, control points and the engagement levels and collaboration of our teams. As I intend to leave no stone unturned, I've already launched a series of work streams to review our growth and margin opportunities. These work streams focus on areas including: our organizational structure, to assess role clarity and decision rights among our verticals regions and lines of service, and to ensure a clear accountability model that drives a culture that is both empowered and performance-oriented.","Our sales model, including how we segment customers, align sales coverage and establish sales performance metrics and more leveraged sales commission plans. The must-win battles in our digital strategy as well as the practical matters of ensuring our pivot to digital will be successful via structural leadership and compensation actions. And our delivery model particularly on lowering the cost of delivery through pyramid actions, tooling and automation and optimizing the mix amongst our delivery locations.","Finally and acknowledging people are at the heart of everything, we have work streams focused on our leadership and culture, emphasizing rigorous data-driven talent management, succession planning and leadership attraction and development. While, we're on the topic of leadership an essential part of my role is to ensure we have the right team in place to propel Cognizant forward. Having conducted over two dozen 4 to 5 hour business reviews in the last five weeks, I've had a good deal of interaction with most of our senior leaders.","I believe we have a highly experienced, deeply knowledgeable and accountable team that serves our clients and shares my commitment to getting the company back to executing the basics well. Recognize, however that when a new CEO joins some reshaping of the leadership team is inevitable and this has already begun to happen. As you know with my arrival Frank D'Souza moved into the role of Executive Vice Chairman and will transition to Vice Chairman of our Board at the end of June. Raj Mehta has stepped down as President. I'm not planning to backfill this role. I want to be deeply engaged in the business and also want to flatten our organizational structure, so that we can take out layers of costs, communicate quicker and move with greater speed and agility.","With the view to sharpening our focus and accelerating our growth in digital business I've just appointed Malcolm Frank as the new President of Cognizant Digital Business. Malcolm will bring significant customer centricity, passion, a strategic mind and a partnership mentality to this critical position. And to improve our performance in Banking and Financial Services, which represents 35% of Cognizant's annual revenue, I've asked Prasad Chintamaneni our EVP and President of Global Industries and Consulting in addition to his existing responsibilities to also assume the direct management of the banking business on an interim basis.","Earlier in his career, Prasad led our Banking and Financial Services segment. Therefore I'm confident that he will immediately make a difference as we launch the search for a new head of our banking business. Prasad will continue to maintain all of his existing responsibilities in addition to his interim role. Finally before turning the call to Karen, I would like to touch briefly on Cognizant's significant market opportunity. One of the things that drew me to Cognizant is our large addressable market. The rates of digitization across industries creates a significant opportunity for us and clients, as they recognize digital as both an opportunity and a threat.","We built leadership positions in many industry verticals and strong client relationships where we can upsell and cross-sell our lines of service. We have an opportunity to further diversify our client base. And on a geographical basis, there's a huge opportunity outside of North America with our global growth markets currently accounting for just over 1\/4 of our total revenues. I believe that we have the right strategy and portfolio of services and solutions to capture the market opportunity and we will double down on execution to ensure success. We have been focusing over investments on six advanced capabilities that our clients need to become fully digital businesses.","These six capabilities which form the core of our digital strategy are: core modernization; digital engineering where I'm really enthusiastic about the capabilities enabled by Cognizant's Softvision; AI and analytics; intelligent process automation; industry and platform solutions; and interactive customer experiences. To this list, I have added one more capability, Internet of Things. The advent of 5G will vastly expand the impact of IoT and create significant opportunities across our verticals.","As we help our customers be successful in a digital world, we need to extend our IoT portfolio of offerings and build out our IoT partnership ecosystem. We see ample headroom for growth in all of these areas which offer strong margin profiles and a combined market opportunity that we estimate to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. As we get after these opportunities we will be ultra-efficient in our legacy operations, prioritizing our investments, investing in partnerships and ensuring we digitize our own operations.","In short, my mission is to ensure that Cognizant is well positioned for long-term success. My aim is to leave no stone unturned so that we can identify all opportunities for improvements in growth, efficiency and profitability. I look forward to giving you an update on our progress in the coming quarters. We have a solid strategy engaged associates and incredible client centricity and we are fully committed to executing this strategy.","Okay. With that it's my pleasure to turn it over to Karen who will give you an update on both our operational and financial performance as well as a view on how we see the year ahead. Karen? ","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. While the quarter started as expected, we saw a deterioration in our performance in the second half of the quarter which led to a slower-than-expected Q1 revenue of $4.11 billion, an increase of 5.1% year-over-year or 6.8% in constant currency. Digital however continues to be the most significant driver of our growth and now accounts for over 1\/3 of total revenue.","Moving to the industry verticals, whereas Brian mentioned the Q1 underperformance were primarily driven by Financial Services and Healthcare. Financial Services growth was flat year-over-year in constant currency driven by both banking and insurance.","In insurance, growth was slower than our expectation at the beginning of the year as executive transitions underway at several of our clients, slowed the decision-making process in the latter part of the quarter, particularly around larger deals in the pipeline. In banking we continue to see softness at a few of our largest banking clients, but during the quarter we also saw a more conservative approach to spend with several of our regional banking clients in North America, including some banks that were impacted by M&A activity.","Consistent with what we communicated at our Investor Day in November, two of our top five clients continue to show good growth while spend at the other three clients remains under pressure. We have however made progress in furthering our platforms and solutions strategy for the banking clients through the recent acquisition of MeritSoft, a capital market software platform for post-trade receivables and payables processing with offerings in regulatory, tax, operations and fees and billing. And the previously announced partnership with three Finnish financial institutions to transform and operate a shared core banking platform based on the Temenos platform which began as expected in the second quarter. However we are seeing some cautiousness in the banking sector around levels of spend in the second half of the year with a moderating outlook for growth in their business.","Moving on to Healthcare which grew 4.6% year-over-year in constant currency. Within our Healthcare vertical slower-than-expected growth of our payer clients was largely the result of several large clients involved in mergers, as well as the accelerated movement of some work to captive at a large client. The continued rampdown of an account in which we were a subcontractor to a third party also continued to negatively impact revenue. We expect these trends to continue and likely deteriorate in the second quarter as some of these clients finalize new contract negotiations before embarking on the execution of their integration plans. Over the last several years, we've seen periods of heightened industry consolidation in Healthcare creating pressure on our organic growth rates during those periods.","While the revenue associated with integration work that typically follows M&A can be meaningful, we recognize the volatility that has resulted from a handful of large clients over this period. As we broaden our client base within Healthcare by expanding into new care clients through platform offerings developed for contracts such as TMG, as well as the provider space, the diversification of our client mix should over time contribute to more consistent growth.","Life Sciences saw broad-based acceleration in the quarter contributing above-company average growth. We are seeing good traction in large enterprise transformation deals and momentum with our industry-specific platforms such as the shared investigator portal for clinical trials. Products and resources had another strong quarter showing 13.8% growth year-over-year in constant currency. We saw double-digit growth in constant currency across retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality, as well as manufacturing logistics energy and utilities.","Building on the momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter, retail continued to perform well, despite a handful of bankruptcies in some of our smaller relationships during the quarter. We continue to see strength in cloud and digital engineering services and increased demand for interactive IoT and analytics solutions across clients. Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 19.6% in constant currency driven by software and platform clients within the technology sector. Within media and communications, growth was primarily driven by digital services for media and entertainment clients to accelerate their transformation to modern media companies, partially offset by slower growth with communications clients involved in industry consolidation. Technology delivered double-digit growth driven primarily by our digital content solutions.","Now moving on to geos. The rest of the world grew 7.1% year-over-year in constant currency. Results in Asia Pacific continued to be negatively impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. On a constant currency basis, the three industry segments outside of Financial Services saw double-digit growth in the quarter.","Europe grew 14.3% year-over-year in constant currency. In Continental Europe, we saw strength in Life Sciences and telecom while a few of our larger banking relationships in Europe remain under pressure we did see good growth from several of our newer logos. While North America remains a significant and growing market for us we see tremendous opportunity for growth in other parts of the world. We have made a number of organic and inorganic investments in Continental Europe which have given us a strong foundation for future growth. Going forward, we expect to increase our investments and drive an even greater focus on international growth particularly in Europe.","Shifting now to margins. Our GAAP margin and EPS were 13.1% and $0.77 respectively. Our GAAP margin and EPS were negatively impacted by a $117 million accrual related to a recent ruling of the Supreme Court of India interpreting certain statutory defined contribution obligations of employees and employers which altered the historical understanding of such obligations by extending it to cover additional portions of an employee's income.","Our accrual covers prior periods and assumes retroactive application of the Supreme Court ruling. However as further discussed in the financial tables to our earnings release, there is significant uncertainty as to how the liability should be calculated and whether the Indian government will apply the ruling on a retroactive basis. As such the ultimate amount of the company's obligation may be materially different from the amount accrued.","As a result of this ruling, the contributions of our employees and the company in future periods are required to be increased. This change will result in approximately $15 million of incremental spend for the remainder of 2019 related to the employer portion of this contribution. Adjusted operating margin which excludes realignment charges and the $117 million incremental accrual related to the India defined contribution obligation was 16% and our adjusted EPS was $0.91 in Q1.","Q1 margins followed our typical seasonality and were lower than the full year projection. In Q1, we also had the continued absorption of headcount additions and wage increases and promotions from the fourth quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was below our expectations for the quarter due to costs related to headcount growth outpacing the lower-than-expected revenue growth in the quarter which negatively impacted operating margins by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.04 and an anticipated increase in bad debt expense related to a few bankruptcy filings by clients, primarily in our Products and Resources segment. This bad debt expense negatively impacted operating margins by 30 basis points and EPS by $0.02. For the remainder of 2019, we expect margins to remain below our previous expectations, but to improve in the second half of the year as we align our cost structure with revised revenue expectations.","As we discussed during our Investor Day back in November, while we have taken steps to improve our cost structure there remains much more we can do to enhance margins through areas such as pyramid optimization, sustaining higher levels of utilization and improved pricing levers. There is additional opportunity to simplify parts of our business unit overhead structure and take a hard look at the cost of delivery. Additionally a shift to higher-value services such as digital will continue to support margins. From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate at 19% is flat with Q4, but remains elevated. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and overall management.","Turning to the balance sheet which remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments, down $843 million from December 31, 2018. This decrease is largely due to the $750 million of share repurchases under our stock repurchase program including the funding of the $600 million accelerated share repurchase program launched in early March and annual bonus payments. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $427 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department. We generated $163 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Following the typical seasonal pattern, free cash flow in Q1 was impacted by the timing of our bonus payouts.","Additionally we had an uptick of DSO of three days compared to Q1, 2018 which negatively impacted free cash flow by $125 million and included an increase in unbilled receivables. We billed approximately 57% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April which is in line with our historical norms. Our outstanding debt balance was $746 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares and our diluted share count decreased to 575 million shares for the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2019. For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 3.6% to 5.1% year-over-year in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates this translates to growth within the range of 2.7% to 4.2% reflecting our assumptions of a negative 90 basis points of foreign exchange for the full year. This revised guidance reflects the slower growth in quarter one as well as a more muted outlook for Financial Services, including Banking and Insurance as well as Healthcare. For the second quarter of 2019 we expect to deliver revenue growth in the range of 3.9% to 4.9% in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates this translates to growth in the range of 2.6% to 3.6% reflecting our assumption of a negative 130 basis points for foreign exchange for the second quarter.","For the full year 2019, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 17% and to deliver adjusted EPS in the range of $3.87 to $3.95. The reduction in our operating margin guidance is primarily the result of headcount which grew faster than revenue for the last two quarters. While we will better align our cost structure with our revised revenue growth expectations, we will also continue to invest in talent and development of solutions that further our position in the digital marketplace. In the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating margins to be in line with Q1 at approximately 16% while we take perspective cost alignment actions that will take several months to implement.","This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 572 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. Guidance provided for adjusted EPS, excludes realignment charges and any other unusual items net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, the incremental accrual related to the India defined contribution obligation and the tax effects of the above adjustments.","Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment including areas such as immigration and tax. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we intend to utilize approximately 50% of global free cash flow annually for dividends and share repurchases. In Q1 we executed share repurchases that will reduce our average share count for the full year by more than our target of 1%. In addition the Board has declared a Q2 cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on May 22.","Additionally we intend to utilize approximately 25% of global free cash flow on acquisitions and have closed two acquisitions thus far in 2019. We continue to look for acquisitions that enhance our longer-term strategy of enriching our digital capabilities, expanding our geographic footprint and enhancing our vertical expertise.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Brian.","Brian Humphries","Well, thank you, Karen. Before we take your questions let me close by saying once again, how delighted I am to have the opportunity to lead this great company. My 286,000 colleagues and I recognize that we have work to do to get Cognizant back to basics and to strengthen our execution. We will roll our sleeves up and ensure that we tenaciously follow through on our strategy to produce the kind of results I know Cognizant is capable of achieving. We are all dedicated to our clients and we are all committed to advancing Cognizant's pivot to digital and spurring the next phase of growth and success.","And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Ellis","Hi good afternoon guys and welcome Brian. I look forward to working with you. ","Brian Humphries>","Thank you. ","Lisa Ellis","Can you give a sense -- I know you've just been on the ground like you said for five weeks or so, but given you've landed in an organization that's clearly in this pretty tough period of transition, can you just map out for us a little bit how you envision the next 6 to 12 months for you looking like? Like where are you going to focus? Are there some immediate shifts and changes you can already envision you might want to make things you want to be doing faster investing in more aggressively? Any, just early thoughts? Thank you. ","Brian Humphries","Yes, I'm happy to do so. And ultimately over the last five weeks I spent my time across three continents and ultimately have been prioritizing business reviews, spending time with our associates and spending time with clients and partners. And to a great extent that will be how I will continue to spend my time going forward.","From my point of view, but the great news is that we have an exciting market opportunity. The potential is there. But one of the things we're going to have to get back to doing is understanding the relevant trade-offs between costs investments and growth. I don't view costs and investments to be the same thing, but I do view costs and growth to be the same thing. We have to be fit for growth.","So in order to do so we need to invest in growth, in order to invest in growth we need to free up dollars for investment. And to a certain extent Lisa, I really feel that we have to restart the engine that was the secret sauce of Cognizant. We have very engaged associates who have a winning spirit. There's a great opportunity out there, but we have to go back to making the investments, getting our cost structure right, really embracing digital and doing the basics well.","And sometimes those basics in companies can be overlooked in terms of structural decision rights, sales commission plans etcetera, etcetera. If we get all of this right I think we will be in a position to execute our strategy and to do well. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thank you and Brian, thanks for the thoughtful comments. I wanted to ask you, our understanding was that the Board when they selected the CEO that would ultimately carry out the strategy that they laid out at Investor Day late last year. So given what you've learned and what you described in 1Q results are the company's longer-term growth and margin goals still relevant? Or are changes required again based on what you've seen and observed? ","Brian Humphries","Well, I can't really comment on what the Board sought in a candidate so the question is for them to answer over time. What I will say is that five weeks into my tenure, I'm still very much in a steep learning curve as you can well imagine. I'm delighted to be here and obviously optimistic about our potential. And why? Of course as I said the market opportunity is there to be taken. I'm surrounded by a lot of really smart people with broad industry knowledge and I'm going to be leaning on them to help me execute our plan in the years ahead. We do have a base of associates as I said that are client-centric which is a huge asset to have a winning spirit and that's based on years of commercial success.","Now we have a set of customers who like Cognizant and that gives us the opportunity to up-sell and cross-sell to our installed base, but we also have an opportunity to go after new customers within our largest spend and most successful verticals as well as in the other segments and indeed as Karen touched open within growth markets. And we have to embrace digital further and leverage our strong C suite relationships notably at the CIO stack to better penetrate the rest of companies in their digital ambitions. What's easy or what's easy to articulate in one hand is obviously harder to execute. You asked me what needs to change? Too early for me to comment and I'll be in a better position to address that obviously down the line in the outer quarters.","Maybe let me answer your question indirectly by saying and touching upon some of the work streams that I\u2019ve started. What's really clear and important to me in good companies is that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. Teams are empowered with responsibility clarification and empowerment so too goes accountability. And core to all of that his decision rights. And we have a matrix as every company has a matrix, but we need to and I will explore the D if you will on a rapid between horizontals verticals and the deeper markets.","There must be clarity in the matrix. I also really want to look at how we get after the sales opportunity and not just in terms of the CIO versus the rest of the C-suite where we in theory should be able to better leverage our CIO relationships to cross-sell into the CMO, the COO and indeed the CEO and shift ultimately from the run portion of the business which will always be under some degree of constraint into the optimization or transformation portion of the business, leveraging more of a shift to advisory and indeed our digital offerings.","But we have to look at some of the basics as well customer segmentation, commission plans, accounts-based marketing all of these are critical to growth and it's important to get the basics right and of course as it expands our delivery model. So look in short I'm learning the business. With every passing week I get a little smarter, but I've got a lot to learn and I'm rolling my sleeves up as you can imagine with the team spending time with clients and they themselves will have a huge role to play in informing my priorities going forward. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Essex","Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess either Brian or Karen I was wondering if we might be able to get a little bit more color on the Banking and the Financial Services side? And it sounds like things are a little bit softer than you anticipated particularly with North America and regional banking clients? I was wondering maybe if you could help us wrap our arms around that a little bit to understand what -- where the softness came from and is this a temporary issue? Or might there be a fatter pipeline kind of in the back half of the year as you kind of progress through the year? ","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. Brian it's Karen. I'll take that. So I think, certainly as we've talked about for several quarters, the top five banking clients have been under pressure and we saw the nice recovery in two of the top five last year and that continues into this year. We haven't really seen any change of the profile of those clients or their behavior.","But we did, as we said on the call in my comments see some pullback in the regional banking clients. Some of it was M&A as we\u2019ve always talked about when there were acquisitions happening between clients particularly when both sides of the acquisition are clients of ours. We do tend to see some pullback as the deals are getting finalized and closed before integration spending, so there was a little bit of that in the quarter.","But we saw some general softness at some of our other regional clients as well, not on a material basis in any individual client, but a number of small pullbacks across the industry. I think it's early to say what's happening in the broader market. But at this point I don't expect to see a significant recovery as we move into the back half of the year. But neither do we expect to see significant deterioration beyond what we've already seen with the three of the big five banking clients, but it was a little bit of a surprise in the quarter as we got further into it. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Bachman","Hi, thank you very much. I want to -- Brian this is for you and I wanted to start with you're lowering estimates, which I don't candidly think as a surprise, but the magnitude's certainly a bit larger than we were thinking. And as you indicated you've been there a short period of time. And so I just wanted to get kind of comfort level that you had enough time to at least give some assessments that would suggest that the estimates are set at a reasonable spot. And the second part of the question is you are taking a fresh look at things.","And one of the things that does surprise me a little bit is the free cash flow targets, in other words, using 25% of your free cash flow for acquisitions. And given your attached rates to some of the troubled banks and the gravity that that poses, I would think that Cognizant would be well-served by perhaps leaning a bit more on M&A as your friends from Accenture doing in other firms. And so the corollary part of the question if you saw opportunities that would advance the cause of Cognizant would you be willing to flex away from some previous statements that were made to advance Cognizant? That's it for me.","Brian Humphries","Well, thank you, Keith. Let me first start with capital allocation because the M&A question is inherent in that. Look you can well imagine Keith, our Board of Directors and I will continue to evaluate our framework on an ongoing basis to ensure we're maximizing value for people like you and our shareholders generally. We do have a very strong balance sheet. At this moment in time, there is no change in our previously disclosed capital allocation framework.","I will say more explicitly to the question on M&A, it has been and will continue to be a level of -- a lever to execute our strategy. I'm very clear in my mind that M&A is not a strategy, it is a means to execute a strategy. So, all acquisitions that come forward to me needs to be contextualized against our strategy and we need to have clear business ownership and sponsorship and a clean line of sight to integration.","At the moment, we're not working on major acquisitions and I'm more historically favorable to tuck-in acquisitions as opposed to anything beyond that. And I do think we should be able to use those as a means to an end to drive further revenue growth in line with our strategic ambition.","Back to the first part of your question which relates to the margins, look everybody knows I've been here five weeks, so I arrived in April 1st, the quarter was closed and immediately we started looking at the results and trying to decompose them down understanding what happened in the latter part of the quarter.","By definition, I have been focused on what is a secular trend versus a cyclical trend, what is an external factor versus a Cognizant-specific factor? I'm pleased with the work that Karen and I have done to try to get below those as best we can. I'm obviously focused on putting guidance out there that I know we can actually execute against. And that will enable me to invest in the long-term health of the business to ensure we can drive shareholder value creation. So, at this moment in time, that's as much as I can say.","A \u2013 Karen McLoughlin","And I think Keith if I could just add to Brian's comments on capital allocation and acquisitions. As you'll recall at Investor Day what we outlined was a framework that on average in a given year, we would deploy 50% of our free cash flow for buybacks and dividends, 25% for M&A, and then 25% on average goes to India. But we continue to have a very strong balance sheet both with cash and excess capacity for debt if we needed the appropriate time for acquisitions or other investments.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Q \u2013 Bryan Keane","Hi, good afternoon. I know you guys gave guidance on February 6, so I'm just trying to understand in the first quarter, the miss of op income was by $100 million versus $300 million and margins ended up being down 170 basis points. So -- and I know we talked about margin expansion this year. Margins were going to be up 100 basis points.","Now they're going to be down 100 basis points. So I'm just trying to put what happened to the margin expansion and just the shortfall in revenue for the quarter doesn't make up for it. And I'm sure you knew about headcount raises already. So I'm just trying to reconcile the differences? Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin","Yes. So I think Bryan the way to think about it is that the revenue shortfall was clearly the biggest piece in the sense that we have ramped up hiring in Q4 and then the beginning of Q1 for the anticipated growth this year. And as you know it's hard to -- you can pull down the hiring, but once you have the people on board you need the revenue to support that.","And when we gave guidance, while we did not give quarterly margin guidance certainly our Q1 margin does tend to be below the full year average. And so while the 16% adjusted operating margin was slightly below our own expectations we had expected that there would be a ramp of margins as we went through the year as revenue continued to build and as we were be able to deploy the headcount that we had bought on in Q4 and the early part of 2019. And I think what you'll see, as I\u2019ve said in my comments that margins, there will be a little bit of a different seasonality this year. So margins -- adjusted operating margins in Q1 and Q2 will be roughly the same. Q2 tends to be our strongest margin quarter, but given the pullback of revenue and the headcount that we have on board now, Q2 margins will be similarly in line with Q1, but then we'll see the ramp as we get back into Q3 and Q4 and we can better align the cost structure to the revenue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Schneider","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and welcome Brian. Maybe if we could go back to the conversations you've had with clients over your initial month at the company. Can you maybe just talk philosophically about what they've told you about their willingness to potentially give you more business, if business conditions were different?","In other words, for example with respect to pricing is -- do you believe that you could actually accelerate revenue growth at the company by potentially being a little bit more aggressive on pricing? And can you maybe -- understanding that you don't believe there's a direct trade-off between revenue growth?","And margins, just talk about your thoughts on how you could re-accelerate revenue growth beyond all of the kind of temporal issues that are going on with the clients in Banking, Healthcare right now? ","Brian Humphries","Yes. I think it's a good question and inherent in that is the notion of elasticity and also our position within clients in terms of where we stand, not just in legacy but also in the new. I've seen quite a lot of clients across three continents and I have approached those meetings very openly soliciting feedback on Cognizant, on our brand, on what we stand for, on our client teams and delivery and project management. I've tried to obviously in the same vein understand what those customers are working on.","And I would say very clearly and consistently spend pressure continues on the run side of the business in Financial Services everywhere else kind of consistent theme. And all firms are fully aware of the do-or-die notion that digital disruption brings their way. So they are in a highly competitive market with legacy competitors as well as new. And so very often the message is, we have to find ways to get our investments down in legacy, free up dollars for investments in security, but also free up dollars for innovation, to enable them to better participate in the digital world, if you will. So there is spend, but it's not always where we would traditionally played. And so our task is to optimize our portfolio, being as efficient as possible in our legacy business, and better positioning ourselves then in the digital world.","And that brings with it complications as well as opportunities. The nature of the contracts from longer-term contracts to more project-based contracts is the fact that we have to juggle with, the nature of the skills required to get at those opportunities and the relationships, how we get into the front door? How we leverage our strength with CIOs and strong customer NPS to sponsors with their CMO, COOs, CEOs? How we get the right skill sets? Who we talk to? How we talk to them? How we follow-up? What collateral to leave? You name it. It's fundamentally an opportunity for us, but also something we have to grow into and continue to flex our muscles in, as we become more of an advisory element.","Cognizant Digital Business is really important to making that happen. Winning new logos of course will enable us to grow too. But more broadly, almost two-thirds of our business is in Financial Services and Healthcare, so it's important that we turn those businesses around. It's important that we buttress our North America business with further growth in global growth markets, which grew 12% in the first quarter. And, if we get all of those things right and invest for growth, I am confident that over time in a steady-state, we will be able to simultaneously deliver better margins and accelerated growth. At this moment in time, of course, we have a lot of work to do.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. Please proceed with your question.","Q \u2013 Rod Bourgeois","Hey, welcome, Brian, and nice to have the fresh perspective. Hey, I just want to go back to where we had been recently. I mean, it does seem that the Analyst Day and the related financial targets that were set by the outgoing management, it does seem that those targets were awkwardly timed. And so I just wanted to inquire, a couple of things. One has the process for forecasting risk rating prospects in the pipeline and so on, has that process changed as you've come to the helm?","And two, is there a plan for the role that Frank will be playing going forward? Is he ultimately going to transition out or is he staying for an extended period? So any clarity on that in the context of having these financial targets that were issued when there was the CEO change eminently about to occur. I think a lot of people are now especially now wrestling with the awkwardness that was created with that. So has the guidance process and the forecasting assumptions and approach changed? And is there a plan for the role of Frank going forward?","A \u2013 Brian Humphries","Well, let me first start with the latter question around Frank who's been nothing short of a gentleman in the transition period with me. And I've been delighted to have the opportunity to spend time with him and work with him. He\u2019s somebody I reach out to almost on a daily basis to get guidance and counsel within the same vein. He's clear that he hasn't gone from the CEO role for the next three months or the next two months at this stage to move into an EVP or Executive Vice Chairman role and thereafter, will transition to the Board. And I'm sure will be available for me in non-operational capacity, but as a counselor as needed and as I choose to use.","With regards to the process for forecasting and the Investor Day guidance and Q1 guidance, I can't really comment on the past. It's very clear obviously that, I understand the importance of setting expectations we can meet and consistency of earnings. It's something that I hold near and dear to my heart. We will continue to work to get rigor in our forecasting process and not just forecasting, but an annual budget process. Forecasts happen on a monthly basis, bottom up from accounts. But at the end of the day, we set a cost structure and we set leadership bonuses based on the annual budget. So we want to make sure we're rigorous, not just against forecasting and predictability of guidance, but also against the inherent plan as we enter a year. ","Q \u2013 Rod Bourgeois","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Q \u2013 Darrin Peller","Hey, thanks, guys. Listen just to dissect the shortfall on revenue versus your initial outlook, I mean, when we think of the magnitude of $500 million $600 million of revenue here, I guess, I'd just love to get a little more granularity as to how much of this is a handful of large clients? How much of it is broad-based? And then, really, I didn't hear you say you digital \u2013 sort of, digital revenue growth rate. Maybe if you can give us that and if that's not been really enough to offset, what you're seeing is legacy revenue decelerating at a faster pace now. Thanks, guys.","A \u2013 Karen McLoughlin","So, Darrin, it's Karen. So the digital, what we've said in my comments was that it's about a-third of revenue now. It grew low \u2013 above 20%, so \u2013 but low 20s, so consistent with where it was running towards the end of last year, so no real significant changes there.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Q \u2013 Bryan Bergin","Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask on Healthcare. With the political cycles starting to ramp and then the rhetoric around health insurance also ramping, can you discuss what you're seeing in spending behavior in conversations with your managed-care clients. I'm trying to understand the underlying outlook here, that's independent of the captive and also independent of account ramping down. And really, when do you expect that segment can potentially show a turn of the corner here?","A \u2013 Karen McLoughlin","It's Karen. So I don't \u2013 I think the behavior we saw in Q1 was really related primarily to the merger and acquisition activity that we've seen in Healthcare. So as we all know, there have been two very large mergers in the last few months. All four of those companies were clients of ours.","And that was the majority of where we saw some pullbacks and where we expect see some deterioration, as we said, going into Q2 and sluggishness for the rest of the year. And then, we had one large client that did accelerate the move to a captive during the quarter. At this point, I think, it's more about those client-specific situations versus anything that might be happening in the broader regulatory environment with Healthcare. But I'll ask Brian to maybe add some color to that as well.","A \u2013 Brian Humphries","Well, thanks, Karen. Well, first of all, it bifurcates. Obviously, Life Sciences has been very strong and grew double-digit, as we said. In the health care payer business, we've had a different story and certainly excluding some M&A, it's been slow. I would say, on a positive nature, health care is still about 18% of the nation's GDP and we're starting from a position of strength. So we need to understand, of course, we've had disappointing Healthcare results this quarter, but we need to do better.","In the last few days, I've spent about three hours with CIOs of some of the largest Healthcare companies in the world. And the message I received was very clear. Help them on the run to optimize your opportunities, which optimize their run business and get cost savings and yet they are very open to embracing Cognizant under transformation and digital agenda, where we have so much opportunity. And so for us now and Malcolm in his new offer \u2013 in his role to get after those opportunities and make sure we bring our assets to bear in customers where we've historically had very strong customer satisfaction and growing business in prior years.","Karen McLoughlin","And with that, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining and for your questions.","Brian Humphries","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone.","By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2013 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have for today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Francisco, please go ahead.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Cognizant's second quarter performance was strong and ahead of our guidance for the quarter.","Second quarter revenue was $2.16 billion, a sequential increase of 7% and an increase of 20.4% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was above the top end of our target range at 21.4% for the quarter. This was primarily due to the weakness of the Indian rupee, the timing of wage increases in the year and higher utilization. Based on our strong growth this quarter and our expectation of continued healthy demand environment for the rest of the year, we've increased full year revenue guidance by $140 million to $8.74 billion, which represents at least 19% year-over-year growth.","I'm pleased with our strong growth this quarter. We added more incremental revenue this quarter than all but one other quarter in our history. I'd like to comment on some of the drivers of this quarter's performance before I turn the call over to Gordon and Karen for the operating and financial details.","During the quarter, we celebrated the 15th anniversary of Cognizant's IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange. While much has changed at Cognizant during that time, one thing that remains absolutely consistent is our strategy of reinvestment in the business to drive top line growth. During these 15 years, we have maintained stable operating margins and delivered industry-leading revenue growth. In recent years, we have focused our investment across 3 growth horizons. We implemented these 3 Horizon approach in response to a fundamental long-term shift we identified in our clients' business imperatives. We think of these imperatives in terms of a dual mandate: run better and run different. As a reminder, run better is when we help clients drive greater performance in their current business, and run different is when we help clients improve the positioning of their businesses for future success.","On our call last quarter, I went into some details outlining our Horizon 3 portfolio. I spoke to you about our progress in building out our capabilities in the SMAC technologies: social, mobile, analytics and cloud. We continue to see strong evidence that SMAC is the next secular shift in computing, and we are investing accordingly. And we had some great client wins across our SMAC practices. For instance, we recently engaged with a global consumer goods company to build a Center of Excellence for social media analytics, which will enable them to derive actionable insights from the data gleaned from a variety of social media sources. As enterprises around the world focus on digital transformation of their operations, and SMAC becomes ever more prevalent in the industry nomenclature, we have seen that our early lead and our thought leadership in this area gives us a distinct competitive advantage in the market.","And while I'm pleased with the investments we have made in SMAC as a driver of growth, I'm also pleased with the healthy growth in our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 services, which Gordon will talk about shortly. The growth in these services is important because it demonstrates our continued success in enabling clients who have to increasingly run better in order to free up investments for run different initiatives. I'm confident that Cognizant has more class offerings on both dimensions of the dual mandate.","As we look to the remainder of the year, we see a continuation of the healthy demand environment for our services, which gives us the confidence to raise guidance for the full year. The demand comes from a combination of macro trends and our own competitive positioning. On the macro front, in North America, our largest geographic market, as consumer and business confidence continued to show modest improvements, our clients are starting to turn their attention to making investments in software and services. Often, these investments are funded through modest budget increases, but more often, the funding comes from driving efficiency in other parts of the business. And in Europe, which represents the majority of the remainder of our business, as the macro environment in many countries continues to be challenging, we are finding an increased appetite from clients to move more work to a global delivery model.","Let me end my remarks by saying that I think our strong performance is a testament to the strategy we have been implementing and discussing with you in recent quarters. I believe that we're extremely well positioned and I am encouraged about our prospects for the remainder of the year.","Now I'll hand it over to Gordon to share more about our performance, and to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return to the conversation for Q&A. Gordon?","Gordon J. Coburn","Thank you, Francisco. We had another solid quarter with demand across our industries, geographies and service lines generally playing out better than anticipated, driven in part by strong discretionary spend. Our Horizon 1 services performed very well, with particular strength in consulting and technology services. This is in line with what we see in a normal budget and spend cycle, where we see the full-quarter impact of the current year's budgeted discretionary spend kick in during the second quarter.","The strong growth in our Horizon 1 services is a further validation of our balanced approach to growing and integrating our core services with our emerging services and new service offerings. For example, we saw this reflected in the performance of our quality engineering and assurance practice, which performed exceptionally well this past quarter. Today, this practice has over 20,000 career testers providing a wide range of testing services across all 3 Horizons of our business, including in newer and rapidly growing areas such as testing for regulatory compliance, testing of mobile applications, product testing and testing consulting and advisory services. As a market leader in this service offering, we are seeing strong interest by clients in utilizing our testing services and IP through newer business models such as managed services.","Turning to Horizon 2 offerings. On a combined basis, our Horizon 2 services continued to grow faster than company average, driving both mind share and market share. Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continues to lead the charge for many of the transformational deals we win. During the quarter, several key wins were a result of CBC being an integral part of our pursuit in helping us present a transformational roadmap to our clients.","It is important to note that these consulting-led transformational deals cut across our Horizon 1, Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 businesses. Our vertically aligned BPO practice continues to show solid growth, supported by expansion of work with existing clients and recent wins with new clients. With every passing quarter, we continue to expand our capabilities in vertically aligned BPO. This quarter, for example, we saw some good wins around provider credentialing, health exchanges, asset management and banking reconciliation.","Additionally, we continue to expand and strengthen our U.S. delivery and operations capabilities to support our BPO services. As part of this effort, we recently completed a tuck-under acquisition of SourceNet Solutions, an accounts payable service provider located at College Station, Texas, which was owned by our long-time financial services client, BNY Mellon. This acquisition brings SourceNet's processing platform to Cognizant.","IT Infrastructure Services continued to see robust growth across industries and geographies. As indicated in the previous quarter, we continue to see more deals integrating applications and infrastructure and delivering significant value to clients from their synergies. During the quarter, we won several large deals, some of them being end-to-end, multi-year IT Infrastructure deals that included data center migration, provisioning and support leveraging our recently added data centers.","One good example is a deal with Orkla, the Nordics' leading supplier of branded consumer goods. Under a 5-year agreement, Cognizant will provide a broad range of applications and end-to-end infrastructure management services to Orkla, delivering a more stable and scalable technology environment, improving service quality, predictability, flexibility and business agility.","Looking at our performance from an industry standpoint, financial services continued to perform well during the second quarter, growing over 6% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. Within banking, among both our larger and midsized clients, demand continues to be driven by ongoing cost optimization, a steady pickup in regulatory and risk management projects and the growing importance of mobility and analytics.","Healthcare, which consists primarily of our payer and pharmaceutical clients, grew 6% sequentially at about 12% year-over-year. While we expect the growth of our pharmaceutical business to remain slower than company average, given the industry's ongoing challenges with patent expirations, the work with our payer clients is beginning to rebound. The growth in the payer sector is broad-based among many of our larger clients. In particular, we are executing a number of consulting, program management, IT and BPOs assignments, assisting clients with the participation in the new health insurance exchanges.","Our retail manufacturing sector, which had another strong quarter, growing 8% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. Within retail, the strength of our consulting and program management capabilities, coupled with our deep industry knowledge, is enabling us to win a number of strategic deals. During the quarter, we were selected to implement a supply chain initiative for a major retailer, and we continue to expand the number of clients that we serve as their e-commerce partner.","Our Other segment grew 8% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. Within the telecom portion of the segment, we saw broad-based growth and project ramps across a number of our key accounts. We also saw strong sequential growth in the high-tech portion of the segment, resulting from strong discretionary spend, as this area is more heavily weighted towards development work.","Moving on to our performance by geography. North America grew 6% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Europe saw healthy growth at 11% sequential and 37% year-over-year. Breaking down the European performance: U.K. grew 8% sequentially and 28% year-over-year; including the impact of the C1 Group acquisition, Continental Europe grew almost 16% sequentially and 54% year-over-year. Excluding the revenue from the C1 Group, growth in Continental Europe was approximately 6% sequentially.","Last quarter, we spoke to you about the acquisition of the 6 companies of the C1 Group with strong presence in Germany. Integration is progressing well. We are jointly going to market with a broader and deeper set of capabilities and stronger local presence. Within a short period of time since we closed this acquisition at the start of March, we have jointly won several new logos and have expanded our capabilities with existing customers in Germany and Switzerland.","As discussed earlier, we are seeing a structural shift to long-term outsourcing deals across Europe with the economic climate serving as a catalyst. Because of our continued investments in Europe, local leadership and broad range of capabilities, we remain optimistic in our long-term growth prospects across Europe.","Our growth in the rest of the world continued to remain strong, growing 7% sequentially and 25% year-over-year, as our investments in key markets such as Singapore, India and the Middle East are continuing to drive accelerated growth. I'd now like to quickly touch base on the status of immigration reform.","As many of you know, and as expected, a comprehensive immigration reform bill was passed by the Senate in late June. Our view of the bill remains unchanged. The bill includes some very good things for the American economy, our customers and our industry, but also include several clauses which, if enacted, would be detrimental to our clients and U.S. competitiveness. Now that the Senate has passed this bill, the immigration debate shifts to the House of Representatives. The House leadership has clearly stated that it does not intend to consider the Senate's bill. Rather, it will follow a different approach and develop its own legislation through a step-by-step approach.","It is unclear whether the approach in the House will result in a bill as comprehensive as the Senate's or several separate bills addressing targeted components of immigration. In late June, a High-Skilled Immigration bill was passed by the House Judiciary Committee. This proposal includes many of the positive components of the Senate bill, such as increasing Visa caps and streamlining the Green Card process. However, it did not include the onerous outplacement clause found in the Senate's bill. It is clear that we are still in the early days of the House's discussion of immigration.","In addition, we were pleased to see the Indian government raise the potential impact of the Senate's H-1B provisions on the U.S.-India relationship and the India government's understanding of the concerns of the U.S. Government and U.S. technology companies regarding certain of its policies and the flexibility that the Indian government has shown on these issues.","On the client side, we are seeing no change in client behavior as a result of the immigration debate. We are discussing the issue with clients and other stakeholders who are interested, though such requests have been few and far between.","Finally, let me comment on our attrition during the second quarter. Annualized attrition was 18.7%. We calculate attrition by annualizing the turnover which occurred within the quarter, including both voluntary and involuntary. Our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO and employees in our training program. Although we often see a sequential increase in attrition during the second quarter, this year's increase was a bit higher than normal. Our attrition was heavily weighted towards our junior staff offshore and it was impacted by the timing of our 2012 bonus payments, as well as the completion of our 2012 performance evaluation process. Although attrition increase was not entirely unexpected, we're certainly paying attention to this uptick. In addition to the compensation increases and promotions that took effect July 1, we are also making it very clear to our associates, both in our employee communications and also in our actions, that Cognizant's strong growth creates tremendous career opportunities for each of them.","I'll now hand the call over to Karen to comment on our financial performance and guidance.","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning to everyone. As detailed in our press release, our second quarter revenue grew 7% sequentially and 20.4% over last year to $2.16 billion, ahead of our guidance of $2.13 billion from last quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 21.4%, above our target range of 19% to 20%, while our GAAP operating margin was 19.7% for the quarter. We generated $1.07 of non-GAAP EPS and $0.99 of GAAP EPS for the quarter. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS included $0.07 of nonoperating FX losses for the quarter.","As Frank mentioned, the over performance in non-GAAP operating margin was primarily the result of increased utilization during the quarter, the impact of the rupee depreciation net of our hedge losses and the timing of compensation increases and promotions which took effect on July 1.","Our GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 28.5%. Our tax rate for the quarter and expected rate for the full year is higher than our previous guidance, due primarily to additional tax expense in India related to the impact of foreign exchange movements on certain USD-denominated assets of our Indian subsidiaries.","Now turning to some of our other performance measures. Consulting and technology services, formerly known as application development, represented 50.5% of revenue; and outsourcing services, formerly known as application management, was 49.5% for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 17.8% year-over-year and 8.7% sequentially. Outsourcing services grew 23.1% year-over-year and 5.3% sequentially. 32.4% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts during the second quarter and grew by 5.4% sequentially and 16.9% year-over-year. As expected, on a sequential basis, our pricing was stable during the second quarter. We closed the quarter with 1,100 active customers and the number of accounts which we consider to be strategic increased by 8. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 229. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic customers embracing a wider range of Cognizant services at an earlier stage in the relationship.","Our fully diluted share count for the quarter was 304.4 million shares, a decrease of approximately 730,000 shares from Q1. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.83 million shares at an average price of $62.94 for a total cost of approximately $115 million. To date, 15.7 million shares at a cost of $998 million have been repurchased under the current share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the second quarter with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $156 million from March 31. During the second quarter, operating activities generated approximately $365.6 million of cash. Financing activities consumed approximately $106.3 million of cash. This was comprised of expenditures of $115 million towards our share repurchase program, offset by net proceeds of $8.9 million related to option exercises and related tax benefits, as well as our employee stock purchase program. We spent approximately $50.3 million for capital expenditures during the quarter and during 2013, we continue to expect our capital expenditures to total approximately $400 million.","Based on our $1.79 billion receivable balance on June 30, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 75 days, down by 1 day from the first quarter. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $224 million, up from $206 million at the end of Q1. Approximately 63% of the Q2 unbilled balance was billed in July.","Net headcount increased by approximately 1,600 people during the quarter, 48% of gross additions for the quarter were direct college hires, while 52% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 164,300 employees globally, of which approximately 152,700 were service delivery staff.","Utilization increased on a sequential basis during Q2. Offshore utilization was approximately 70%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 75%. And on-site utilization increased to approximately 93% during the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our growth expectations for the third quarter of 2013, as well as the full year. For the fourth -- for the third quarter of 2013, we are projecting revenue of at least $2.25 billion. For the full year 2013, we expect to continue delivering industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we are pleased to revise our revenue guidance upwards to at least $8.74 billion. This represents full year growth of at least 19%. This guidance includes $10 million of expected revenue from the recently closed tuck-under acquisition of SourceNet Solutions.","During Q3 and for the full year 2013, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.09, which translates to GAAP EPS of $1. This guidance anticipates a Q3 share count of approximately 305 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27%. Our guidance excludes any nonoperating FX gains or losses.","For the full year 2013, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be at least $4.32, excluding estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.31 and acquisition-related expenses of $0.05, our GAAP EPS will be at least $3.96. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 305 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27%. It also excludes any further nonoperating FX gains or losses.","Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a real quick question. Normally, 2Q and 3Q sequential growth are pretty similar in terms of revenue, but it looks like even backing out the SourceNet acquisition, you're expecting a softer sequential revenue growth from the spike of, looks like about 6% organic in 2Q. I guess, just anything behind that or is that just conservatism? And just related to that, the headcount growth wasn't as high as we expected sequentially. Should we expect a spike back up in headcount growth? And was that just impacted by the attrition rate?","Gordon J. Coburn","Bryan, it's Gordon. Q2 generally should be our strongest quarter sequentially, and the reason why is Q1 tends to be muted because you don't get a whole lot of discretionary spend in the first half of the quarter. So in Q2, you get the full-quarter impact of the new budget cycle and then, obviously, that continues in Q3 but you don't get as big a sequential boost. And that is more pronounced in the years where discretionary spending is the driver of growth, which obviously, it is this year. Headcount is playing out exactly as we want it, we're actually very pleased. If you'll recall, we hired a lot of people at the end of last year to set ourselves up well for growth this year. Took utilization down a bit in Q1 and then, clearly, we said we wanted to take utilization back up and that's exactly what we did. So we have great control over our hiring and we are executing on our plan of taking utilization up as the year goes on. We don't give specific hiring targets for the remainder of the year, but certainly, we would -- we think there is a little bit more room for utilization, though Q2 was -- saw the big jump in utilization.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm wondering for immigration reform, if you're seeing any discussion with clients about it, if there are any delays in their decision making or the kinds of questions that they are asking? And also, you've talked about clients being ready to lobby on your behalf. Has that begun now that the Senate bill is passed?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, Sara. So with clients -- first of all, let me be very clear about this, there has been absolutely no change, whatsoever, in decision-making as a result of immigration. The number of questions that we've gotten from -- received from clients have been few and far between. Where clients ask questions, we've been going out and meeting with them. But the number of questions have been quite small, and the discussion is more around, \"Hey, how do you think legislation will play out?\" And typically, in those discussions will come up, are there things that -- the customers says, we as a company can do. Generally, the CIO won't have the authorization to go do it themselves, but what we're seeing, they're certainly hoping to reach out to their Washington offices. Clients are getting involved, some directly and some through trade organizations. But it's a fairly small number, which is appropriate at this time, the -- what's wise for key ones to voice their opinion.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Gordon, just one real quick one, just to clean up the acquisition contributions for the quarter and for the year. I thought I heard both the C1 and SourceNet -- but I think when you guys said a $10 million acquisition, that was only for SourceNet. Can you just help us clean that up a little bit to know what the sort of acquired contributions are expected to be from, I guess, both C1 and SourceNet and then, just the organic implication underneath that?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure, Julio, this is Karen. So -- think about there's 3 pieces. There's C1 and MediCall acquisitions, which we talked about back in Q1. Those are still on track to do about $90 million of incremental revenue for the year...","Gordon J. Coburn","And those were in our guidance.","Karen McLoughlin","And that was in our original guidance. The only change this quarter is the addition of SourceNet, which is $10 million of incremental revenue for the year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about SG&A, it was surprisingly low, looks like only up 6% year-on-year. Can you break that down for us, what's sort of depressing the growth rate there?","Gordon J. Coburn","Tien-Tsin, SG&A will bounce around a bit. In the end, we target an operating margin, as we always have -- this quarter, we came in a little bit high but obviously, it will come down into the range next quarter as wage inflation kicks in. And so depending on where cost of goods land. Now -- but remember, what's -- part of what's happening here is we're growing. And as we grow, there is more leverage of SG&A. So I would not read a whole lot into quarter-to-quarter movements in SG&A.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know you guys do sometimes 2 sets of rate increases, 1 in May and 1 in July. Was there a shift in relative importance you give to the May 1 versus the July 1 this year?","Gordon J. Coburn","We simplified it this year. So last couple of years, we split -- part of the population was in May, part was in July. We simplified it this year, we moved everyone to a July cycle. So the ones that were in May are now in July, the ones that were in July continued to be in July.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Karen, with regard to the unusually high tax rate, 28.5%, I heard your commentary, but it sounded like in the instance that the rupee were to go the other way, would the tax reverse? And then, a follow-up related question, did you say you had $0.07 of hedge-related losses in the quarter?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. So let me answer the first -- the second part of that first. So the $0.07 was the nonoperating FX losses for the quarter. So that was on the, essentially, on the INR-denominated -- the net asset position of the INR assets, okay, was the $0.07. Then separately, on the increase in the tax rate, that is due to the gains, essentially, in our India books on the U.S. dollar-denominated assets that are recorded in our India statutory book. So yes, if the rupee were to strengthen significantly, that would offset over time.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a question on the Healthcare vertical. After a few quarters in a row of seeing a little bit of weaker trend, obviously, it did show an acceleration quarter. I know I think, Gordon, you mentioned the paying side of it or the payer side of it. Can you just give us a little more color on that? I mean, is that something we can see as being sustainable? Obviously, that's one -- it's been, historically, one of your more important verticals and seeing strength in that is nice to see.","Francisco D'Souza","It's Frank, Darrin. Yes, we're very pleased with the strength in Healthcare, overall, and a large part of it is driven by, we're seeing broad-based growth across our payer clients and that's really across a spectrum of services that we offer. So we've seen really good growth there in our consulting business, program management. We're starting to do a lot of IT and BPO stuff, assisting clients with participation in the new health insurance exchanges. So we're feeling very good about the payer side of that business. The other side of the Healthcare business is the Life Sciences business, and there, I think it's going to take us a few more quarters -- there's sort of a lingering pressure on Life Sciences clients who are dealing with the patent cliff. And so I think that, that will bottom out over the next 2 or 3 quarters and then, start to come back. So we're seeing good strong growth on the payer side, still some lingering pressure on the Life Sciences side, but overall, you saw a good quarter-on-quarter sequential growth, so we're feeling good about the overall business.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Edward Caso of Wells Fargo.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to talk about the infrastructure outsourcing business, if maybe you could frame the size of it as a percent of the total? What the competitive position outlook is right now? It seems like everyone is talking about it, they seem to be larger deals. So could you also talk about the margin profile relative to your average?","Gordon J. Coburn","Ed, it's Gordon. So let me take the first part on size and then, I'll hand it over to Frank to talk about the market. Think about Horizon 2, BPO, infrastructure and CBC, all those we've now gotten to critical mass. Infrastructure -- all 3 together are over 20% of revenue. Infrastructure alone is now, in terms of people, is measured -- I think, we're approaching 14,000 people or so. So we're at critical mass in that business, which means we can start competing in bigger deals. And that's one of things that we're excited about because it gives us the credibility now to compete in the bigger deals too. Frank, do you want to talk a little bit about the market?","Francisco D'Souza","I think, as Gordon said, we feel good about our competitive position at this point. Obviously, we're playing in the asset-light area of infrastructure management. We built a very strong, credible capability. Gordon, in his prepared comments, talked about the win up at Orkla, which is one example of a multi-year infrastructure deal. So -- and there are several such deals that we are competing on and winning. So as the market shifts more towards looking at infrastructure as a viable candidate to move to a global delivery model and in addition, as clients look to leverage the cloud increasingly and infrastructure in the cloud, that's driving a great deal of transformation in Infrastructure Services. We feel like we're very well positioned. In terms of margin profile on the business, we think that the margin profile in the business in the long run, it's very similar to the core business. We are investing in the business right now so our SG&A in that business is higher than what it will be in steady-state as a percent of revenue, and that's pulling margins down. But the fundamental of the business is such that we think in the long run, they will be very compatible to the core business.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois of Sanford Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So 2 topics. Can you just quantify how much margin boost you received in the quarter from the rupee depreciation, and then, what that might look like in the current quarter? And to what extent the move in the rupee is enabling you to invest at a more rapid rate than you would have assumed at the beginning of the year? And then just real quick, as a second topic, can you just give us thoughts on your assumptions in your guidance for the rest of the year concerning discretionary spending?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. So Rod, I'll take the first part, then, I'll turn it over to Gordon for the second piece of that. Regarding the FX impact on a sequential basis, there's about 30 basis points of margin improvement because, obviously, we've hedged a lot of our rupee exposure. So net of the hedge losses, that's about 30 basis points. Going forward, think about it as about 10 basis points of margin improvement for every 1% movement in the rupee.","Gordon J. Coburn","And on our assumptions about discretionary spending. As we said, we -- in the second quarter, we saw continued healthy demand for discretionary spending. We saw it start at the end of Q1, it clearly continued into Q2. And based on what customers are telling us, pipelines deals that are happening, we think that continues for the remainder of the year.","Operator","The next question is from the line of George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just as it relates to Horizon 2, can you kind of break out the growth rates or maybe give us a sense if consulting BPO and infrastructure management are growing in tandem or one is outperforming the other? And just as it relates to the U.K., can you talk a little about the strength that you saw there and was that all organic?","Gordon J. Coburn","So when you think about Horizon 2, all 3 of them, overall, are growing faster than the company. Each quarter, one will grow a little bit faster than the other and so that's all small numbers. But think about all 3 of these, our businesses, as I had just mentioned, that now hit critical mass, can play in bigger deals. So we would expect sort of, on a normalized basis, all of them to grow faster than company average. Which one grows the fastest, that will -- quarter-on-quarter, that'll flip around a little bit. U.K. had no inorganic revenues, so that was all organic. Frank, do you want to just comment on the business environment in the U.K.?","Francisco D'Souza","I think that for the last several quarters across Europe, both on the continent and in the U.K., the focus has been -- our clients' focus has been on the run better services. So focused a lot on optimization of existing operations and looking more work to the global delivery model. I would say, though, that in the last, perhaps, 1 quarter -- and I don't want to call it a trend yet, we have seen in the U.K., particularly some pickup in discretionary spending as well, where we see somewhat of an uptick in the U.K. on business confidence and consumer confidence. We're also starting to see an uptick in discretionary spending. A lot of that is focused on things like the SMAC stack. So clients looking at deploying social, mobile, analytics and cloud. We're also seeing things like omni-channel with our retail customers. So we are starting to see, in the U.K., some signs that discretionary spending starting to pick up. And of course, there continues to be a strong thrust both in the U.K. and in the continent towards the run better types of services -- excuse -- in the run better types of services.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Gordon, I just want to go back to sort of the discretionary spending comments, get a little bit more color there. Kind of, is it broad-based across verticals and geography? How much of the upside guide was due to this relative to market share gains? And kind of taking note of the 8 strategic ones in the quarter, it seems like the deal activity actually accelerated as well, maybe you could comment on that?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So I think the majority of the increase in guidance and overperformance in the quarter was a result of discretionary spend. Because coming out of Q1, we saw the early signs of a pickup in discretionary spend, but we weren't sure if it had legs. Clearly, it had legs, so we were a bit cautious on it early on, we saw it materialize in the second quarter. So I would really point to discretionary spend. What we referred to as the run different spend being the big driver of over performance in the quarter and for the full year. And then, obviously, from an industry standpoint, banking did very well. It's a big business and it did well. And the payer side of Healthcare did well as well, so we're certainly pleased and perhaps, a bit surprised on both of those.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Togut of Evercore Partners.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Can you please quantify wage increases in the quarter? And separately, can you please discuss your current capital allocation priorities, including, if there's a possibility for an initiation of a dividend in the near term?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So on wages, as we mentioned, our annual increment, as well as our annual promotions all go into effect July 1, so there is no impact in the second quarter. Obviously, it impacts in the third quarter, and that's way we guided that we'd be back down into our normal operating range. On capital allocation, as Karen mentioned, we continued to repurchase shares during the quarter. As many know, we expanded our repurchase program earlier in the year, and we still have about $500 million left in that program. So the focus would be when and how do we continue to use that program.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just curious, when you think about getting back to the targeted non-GAAP operating margin range, what are the factors that get you there? In the third quarter, obviously, you have the salary bumps July 1, but do you also expect to step-up hiring as you go into the back-half the year? And then, maybe if you can just comment on the higher attrition, where do you think those junior workers are leaving Cognizant to go to?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So let me start with the first question on margin. The big driver is the salaries kick in. Obviously, we'll continue to hire, but revenues growing so that offset, so it's really -- the wage is just the big thing. And implied in that is we continued to invest during the second quarter -- I want to be very clear about that, our investment continued at a very healthy pace. Where do people go when they leave? They go to lots of places. The reality is, Cognizant has an incredible training program. Obviously, we're doing well in the marketplace, so our people are in demand. So we lose to various multinational competitors, to ISPs as well as once in a while, to other offshore companies. But I think what we see is -- and people understand, is when you grow faster, which we're doing, than the rest of the industry, does create unique career opportunities. And we see that, particularly, with our highest performers, where we see a very low attrition rate. So we're very pleased about that. So there's a pickup in attrition, but this has happened many times in the past, we know how to deal with it. So obviously, we got to make sure we take it back down to where we like but this is -- this has happened many times and it's normal course of business.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies and Company.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a clarification and a question. A clarification on the tax rate, especially, as we start to think beyond this year, are we saying that the rupee would have to appreciate for the tax rate to come back towards the 25% range versus the 27% range? And then, just my question is, what percent of your new clients these days are initially engaging Cognizant in Horizon 2 or 3 rather than Horizon 1? And any comparison to what that percentage might have looked like a year or so ago?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. So Jason, I'll take the first part of that and then, turn it over to Frank and Gordon for the second part. But on the tax rate, what's really causing that spike to the 27% is the volatility in the rupee. So if the rupee were to stabilize at this rate, over time, the rate would start to come back down. So we wouldn't have that big swing in the gain or loss on the U.S. dollar-denominated assets. So we do not view that this is a permanent adjustment to this tax rate, assuming that the rupee does start to stabilize over time.","Francisco D'Souza","Jason, on the other part of your question -- it's Frank. I don't have a specific number, but my instinct thinks it's about -- it's been increasing in terms of the number of new clients that we're winning based on a Horizon 2 or Horizon 3 type of service. We're actually winning new clients now based on Horizon 3 services, clients that have never done business with Cognizant in the past. As a guess, without a specific number, I would say it's about 1\/3 -- 25% to 1\/3 of the clients -- the new clients that we're winning would be a Horizon 2 or Horizon 3 services. And that's up from, I would say, 2 or 3 years ago, that would have been in the low-single digits in terms of new clients for the company. So it's up quite considerably, and it's an indicator to me that, once again, that our -- those service lines are becoming competitive in their own right. And of course, we're having great success cross-selling into our existing client base and we're also doing very well selling those services to new clients.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Given your success in run different this last quarter, do you raise your $500 million target for SMAC? And I guess, which parts of SMAC are you seeing the most interest in?","Francisco D'Souza","I'll answer the second part first. The places where we're clearly seeing the most traction in SMAC are in the mobile space. There's just a tremendous amount of demand in mobility, that part of the SMAC business grew very nicely, sequentially. And more importantly, we're starting to see clients there where we are doing large ongoing platform mobility work. And a year or 2 ago, if we had looked at the mobile work we were doing, it would be small engagements in that space. So now we're starting to see a real significant client engagement in mobility. The next after that, I would say, would be analytics. And there is just a tremendous amount of interest in -- and opportunity to drive better business performance through Big Data and deep analysis. Cloud is a very significant part of our business but it's, in a sense, distributed across many areas of our business. So cloud shows up in our Infrastructure business, cloud shows up in our enterprise applications business. So it's very distributed across all of Cognizant. And so I would point to those 3 as being the places where we're seeing the most traction. And of course, social, I would say, to a lesser extent, that there continues to be some interest there as well, like the example I gave in my prepared comments. We don't update guidance on a service-by-service basis. We wanted to give you a sense last quarter of where we will land with SMAC this year. I still think $500 million is a pretty good number. Will it be a little higher than that? It could be based on the demand we're seeing. But I wouldn't want to update that on a quarter-by-quarter basis moving forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a clarification, you've bumped up guidance by about 200 basis points for revenue growth, but then you bumped up the EPS guidance by $0.01 for the year. Maybe you can talk about that? I don't know if you did earlier on the call. And then, just another clarification here. We're focusing a lot about -- on net headcount additions for the quarter. In your view, given the fact that you're focusing a bit more on nonlinear growth, is this something we should continue to focus on as a proxy for top line growth or maybe, the effect of net headcount additions will probably not be as relevant down the road?","Gordon J. Coburn","Moshe, it's Gordon. On EPS, that's entirely due to the nonoperating FX loss this quarter. We actually beat earnings this quarter by $0.07 more than reported because our guidance always excludes nonoperating losses. So the reason you're not seeing as much EPS flow through to the full year as revenue is due to that $0.07 FX loss that we experienced -- nonoperating FX loss that we experienced during the quarter. The net headcount additions, I'd always be very careful on focusing on that, that's why we stopped giving guidance because there's a lot of seasonality for when we bring people on, when we want to take utilization up and down. For instance, late last year we decided to bring on a bunch of people, consciously took utilization down in Q1 and starting to take it back up now. So I think you ought to always want to be fairly careful about that. I'm not sure the nonlinear stuff is materially moving the needle at this point, on headcount additions because you also have BPO growing, which takes it in the opposite direction. So that's more of just utilization management.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Would you describe the recovery as balanced or are there pockets of strength and weakness? And then, maybe you could give us a little bit more color on the financial services vertical. Have you seen a pickup in discretionary spending there, particularly in capital markets or consulting?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes, I would say -- Joe, it's Frank. I would say that in the U.S., I would call the recovery fairly balanced. We are seeing it across almost all of the industry sectors that we -- in which we operate. So the U.S., I think, we're seeing good broad-based growth in discretionary spending. The only place, as I've mentioned a little earlier in the call, that I think there's some lingering weakness is in our life sciences business. We talked to you about that last quarter as well, but besides that, we feel very good about the U.S. market. As we look at Europe, I think the continent continues to be a story of different countries and different stories in the different countries. But there, we're seeing more of a focus on cost containment and driving greater efficiencies, so sort of the run better part of our business. And in the U.K., a little bit of a mixed bag. I would say, broad-based growth but not as strong as it is in the U.S. So a little bit in the middle. So overall, I think that's the picture. And sorry, Joe, what was the second part of your question? I apologize.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to know about financial services, a pickup, particularly, in capital markets. Maybe you can just give us a breakdown of demand within that vertical?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes. So we're -- so again, as Gordon said, we were a little surprised when financial services came back -- in the last 2 quarters, we've been surprised as to the positive side in both quarters. This quarter, we had good sequential growth there. The demand is coming from retail, it is coming from capital markets. Retail banking, and as we've said in the last few -- 2 or 3 quarters, we've also started to see nice pickup with the midsized banks in the U.S. as they start to adopt the global delivery model. In capital markets, some of our growth now is being driven by a pickup in regulatory and risk management-related projects. And that often does include a consulting and, sort of, strategy and consulting fees upfront.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two, if I could. If you think about last year this at time, you're guiding to 20% year-over-year growth, and now you're guiding to, call it, 19% year-over-year growth. Would you -- could you characterize the visibility relative to those benchmarks that you currently have in terms of pipeline and deal flow to the 19% growth this year versus where you stood last year? And then, secondly, could you also just talk about cash flow targets for the year? For instance last year, you delivered about 16% of revenue was cash flow from operations. Would you anticipate about the same level of performance this year?","Gordon J. Coburn","Keith, it's Gordon. Let me take the first part and then, Karen will take the second. So we just increased our guidance to 19%, given it's mid-August, and in our business, you have to ramp up the people and so forth. We have pretty good visibility on the remainder of the year. So I would say, our visibility is similar to what it was this time last year. The time when you have less visibility is in February, before people lock down their budgets. But by this time of year, people -- you have the natural flow. Obviously, you can have new deals come in and that kind of stuff, but you don't have the macro surprises -- that's all tied out at this point. And obviously, that's why we're pleased that we're able to raise our guidance. Let me have Karen comment on cash flow.","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. So we actually don't provide cash flow guidance for a number of reasons, but -- including, we don't know the timing of acquisitions, what we might do under the stock buyback program and so forth. So I think we would expect to continue to show strong cash flow from operations as we go into the back half of the year. And we'll continue to invest in capital expenditures, as we talked about. And then, when appropriate, utilize the stock buyback program and do acquisitions as appropriate.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dave Koning of Robert W. Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just one quick one. You said $10 million of revs from the SourceNet acquisition in the back half. Is that about $5 million a quarter? I'm just wondering as to the timing of when it got done, just so we correctly model quarter-by-quarter.","Karen McLoughlin","Yes, so the acquisition closed beginning of June, end of May, and that's spread pretty evenly over the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arvind Ramnani of BNP Paribas.","Arvind A. Ramnani - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. Your Q4 guidance implies only about 2.6% sequential growth. What assumptions have you made in -- changed like somewhere in the guidance? And the second question is related to the Immigration Bill. I agree with your earlier comments that buyers of IT services are not worried about the Immigration Bill. However, have you all made any changes to your recruiting efforts and is there any medium- to long-term plan to reduce dependency on H-1Bs?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, this is Gordon. Let me quickly just set the Q4 guidance and discuss immigration. Q4, that's a quarter where you never quite know, is there a budget slash? Do people run out of budget? As you get to the year -- so you always want to leave a little bit of breathing room there. And historically, Q4 tends to be weaker than Q3, so that's one where, yes, there always could be a little bit of noise. On immigration -- just repeat your immigration question again, sorry?","Arvind A. Ramnani - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Have you all made any changes to your recruiting efforts and is there medium- to long-term dependency to reduce your dependency on H-1Bs?","Gordon J. Coburn","So I think this is an important point. We've been evolving our model for a long time, well before the immigration debate started. 3 years ago, we started a U.S. college recruiting program. We now recruit several hundred students each year. We have 75 recruiters recruiting U.S.-based employees. So this is nothing new to us. We've been opening up our own development centers in the U.S. We now have centers in North Dakota and Iowa and Arizona and Texas and Florida and New Jersey. So this is an ongoing process for us. The challenge is, we have to hire thousands of people a year here in the U.S. and it's challenging to find enough qualified IT professionals. Where we can find them, we hire them. But particularly in the locations that we need, it is a challenge, so it's a mix. But doing more local hiring is a process that we've been doing for a while, and we'll continue to do.","I think that is -- we are at the 8:00 mark. So with that, thank you, all, for joining this quarter call. Frank, you have any final comments?","Francisco D'Souza","No, just thanks, everybody, for joining. And we're happy with the quarter's performance and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Francisco, please go ahead.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.","We finished 2014 on a strong note. Our fourth quarter revenues were $2.74 billion, a sequential increase of 6.2% including revenues from TriZetto. Excluding the impact of the TriZetto acquisition, we posted sequential growth of 3.1% in Q4 which includes a negative currency impact of 1.1%.","For the full year 2014 including TriZetto we delivered $10.26 billion of revenue which represent a growth of 16.1% over 2013.","As you're aware, we revised our full year guidance, growth guidance at the time of our Q2 earnings release on account of client specific issues and delayed ramp ups in some projects. As is clear from our strong performance during Q3 and Q4 those clients and projects specific issues are now behind us and as we enter 2015, we are encouraged by the strength of the demand environment and how well positioned we are to capture the market opportunity.","For the full year 2015, we expect to deliver at least $12.21 billion of revenue which represents full year growth of at least 19% after a 2% currency headwind. Adjusting for the impact of TriZetto and currency movement, this guidance reflects strong revenue growth in our underlying business and is roughly in line with our 2014 growth. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected financial performance shortly.","I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing you a perspective on the trends that we saw last year and how these are impacting the demand environment going forward and how Cognizant is positioned to address the market opportunity.","Let me start with the demand environment. For many quarters, we've been talking to you about a once in a decade shift driven by digital technologies that are putting industries and businesses at cross roads. While there have been big technology shifts in the past, the current digital era is different in two very fundamental ways.","First, technology has moved from automating transactions to instrumenting all aspects of our lives. Senses are being embedded everywhere which implies that physical environments are becoming more intelligent and almost everything is becoming a source of data. It's estimated that by 2020 there will be 50 billion connected devices generating 50 times the data that is being generated today. The only way to harness this ecosystem is through advance forms of automation and technology. The second difference is that the base of change is like nothing we've ever seen before.","In the past, technology evolution was characterized by brief periods of very intense innovation followed by long periods of incremental improvement. Today, innovation cycles have compressed so dramatically that business leaders around the world have to think of innovation and improvement simultaneously. This challenge to achieve both efficiency and innovation is what we call the dual mandate and we believe companies must simultaneously focus on both of these.","On the one hand, large parts of the world economy are yet to return to robust and sustainable growth which means we have to help our clients conserve capital by providing efficiencies and productivity while also helping them build variable cost structures so, that they are better able to match their cost with revenue and demand.","On the other hand, we have to help them reinvent and reimagine their businesses and build the skills and capabilities required to make digital come alive. This is driving a significant demand for newer services in areas such as mobility, data and security. McKinsey study highlights this demand indicating a potential shortage in the U.S. of up to 190,000 data scientist by 2018.","Clients need a partner who has the ability to integrate and execute end to end transformations driving both efficiency and innovation and I am confident that Cognizant is that partner for our clients in 2015 and beyond.","Now let me explain in some more detail, how we are bringing all our capabilities together to help our clients on both sides of the dual mandate. The first thing we are working on is driving best in class delivery across all of our service lines. We're continually improving each and every one of our services to bring capital and operating efficiencies to our clients. We have a relentless focus on bringing in tools and techniques to measure an improved delivery across the life cycle so clients can benefit from best in class operations. And we continue to drive efficiencies by investing in our delivery network tapping new sources of talent and also driving process automation by flying advanced technologies across our lines of service.","The second area in which we are focused is the end to end productivity achieved by bringing multiple services and service capabilities together. For example, we are increasingly packaging application and infrastructure services together to take advantage of the synergies for managing these layers of the stack in combination. Our engagement with Heath Net announced last year is an excellent example of an end to end solutions which includes applications and infrastructure as well as business process services.","Our ability to extract end to end synergies will allow us to reduce Health Net's G&A spend and improve quality of service. Another example of the work we are doing to drive end to end productivity is our work in developing shared industry platforms. We are increasingly bringing together applications, cloud and business process services to create industry utilities benefiting multiple customers in an industry. In this process we have created new commercial models where we can charge clients on the outcome or output we deliver to them. The platform from TriZetto and Heath Net will enable us to offer these new delivery models in healthcare at scale.","Third, we're best in class delivery and multi-service integration in industry platforms help us drive efficiency for our clients. On the innovation front, we made significant investment and solve great traction for digital solutions this past year.","Business transformation at scale in the digital era requires approaches scales and capabilities that are different from traditional IT services. For several years, we've been working with our clients, our new solutions driven by social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies. This experience has helped us create a comprehensive integrated approach to transform our clients businesses into digital enterprises. We've been working with CEOs to strategically re-think business models with business leaders to digitize business processes and with CIOs to create the foundational technologies and security for the digital age. We have multi-disciplinary teams that bring together consultants, digital technologist designer\u2019s business process experts and data scientist to create cohesive digital solutions for clients.","We're organically building on our heritage of data, industry expertise, knowledge of SMAC technologies and legacy systems complemented by digital acquisitions like iTask, Cadient and Odyssey.","And finally to further enhance our offerings to clients, we continue to invest in new capabilities to make sure that we stay well ahead of the curve. We're particularly focused on the next generation of game changing technologies such as instrumentation with ultra-low cost sensors, embedded software, 3D printing advanced cyber security and many areas of artificial intelligence. These are exciting times to be in the technology industry. The pace of change and innovation is breathtaking. Over the next decade organizations around the world will raise to deploy new technologies for competitive advantage and better service. The world is becoming more technology intensive and I am excited about the opportunity that this represents for our clients and for Cognizant.","In closing, let me say that 2014 was a significant year for us. We completed 20 years of strong growth expanding to over 200,000 talented associates and now have operations in more than 40 countries globally. We've created a solid platform for growth and I am confident that given our entrepreneurial culture and our ability to adapt to change we're well positioned for the next phase of our journey.","I'd like to hand it over to Gordon now to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return later for the Q&A. Over to you, Gordon.","Gordon Coburn","Thank you, Frank.","Before I get into the details of the quarter, I'll first discuss the status of the integration and revenue synergies of the TriZetto acquisitions and then provide some additional color on the current demand environment.","As announced previously, we closed the $2.8 billion acquisition of TriZetto on November 20th. At this point, client account teams have been integrated and detailed plans are in place to begin to drive revenue synergies this year. We have a team of people dedicated to the integration and the various synergy tracks we outlined several months back. We have identified at a granular level, the path to achieving the $1.5 billion of synergy opportunities over the next five years and remain confident and our ability to deliver that result based on the many exciting opportunities we see.","First, we anticipate picking up incremental projects integrating TriZetto platforms for pair clients. Second, we think there is an opportunity to cross-sell our BPS hosting and consulting services into the TriZetto clients where we currently don't have relationships. Finally, the longer term opportunity goes beyond that. The combination of TriZetto's platforms with our services and program management capabilities will allow us to create end-to-end platform based solutions for pair clients.","At the time, the significant disruption in the healthcare industry, regulatory reform ageing populations increasing price competition to manage for transparency and new technologies. These, end-to-end solutions gain interaction. We are receiving numerous inquiries from CEOs and COOs at our clients. They are proactively reaching out to us starting conversations about combined Cognizant and TriZetto solutions. These clients are intrigued by how these comprehensive platform-based solutions can create compelling value propositions for their companies.","Let me now comment on the overall demand environment and our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. We\u2019re pleased with the strong revenue performance during the fourth quarter despite unfavorable currency movement. As Francisco mentioned earlier excluding the impact of TriZetto revenue grew 3.1% over quarter three which includes a negative currency impact of 1.1%. The demand environment remains strong, as reflected in our strong order pipeline and the pickup of deal activity over the past couple of quarters and reflects clients growing demand for achieving both efficiency and innovation on one platform.","From an industry perspective, our banking and financial services segment grew 3.6% sequentially and 12.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in our insurance practice, where there is a growing interest in end-to-end managed services.","On the banking side, underlying demand drivers remain consistent through 2014 cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance, real-time risk monitoring, and fraud and trade surveillance. We expect many of these drivers to continue in 2015 but with the increased focus on newer technologies in digital and automation.","Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, and now our TriZetto business grew 17.9% sequentially, and 26% year-over-year. Excluding TriZetto, the healthcare segment grew 5.6% sequentially. As we\u2019ve discussed over the course of 2014, our payer sector took a more cautious approach to investment during the year. Longer-term, the payer sector is undergoing fundamental change driven by changing regulatory environment, increasing focus on medical cost and the consumerization of healthcare. We believe this fundamental change creates longer term opportunities for which we are well positioned to capture.","Within the pharmaceutical segment, we have seen another quarter of strong sequential growth driven by cost optimization and vendor consolidation as well as increased traction in BPS especially with clinical and commercial operations.","Finally our acquisition of Cadient is helping drive the digital agenda with our pharmaceutical clients as Cadient has seen as leading the market in digital marketing solutions.","Our regional manufacturing segment was essentially flat when compared to the third quarter and up 9% over Q4 of 2013. Q4 is typically a slow quarter for the segment given the lockdown of IT systems during the holiday season and a number of furloughs that occur at year end. However we are seeing improved demand particularly in areas of modernizing supply chains as well as digital and e-commerce engagements.","Our other segment which includes hi-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients was up 1.2% sequentially and 23.3% year-over-year, primarily driven by further penetration with our existing clients. We have seen good traction through our iTask acquisition with our communications and media and entertainment clients as traditional cable, broadcast and telecom network environments move towards a wide range of digital video services.","Let me now turn to a discussion of our Horizon II service lines where we continue to be pleased with the market traction we\u2019re realizing. Our BPS practice saw continued traction during the quarter, launching the ramp up of a number of wins in prior quarters across financial services, insurance and healthcare. BPS is a critical component of bringing operating efficiencies to our clients, increase the rate this is delivered through solutions leveraging technology and advanced automation.","Demand for our vertically aligned business processes such as membership enrollments and revenue cycle management and healthcare and claims processing and mortgage services and insurance and financial services remain strong.","Cognizant infrastructure services had another strong quarter. We\u2019re seeing solid demand from clients looking to simplify and automate their infrastructure through newer delivery models, often incorporating highly automated managed services and newer technologies such as our hybrid cloud and mobility solutions.","Additionally solutions integrating infrastructure and applications management are gaining traction. Cognizant business Consulting or CBC continued its pace of above average growth as transformational engagements which requires clients to rethink and reimagine their strategy in operating models are driving strong demand.","Within today\u2019s environment, clients are expecting consulting to go beyond strategy and to be included within integrated solutions incorporating design, technology and the implementation. CPC is on the front lines of our digital engagements with over 60% of deals in their 2015 pipeline having a digital component, focusing particularly on three key areas. Enhancing the customer experience, modernizing and simplifying supply chains and transforming underlying technologies for their digital environment.","Our Horizon III offerings include new technologies and new delivery models as well as new markets. In new area seeing especially strong traction is our public sector practice. This strength is driven by leveraging our commercial expertise particularly in banking and healthcare and offering our full suite of services across all three horizons.","From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 7.7% sequentially and 17.4% year-over-year. Excluding TriZetto, North America was up 3.6% over the third quarter. Revenue from Europe was up 0.6% compared to quarter three including a negative 4.4% currency impact. Revenue was up 10.7% over a year ago.","Continental Europe was up just under 1% sequentially including a negative 4.7% currency impact. We expect solid growth in the continent over coming years as we increasingly benefit from the structural shift towards larger multi-year outsourcing programs. The rest of the world continue to show good growth up 4.5% sequentially and 22.3% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as Australia and the Middle East.","2014 was a strong year from a business operations perspective. In our 20th year, our reputation of being an employer of choice was further strengthened across the globe. We crossed the 200,000 employee mark. We continue to recruit and hire some of the best talent from around the world both from the lateral market and from leading universities in 17 countries. With newer skills needed to address opportunities driven by digital, we have aggressively expanded recruitment into areas such as analytics and digital solution design.","Additionally, the acquisition of TriZetto, iTask, Cadient and Odyssey in 2014 have brought in world class talent in areas of product engineering, video engineering, mobility, digital marketing and other skills critical to transformations that clients are seeing. We saw a downward trend with attrition during the year, evidence of our ability to engage, train, develop, recognize and retain our associates. We were pleased that Cognizant was ranked number one for the second year in a row in the association for talent developments 2014 best awards program.","Additionally, our Annual Business Effectiveness Survey of Employees showed results improving from the prior year and validation of our sustained focus on employee retention while driving high levels of customer centricity.","As we enter 2015, I believe that we are well positioned to capture the evolving market opportunities. Our investments in expanded capabilities and markets combined with the strongest workforce in our history gives us confidence in delivering strong growth despite the current currency headwinds.","Now let me have Karen provide more color on the financial details of our performance. Karen?","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you Gordon and good morning everyone.","Fourth quarter revenue of $2.74 billion included approximately $80.6 million associated with TriZetto and represented growth of 6.2% sequentially and 16.4% year-over-year.","Non-GAAP operating margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related expenses was 19.4% within our target range of 19% to 20%.","During the quarter, we adjusted our estimate of 2014 incentive compensation downward to reflect the margin impact of accelerated hiring and other investments. This revision positively impacted our Q4 operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 exceeded our previous guidance by $0.04. For the full year 2014, revenue of $10.26 billion represented growth of 16.1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2% and non-GAAP EPS was $2.60. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 54% and 46% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 8% sequentially and 26% year-over-year while outsourcing services were up 5% sequentially and grew 7% from Q4 a year ago.","During the quarter $45 million of revenue from TriZetto was included in consulting and technology services and $35 million was included in outsourcing. For the full year, consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 53% and 47% of revenue respectfully.","During the fourth quarter 36% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and as expected overall pricing was stable. As part of the TriZetto acquisition, we added both payer and provider clients including more than 245,000 providers as such the customer count is no longer as relevant a metric for measuring our core performance, so we will no longer be providing that going forward. We will however continue to provide the number of strategic accounts which we have defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. We added several strategic customers in the quarter bringing our total number of strategic clients to 271.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $58 million. To-date, we have repurchased approximately 35.2 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion under the share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $814 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count increased slightly to 612.8 million shares for the quarter. As a result of the TriZetto acquisition we are modifying our DSO calculations. The DSO formula will continue to include total accounts receivable that will now be net of the uncollected portion of deferred revenues. Total receivables were $2.3 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivable of 70 days.","Under the previous calculation, the DSO for Cognizant excluding TriZetto would have been 75 days, a decrease of approximately two days from the last quarter. The unbilled portion of our receivable balance was approximately $325 million down from $338 million at the end of Q3. We build approximately 56% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables.","Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $3.8 billion of cash and short-term investments down by approximately $844 million from the quarter ending September 30th and up by approximately $27 million from the year ago period.","As mentioned previously, we closed the acquisition of TriZetto during the quarter. The funding for this acquisition came from a combination of cash on hand and debt priced at LIBOR plus the 100 basis points. At the end of the quarter, our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.6 billion including approximately $650 million which was drawn on our revolver to fund intercompany payments at the end of the year.","Including this debt financing activities were approximately at $1.6 billion worth of cash during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated approximately $324 million of cash, investing activities were a use of cash of $2.53 billion, this included $2.68 billion for acquisitions and capital expenditures of approximately $75 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the full year were approximately $213 million.","Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics for the quarter and for the rest of the year. During the quarter, we added approximately 11,800 employees including approximately 3,770 associates from the acquisition of TriZetto and we ended the quarter with approximately 211,500 employees globally. Approximately 198,000 of our employees were service delivery staff.","Excluding the TriZetto associates 33% of our new hires were direct college hires while 67% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. Annualized attrition of 14.5% during the quarter including BPO and trainees improved a 110 basis points from Q3 of this year. Attrition levels are something that we continue to monitor very closely and we are pleased by the sequential decline in those metrics.","Utilization declined on a sequential basis as we on boarded our new hires. Offshore utilization is approximately 59%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates during our training program was approximately 76% and onsite utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter.","As we spoke about last quarter, there have been significant fluctuations in global exchange rate this year.","For example, as of February 3rd, the euro had depreciated roughly 18% against the U.S. dollar versus where it was a year ago. The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates at the time of which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.","Based on current exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar, our guidance includes the 2% headwinds to 2015 year-over-year growth. With that in mind for the full year 2015, we expect revenue to be at least $12.21 billion, which represents growth of at least 19%. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $2.88 billion.","During the first quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.69. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses stock-based compensation and acquisition related expenses and amortization.","This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 612.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.6%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $2.91 for the full year. This guidance anticipates the full year share count of approximately 612.9 million shares and the tax rate of approximately 26.4%.","Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys and nice end to the year. Just wanted to start off first with your outlook for the 2015 year. You talked about an organic growth rate that similar to 2014 levels, which were nearly roughly 14%, 15% now, I guess 15% as when you called out. I guess the first question is just touching on the dynamics of the $80 million run rate from the last quarter seemed a little higher than we would have thought from TriZetto last, from really just December and a little bit in November from TriZetto. So can you talk a little bit about, you're actually including near 15 outlook for that? And then also, given that help that\u2019s not close, is that actually included in your guidance and maybe just talk a little bit about the underlying healthcare drivers beyond TriZetto it looks like it accelerated pretty nicely in the fourth quarter? Thanks guys.","Karen McLoughlin","Hey Darrin, this is Karen. I\u2019ll start with the first part about the guidance and I\u2019ll let Frank and Gordon talk a little bit more about the industry side of this. So for TriZetto keep in mind that obviously their primary revenue is software, so Q4 tends to be very, very strong for them, it is by far their strongest quarter of the year. I think when we talked about the acquisition previously we mentioned that there about $720 million run rate, which is essentially where they landed for 2014, but a lot of that revenue is back ended.","So think about them as give or take about $720 million company growing mid-single-digit have been historically their growth rate and that would what you back a little bit guidance is. In terms of Health Net, I\u2019ll let Frank and Gordon talk a little bit more about the actual contract and what\u2019s happening there, but in terms of guidance as we have talked about previously, we expect that we will get regulatory clearance by about the middle of the year. And so we do have baked into our full year guidance what the increase in the Health Net revenue would be from that point forward.","Darrin Peller","And just to add that we\u2019re willing to the process of regulatory approvals at this point our expectation is that things would be in line with the timing that we had expected mid this year to be able to go live?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes. And I\u2019ll just add to that Darrin. Look, it\u2019s Frank. On a big picture level the, if you recall this strategic rationale behind the TriZetto acquisition was premised on the fact that the healthcare landscape is undergoing very strong significant structural shifts due to not just the reform law, but associated cost pressure is shifting responsibility between payers and providers. And we think all of these things together create great growth opportunity for us, I think you saw some of that in the fourth quarter, I was very encouraged by the level of activity and dialogue that we saw in Q4 around the combined Cognizant TriZetto proposition with interest from clients and clients talking to us about the combined opportunity. So I think, great start to the combined relationship and I expect to see increased momentum as we go into '15.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Edward Caso","Hi thanks and congrats on the quarter. I was more curious about hiring and training as whole digital phenomenon takes off here as your peers are facing the same opportunity as well. So are you hiring people with the skills, have you develop new training program so this is added burden or is this just a different kind of training. Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza","Ed its Franc. I think it's a little bit of both, when you look at the digital opportunity from a skill standpoint, there are, I would say two tracks in a sense. You've got a set of foundational technologies that you need to deploy for clients and building out foundational technology skills, I would say follow the similar process to what Cognizant has historically done when it comes to building out new technology capability area. So we have great partnerships and alliances with technology providers, very deep partnerships we've got Cognizant academy that recruits trains cross trains cross skills our teams on foundational technologies.","But equally importantly and in what we find in the digital world is that it's not just about technologies. To really make digital come alive, you have to bring together these cross functional multi-functional teams that include consultant\u2019s technologist\u2019s data scientist\u2019s designers and of course folks who want to stand the client in the client context. And the skills like designers and data scientists are skills that we are both building organically internally but also recruiting heavily for in the marketplace and also as you've seen from the - some of the acquisitions that we did in 2014 we're also looking at inorganic ways to grow those capabilities. And I think you'll continue to see us pushing forward on all those fronts that I just mentioned as we go into '15 and we continue to build out the digital capability at Cognizant.","Gordon Coburn","And Ed one thing to add to that as Cognizant's brand awareness continues to strengthen, the quality and the breadth of the people that we're tracking is that all time high. So we're able to attract the technologists, the designers and people recognize our brand and they see that we are clearly positioned as a leader in the space. So we're really quite pleased with our recruiting capability right now, as well as we've always been terrific at training capability.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thanks. And let me add my congratulations on the year as well as good guidance guys. So I guess two questions one was the timing of TriZetto synergies. Just wanted to clarify 2015 guidance is there anything there is it reasonable to assume that the mid-single-digit growth rate can accelerate to maybe a low-double type number over the next 12 to 18 months.","And then secondly on your operating margins, the last time below 20% was I think some crack in 2007. So my question is if you include TriZetto ramping Health Net, the investments you're making in digital and automation. Is this the year you finally kind of get down to the 19, 20.","Gordon Coburn","Sure Ashwin its Gordon. So a couple of things, as we said in our prepared remarks we remain quite confident of achieving our $1.5 billion of revenue synergies over the next five years. As we said when we did the acquisitions that is back and loaded because the biggest piece of that comes from selling the integrated deals and obviously there is a long lead time on that. But also as we said we are actually seeing quite a bit of interest in that, so the pipeline is building.","Going forward you will not see us breakout TriZetto revenue, because what's TriZetto what's Cognizant very quickly becomes blurred particularly when you think about services revenue and BPO revenue. So we are managing as part of our healthcare practice going forward obviously we want to break it out as people understood what organic growth was for 2015.","Revenue synergies for 2015 as we said when we did the deal are certainly more modest than we will be in future years and it'll be heavily weighted towards services work which even prior to the acquisition we had the leading practice and obviously that\u2019s further strengthen now and we certainly feel good about the pipeline there.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you.","Gordon Coburn","Sorry on the operating margins, our target remains 19% to 20% we have bounced above 20% a little bit each time we did that we did reaffirm that we do not want to be above 20% so certainly our expectation is we would be in the 19% to 20% range for 2015 and our guidance assumes that and I would certainly encourage people and their models to assume we're in the 19% to 20%.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great, thanks. Good morning. Good results here. Just want to ask on the top five top 10 client growth composition of those clients change excluding TriZetto and also maybe I missed just the outlook for technology versus outsourcing revenue for the year? Thank you.","Karen McLoughlin","Sure, so top five for the quarter was 11.6% and top ten 20.1 Tien-tsin so, it\u2019s coming down at the percentage of revenue as you would expected too. No material changes this quarter and in terms of the customers that make that up so obviously we did have some overlap with TriZetto in terms of customers but the revenue for customer obviously is a little bit less than ours so no material change there and we did not provide specific guidance around the outlook for consulting the technology services versus outsourcing but I think as we had said previously with the ramp-up of some of the new contracts we signed this year including Health Net and then the big insurance contract and the board contracts and others that we talked about earlier in the year we would expect outsourcing revenue to recover a little bit as we go into 2015.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Ellis","Hey, good morning guys. I had a question around the TriZetto roadmap, can you provide maybe that\u2019s for Gordon, a bit more color around what how you are thinking about the product roadmap for the underlying TriZetto product and how you are thinking about incorporating and owning and managing as software platform into your overall business operations?","Francisco D'Souza","Hey, Lisa its fine let me address that so as we said when we did the TriZetto acquisition, the TriZetto business that we acquired has become part of the Cognizant Healthcare business but continues to operate as relatively standalone unit within the healthcare business. Now obviously we're focused on the synergy opportunities from an execution standpoint and as Gordon said those synergy opportunities in the short run are around the services business and the BPO business that we can generate together. But the core product, the TriZetto product set that capability remains a separate unit run by the management team that came to us when we did the TriZetto acquisition and they continue to execute against the product roadmap that they had laid out for their customers and now for our customers before the acquisition so we are keeping the platform very much as a standalone unit. We will continue to invest in it as we had as the plan had been in the past.","If anything we feel like we might be able to accelerate some aspects of the product roadmap because of our development capability and so on and so forth but we clearly recognized that the rhythm of a software business is different from the rhythm of a services business and so we are keeping it as a standalone unit within the healthcare, the bigger healthcare business unit so that we protect that culture and we continue to make the - create the necessary focus I would say around the software product business.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Sara Gubins","Hi, thank you good morning. As you are thinking about 2015 what you are expecting client budgets to be during, there has been some discussions from competitors of US bank, IT budgets are down in 2015 because of regulatory cost I'm wondering if you're seeing that.","Francisco D'Souza","Hey it\u2019s Franc. Let me jump in and then Gordon can add to it. I don't think we're seeing budgets down overall we are actually seeing sort of flat to modestly up budgets. So I think Gartner predicted or Gartner's projection from January of this year was sort of 2.4%, 2.5% increase in budgets. That sort of consistent with what we're seeing. Clearly, there is a shift going on within budgets and I think that's really the more important trend for to focus on what we are seeing is that is dual mandate that we've been speaking about for so long is really playing out in budgets where because overall budgets are call it flat to modestly up.","The pressure that it creates for organizations is to really get more done with those essentially same budget dollars. And so what that means is that on one side clients continue to look for ways to drive greater degrees of efficiency and effectiveness kind of what we call the run better side of the equation. So that they can invest those dollars in deploying new digital and other capabilities that sort of the run different side of the equation.","Clearly in financial services regulatory compliance initiatives are consuming a significant amount of our client's budgets. I think this is anecdotal, I would say that the most intense period of that was probably last year I think as we go into '15 when I look at in our financial services institutions. It's not to say that the regulatory compliance spend goes away but I think it's, I would say it's become more stable I don't see increasing as a percent of overall budgets and so that's started to create a degree of stability within our financial services clients where I start to see more focus and attention being turned to digital initiatives and initiatives that I considered to be ones that will drive competitiveness and top line growth for financial services.","So I am actually seeing a positive shift in financial services more towards innovation and growth as regulatory compliance stabilizes and becomes a better and more understood level of spending. I don't know Gordon if there is anything you want to add to that.","Gordon Coburn","No I think you've covered that well. The only thing I might add in Europe obviously the economies are little bit softer but we're seeing that actually serve as a catalyst for people to shift their spending and look at services such as Cognizant to help reduce their cost of running the business so they can still invest in innovation.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Bachman","Yes thank you. Good morning team. I had a question either for Karen and Gordon on operating margins. A if you could you had two quarters of non-GAAP operating margins in the 19.5% range call it. How much the TriZetto impact December quarter operating margins and as the follow on we don't yet have the 10-Q yet for the December quarter, but at least in the September quarter industry segment level operating dollars of profit actually declined year-over-year and I was hoping you could flush out why is that will that continue. And as my follow on question Karen if you could talk about some of the puts and takes in the CY15 operating margin guidance and specifically including how much TriZetto and or FX impacting the guidance that you provided. Thank you.","Karen McLoughlin","Okay, sure so let me start with TriZetto Keith. So TriZetto's operating margin is roughly in line with Cognizant. So in terms of the impact on overall margin percent it's nominal so it's really just about the revenue growth there that's obviously on a non-GAAP basis, on a GAAP basis because of all the acquisition amortization obviously that would be dilutive. But on a non-GAAP basis I think about its being roughly in line with company average margin going forward. FX has a little bit of an impact on margin, but fairly nominal it's mainly a revenue issue with the FX headwinds that we had both in Q4 and that we're forecasting as we move into 2015.","In terms of the segment margin, obviously we have done a lot of hiring in the last six months, and that obviously puts pressure on margin until those folks become fully billable utilization ticked down both in Q3 and Q4. We would expect for that to stabilize in 2015 as we've talked about utilization will go up and down a little bit based on hiring and based on growth opportunities that we see in the company, but we would expect utilization to stabilize and margins to stabilize accordingly with that.","And so then as we move into 2015 really nothing unusual it really is about stabilizing utilization integrating TriZetto but as we said that generally runs in line with company average and continuing to ensure that we are driving for industry leading growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Steiner [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two if I may, first on the guidance you are providing excluding the effect of TriZetto and FX for 2015. As you look in 2015 versus where you were at the same point last year how you've adjusted your guidance for the year underlying that to be either more conservative the same or potentially more optimistic than your last year and then secondly with respect to offshore cash there has been some talk about potential legislation there to allow low rate repatriation of cash if that were to go through how much you think about your cash differently?","Gordon Coburn","Sure, this is Gordon. Let me start with the question on guidance and how conservative we have been. Clearly we build a meaningful risk adjustments into our guidance compared to the targets that our field organization has certainly we do not want to end up in situation similar to last year, so, we think we have built in the appropriate risk adjustments taking into account the experience that we have last year.","Karen McLoughlin","Sure, and then in terms of cash repatriation obviously we are supportive of anything that the U.S. does to help multinational companies be successful and to ensure that we can make the right investments around the world. So if something happens obviously we will take the appropriate steps and actions but we'll wait and see what happens at this point.","Gordon Coburn","I would remind you for the cash that we have in India even with the tax holiday or a reduced tax for repatriation in U.S. there is still a tax for taking the cash out of India.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.","David Togut","Thank you. As you look across each of your three horizons of services could you quantify unit price changes year-over-year 2015 versus 2014 and then for the employees we are working in each of these horizons what are the unit changes year-over-year and wages look like against the price changes? Thanks.","Gordon Coburn","Sure, so pricing is this over the past couple of quarters have been stable. I think that's a reasonable assumption going forward. You may see some divergence certainly on pricing in digital will be higher than in traditional apps maintenance but the people cost more there as well so when you netted all out I think reasonably stable price environment is the way to think about it. In terms of wage inflation we do our wage increases later in the year and certainly we'll make sure that we're competitive with what others do but I would expect given the strong supply that wage increases will be relatively modest compare to prior year but in the end we will certainly match what others do so but I would expect others to be fairly disciplined in their wage increases.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys just want to give up data in the large deal pipeline any other chunky or larger deals that you are working on that could come in throughout the year and then just like just the outlook in Europe you guys are expecting to pick up demand in Europe, Thanks.","Gordon Coburn","Sure, large pipeline is healthy but you are absolutely it is chunky you don\u2019t have one every month we're certainly working on that number of large deals when that will - you never know with larger deals but the good news is we are clearly competitive in the large integrated deals that include BPS that include infrastructure that include co-IT so we have achieved critical mass and infrastructure and business process services and that's very important so we can we are quite competitive in the larger deals.","In terms of Europe, pipeline is healthy obviously the economy is a bit lumpy over there what we are seeing certainly in some of the more traditional outsourcing it serves as a catalyst for people to move forward because they have to reduce their run cost. It's early to note that what the impact will be on innovation spend certainly there is lots of interest you will see what's sort of projects kick off, but overall we continue to invest heavily in Europe, because we think the window for outsourcing is very active right now.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney. Please go ahead with your question.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. You had mentioned before that I think you are looking for at least $200 million in incremental revenues from large deal winds next year and in this year 2015. Is that still the case and can you wrap some numbers for us around SMAC as a percentage of revenue growth rates and margins. Thank you.","Gordon Coburn","Sure so on the large deals that $200 million was related to the three large deals that we talked about on the prior earnings call. I think that is still an accurate assumptions assuming everything continues on track to way it is currently. In terms of SMAC, SMAC has been kind of folded into the broader digital initiatives which and within digital what we're seeing is across is all of our businesses all of our accounts. So it becomes very difficult to say it's in a specific amount because it touches everything. So we don't have a further update on that other than to say clearly there is healthy SMAC demand within digital and digital we're seeing currently - across all three horizons currently.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Essex, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Essex","Hi good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could dig in a little bit on TriZetto and I think when you announced the deal we talked about the potential opportunity for some kind of halo around it you think kind of Health Net as an example of the reference of those deals. I wondered can you talk a little bit about conversations that you're having with customers in the pipeline and are there any potential prospects like wins in the pipeline and understand those several type of the little bit longer, our near term might some of those deals be as far as in the pipeline.","Francisco D'Souza","Its Franc let me take that. Let me start by saying that I think that and as I said in my prepared comments, one of the trends that I'm quite excited about is this notion of clients looking to us in various forms to create these large integrated deals that include apps infrastructure and business process services. And those sometimes those like in the case of Health Net those are relatively standalone and in other cases we see migrating potentially to shared industry utility type of model which I think TriZetto and Health Net will enable going forward.","After the announcement of the TriZetto acquisition, I would say that we've seen an increase in conversations with clients about the potentials of those kinds of deals. I would characterize the pipeline of those deals as relatively early stage at this point, but certainly an active set of conversations going on right now with prospects around what those kinds of deals structures might look like.","I would remind you that the Health Net deal, the sales cycle was probably in the order of, Health Net has been a Cognizant's client for 10 years close to 10 years and the sales cycle on this particular transactions was closed to three years. My hope is that when we look at the TriZetto opportunity that we're not looking at three year sales cycle, but I would still set the expectations that it's 18 to 20 months before we start to see those kinds of transactions these are large complicated deals that involve a lot of structuring and a lot of groundwork with clients, but I think all of the elements are there I feel very good about how we're positioned to do those deals and I think that the Health Net transaction serves us as somewhat of a beacon that others will emulate.","Gordon Coburn","Operator we have time for one more call. One more question.","Operator","Yes that question is coming from the line of Steven Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Steven Milunovich","Great. Thank you very much. Just quick question Karen could you go over the discussion of incentive comp again and the impact?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure so in Q4, we adjusted down our incentive comp across as you know that's obviously variable compensation and we tie that to the performance of the business and which is both based on the revenue and margin. So we did adjust that down in Q4 to offset the margin impact the strong hiring\u2019s and some of the other investments we were making in the quarter and that had a two point impact on the quarter.","Francisco D'Souza","Very good. I think with that we'll wrap up the call. I want to just thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. And I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com.","The speakers we have on today's call are: Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q filed later today.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Cognizant is off to a solid start this year. Our first quarter revenue was $3.55 billion, at the top end of our guided range, and up 10.7% your rear. Our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.84.","Turning to guidance, we expect second quarter revenue to be within a range of $3.63 billion to $3.68 billion, and we continue to expect full-year revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10%.","I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing how we're accelerating our shift to digital by helping clients become technology enabled across their businesses. As the markets we serve move away from the physical and towards the digital, our clients know that they must build new customer experiences and automated processes on top of secure and scalable technology. That's the only way to compete effectively in a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, algorithms, bots, and big data. Doing so at scale, however, is a tall order, and that's why Cognizant's mission is to help clients transform their business models, their operating models, and their technology models in tandem to deliver the promise of digital at scale.","Now we realize the word digital carries many meanings. For Cognizant, it goes well beyond building user interfaces or implementing collaboration platforms. For us, it's about using technology to enable clients to run better and run different. It's about the dual mandate to achieve more efficient and effective operations while reshaping business models for innovation and growth. This is the digital that matters.","As noted on the Q4 call, Cognizant's digital revenue is generated by all the work we do to help clients excel in this new economy. That work spans the development of more engaging customer experiences, automated core business processes, and modern secure technology systems. It's because we care about the success of our customers and can speed their movement from doing digital to being digital that we realigned our company last year into three practice areas.","At the point where clients engage their customers, partners, and employees, we work with them to build compelling experiences across channels and devices to create new value, revenue, and growth. That's what Cognizant's digital business does. To make their operating models more efficient and agile, we help elevate their operational core with processes that apply automation, managed services, and systems of intelligence. That's the focus of Cognizant's digital operations. And for their core infrastructure and technology, we simplify and modernize their legacy IT systems and implement a flexible backbone to deliver auto-scaling infrastructure, real-time data management, and adaptive security. And that's the role of Cognizant Digital Systems and Technology.","Our cohesive approach extends from personalized customer interactions all the way through the IT infrastructure. Our three practices work closely with our industry verticals, which is the way we go to market, as well as with our geography and Cognizant business consulting to create industry-tailored solutions. By aligning all of our offerings within these practice areas, we've been able to open up significant new growth opportunities. Our aim is for clients to become fully technology-enabled in every aspect of their businesses.","But what does that entail, and how do clients benefit? Cognizant has been working with a multinational insurance and financial services firm to overcome its process, organizational, and technology challenges and speed its journey towards digital. Because the firm lacked uniform processes and relied heavily on manual intervention, its insurance policies were prone to errors, and new products could take up to two months to roll out. Few of its agents had adopted advanced technology, and therefore few could take a 360-degree view of their customers' needs. There were no end-to-end digital channels for selling and issuing policies, and rigid back-end systems couldn't keep up with their expanding roster of customers whose own needs were growing. By the way, this example of legacy IT constraining the business is one we often see amongst our clients.","In a three-phase engagement, Cognizant digitized the firm's enterprise applications relating to the administration of general and life insurance policies, enabling straight-through processing. Then we helped the firm use its new enterprise foundation to build its own customized user interfaces. And now in the third phase, we're providing all their partner channels and entities with digitized customer interaction platforms that integrate the firm's data, processes, and services.","As a result, this client's new product rollout cycle has been reduced by 35% to 50%. And with its new 360-degree view of customers, the firm can design products for diverse customer segments, upsell products, and enhance its overall product marketing. This is an example of how two of our practices, Digital Business and Digital Systems and Technology, come together to transform a client's business.","On our last call, we expressed our commitment to accelerate our shift to digital services and solutions. Here are some signs of our continued strong momentum. Building on our acquisition of companies such as Idea Couture, Mirabeau, and Adaptra, we acquired Brilliant Service in Q1 to strengthen our digital capabilities in Japan. Brilliant Service provides end-to-end Android and iOS applications, embedded software, and user experience design to major corporations in Japan.","We continued the momentum of our client innovation spaces, opening two more of these collaboratories, one in Amsterdam and another in Melbourne. And in Barcelona, we opened the Salesforce Solutions Focus Lab that combines a supply center and a delivery center.","In addition, to ensure that our teams remain at the vanguard of mastering advanced technologies, we're stepping up investments in professional training. This year our goal is to develop more than 10,000 engineers and architects plus another 10,000 across niche areas of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cognitive computing. Given the tens of thousands of employees already skilled in these areas, we expect to have about 100,000 employees by the end of this year with a depth of knowledge and skills that will enable them to pursue the most specialized areas of digital. All of these initiatives are needed because as client interest in becoming technology-enabled across their businesses grow, we're engaging with an increasing number of larger, more complex digital-at-scale projects.","Our progress is receiving broad validation from industry analysts. We remain a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for providers of managed workplace services. IDC named us a leader in IoT consulting and systems integration. Everest Group calls Cognizant a leader and star performer in digital services, and HfS Research placed us in the Winner's Circle for digital marketing operations.","Overall, our digital-related revenues are growing well above company average. We continue to pursue tuck-in acquisitions to expand our intellectual capital, domain expertise, global reach, and our platform and technology capabilities. Of course, we maintain our focus on strategic clients across our core industries. Raj will provide a bit more color on how we're accelerating our shift.","It's exciting to think about the scale of the opportunity ahead as technology embeds itself into almost everything, as tens of billions of devices join the Internet, and as the amount of digital information reaches an expected 35 trillion gigabytes by 2020.","Cognizant's Center for the Future of Work studied 2,000 companies across six industries globally to determine what percent of their overall revenue is driven by digital transformation. In 2015 it was nearly 5%, but by 2018 we expect this technology to influence more than 11% of all revenues these companies generate, or more than $2 trillion. There's a virtuous cycle at work. The more clients invest in new technologies, the greater the return, and the more they want to invest. We see the pervasive build-out of advanced technologies significantly expanding our market opportunity.","Now I'd like to cover two central elements of our plan, which are to improve margins and execute an enhanced shareholder capital return program. We moved quickly to implement our capital return program. In March we launched a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program that is ongoing, and today we announced the company's first quarterly cash dividend.","On the margin front, we have a number of operational efficiency and cost reduction work streams underway. In addition, our board has shifted management compensation to more closely reflect the balance we're striking between revenue and profit growth. The board and the company leaders, including me, are intensively focused on executing both these plan elements. Karen will provide more detail within her remarks.","We also continue to refresh our board, and in March we announced the appointment of two new directors who will replace two retiring directors. I want to take this opportunity to welcome two independent directors who joined the Cognizant board on April 1, Betsy Atkins and John Dineen. Betsy is the CEO of venture capital firm Baja Corporation and an entrepreneur who has cofounded and led enterprise technology companies. John brings extensive leadership and operational experience from his 28 years in senior roles with GE, most recently as the CEO of GE Health Care. We look forward to benefiting from their expertise on our board.","I'd also like to thank Tom Wendel and Lakshmi Narayanan, who will not be standing for reelection at our upcoming annual meeting, for their many years of service to the company.","To wrap up, being digital is the defining challenge for today's C-suite and the enterprises they lead. Digital touches every part of every company strategy and operations, and therefore it touches every part of our business. We're committed to accelerating the shift to digital to create value for both our clients and our shareholders, and we're committed to executing our plan on margin improvement and capital allocation.","And now over to Raj, who will discuss first quarter performance in greater detail, followed by Karen, who will cover our financial results. Raj?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thanks, Frank. Building on Frank's discussion, I'll outline our progress in executing the shift to digital. And then I'll review our industry verticals, focusing on our financial performance and how we're helping our clients manage through their challenges.","To speed our progress, we have many initiatives underway. Here are the top three. First, we're expanding our solutions portfolio. To do so, we're deploying repeatable industry-tailored solutions faster across our three practice areas, and we're further developing offerings through selected partnerships and acquisitions.","Second, we're deepening and broadening our digital skills under the guidance of chief digital officers in each of our industry and regional business units. Our CDOs oversee the building of domain-based solutions, and they ensure that our teams, which focus on our strategic clients, have the skills they need. As a result, our teams are broadening Cognizant's reach and deepening our relationships, particularly with decision-makers who are outside the clients' CIO organizations.","Third, we're enhancing our digital engagement with clients. For example, at our Newark laboratory, co-innovation centers in Amsterdam and Melbourne, our strategists, designers, data scientists, human science, and cyber security experts work with clients and partners to design, prototype, build, and run new customer experience and business processes. During the first quarter, about 50 clients visited our innovation centers.","Today in every industry, our clients face common challenges. They must strike a balance between optimizing cost and investing in innovation. We help them to do both at the same time on their journey to implement digital at scale. Through our engagement, clients are able to drive profitable growth by enhancing their customers' experience, speeding products to market, and deploying new business models.","I want to turn now to our financial performance in our industry verticals and provide examples of our customer engagements. Let's start with Banking and Financial Services, which consists of our banking, capital markets, insurance, and transaction processing clients.","First quarter revenues were up 7% year over year. Consider the work our Digital Systems and Technology practice is doing with ABN AMRO Clearing. We are cloud-enabling their global IT infrastructure and laying the foundation for digital transformation. Cognizant will modernize their existing global technology infrastructure and transform their IT operating model across their core trading system, reporting systems, and other business services.","We'll also provide hybrid cloud security network management and end-user services. Doing so will enable ABN AMRO Clearing to increase their operational resilience and application availability. They'll able to operate with greater speed and agility to better manage market volatility, and they'll lower their capital investment and operating cost. This is what we mean by driving digital at scale.","For insurance clients, our Digital Operations team is able to rationalize their life and annuity platforms, supporting policy issue, building collections and claims. With these integrated platforms, clients can manage their legacy products more efficiently while providing a foundation on which to build more customer-centric digital capabilities.","Turning to healthcare, this segment consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients. First quarter revenues were up 9.7% year over year. To help clients balance cost and investment, we're developing solutions that address cost, access, and quality of care. These solutions will improve membership engagement and combine clinical and claims data through advanced population healthcare management initiatives. Client interest in our healthcare platforms, including TriZetto, continues to grow.","Take the work our Digital Operations practice is doing with LifeBridge Health, based in Maryland. We're working to transform communications across their network and drive stronger relationships among physicians, patients, and regional health facilities. LifeBridge's communication network is built on our cloud-based Onvida software-as-a-service platform. Our platform combines customizable software with 24x7 phone and online access to clinical specialists. As a result, patients have self-service access to consultations and information to manage their healthcare, and doctors can receive near real-time customized communication about their patients. This means better care coordination and better transition of care.","To deal with the launch of new projects and rising pricing pressures on existing products, our life science clients know they must enhance their patient, provider, and payer engagements. In response, these clients are increasingly interested in patient engagement, clinical analytics, investigator collaboration, new commercial models, and customer service transformation.","Here's a case in point. A large U.S.-based pharmaceutical and medical device company is using our MedVantage platform to transform their field services, quality, and complaints processes. Our cloud-based platform, which is part of digital operations, will help them drive higher levels of agility and productivity and improve customer experience.","Turning to retail and manufacturing, this segment grew to 16.4% year over year. We've renamed this segment Products and Resources to more clearly convey the industries we serve here, retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality, manufacturing and logistics, and energy and utilities. These clients are managing through a challenging retail and consumer business environment. And so they're giving priority to optimizing costs, transforming their supply chain, and building omni-channel customer experience solutions. We've responded with an industry-specific suite of offerings that leverage automation, big data, and cloud. Our clients in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utilities continue to see solid growth. They're on a path of scaling their digital transformation by leveraging connected products and process reinvention.","Let's look at what our Digital Systems and Technology practice is doing for Cargill, a global provider of food, agricultural, and industrial products. As part of a multiyear agreement, we will migrate Cargill's application to the cloud to modernize, transform, and run their global IT applications. We'll be applying a lean, agile delivery model that will enable Cargill to achieve best-in-class operational excellence while enhancing their go-to-market capabilities.","From this quarter forward, we will refer to this segment we formerly called Other as Communications, Media and Technology. This segment grew 16.5% year over year. The name change signals our progress in developing our business in these industries and our increasing focus given their growth potential. This practice services many of our Silicon Valley digital leaders, including four of the top five born-digital platform firms.","Now let's take a quick look at performance by geography. North America grew 10.6% year over year. Europe was up 6.5% over last year after a 7.4% negative currency impact. Integrating multiservice solutions and our expansion through targeted acquisitions contributed to our success in Europe. For example, clients view our recent acquisition of Mirabeau, a specialist in developing digital marketing and engaging customer experiences, as another hallmark of Cognizant's differentiated value in the marketplace. To close out our geographic discussion, we have continued strong growth in the rest of the world, which was up 25.6% year over year.","As I wrap up, I want to offer a quick update on a topic I discussed on our last call. Given our attention to the H-1B visa program, we want you to know that we're evolving our workforce and delivery in the United States. Cognizant hired 4,000 U.S. citizens and residents in 2016. In 2017 and beyond, we expect to significantly ramp up our U.S.-based workforce by hiring experienced professionals in the open market and by making more use of university, veteran, and related programs. We are shifting our workforce largely in response to clients' increasing need for co-innovation and collocation.","While we still seek visas for highly specialized and skilled talent, we're reducing our dependence on these visas. In fact, during the most recent filing period on April 1, we applied for less than half the number of visas we sought last year and we expect to further reduce our need for these visas going forward.","As part of our shift, we continue to expand our U.S. delivery centers. A good example is our Tampa delivery center, where we employ over 1,000 technology and business professionals. They provide business process services, application services, and testing for financial services and healthcare clients. At our center, we're employing a broad skill mix that includes longtime local residents as well as veterans and recruits from local colleges.","At similar delivery centers around the country, we've expanded our retraining programs and are working with local institutions to implement special curriculums that will help us meet growing client needs. Today we have over 20 U.S. delivery centers, and we continue to expand this footprint.","To sum up, we are executing the shift to digital at scale by helping our clients simultaneously optimize their costs as they invest in the future. And we are shifting our workforce rapidly in the U.S., with more U.S. jobs and U.S. delivery centers.","Now I'll turn over the call to Karen to discuss our financial performance","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. The business got off to a solid start in Q1, which positions us well to achieve our full-year guidance. First quarter revenue of $3.55 billion was at the high end of our guidance range and represented a year-over-year increase of 10.7%. We had a negative currency headwind, which impacted year-over-year revenue growth by $35 million or 110 basis points.","Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and realignment charges, was 18.9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.84.","Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.2%. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter is lower than our previous guidance, as we recorded certain income tax benefits that were previously unrecognized in our consolidated financial statements. The timing of this adjustment was primarily driven by the lapse of the statute of limitations.","As Frank outlined in his comments, we are committed to a comprehensive return of capital program. In March we launched a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, program. Today we declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on May 22, 2017. This dividend will be payable on May 31, 2017.","Now let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and Technology Services and Outsourcing Services represented 57.8% and 42.2% of revenue respectively for the quarter. Consulting and Technology Services grew 10.6% year over year, driven by strong performance in Cognizant Business Consulting and an increased demand for digital solutions. Outsourcing Services revenue grew 10.9% from Q1 a year ago.","During the first quarter, 38% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. We continue to make progress over the long term towards changing the mix of our business towards more fixed-price and\/or more managed services arrangements.","We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 336.","We are strongly committed to our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019. To ensure we achieve this target, we have engaged outside advisors and have a number of work streams underway to focus on cost and operational efficiency, increasing utilization, optimizing our pyramid structure, improving our talent supply chain to better align resources with client demand, simplifying our business unit overhead, and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively.","Within the corporate functions, we are focused on a number of areas, including but not limited to span of control, automation, and vendor consolidation. Additionally, our Board of Directors has organized and chartered our recently announced Financial Policy Committee. And as Frank and Raj mentioned, we are accelerating our shift to high-value digital transformation work while continuing to reassess less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace.","In Q1, we incurred approximately $11 million of charges related to our realignment program, including advisory fees and severance costs. During the remainder of 2017, we expect to incur additional costs related to severance, including those associated with our recently initiated voluntary separation program, lease terminations, and other facility-related shutdown costs and advisory fees. These actions will ultimately improve our cost structure and operating margins while allowing us to continue to invest in the business for growth. We expect to show gradual improvement in our margins throughout 2017 as these efforts take hold.","We have already started driving utilization higher by slowing hiring and improving resource alignment to better meet client demand. As evidence of this, we added just 1,000 net new hires in the quarter. While we will carefully manage head count and our cost structure, it is important that we continue to hire and invest in critical skills to support our evolving digital capabilities.","Annualized attrition of 14.7% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was roughly in line with the year-ago period.","Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 74%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was 79%, and onsite utilization was 91% during the quarter. We would expect these ratios to improve gradually over this year, as many of the actions we took in Q1 begin to accrue in Q2 and the remainder of the year.","Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was down by $1.2 billion from the quarter ending December 31 and $369 million from the year-ago period, reflecting the use of cash on hand to primarily fund the ASR.","Receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 72 days, flat with last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $395 million, up from $349 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 57% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables.","Our outstanding debt balance was $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, which included a $350 million outstanding balance on our revolver.","Turning to cash flow, in response to investor requests, beginning with this quarter's release, we have included a condensed cash flow statement. Operating activities generated $277 million in the quarter and we invested $66 million in CapEx, resulting in $211 million of free cash in the quarter. The U.S. portion is roughly one-third of our total free cash flow.","As previously mentioned, as part of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders, we launched a $1.5 billion ASR in March. At that time, we received and retired 21.5 million shares, a portion of the total expected shares to be repurchased under the ASR. We expect to complete the transaction during or prior to the third quarter of 2017, at which time the total number of shares to be delivered will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price during this period. Our diluted share count decreased to 607 million shares for the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and for the full year 2017. For the full year 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $14.56 billion to $14.84 billion, which represents growth of 8% to 10%. Our guidance is based on current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.","For the second quarter of 2017, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.63 billion to $3.68 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be at least 19.4% during Q2 and at least 19.5% for the full year 2017, as the benefits of our realignment program begin to accrue.","For the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.89. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 591 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $3.64. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 595 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 23%. This guidance also includes the impact of the $1.5 billion ASR, and we will provide additional details on the full share count impact once the purchase has been completed.","Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, and realignment charges. For the full year, it also excludes the recognition of the Q1 income tax benefit that was previously unrecognized. Our guidance does not account for any potential impacts from events like changes to immigration and tax policies.","In summary, we had a strong start to 2017, and we expect to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth this year along with a substantial capital return to shareholders.","Operator, now I'll turn it back over to you for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys, congrats on the strong quarter. Just looking over at 2Q revenue guidance, that range seems to be a little bit wider than usual. I was just curious. Is that some different demand outcomes from clients that's causing that wide a range? Because I think historically we've seen more of a pickup between 1Q sequential and 2Q growth rates.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Sure, Bryan. This is Karen, good morning. So Q2 revenue, the range is actually about the same as the ranges we've been providing in recent quarters and in Q1. It's about a $50 million range between the low and the high end of the range.","One thing that we should point out that was not in the prepared remarks is this year is a little unusual with the calendar, so Q2 actually has less billing days than Q1, which is the first time in my history with the company that that's happened. And it's partially just because of the way the holidays and weekends line up this quarter. So that's why a little bit the Q2 seasonality doesn't seem quite as strong as it would in prior years.","But we're very comfortable. The demand environment, as we were talking about in our prepared remarks and obviously I'm sure we'll have more conversation over the next few minutes, the demand environment continues to be solid. We haven't seen any change in that as we went into Q2. It's primarily just a matter of the number of bill days.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, and then a quick follow up, maybe Francisco. Any changes in clients' appetite to use Cognizant services due to some of the stuff going around on immigration reform? Has anybody pulled back or looked to be more hesitant than usual? Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Good morning, Bryan. I would say specifically related to immigration, we really have not seen any slowdown or impact on client demand. And overall, we were pleased with Q1 at the top end of our range. And so I think that there wasn't any impact obviously in Q1, and we haven't seen anything that concerns us going forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, nice start to the year here. I'll ask about the healthcare outlook. Just a lot of noise there obviously, just curious about the progress or maybe movement in the BPaaS pipeline. Are you seeing any pent-up demand at payer clients? Maybe anything else you can give us on the outlook in healthcare this year would be great. Thanks.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hi, this is Raj here. Look, I think we're pleased with the start of healthcare this year. Obviously, as you know, Q1 has a lot of seasonality in there with the TriZetto business being a software business, and in addition to that our life sciences business, which has a lot of discretionary spend and budget flush that happens in Q4. So overall, we're pleased with the start of healthcare.","I think obviously there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of what happens with proposed legislation around the Affordable Care Act. But we are seeing some stability, especially given that some of the large M&A deals that were out there, we're starting to see some. Given that those are not moving forward, we're starting to see some pent-up demand, which is a good start for us as well too.","I think look, BPaaS in terms of our platforms, we continue to see a lot of traction, a lot of client interest around our solutions, and along with that, a lot of initiatives around digital, especially around customer engagement and analytics, security, and cloud-related services.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, congrats. Does TriZetto, could you remind us if TriZetto has a license fee impact on the model and what quarter it might hit, or is it all spread over the life of whatever the engagement is? Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Good morning, Ed. This is Karen. So as you know, obviously when we brought TriZetto, they were very focused on software sales and had tremendous seasonality in their business, with Q4 being their strongest quarter historically. That still continues to be true. But over time, obviously, one of the things we've been trying to move them towards is more of an annuity-based structure. So in Q1 of this year, the sequential decline in TriZetto revenue was about $20 million from Q4 to Q1. That's down from last year, where it was over $25 million sequential impact from Q4 to Q1. So we're slowly starting to move them into much more of an annuity-based structure so that over time we would have less of that lumpiness.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe dive a little bit more into the immigration comments you touched on earlier. Can you maybe give us any kind of quantification around absolute numbers of visas you applied for either last year or this year, just to give us a sense about what the half, the 50% mark implies? And maybe just give us a sense about what your plans are in terms of campus recruiting, both in India and the U.S., over the next year, and how you think about the head count additions for the rest of the year relative to some of the rationalization efforts you talked about, part of the restructuring.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Okay, why don't I \u2013 Jim, this is Frank. I'll take some of that and then I'll ask Karen to cover some parts of it. We don't disclose numbers around our use of visas for competitive reasons. But I think, as Raj said in the prepared comments, this year we filed for half the number of H-1s that we had filed last year. We wanted to put that out there just to give you a sense that we are continuing to aggressively shift the model, to continue to give you a trend line that says as the business shifts more toward digital, as our clients \u2013 as the demand from clients is more about collocation and co-innovation because that's the kind of work that digital demands, that we're shifting the model accordingly.","As a U.S. company, we're committed to hiring and reskilling employees, not just in the U.S., but really in all the markets around the world where we operate. Specific to the U.S., we're hiring more here. We've got what we think are very innovative training programs with colleges to help train the next generation of technology workers. As Raj said, we're expanding the number of our U.S.-based centers. He gave you an example of the Tampa center and some color around that one. Like Tampa, we have 20 other centers like that already around the U.S. that we will continue to build and grow and expand our footprint in. And let me ask Karen to cover head count and our thinking around head count as we look through the rest of the year","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yes, sure. Thanks, Frank. So, Jim, obviously we haven't and will not provide any head count guidance. But I think at a macro level, it's safe to assume that utilization will go up throughout the year. We will certainly continue to hire as we continue to drive forward with the change in the skills mix. So as you saw in Q1, we added about a net of 1,000 people. That will move up and down throughout the year as we bring on some of these new skills and continue to also retrain our workforce, as Frank talked about.","In terms of the balance between campus and lateral hiring, that will continue to shift from quarter to quarter. As you know, we have a very robust campus hiring program in India. That continues. In the U.S., we continue to expand our campus hiring programs, and that's everything from working with local community colleges and retraining and skilling programs, all the way up through the big MBA and Master's programs. And then similarly in Europe, we also do a lot of campus recruiting there. So we've got very robust campus programs that we've put in place over the last few years, and continue to look to those as ways of expanding our local presence onsite.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could start by maybe touching on gross margin a little bit. It seems as though on the gross margin side, it was a little bit softer in the quarter. So I was just wondering what in terms of business mix, or maybe we're not accounting for charges correctly as we're backing them out, might be included in that number. And then I have a quick follow up.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hi, Brian. This is Karen. So it was a little hard to hear you, but I think you were asking about gross margin for the quarter.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So gross margin, as we've talked about from time to time, will move up and down. Our focus is always on non-GAAP operating margin. But what you saw putting pressure on gross margin, we saw this last year as well, is in 2016 we hired a lot of people, and frankly, head count grew much faster than revenue. That already did start to subside, at least on a sequential basis, this quarter and will continue to subside this year and will bring those two back more in line. And certainly head count growth I would expect to grow actually slower than revenue this year. So it was really the lower utilization that was putting pressure on gross margin, but as I said, that will start to reverse itself as we get through the rest of the year.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And on operational efficiency initiatives, maybe if you can offer a little bit of color in terms of what you made progress with in the first quarter and how we should anticipate ongoing initiatives to trend through the remainder of the year?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So I think really the vast majority of the initiatives are just starting now, so I would say the January and February timeframe was a lot of planning. We want to be very thoughtful. It is most critical that we continue to invest for growth and the shift to digital that we're seeing in the business. So that's our \u2013 first and foremost, we need to make sure we protect that while at the same time, obviously, we're looking for opportunities to enhance our cost structure and further optimize our cost structure.","So there were some small actions in Q1. As you saw, there was about $11 million of realignment cost that was a combination of advisory fees to help us prepare for this, as well as some severance. But most of the actions will begin here or have begun already in Q2. We just launched earlier this week a voluntary separation package. That program will go through the end of Q2, so we'll start to see the benefits of that as we get into Q3.","Similarly, as we're looking at real estate and other opportunities and vendor consolidation and so forth, the vast majority of those benefits we'll start to see towards the end of Q2, but most of that will really start to kick in as we get into the back half of this year, which will then hopefully set us up very well as we move into next year and we start to see the full-year benefits of those.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Hi, Frank. Hi, Raj. Hi, Karen. So the performance with regards to revenues and EPS was in line with our expectations, but the gross margin decline was a bit sharper than I expected. Can you break down the decline in terms of the impact from revenue mix versus the investments you're making or miscellaneous factors? What I'm trying to get to is how much of the impact is likely to be ongoing versus you get a recovery as you proceed through the year.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Ashwin, this is Karen. I'll take that. I think similar to the answer to Brian's question, this is really about utilization in Q1. As the business mix continues to take hold, digital becomes a bigger piece of the business. We are actually seeing that business continue to be margin accretive. And we expect that to continue, and that is certainly a big piece of what will help drive our margin profile in the outer years. But in the short term, because of all the hiring we did last year and the fact that we had such a big drop in utilization year over year as we went through last year, that's really what's putting the pressure on gross margin. And as I said, we would expect that to start to reverse as the year goes on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Please go ahead with your question.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, thank you. Karen, is there a way to think about how your cost base is changing? What I mean by that is you're requesting or applying for fewer visas, but you're adding more onshore labor, so your costs \u2013 your general costs are increasing per head count. Is there a way to think about how that is unfolding for the year? In other words, are your costs per head count going up by 5% or 10% or not really changing? I know some of your strategic initiatives are designed to alleviate that pressure. But is there any way to quantify as you're growing your onshore head count how that's changing your cost base?","And the second part of the question is, how much more can you move mix to be offshore? We've talked to some customers, and they seem more willing to move with the H1B1 \u2013 H1 issues that are arising. It seems like clients are more willing to let work move offshore. But how much more do you think room is there to move work offshore to mitigate some of the impact of what is generally I think higher cost wages that you have to pay for your onshore labor? Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Sure. So, Keith, I'll start and I think I'll let Frank add some color as well. In terms of the onsite costs, this is interesting. On a like-on-like basis, if we're hiring the same skills with a local worker versus somebody who comes over on a visa, there really isn't significant difference in the cost structure by the time you factor in the cost of the wages, the relocation, et cetera, versus the compensation that we're paying. And obviously, we have to keep in mind that when you're using the H-1B program, there are prevailing wage structures that set the salaries that we are going to pay to our people. So essentially, those salaries are set at market wage. So we're not seeing any significant difference as you shift the workforce. The biggest challenge is finding the right talent, and that has always been the concern and the challenge. So as long as you can find the right skill set, the cost structure is not significantly different.","In terms of the ability to move work offshore and the willingness, I think it's the same issue. If clients can find the talent here in the U.S. or in Europe as it may apply, then I think certainly people would avail of that. But when the talent is not available, people are certainly willing to look at moving work offshore. And I will ask Frank, he may have color to add to that as well.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","I think Karen has covered it well. I have very little color to add. All I would say is that on the issue of moving more work offshore, I think in general you have to look at that by line of service. I think that generally speaking, we're pretty optimized by line of service. But on some of the older lines of service, application maintenance, quality assurance, and so on, there may be some incremental opportunity to optimize the mix there. That's driven by maturity of those service offerings, more comfort that clients have with executing in a global delivery model, and to some extent driven by advances in technology, better communications technology, better collaboration and interaction technologies. I don't think that's a significant move.","And to some extent, as we look at the portfolio overall, that move is somewhat at the portfolio level offset by the digital, the new digital work that requires more collocation, co-innovation closer to the client. At a portfolio level, I'm not sure you'd see significant shifts one way or the other.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Frank, maybe this one's for you, I imagine this transition that your business is undergoing right now is one of the biggest challenges you've had in the 20-plus years you've been there. Can you just talk about what are the most difficult aspects in your view of the transition both to digital on the revenue side as well as the margin expansion shift on the cost side of things and how you're addressing those?","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Lisa, I would say while this is a transition that we're taking the company through, I think the company \u2013 and I give the team a lot of credit. I'll take a minute here to recognize everybody on the Cognizant leadership team and all of the people around the world who have gotten behind making this transition happen. It's not dissimilar to many other transitions that we've managed through in the past. We lived through the financial crisis and came out stronger at the other end when close to 50% of our revenue back then came from the financial services industry. We made the shift from year 2000 to the Internet and e-business and so on and so forth. The company is a little bit bigger today than it was back then, so the magnitude of what we're doing is a little bit bigger, but I would say the elements are similar.","The reality is that we have a very, very strong market position that comes from incredibly strong client relationships that go back many years. We understand our clients. We understand their businesses. We understand their technology environments. And our advantage in digital comes from the fact that clients are moving into this phase where they are doing digital at scale, which means they're transforming their business models, they're transforming their operating models, and they're transforming their technology models, all of these in tandem simultaneously. That is Cognizant's advantage, that we have this capability to be able to work with them to transform their business model, their operating model, and their technology model through that in tandem in one strong, solid integrated fashion. So we've got a strong value proposition. We've got a strong \u2013 in the marketplace.","Now in terms of the changes, the core capabilities that we have, our consulting teams, our strong industry domain expertise, those are relevant. We are going through a large process, as I said in my prepared remarks, of re-creating and reskilling the teams. That's mostly related to new digital technologies. We're doing that at scale, so that's a heavy lift given the number of people that we need to take through that. But we've got a great workforce, a workforce that's committed to continuous learning. And so it's a question of making that happen as opposed to desire or will to have that happen. So I think we're taking the company through that.","Look, I think in terms of the margin expansion program, the company is committed to this. We're looking at it as an opportunity to simplify the business, frankly. We've had 20-plus years of rapid growth. The company was probably a little bit more complicated internally than it needed to be in some areas. This is an opportunity for us to simplify. It's an opportunity for us to get better. It's an opportunity for us to be more efficient and more effective in how we do things, and the emphasis is on simplification. And given that, I think the team is rallying around that because they see that this is an opportunity for us to run the place better and be stronger as a result of that.","So I think we're well on our way. We feel very good. The management team is deeply committed to this plan. We see the opportunity as we shift to digital. We see the benefits of simplifying the business. And I think as Karen said, we're off to a good start in Q1, and you'll start to see the actions on the margin front in Q2.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Yes, that question will be coming from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Pacific Crest.","Arvind Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, good quarter. So when you look at these digital projects, they're certainly gaining scale, and clients value your consulting and advisory services even more so now than in prior years. Can you talk about your consulting offering and how you're looking to scale that given your onsite hiring? Particularly among the Indian players, you're certainly well positioned, but I'm sure there's more to do on building scale. And finally, how are you also leveraging your consultants on your account (56:20) management?","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Arvind, it's Frank. There were multiple parts to that question, so I'll try to address them all, so a couple of things. I would say in terms of consulting scale-up, as you know, the consulting business at Cognizant is one that we've been building for years. And so in terms of the basics of that business and the basics of scaling that business up, I think we've got a very robust mechanism in place now. We've got strong campus hiring, MBA campus hiring, both in India and in the U.S. and Europe, so we hire MBAs from the top institutions around the world. That feeds the consulting permits. So the basic mechanism of scaling that up I think is very much in place and very strong.","Having said that, as you pointed out, consulting has never been more relevant. And we continue to look to other ways to scale up our consulting group, particularly inorganically in addition to the organic things that we're doing. So you will continue to see us looking at consulting companies as part of our inorganic screen.","I would say that in terms of areas of focus, we will continue to deepen in the industries that we serve our consulting capability. We're also looking to scale up technology consulting in particular areas that relate to digital around cloud migration. You will see us scaling up. We've already done, as you know, a few acquisitions in what I think of as the front end, the business model side of digital, so experience, design, creative, human factors, all of those kinds of things which are very consultative in nature.","And then the last part of your question relates to integrating consulting more tightly in the client interface, and that's certainly something that we're doing. We've moved now increasingly to a model where, in addition to having client partners on our biggest clients, which is the historical model, we're also infusing the client interface with more dedicated, more full-time consultants from the Cognizant business consulting team. So all of that very much in the works and continues to scale up, so hopefully that addresses all the parts of your questions.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","And with that, I think we're just about out of time. So I want to end by thanking everybody again for joining us today. Thanks very much for your questions. And as always, we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions first quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. If not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you, David, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Cognizant released strong fourth quarter results that capped another year of industry-leading performance. Revenue grew 3% sequentially and 17% over the year-ago quarter to $1.95 billion. This brings full year revenue to $7.35 billion or 20% growth over 2011.","As I look back on 2012, I'm proud of our results. Our continued track record of market-leading revenue growth and stable margins fueled further reinvestment in the deepest client relationships, the most robust portfolio of services and the strongest pool of talent we've ever had. We increased the number of strategic clients by 23 to 214, at the same time, raising the results of our annual third-party customer satisfaction survey to the highest level in 4 years.","One mark of the strength of our client relationships is that we finished the year with 16 clients, each contributing more than $100 million in annual revenues, and nearly 19,000 net new associates joined our team while we maintained attrition rates that are amongst the lowest in our industry. We recorded the highest employee satisfaction survey results in our history, and we're recognized as one of the happiest places to work.","I'd now like to turn to our expected financial performance in 2013 and give you some color around the significant market opportunity we see ahead of us. For the full year 2013, we expect to deliver at least $8.6 billion of revenue, which represents full year growth of at least 17%. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected 2013 financial performance shortly.","As we look to 2013, we see a market shift that is reaching a level of importance that I'd like to share with you. For several quarters, we've been speaking to you about the secular shifts in both the economy and with technology itself. These shifts are now forcing clients to reexamine how they operate, moving from merely incremental levels of performance efficiency to building new digital business capabilities.","For years, you have come to know us as helping our clients manage their businesses better in helping them run their operations better, faster and cheaper. However, in the context of today's secular business and technology changes, our clients are turning to us for more. In short, not only do they wish to run better, they now need to run different. In order to maintain their market leadership, our clients are increasingly turning to us to conceptualize, architect and implement new and increasingly different capabilities.","With each passing quarter, our clients' dual mandate of running better and running different comes into sharper focus. As a result, we continue to deepen our client relationships by challenging status quo, driving fundamental innovation and unleashing new potential across their organizations by uniquely addressing this dual mandate from one global platform.","In looking at the industries that we serve, this is a natural evolution of demand. After all, across financial services, healthcare, life sciences, retail, manufacturing, media, information services and high technology, the combination of economic shifts and technology transformation driven by the SMAC stack of social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies is creating game-changing opportunities across the markets we serve.","These clients all continue to feel the ongoing pressure of cost containment and efficiency. However, in the past 2 years, the mandate to build new and different capabilities based on the back of SMAC technologies has continued to gain momentum. Thus, with these type of clients, the C-suite agenda is now a combination of run better and run different. It's in response to this dual mandate that we institutionalized our 3 Horizon model over a year ago. This approach has proven particularly effective to manage this demand, as Horizon 1 significantly helps clients to run better and Horizons 2 and 3 help clients to run different.","In our Horizon 2 services, with our business consulting, we saw significant progress over the course of 2012 both quantitatively in the growth of our practice, as well as qualitatively in the types of engagements we typically deliver. Similarly, with our business process outsourcing group, our vertical orientation has proven effective in helping clients transform key processes. And within our IT infrastructure practice, we saw strong growth as clients took -- as clients looked to transition away from old ways of managing their IT footprint and embracing the move towards public, private and hybrid cloud models.","In Horizon 3, we continued our progress in delivering new solutions. As we took inventory at the end of last year, we found that we were delivering SMAC-related work for more than 60% of our top 100 customers, as our clients seek new business opportunities through mobility, Big Data and the cloud. Most significantly, these Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 services remain on a steep growth trajectory that is higher than the company average.","In summary, clients continue to partner with us not only for operational improvement and efficiency and effectiveness that they have always known us to deliver, but increasingly to help them stay relevant in the marketplace by helping them reimagine their business models in the face of secular industry changes, changing demographics and new technologies. This will help ensure our clients remain relevant in the marketplace and their business models viable for the future.","Finally, the enterprising spirit needed to identify new opportunities for our clients and quickly and collaboratively implement these new capabilities is a core part of our values here at Cognizant. Cognizant is helping companies run better and run different. It's a trend that's picked up significant momentum over the course of 2012, and we anticipate continuing in 2013.","I'd like to now hand the call over to Gordon to give you some color around our operating results and Karen to review our financial results. We'll then open the floor to Q&A. Gordon?","Gordon J. Coburn","Thank you, Francisco. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance. A couple of quarters ago, we talked about the trend of large, complex and transformational multiservice line deals becoming more common. This trend continues across Horizon 1, as well as Horizon 2.","This morning, I'll spend a few minutes focusing on our Horizon 2 services and then, touch base on our industry and geographic performance. Horizon 2, on an aggregate basis, continues to grow faster than the company average. As we mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, our Horizon 2 businesses represent approximately 20% of revenue. This portfolio best illustrates how we are leveraging our client partnerships, which are infused with domain expertise and industry insight, to help clients run different through a set of solutions that move beyond traditional delivery models.","Our core BPO offerings continue to show strong growth across industries. Clients are increasingly relying on us to deliver industry-aligned process outsourcing that integrate domain expertise, new technology and innovative commercial models to unlock value. It's important to note that a key part of our BPO strategy and value proposition is to go beyond traditional business process outsourcing, which has been focused principally on helping clients run better, and move to using process outsourcing as the key enabler to help clients run their processes differently.","The Everest Group recently named us as a leader in capital markets BPO, validating our efforts to help investment banks, brokerage houses, asset and wealth managers and pension trusts evolve rapidly to the changing market and regulations, as well as changing needs of their sophisticated client base. This recognition comes on the heels of earlier recognition we received in pharmaceutical social media analytics by IDC Health Insights, as well as finance and accounting from Gartner.","We continue to invest in Horizon 2. As an example, to further augment our focus and range of services offered within healthcare BPO, in mid-fourth quarter, we closed the acquisition of MediCall, a U.S.-headquartered medical management services firm with operations in the Philippines. MediCall, which is staffed by licensed nurses, physicians and pharmacists, delivers customized medical management solutions to U.S.-based healthcare payer organizations, including group health and workers' compensation insurance companies, and helps them enhance patient satisfaction, improve clinical outcomes and reduce cost of care.","This small but strategic acquisition adds approximately 600 employees to our headcount and is expected to contribute an incremental $15 million in revenue in 2013. As part of this acquisition, our Healthcare business process services operations has been accredited by URAC. This accreditation enables us to offer specialized clinical services in the areas of group health and workers' compensation utilization management.","Last quarter, we talked about the evolution of the infrastructure services market, resulting in significant transformation of traditional delivery models. In connection with this, we also provided an update on our data center strategy within our IT infrastructure services practice. And I'm pleased to report that we are seeing clients accelerate their adoption of new variable cloud-based infrastructure environments, and we believe that the investments we have made in our infrastructure practice positions us well to capitalize on this trend in 2013.","Our infrastructure businesses have a real impact on our clients today. For example, we're doing work for a global pharmaceutical company. By leveraging Cognizant's transformational themes, including technology simplification, standardization and virtualization, this client has been able to implement a rationalized and updated infrastructure footprint that utilizes automation and self-help to further streamline delivery. These measures have simultaneously provided cost relief, while improving the effectiveness of service delivery and have further optimized technology to align with the business outcomes.","Our consulting business, which has shown dramatic growth over the last 3 years, has become a key component in our ability to develop and execute a roadmap to show clients how they can run better and run different. Consulting is truly enabling us to engage with clients in discussions around how a transforming macro environment, industry-specific secular changes and evolving demographics are creating opportunities for them to rethink their business models. Additionally, these consulting partnerships are paving the way for larger opportunities and more complex transformational deals. Our pipeline is strong, and we continue to expand our portfolio of consulting capabilities and client relationships.","As an example, we're assisting a consumer goods client on a complete redesign of their supply chain strategy. The program includes assessing best practice compliance, benchmarking best-of-breed competitors, conducting capability and process maturity assessments and understanding time-to-market demands for retail customers. The outcome of the program was identification of reengineered customer fulfillment capabilities, reassessment of inventory requirements and the definition of new business capabilities to reduce time to market. This client has now committed to the next phase of the program with Cognizant around detailed business process definition and software selection.","Looking at our performance from an industry standpoint. In Q4, financial services grew 3.4% sequentially and almost 20% year-over-year. Growth was stronger than anticipated, particularly within banking, both with our larger and midsized clients. Although regulatory work is showing an uptick, it is not necessarily resulting in an increase in overall IT spending. The costs -- the focus on cost optimization remains strong, and there is continued push for productivity benefits.","Insurance remains strong both in terms of revenue growth, as well as mix of services. This is a notable focus -- there is a notable focus on improving customer experience and therefore, a continued demand for customer-facing solutions that leverage our CRM capability. There remains a strong interest in managed services in both existing and new clients, particularly outcome-based business partnership models.","Healthcare, which includes our payer and pharmaceutical clients, as well as others in the healthcare ecosystem, grew 3.5% sequentially and about 10% year-over-year. Breaking down Healthcare into its 2 major components, growth was broad-based across our pharmaceutical clients based on a modest increase in discretionary spend. This is a pattern that we have seen in the past. Spend remains conservative in the first half and accelerates in the back half of the year.","We also saw a focus on short-term analytics and consulting projects that will help clients set the context for 2013 strategy. The industry continues to go through significant transformation due to a large number of drugs coming off patent. From a payer perspective, the political climate did create some uncertainty as it relates to healthcare reform and its implications on budgets. However, as clients refine their plans for secular changes to their business, we did see an increase in consulting assignments focused on transforming business models and IT strategy within the segment.","Retail\/manufacturers group grew 3.1% sequentially and about 28% year-over-year. Q4 is traditionally a slow quarter for this industry segment due to IT lockdowns around the holiday shopping period, and the quarter played out as we anticipated. That said, interesting trends are emerging within this segment as clients look to partner with us on their transformation journey. For example, within retail, investment in e-commerce is gathering a lot of momentum.","The trend towards digital marketing is making the chief marketing officer an increasingly important IT user and stakeholder, and they are turning to Cognizant to help them enable their vision. For example, we're helping a leading national retailer deliver a unique and consistent brand identity and experience to customers across all channels, including stores, online, mobile, social and through an e-commerce initiative while also simultaneously improving operational efficiencies and time to market.","Moving to our performance by geography. In general, demand patterns played out as we anticipated in North America and the rest of the world. Europe had a good quarter. It appears that the worst of the economic instability in the region is over. However, it is clear to us that long-term structural challenges remain in the business environment. We believe that these long-term challenges will serve as a catalyst for existing and new clients to look to Cognizant to help them transform their operations and technology to run better and run different. And we are already beginning to see this trend. Of note is our expanded partnership with Rabobank, for whom we will deliver a portfolio of application development, maintenance and testing services by leveraging our consulting capabilities and our proven financial industry expertise.","We continue to focus heavily on building out our front-end capability in Europe and strengthening our local presence. We recently announced our intent to acquire 6 companies of the C1 Group, an independent consulting and IT services firm based in Hamburg, Germany, which, together, provide enterprise application services and high-end testing services to clients in 3 major industry segments: manufacturing and logistics, energy and utilities and financial services.","Under the agreement, about 500 professionals in Germany and Switzerland are expected to join Cognizant. The combination of these acquired companies with Cognizant will help our clients in Europe address the dual mandate of running their businesses better by leveraging Cognizant's global capabilities and scale to drive cost and operational efficiencies, as well as running their businesses differently through intimate client -- local client relationships infused with innovation and business transformation.","We continue to receive recognition for investments already made in Europe. KPMG's Outsourcing 2012 study of service provider performance across Europe ranks Cognizant as #1 in general satisfaction and relationship management, both strategic and operational, with scores significantly higher than industry average. Although we are optimistic for our prospects in Europe over the coming years, the trajectory will be lumpy as individual clients move from planning to action.","I'll now hand over the call to Karen to comment on our financial performance and guidance.","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning to everyone. As detailed in our press release, our fourth quarter revenue grew 3% sequentially and 17.1% over last year to $1.948 billion, ahead of our guidance of $1.94 billion from last quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 19.7%, within our target range of 19% to 20%, while our GAAP operating margin was 18.3% for the quarter. Overall, 2012 was a strong year for us. We grew by 20% year-on-year while maintaining stable margins and a healthy balance sheet.","Consulting and technology services, formerly known as application development, represented 50.4% of revenue. And outsourcing services, formerly known as application management, was 49.6% for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 15.2% year-over-year and 1.5% sequentially. Outsourcing services grew 19.1% year-over-year and 4.6% sequentially.","For the full year, consulting and technology services represented 51.1% of revenue and grew 20.4%, while outsourcing services represented 48.9% of revenue and grew 19.6%. 34.2% of our revenue came from fixed-priced contracts during the fourth quarter. For the full year 2012, 33.1% of revenues came from fixed-priced contracts, up from 31.7% in 2011, reflecting further acceptance of the managed services model of engagement by our clients.","As expected, on a sequential basis, our pricing was stable during the fourth quarter. We closed the quarter with 821 active customers, and the number of accounts which we consider to be strategic increased by 6. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 214. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic customers embracing a wider range of Cognizant services at an earlier stage in the relationship.","Our diluted share count for the quarter was 303.8 million shares, an increase of approximately 645,000 shares from Q3. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares at an average price of $65.17, for a total cost of approximately $26 million. As of December 31, 13.7 million shares have been repurchased at a cost of $866.4 million under the current share repurchase authorization of $1 billion.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated approximately $362 million of cash. Financing activities generated approximately $24 million of cash. This was comprised of net proceeds of $50 million related to option exercises and related tax benefits, as well as our employee stock purchase program, partially offset by expenditures of $26 million towards our share repurchase program.","We spent approximately $126 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. Our full year capital expenditures for 2012 were approximately $334 million. This was below our original expectation of $370 million, primarily due to the timing of some of our construction projects. During 2013, we expect our capital expenditures to total approximately $400 million.","Based on our $1.53 billion receivable balance on December 31, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 72 days, down by almost 5 days from the third quarter and down by 1 day from 73 days in the fourth quarter of last year. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $183 million, down from $214 million at the end of Q3. Approximately 63% of the Q4 unbilled balance was billed in January.","Net headcount increased by over 6,300 people during the quarter. 39% of gross additions for the quarter were direct college hires, while 61% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. We ended the quarter with over 156,700 employees globally, of which 146,300 were service delivery staff. During 2012, we added approximately 19,000 net new employees worldwide.","Attrition in the fourth quarter was 10.7%, lower than our Q3 attrition of 13%. As we have discussed in the past, there is no consistent methodology in the industry to report attrition. We have historically reported attrition by annualizing the turnover which occurred within the quarter, including both voluntary and involuntary. Our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO and employees in our training program. Utilization decreased slightly on a sequential basis during Q4. Offshore utilization was approximately 68%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who were in our training program was approximately 74%, and on-site utilization was down slightly to 93% during the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our growth expectations for the first quarter of 2013, as well as the full year. For the first quarter of 2013, we are projecting revenue of at least $2 billion. For the full year 2013, we expect to continue delivering industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we are projecting revenue of at least $8.6 billion. This represents full year growth of at least 17%. Our revenue guidance includes $90 million of expected revenue from the recently closed MediCall acquisition and the C1 Group acquisition, which we anticipate will close late in Q1, but excludes the impact of any further acquisitions that may be closed during the course of the year.","From 2013, we are prospectively expanding the definition of our non-GAAP operating margin and EPS. We will exclude amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition-related charges in addition to stock-based compensation when calculating non-GAAP operating margin and EPS. We will focus primarily on non-GAAP numbers when discussing results. We believe that the expanded non-GAAP definition will provide consistency with the financial statements used for internal management reporting and budgeting, thus providing enhanced transparency into the operational results of the company.","Second, this change will provide greater flexibility for us to ensure that the objectives and resulting incentives for key employees of acquired companies are designed to maximize the long-term success of future acquisitions. Finally, this expanded definition is consistent with many of our global competitors and will enable better peer-to-peer comparisons.","Our non-GAAP operating margin for 2012, per our expanded definition, was 20.2%, which is 20 basis points higher than the non-GAAP operating margin reported under our previous definition. During Q1 and for the full year 2013, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.01, which excludes estimated stock-based compensation of $0.08 and acquisition-related expenses of $0.01, and translates to GAAP EPS of $0.92. This guidance anticipates a Q1 share count of approximately 305 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25%. Our guidance excludes any nonoperating FX gains or losses.","For the full year 2013, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be at least $4.31, excluding estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.30 and acquisition-related expenses of $0.06. Our GAAP EPS will be at least $3.95. This guidance anticipates the full year share count of approximately 306 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25%. It also excludes any nonoperating FX gains or losses.","Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. One quick clarification and then a question on the demand environment. In your Q1 guidance, can you just clarify if there's any acquisition revenue content in that? And then, I guess the big question, can you just give us an update on the client budget closing process? And more specifically, as budgets are being finalized, what is the pace of deal ramp-ups as new deals get started in the calendar year to set you up for your important Q2? Are you seeing a good pace of deal ramp-ups this year as you set up for the important Q2? That would be very helpful.","Karen McLoughlin","Okay. Rod, it's Karen. I'll take the first part of that around the guidance for Q1, and then I'll it turn over to Gordon and Frank to add some color on the demand environment. In terms of the guidance for Q1, there is less than $10 million of the MediCall acquisition, closed in Q4, and that's small obviously, $15 million incremental for the full year, so that's a couple of million dollars in Q1. And then, we expect the C1 acquisition to close late in the quarter. So in total, the 2 will be less than $10 million for the quarter.","Gordon J. Coburn","And Rod, on your question of the pattern of demand and ramp-up. We're pleased with what we're seeing. Budgets are -- client budgets are tracking the way we want, and when we look at the momentum of stuff that's kicking off, how we think it -- how we come out of Q1 for the important Q2, and I think you are highlighting important, it's tracking the way we'd like to see it at this point of the year.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just real quick on that. I mean, in the Healthcare vertical, you ran a little bit of a lull in the latter part of last year in terms of the demand progression there. Are we still in that lull or are you starting to see a turn in that? I mean, you had reasonable sequential growth in Healthcare in Q4, and I'm wondering if that sector or that vertical is getting back on track.","Francisco D'Souza","Rod, it's Frank. Look, I was pleased with what we saw in Healthcare in the fourth quarter, but I'm still cautious. I don't think 1 quarter makes a trend yet, so I'd still watch it for another couple of quarters. My hope is that we might be at somewhat of a bottom, but let's wait a couple of quarters before we make a call on whether we're seeing sustained recovery there.","Gordon J. Coburn","And Rod, also remember, in the pharma side of the business, Q3, Q4 tends to be stronger than Q1, Q2, so you do have some lumpiness there. And obviously, that's all baked into our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'd love to learn a little bit more about your infrastructure business and your efforts. How much of it is greenfield opportunity versus an in-house solution? And how much of it is takeaway work from, call it, IBM, ADS, CSC? I mean, were you just coming in with a more attractive solution than they historically had offered on their -- as a renew?","Francisco D'Souza","I don't have the exact proportions, but I would say that about -- approximately half of the work would be where we're going into a situation where the client is running their infrastructure in-house. And we are transforming that in some way, taking the infrastructure management, the management layer to a global remote infrastructure management approach or taking the actual physical infrastructure to a cloud-based approach. In many cases, when a client is -- or in a client's infrastructure environment, some parts of that will be done in -- with a traditional provider that's running their infrastructure in what we think of as a traditional asset-heavy model. And in those cases, which is about, I would say, the other half of the business, we would be taking that and restructuring it to the new cloud-based model, adding a layer of global delivery on top of that for the infrastructure management capability. There's a third category in there, which sort of straddles both of those, which is where we are combining apps and infrastructure together, particularly in our application maintenance business, and we're seeing that when we're maintaining an application, there are a lot of synergies to also being responsible for some portion of the underlying infrastructure for those applications. So that's a different cut where, in many cases, what our value proposition becomes is the ability to run the apps and the infrastructure together in a combined way and drive further efficiency and effectiveness for the client around that portfolio of applications. So I think those are the 3 big sort of approaches or sort of themes as we go to market with infrastructure.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So related, is there a bias of success at a different vertical, particularly your 2 big ones, Finance and Healthcare? And is there a geographic bias as well? And I guess, also how many of these deals are advisor-involved deals?","Francisco D'Souza","I think if I look at the infrastructure business, I would say that of the 2 big verticals at Cognizant, it's probably, I would say, roughly equally split between the pharma -- our pharma clients and our financial services clients, particularly when you look at this trend I talked about of infrastructure combined with applications. That's a trend that banks and pharma clients, I think, are recognizing as important. In terms of advisor-based, I don't think it's any more or less intensive than the rest of our business. Again, I don't have the stats, but I would say just off the top of my head, 1\/3 of our deals generally tend to be advisor-led and the rest of our deals, either the client is running themselves or that we've proactively gone out and created where there isn't an advisor or there wasn't an RFP but we sort of created the demand through a piece of proactive selling.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question was in the fourth quarter we just saw the consulting growth rate actually at a little bit of a lower pace than the full year growth and as well lower -- it's really lower than outsourcing. When we think about 2013, Gordon or maybe Frank, what are you implying is going to be consulting -- what kind of driver is consulting going to bring to your growth rate for the full year? Just because you're saying Europe is getting better and discretionary might be, in general. But I just wondered if there's any upside if consulting comes back, a little more force to your full year 16% organic or 17%-plus outlook.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So similar to what we have done historically, we're always fairly cautious on the -- what you refer to as consulting, which is also app dev, which is all a proxy for more discretionary work. So the -- where we ultimately land the year will probably depend on that discretionary work. But yes, we're certainly taking a more conservative stance going into the year. So our guidance would assume that growth of that is probably a little bit slower than the outsourcing work. At this point, we're seeing good demand in that, but it tends to be lumpy, you don't -- certainly don't want to count on it until it's all done.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Good. So that's being conservative already baked into your guidance. And then, if I could get a better...","Gordon J. Coburn","Yes, absolutely. We learned our mistake last year.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. One follow-up, then. On the financial services vertical, I know we talked about Healthcare before. But you mentioned banking being strong, can you give a little more color on that? Is that -- more importantly to me, is that sustainable? I mean, is that something we can have confidence is going to last through the year? Because obviously, the financial services sector, obviously, could be volatile.","Francisco D'Souza","I'm -- let me say I'm cautiously optimistic. I think that we saw, as you know, an environment over the last few quarters where financial services cut or pulled back quite significantly on spending. I think that created a little bit of pent-up demand in some places. And as I look to 2013, I'm seeing signs that some of that pent-up demand in financial services is being released. And of course, the other side of our financial services segment is the insurance business, which has been doing very well last year, and we think continues to do well this year. So when I put those 2 things together, I think Financial Services as a whole should have a pretty solid year this year. So I remain cautiously optimistic about financial services.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And this is -- I think this is the third quarter in a row where it's coming a little better than you probably expected as well. Is that right?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes. I think that's right, yes. So I think we sort of started to see the turnaround middle of last year. The fourth quarter was nice, and as we look to the first quarter, it seems to be shaping up well as well.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to ask, I guess, Frank, any change in competitiveness across your peers? Looks like the growth -- at least in the fourth quarter and perhaps in 1Q, it looks like some of the growth is converging amongst some of the bigger players.","Francisco D'Souza","I don't see any, Tien-Tsin, any particular changes in competitiveness. I think that we compete with a set of very good solid players, and I think we hold our own and win our share directly, sometimes more than our fair share. I see that win rate continuing. I feel very, very good about our portfolio of services. And I come back to my opening comments, right, I think as this trend of our clients sort of  embracing the dual mandate of run better and run different, I think that's where our differentiation is really coming through relative to the competitive set. We think that what we're able to do is offer clients the ability to address both of those, the run better and run different sides of their business from one global platform versus some of our other competitors that are either focused more on the run different piece or more on the run better piece. We think we do both pretty well for our clients, and that's really why we think we're winning in the marketplace.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great, understood. Just quickly then on Europe, I know that was quite strong, certainly better than our expectations. Just trying to understand, is it limited to a few clients or is it a little bit more broad-based than that? And maybe what type of work are you doing exactly? Can you give us just a couple details? I'm just trying to get a sense of how sustainable, obviously, that could be.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. We're clearly seeing in Europe a shift that we were talking about for a while. For the last year, we have been talking about the economic turmoil in the continent is causing the clients to think differently about how they use companies like Cognizant, and we talked about we're starting to win the deals. It would take a little while for those deals to kick in. Those deals are now starting to kick in. It's probably more focused on the run better aspect, and we actually saw our outsourcing business or the nondiscretionary piece grow faster in the continent than the discretionary piece, which, historically, had not been the case. So you're seeing that market open up for the application outsourcing and the application maintenance work. It'll still be a bit lumpy. To be clear, it's still not a large number of clients, so you have a little lumpiness in the ramp-up. But clearly, I think, as I said in my remarks, the -- when there is instability in Europe, it's tough for clients make decisions. Now they're making decisions. And because of the long-term structural changes that they see in their industries and their markets, they realize they have to run their businesses more efficiently and more effectively, and we're part of that solution.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, right. And going in your company, are you going to lock in and retain the C1 employees you're acquiring in the region?","Gordon J. Coburn","We sure hope so. We've spent a lot of time with them. We have a great team on the ground at Cognizant, and the people that we're picking up from C1, from everything we see, are very excited about the opportunity to work with Cognizant and to play a really critical role of being that local presence. We're picking up some just terrific people, and I think they're going to be great leaders in our European business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of George Mihalos of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to kind of go back on the Healthcare segment, nice to see the sequential growth over there. Can you kind of talk a little bit about how you feel about the pharma business now going into '13? You guys were quite cautious on the last call. Do you feel a little bit better about it? And then, maybe just from the healthcare exchanges, any way to kind of quantify what the benefit from spending there could be to Cognizant?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. 2013 is a tough year for the pharmaceutical industry. It's a -- for many companies, it's a low point in the drug pipeline. As we're out talking to our clients, they think '14, '15 should be pretty good, but '13 is going to be hard. So we -- I think we're well positioned certainly compared to others in the industry to work with pharmaceutical clients. But I don't view 2013 as going to be a banner year for growth of our pharmaceutical practice. I think it's a year we'll continue probably to take share from others. But it's -- when you look at the contraction in IT budgets in pharma, it's fairly significant. That's all baked into our guidance. But I'm not sure I would take the Q4 strength as a pattern you want to just project out. Q4 tends to be good for the industry, but '13 will be a tough year.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just any sort of thoughts on benefits from spending on the healthcare exchanges?","Gordon J. Coburn","We're doing consulting work. Certainly, we think there's opportunities both with payers, as well as with government work, related to exchanges. How much of it is incremental spend is the real question versus shifting in spend. So I view the healthcare reform as neutral to positive for us, and it's really a question of does it trigger incremental spend or not.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just last question from me. You've got 17% revenue growth, you're guiding EPS up, on a GAAP basis, 15% or 16% on the adjusted basis. Just what sort of accounting for the delta over there? Is that just a little bit more investment spend somewhere? Or maybe kind of help us think through that.","Gordon J. Coburn","Very simple. We exceeded our margin target a bit in 2012. We were at the extreme high end or just slightly over our margin target. So our guidance for next year assumes we're well within our range, actually on the newly adjusted non-GAAP basis, at the high end of the range. But if you go back to what it would have been under the old thing, it's sort of the upper, upper end, so it's getting margin back to where it should be.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When you say that clients are adopting more of the offerings earlier in the relationship, is there any way to quantify that, maybe in terms of your growth rate for strategic clients or provide some color how to quantify it?","Francisco D'Souza","Ashwin, I don't have a clear way that I can give you an easy quantification of it. I think if you just look over the -- if you look at a couple of different -- you triangulate on it in a couple of different ways, one is obviously the -- if you look at just the raw growth rates of our newer service offerings, those are growing much faster than the company average, and certainly, much of that growth is coming from existing clients. So that's one data point that supports that assertion. The second is that if you look at our newer practices and you look at how quickly they get to certain revenue milestones, so if you look at Horizon 2, as you know, last quarter, we said that those were approaching 20% of revenue, if you look at the period of time in which we've been able to achieve that, it's obviously a lot quicker than many of our traditional services, that might have taken us a decade to get to the same size and scale where these are today. So we're seeing the new service lines ramping up much more quickly. Again, it's a sign that with the portfolio of clients that we have, the strength of our client relationships, the relationships that our field maintains with our clients that we're able to take essentially new service offerings, get them into the pipeline very, very quickly and ramp them up fast. And that's why as we add new capabilities, both in Horizon 3 and through organic and inorganic acquisition, we feel very confident that we can take those capabilities rapidly to the clients. The last data point I will maybe point to is that, as you know, throughout last year, when we talked about Horizon 3, we talked to you about the fact that these were long-term investments that we were making and that we expected good adoption, but we were being sort of more modest in our assumptions about rates of adoption. When we took inventory at the end of last year, we found that, particularly as it relates to the SMAC portion of Horizon 3, social, mobile, analytics and cloud, we were already doing work for 60% of our top 100 clients. So again, another data point that shows that adoption is happening of our new services and happening much faster than traditionally we'd have expected.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's useful. Is there a target maybe for what Horizon 1 versus 2 versus 3 will look like and then in terms of percentages, say, 1 year out?","Gordon J. Coburn","We don't have a specific target other than we clearly would expect Horizon 2 and 3 to grow faster than Horizon 1. How much faster? Obviously, we hope it'd be material, but we don't set specific targets.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And last question really is more for clarification. Should we read something into your commentary on the non-GAAP presentation being changed? Is it maybe indicative of more of a focus on M&A going forward?","Gordon J. Coburn","I would not read a whole lot into it. It aligns with what a lot of other tech companies does. It gives us a little more flexibility to make sure when we do earn-outs, we do it to optimize shareholder value. Clearly, as we move more into Horizon 3, there'll be more IP-based acquisitions, which may have a little bit more intangible amortization. But I would not -- I clearly would not view this as a signal of a fundamental change in strategy. Our acquisition strategy remains quite consistent.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Paul Thomas for Julio. Maybe following up just on that last question about M&A. With the C1 acquisition and your commentary in Europe, might we see any more focus or acquisitions targeted at that region?","Gordon J. Coburn","The short answer is if we could find the right things, absolutely. We think -- if you look at particularly the continent, it's less than 10% of revenue for us. Obviously, when you look at global IT spend, it's a lot more than that. So certainly, we think there's untapped opportunity there. But we always and will continue to be highly selective in the acquisitions that we do.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, any color on headcount, hiring plans for 2013? I guess in light of a little more acquisitions this year, what are your plans for the upcoming year?","Gordon J. Coburn","We'll continue to hire. We don't give -- we give revenue guidance. We don't give headcount guidance. The great thing about Cognizant is because of our brand, we have just a tremendous pipeline of people who want to work for us. How many we hire will depend on demand and equally important are what skills we need. So we'll hire based on demand.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you -- when you're looking at your bid proposal [ph] pipeline and your backlog today, can you kind of give us a feel on how does it compare versus the same time last year? And I think that's going to be an important kind of proxy for us to get a good feel on visibility down the road.","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. So, Moshe, it's Karen. So I think based on where we are today versus where we are -- were last year, we actually feel very good about both the backlog and the pipeline. It's up a little bit. I think, as Frank alluded to earlier, our win ratios continue to be strong. So I think at this point, obviously, client budgets are just getting finalized and so forth now. But right now, the pipeline is very robust, and we're feeling very good about that.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then, final question, can you talk a bit about the U.K. market? And is it still roughly about 15% of revenues today?","Karen McLoughlin","So the U.K. is in total -- total Europe is about 17% of revenue. The U.K. is about 2\/3 of that. And we saw actually very good sequential growth in the U.K. this quarter and actually very strong development -- or consulting and technology services growth in the U.K.","Gordon J. Coburn","It's kind of interesting, Moshe. You're seeing a divergence between the U.K. and the continent. So U.K., historically, there've been a lot of maintenance work and so forth. Now we're seeing the development work kick in. On the continent it's almost the exact opposite story, where because of all of the cultural issues, labor issues, it's more focused on the discretionary work historically. Now we're seeing the maintenance work kick in, in the continent. So different drivers in those 2 regions.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And is that still mostly retail and financial services?","Gordon J. Coburn","No, it's going beyond that now.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer Funds.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I wanted to sort of follow up on some of the Europe questions because your commentary sounds very consistent with at least one of your peers. And wondering if you could get more granular with kind of your growth expectations at least relative to the company average for Europe. Is it sort of a sustainable sort of outsized sort of growth mode you're kind of in or you're seeing in Europe at this point?","Gordon J. Coburn","So let's not talk quarter-to-quarter because Europe, as I said, will be more lumpy. But when you kind of look at annualized basis and so forth, clearly, when you think about the continent, penetration rates are lower, you don't have the law of large numbers and you have this meaningful secular change towards increased comfort without offshoring. So when I look out over the coming years, certainly, we would expect the continent in particular to grow faster than company average. But as I said, I'm not sure I'd have that expectation quarter-to-quarter. You are going to have some lumpiness just because the number of clients is still relatively small.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then -- and Gordon, I wanted to drill down on what you're now calling consulting and tech services. Could you help us sort of piece part how much of that is the consulting versus the app development side? And also just curious why you're sort of changing the definition. Is that sort of anything we should being reading into?","Gordon J. Coburn","So let's start with the definition. Our old definition of development and maintenance was reflective of what our business was 5 years ago. And as we launched consulting, as we launched BPO, all that kind of stuff, we kind of forced them into those 2 categories, and we started talking about those categories as discretionary and nondiscretionary. So we used -- started this year to really change the name, not what's actually in each bucket but change the name to reflect what's really there. So I won't read that as anything other than our old definitions are 5 years old and didn't really reflect the business. When you look at technology and consulting -- consulting and technology services, clearly it's heavily weighted towards the technology component. But consulting is a growing piece of it and strategically, incredibly important, but still it's certainly a small piece of revenue compared to the core technology.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I mean is it sort of getting up to 10% type of revenue or is that too high?","Gordon J. Coburn","It would still be less than 10%.","Karen McLoughlin","Total company.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sorry. To be clear, of total company.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Price of BB&T Capital Markets.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I wanted to just focus a little bit more on kind of the margins and EPS a little bit. The 2013 GAAP EPS guidance probably viewed as a little light relative to expectations. When I ran the numbers quickly, it seemed like you were implying in the middle of your non-GAAP operating margin target, 19% to 20%. I know that's changed. I didn't really have the chance yet to fully factor that in. But I guess, just a few questions around that. That range is still 19% to 20%, if I heard you correctly. If it changes radically as a result of what you -- or what the impact in 2013 is from the add-backs. If you gave that, I apologize that I missed it. And where do you sit within that range? What's implied in your 2013 EPS guidance?","Karen McLoughlin","Yes. So this is Karen. So basically, in the guidance, historically under the old definition of non-GAAP operating margin, we would've assumed a non-GAAP operating margin target of about 19.6% going into the beginning of the year. This year, we've actually taken that up to 19.9%. So clearly, still within the range of 19% to 20% but because of the adjustment we've made to the non-GAAP operating margin definition, we did take that up about 30 basis points to 19.9% to offset the acquisition amortization adjustment. So it's essentially equivalent year-over-year.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Now is that -- is the new range then -- is the new range higher? Is that in the middle of the new range for 2013?","Karen McLoughlin","No, the range will continue to be 19% to 20%, so that we can obviously continue to make the appropriate investments in the company.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And if I could, just quickly on Cognizant Business Consulting, which I think is really a key part of the business going forward. Wondered if you could give a little bit of an update perhaps on the number of consultants, maybe how that capability is evolving relative to some of the large MNCs out there and any more detail maybe on how that CBC factors into your plan for the year.","Francisco D'Souza","It's Frank. Let me try to address the qualitative aspects of that. At this point, CBC -- so let me just say that if you look over the last couple years, we're very, very pleased with how CBC has grown and evolved and the fact that I believe it's having really outside impact in our client relationships into our business relative to the size of revenue it represents. Gordon gave some case studies and some qualitative data points around the kind of impact we're having with CBC, which I think is very significant. Particularly as we engage more and more with our clients on this notion of running differently, CBC becomes a very key enabler. CBC now is about 3,000 consultants, give or take. And I think it's worth pointing out that we take a relatively pure definition of consulting. So when I talk about 3,000 consultants, these are pure, what I think of, as management consultants. These are not folks that are doing blueprinting for technology implementation and so on and so forth. This is really management consulting work that we're doing for clients. We're building this out across all of the industry verticals we serve, so the 3,000 folks are aligned by the industry that we serve. And we're also building out broad capabilities that go across all of -- each of the industries that we serve that are more generic in nature. So we expect to continue to invest in consulting. We're continuously looking at ways to accelerate that growth. I think that we're pleased, but we still feel like we've got work to do in certain areas, particularly when I look at geographies around the world, to ramp up consulting even more strongly in those parts of the world.","And I think that was really all that we had time for. So let me just wrap up by thanking you all for joining us today. And just to summarize, I think we're very pleased with our 2012 results, and we're looking forward to a strong 2013. We're very encouraged that our clients find our value proposition increasingly relevant in the midst of changing market dynamics and that they continue to turn to us, not only to help them run better but also to help them run and adapt and change to run differently. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone.","By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. Additionally, we have loaded an investor presentation onto our website. This presentation covers the key points discussed on this call.","The speakers we have on today's call are: Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q filed later today.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","Cognizant delivered strong second quarter results. Q2 revenue was $3.67 billion, which is at the high end of our guided range and up 8.9% year over year. Three of our four business segments were strong contributors to our performance. Healthcare, Products and Resources, and Communications, Media and Technology averaged double-digit growth rates. And our digital-related revenues continue to grow well above company average. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.93. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved sequentially from 18.9% to 20%.","In light of our strong first half results, we have raised the lower end of our full-year guidance range. We now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $14.7 billion and $14.84 billion. And as we continue to invest in the business for growth, we expect our full-year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 19.5%.","We've now delivered two consecutive quarters of solid performance in 2017. This is a result of our strong and distinctive position in the marketplace and our ability to execute against the large opportunity in front of us.","During recent earnings calls and investor conferences, we've discussed our plan to accelerate Cognizant's shift to digital services and solutions. As a reminder, the three elements of our plan are: one, to invest in and scale our digital practices to solve clients' current and emerging challenges; two, to continue to invest in our core business, which remains very relevant as we accelerate our shift to digital; and three, to implement our margin improvement and capital return programs. We believe our performance through the first half demonstrates the consistency of our execution against this plan.","So this morning, I'd like to highlight our progress in helping clients achieve the full value of digitizing their entire enterprises, or what we call being digital at scale. For clients, digital at scale is both their defining competitive challenge and their long-term direction. Now that digital is mainstream, enterprise transformation is no longer an elective. It's mandatory for competing effectively. This enterprise-wide effort is about remaking their business models, operating models, and technology models, all three simultaneously, so it's a heavy lift.","As a result, clients need more from us than ever before. They're seeking our expertise to reimagine, redefine, and transform their businesses to create new sources of value. And that's why we've invested in and continue to scale our three practice areas, which run across our business segments. They are Cognizant Digital Business, Cognizant Digital Operations, and Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology.","Cognizant Digital Business now harnesses the expertise of more than 40,000 digital professionals who focus on developing virtual channels with customers and creating smart products. These digital business experts identify insights, develop strategies, and they design, prototype, and scale digital experiences to reshape clients' products and business models, all of this effort in generating new growth.","Turning to Cognizant Digital Operations, our team is drawing on deep process and technology knowledge to help clients reengineer, digitize, manage, and operate their core business processes to lower costs and deliver growth. Within digital operations, we're making good progress building repeatable industry utilities both organically and through acquisitions. As part of our extended strategic relationship with Health Care Services Corporation, we announced an agreement in June to acquire TMG Health, a subsidiary of HCSC and a leading national provider of business process services for Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and managed Medicare plans. TMG Health will further strengthen our scalable business process and service on BPaaS solutions for the government and public health programs markets.","Along with building industry utilities, we are continuing to push the envelope of the intelligent automation of clients' repeatable vertical processes. Examples include mortgage document processing, insurance claims processing, and medical claims management. In these cases, we're applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to bring significant efficiencies to tasks such as adjudicating and processing claims, reconciling invoices, and retrieving and comparing complex data. Cognizant robots based on our own automation technology along with other intelligent automation solutions now process hundreds of thousands of transactions a day for several of our customers across industries.","Turning to Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology, we're working with clients to simplify, modernize, and secure their heritage IT infrastructure and applications. For example, as our clients look to create an agile, secure, and resilient platform, we're increasingly helping them migrate workloads to the cloud.","Cloud migration and operation, which take many forms, have become a significant opportunity for us. For example, in May we moved our flagship TriZetto products to the Microsoft Azure cloud and launched our TriZetto Healthcare Cloud Solution, a secure compliant SaaS platform for healthcare players of any size. With our new TriZetto Healthcare Cloud Solution, the more than 300 active TriZetto clients now have the option to migrate their on-premise software to the cloud, and we can help them with the services to do just that. Once their workloads are migrated, we can provide ongoing technology services to securely manage and maintain the software or even move them to a BPaaS model where the Cognizant Digital Operations team can manage their end-to-end business and technology operations.","There's another way of helping clients take advantage of cloud computing's agility, flexibility, and cost savings, and that's by moving their custom applications to cloud platform-as-a-service environments. For example, we've expanded our alliance with cloud native leader Pivotal to speed the enterprise-wide adoption of cloud applications and software platforms. And by the way, Cognizant now has more than 4,000 cloud professionals, the majority certified on Pivotal, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.","Now cloud migration is just one example of how the Digital Systems & Technology team works with clients. In the course of simplifying, modernizing, and securing clients' heritage IT environments, our team is working to ready their technology backbones for the rigorous demands of an always-on, high-throughput, highly secure environment, which is typical of large digital deployments today. In this way, the knowledge of our clients' technology environments, built up over many years, has become a significant advantage in our ability to provide them with the technology transformation services.","Now the way we pull together the full range of services and solutions from our three practice areas is through Cognizant Consulting. As these practices work with clients to transform their business, operating, and technology models, Consulting makes their journey faster and smoother. Now nearly 6,000 strong, our consultants advise CEOs, CFOs, chief operating officers, and line of business heads in addition to the CIOs we've long worked with on issues that cut across strategy, operations, and technology. Consulting is a powerful enabler for our practices and continues to drive large transformational deals for us. And I'm pleased to report that IDC has now positioned Cognizant as a leader, one of only four in its global MarketScape for digital transformation, consulting, and systems integration services.","To sum up, as our second quarter results confirm, we continue to grow our business while shifting an increasing focus to enabling digital transformation. Most businesses today recognize the need to go all in on digital. They know they can't simply glue digital solutions onto industrial business models. So clients need a partner with the proven ability to transform their entire enterprises. We believe Cognizant is one of the few companies with the range of knowledge and capabilities that clients need to be fully digital. And therefore, the market is moving our way, directly into the wheelhouse of our expertise. We think this transformation mandate will drive our success for years to come. We're committed to fully executing our strategic plan and extending our lead in digital, and that's how we will sustain our momentum in 2018 and beyond.","And now over to Raj, who will provide examples of how we're building repeatable industry-specific solutions for clients to take advantage of this opportunity. Raj?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thanks, Frank.","Like other members of our leadership team, I spend much of my time with our strategic clients. And I listen for new ways to add value to their businesses, including how to help speed their transformation journey. Our clients of course pay close attention to the rising expectations of their customers and the competitive moves of their peers, so they know how fast things are changing and how easy it is to be left behind if their business, operating, and technology models are not digital through and through. We're responding by investing in the build-out of repeatable industry-specific solutions that we can deploy across our practices. These platforms solve pressing problems and deliver measurable results.","Frank talked about clients needing to digitize their entire enterprises, so let's look at a few examples of how they're deploying digital at scale. Many consumer product companies today are running to catch up to their retailers' new expectations for engaging customers. Retailers expect relevant product suggestions and self-service channels as well as speed and convenience when placing orders with their suppliers.","In response, Cognizant has developed a next-gen sales platform that enables businesses to acquire and retain more customers and sell more product. Next-gen sales is built on our Onvida SaaS platform, which is a cloud-based and omni-channel. You may recall that Onvida also serves as the foundation for the physician and patient communication network of LifeBridge Health, a client I talked about last quarter. To create next-gen sales, we have integrated digital commerce, email marketing, account acquisition, and advanced analytics in one platform.","Consider the impact of this platform on a large consumer products client. This organization needed to replace its traditional phone-based sales operation with a digital ordering and service platform, a true digital commerce and marketing portal. They also wanted to become more effective at cross-selling and upselling products by applying advanced analytics. In just a few quarters, we ramped from inception to production. We are now in the process of onboarding their thousands of B2B customers as we move more than 25% of their phone transactions to digital channels. Among the benefits they will see are: a significant uplift in revenue; a double-digit reduction in operating costs; and a far more compelling customer experience. Many companies face similar challenges and need cloud-based digital commerce solutions, so we see plenty of market opportunity for our next-gen sales platform.","Another area where operating models need to be modernized and automated is workflows. To bring intelligence to these workflows, we've developed and are deploying our proprietary digital automation fabric. This fabric combines image recognition, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and process automation.","Here are two examples of clients applying our advanced framework. For a leading mortgage information service provider, we've worked to redesign the workflows of their loan origination, servicing, and support functions. The result, our implementation reduces staff by a third and can pass (14:55) more than 200 million pages a year with data accuracy that exceeds 99%. And for a global property and casualty insurer, our deployment has substantially reduced unnecessary claims and saved tens of millions of dollars. We continue to expand this framework to other industry solutions.","Now I want to turn to the financial performance of our business segments and geographies. Let's start with banking and financial services. Second quarter revenues were up 4.1% year over year, driven mostly by our growth in insurance. In insurance, we're seeing broad-based growth across clients and strong demand for multi-service line managed service deals. The overall performance of our banking clients has improved from the first quarter, but we still see large money center banks taking a conservative approach to their spending and continuing to focus on optimizing their cost structures. This is being partly offset by continued strong growth in our mid-tier accounts.","In healthcare, our second quarter revenues were up 9.5% year over year, driven by both our life science and payer clients. Broadly, we've seen a healthy pickup in demand across our payer clients. This includes pent-up demand from those healthcare payers involved in M&A activity last year.","The healthcare industry continues to shift from fee-for-service to value-based care models. In response, healthcare organizations seek new ways to deliver consumer-centric care while driving operational efficiency and lowering medical costs. These competitive pressures persist despite continued uncertainty about the ACA's future. We've invested heavily in our healthcare practice, creating a differentiated offering that has positioned us well to meet evolving client demand. And we're actively helping many of our clients manage through this transition.","Let's turn to our other business segments, Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology. Today they make up over a third of our total company's revenue and are meaningful contributors to our growth and our portfolio diversification. Products and Resources grew 13.2% year over year as a result of continued strong performance with our manufacturing and logistics clients. As these clients sensor-enable their products, they're embracing enterprise digital transformation. To harness the power of their connected products, we must rearchitect and transform their supporting business processes as well as simplify and modernize their technology models. That's how they'll create new digital products and drive new revenue streams.","Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter of broad-based growth, up 16.8% year over year. Our clients in CMT are focused on creating a differentiated experience that delivers personalized content to their customers. Doing so requires each client to efficiently and effectively manage content, from acquisition through targeted distribution and analytics. We're responding with a repeatable digital content operations solution. It uses human intervention, machine learning, and digital platforms to ensure the right content is viewed by the right person at the right time and place.","Now let's look at our performance in emerging geographies. Europe was up 5.7% year over year after a 6.1% negative currency impact. This was driven by strength on the continent in key markets such as France and the Netherlands and by strategic investments made in the second half of 2016. By the way, earlier this month we opened our new London Digital Business Collaboratory. This co-lab combines human-centric design with digital technologies to enable clients to deliver engaging new experiences for their customers.","To close out our geographic discussion, we had continued strong growth in the rest of the world, which was up 21.2% year over year. This growth was driven by key Asia-Pacific markets such as India and Australia. And just as we have done in continental Europe, we're building a strong local presence and investing both organically and inorganically in these emerging markets.","In recent calls, we've talked about Cognizant's evolving workforce and delivery. I'd like to add a few points to this discussion. The engines of our digital practice areas are our talented and deeply skilled professionals. To ensure they stay on digital's cutting edge, we're investing tens of millions of dollars this year to continuously deepen and broaden their skills in areas such as analytics, artificial intelligence, data science, and digital security.","Cognizant is also building skills and capabilities in local communities where we operate around the world. One way is by partnering with educational institutions to establish and fund retraining programs in high-demand digital technologies. For example, we partner with Per Scholas, a national organization to create a job training program in the south Bronx. It's designed to help New Yorkers access career opportunities in tech, and we plan to hire at least 350 of the program's initial graduates for our client sites in New York's five boroughs.","We've also been developing similar training programs in Des Moines, Tampa, Phoenix, and Charlotte as well as internationally. For example, in Singapore we're partnering with educational institutions to provide the local community with STEM-related training. And in Switzerland, we run an apprentice program that trains students in application development and testing. In short, our company runs on talent, and we remain committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent in the world.","To wrap up, we're driving digital scale by building repeatable industry-specific solutions that enable clients to add significantly more value to their businesses.","Now I'll turn the call over to Karen to cover our financial performance. Karen?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone.","Q2 performance continued to be strong, and we made significant progress on each element of our overall plan. Second quarter revenue of $3.67 billion was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 8.9% year over year. We had a negative currency headwind that impacted year-over-year revenue growth by $35 million, or 100 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and realignment charges, was 20%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.93.","In the second quarter, we continued to execute the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, with completion expected during the third quarter. And today we declared our second quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on August 22. This dividend will be payable on August 31.","Now let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and technology services represented 58.7% of revenue, and outsourcing services 41.3% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 11.4% year over year, driven by an increased demand for digital solutions.","Outsourcing services revenue grew 5.6% from Q2 a year ago. The slower growth in outsourcing is largely attributable to the timing of the ramp-up of several client engagements and clients continuing to optimize their spend in certain areas such as application maintenance. We expect growth in our outsourcing services to improve in the second half, as projects ramp and demand in digital operations and infrastructure services remains strong.","During the second quarter, 38% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts. We continue to make progress toward shifting the mix of our business over the longer term towards more fixed-price or managed services arrangements.","We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as those with the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 343.","And now moving to an update on margins, in Q2 we took some actions that will improve our cost structure and operating margins while allowing us to continue to invest in the business for growth. These actions resulted in approximately $39 million of charges related to the realignment program, primarily from severance cost, including those associated with the voluntary separation program that was initiated and concluded in the second quarter.","Of the $39 million of realignment charges, $35 million was for the roughly 400 associates who accepted our voluntary separation package. We expect approximately $60 million of annualized savings as a result of the VSP. During the remainder of 2017, we expect to incur additional cost related to advisory fees, severance, lease termination, and facility consolidation costs. We remain committed to our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019, and to date have made good progress towards this target.","We've made good headway in Q2 driving utilizations higher by slowing the pace of our hiring and improving resource alignment to our reskilling and multi-skilling programs. These adjustments are structural changes that will help improve our profitability through greater operational efficiency while continuing to provide sufficient resources to support the growth of the business.","While our overall head count decreased by approximately 4,400, gross hires were 10,800 in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 23.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, increased from 17.1% in the year-ago period. Our attrition level was higher than normal given reductions resulting from performance evaluations and the voluntary separation program. While we will of course carefully manage head count, we will continue to hire and invest in critical skills needed to grow our digital business, and we expect attrition to decline in the coming months.","Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 76%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who were in our training program was 80%, and onsite utilization was 93%. We expect these ratios to continue to improve over the remainder of the year, as the full benefit of our resource alignment program comes through.","Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $4.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was down by $900 million from December 31 and $188 million from the year-ago period, reflecting the use of cash on hand to primarily fund the ASR.","Receivables were $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 73 days, marginally higher than last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $409 million, up from $395 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 61% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables.","Our outstanding debt balance was $991 million at the end of the quarter, which included a $150 million outstanding balance on our revolver.","As previously mentioned, as part of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders, we launched a $1.5 billion ASR in March. At that time, we received and retired 21.5 million shares, a portion of the total expected shares to be repurchased under the ASR. We expect to complete the transaction during the third quarter, at which time the total number of shares to be delivered will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price during this period. Our diluted share count decreased to 591 million shares for the current quarter.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full-year 2017. Following our strong first half performance, we are raising the low end of our full-year 2017 guidance range, and we now expect revenue to be in the range of $14.7 billion to $14.84 billion, or growth of 9% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.","For the third quarter of 2017, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.73 billion to $3.78 billion. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.94. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 592 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%.","For the full year 2017, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be at least 19.5% and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $3.67. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 595 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 23%. This guidance also includes the impact of the $1.5 billion ASR. We will provide additional details on full share count impacts once the purchase has been completed.","Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, and realignment charges. For the full year, it also excludes the recognition of the Q1 income tax benefit that was previously unrecognized. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to immigration or tax policies.","In summary, we have continued our momentum from the strong start to 2017, and we expect to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth this year along with a substantial capital return to shareholders.","Operator, we can open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if we could just touch on your outlook for the growth in the healthcare space briefly. Obviously, we've heard across the space that in light of the uncertainty around repeal\/replace and the Affordable Healthcare Act (sic) [Affordable Care Act] that there's some hesitancy with regard to budgets. So I'm curious in terms of what you're seeing on the budget conversation side with your clients, how much is being held back versus how much is a recovery in pent-up spending demand. And then maybe as a follow-up, any pressure on the BPO or BPaaS side as a result of some of the larger payers pulling out of exchanges?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hey, Brian, this is Raj. Look, I think when you look at healthcare, we've invested very heavily on our healthcare practice, and it's really created a differentiated offering which has positioned us well. And if you look at the entire practice, with what's happening with the healthcare ecosystems, with the providers, the payers, and the pharma, with all the collaboration that's going on there, and these are all big practices for us, so I think that we're positioned very well in healthcare.","And in addition to that, we've talked about last year we had a couple large M&A transactions, and obviously with those going away, you see a lot of the pent-up demand. So there's still some uncertainty with what happens with the ACA. But overall, I think this year and going into next year with the position we are, we're well positioned.","Regarding some of the BPO, we haven't seen any impact on that at all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Karen, this one is probably for you, just a question around the margin plan and your hiring plans. First, just relative to where you were six months ago when you put forward the margin plan, would you characterize the actions you've taken so far as going better than expected or in line with expected?","And then a related question, you mentioned that the gross hiring in the quarter was 10,800 folks. Can you give a sense for the skill mix and locations of those folks and in particular whether they're coming in at a higher revenue per head level?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Sure, Lisa, so I think in terms of overall plans and margin trajectory, I think we're right on track. I think Q2 was a little stronger than we expected. Headcount came down a little faster than we thought and utilization came up a little bit faster than we thought it might, so I think that was positive as we get into the back half of the year, though obviously we'll have raises and promotions. And I would not expect head count to decline from here. It will actually start to tick back up as we continue to invest for growth and as we look forward to next year and what our plans are for growth there, so I think we reached a low point, at least for 2017 anyhow.","In terms of the hiring, as you mentioned, we added 10,800 gross hires during the quarter. As has been the case for the last several quarters now, you're really seeing a shift mix towards more of the digital skills, higher-end consulting, designers, the data scientists, et cetera, folks who can support our infrastructure business, and then certainly the digital operations business as well, which is experiencing high growth rates. So it's really a mixture of those three sets of skill types.","In terms of the onsite\/offshore ratio, we haven't seen a significant change there. You'll see head count shifted a little bit onsite this quarter, but that was really mainly because of the decline in head count for the quarter. So from a hiring perspective, hiring hasn't really shifted from quarter to quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe just talk a little bit more about the financials vertical, obviously muted spending, conservative spending from the banks at this point. Maybe just talk about what you think gets them unstuck in terms of their discretionary spending plans and whether you have any visibility in terms of bookings, that that's actually going to happen before year-end.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hi, Jim. This is Raj. So look, I think the overall financial services, I think if we look at the entire practice, obviously insurance continued doing well. Where the challenge is, is a little bit on the banking side. And as we talked about, regional banks are healthy, strong growth. Where we're challenged is on a couple of the large money-center banks. The good news here is obviously we're in a better position than I think we were at this time last year with them. But as we look out, they're still very much focused on the cost side and optimizing that, but we are, obviously, engaged with many of them on digital-type engagements. Now as these projects become larger scale enterprise initiatives, I think we're well positioned to benefit from that. But right now, that's our focus area right now in terms of continuing to invest and continuing to be well positioned for those large enterprise transformations.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning and congratulations. A quick question, the TMG Health deal, is that in your guidance or not, and about how much would it contribute this year?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Ed, this is Karen. We have really not baked in any significant revenue from TMG. As you know, that deal still requires regulatory approval. So in the guidance, we did not bake anything in until we get a little bit more clarity \u2013 or anything significant until we get a little bit more clarity around the timing of those approvals.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys, just a question on the overall environment. First, what areas are showing strength versus the original plan? Obviously, we saw the lower end of guidance increase, and maybe you can hone in a little more on the healthcare financial side. But really when we think about \u2013 you're trending at about 10% growth year to date, year over year, and comps look like they get easier in the second half. So is there anything we should consider in terms of elements on guidance being conservative or any other factor that would cause a deceleration in the second half? Thanks, guys.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Why don't I take that, Darrin? It's Frank. I would say we've invested significantly, as you know, over the last years in building and realigning our business around these three practice areas that I talked about that cut across our business segments. And we think we're really well positioned right now to capture the emerging and evolving demand for digital solutions, so I think that's the core driver of our growth.","As I said in my prepared comments, three out of our four business segments grew when taken together on average double digits, so strong growth. Financial Services was the only business segment that didn't have strong year-over-year growth. So we feel like we're well positioned. We feel like the solution set that we've been building with these three practice areas is resonating in the marketplace, and we're well positioned.","I think as we look to the back half of the year, it's largely that that gave us the confidence to take the lower end of our guidance range up. But just to set the expectation, I would say given where we are in the year at this point, there's not that much time in our business. We don't have a lot of runway here to deliver above the high end of our range. So we think it's a prudent range that we've given you in the 9% to 10% range. I don't think there's a lot above that, but I feel very good about how we're positioned as I think about 2018 and beyond.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","I think, Darrin, if I could just add to Frank's comments, if you look at Q3 and Q4, it's just for argument's sake you assume that we're in the middle of the range. I think you'll actually see the growth versus last year \u2013 growth rates in Q3 and Q4 would actually be higher than in 2016. So I don't think we're seeing a decelerating trend there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with our question.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys, congrats on the solid results. I want to ask on the non-GAAP operating margin. It came in at 20% in 2Q 2017. I guess I'm curious. Why wouldn't that adjusted operating margin continue at or above that 20% level in the second half? Maybe it has to do with some of the raises and promotions, but I thought there would be some other offsets, but just curious on that.","And then secondly, looking at the implied 4Q 2017 guidance, it looks like stronger than anticipated sequential revenue growth in that fourth quarter. What's driving that? Thanks so much.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Bryan, this is Karen. Let me take that. So margins in the back half of the year, there will be a couple of things that will happen. One is we will have raises and promotions kicking in later this year. The other thing, as we mentioned earlier, while we have not assumed a lot of revenue from the TMG contract, there are some ramp-up costs that are already starting to take place that will accelerate as we get into the back half of the year before the contract even moves over officially.","And then obviously, we want to continue to invest for growth. So as we always have in the past, when we used to talk about a 19% to 20% range and that we would invest above that to continue to drive growth, the same story holds true this year. So as we think about what we need for next year and beyond to really continue to drive the digital transformation, we will continue to invest. As I mentioned, we would expect head count to certainly not decline any further and, if anything, will start to come back up a little bit as we get back into the back half of the year. So all of those will lead to some decline in margin essentially versus Q2. And as we said earlier, we remain committed to be at least 19.5% for the year and feel that we're very comfortably on track for the 22% in 2019.","As it relates to Q4 revenue, I think certainly we are seeing some good growth as we get into the back half of the year. The pipeline continues to be strong. We're seeing a nice recovery in the healthcare practice. So I think we're certainly shaping up for a very nice Q3 and Q4 as we get into the back half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good morning, nice quarter. Karen, how much inorganic growth is factored in that 9% to 10% number for the year? And then just in general, I think, Raj, you spoke about a couple of large banks that are maybe a bit weaker in terms of performance. Are they predominantly Europe-based, European, maybe some color on that? Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Sure, Moshe, I'll take the first part of that and turn it over to Raj for the BFS question. We have not baked any incremental inorganic revenue into our guidance for the remainder of the year. And obviously, we've done a couple of very small deals this year, but nothing that's material in the current run rate either, so the 9% to 10% is essentially organic revenue.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Moshe, the large money central banks obviously have both a European and U.S. presence. So I think you're seeing softness there because of the discretionary work not kicking in as fast as we would like it. Now again, like I said, we're engaged in a lot of the digital initial work with those banks. And as these banks continue to get healthier, I would expect that you would start seeing some more of the enterprise transformation initiatives that we're expecting. And I think we're well positioned. If you look at it from the business to the operations to the technology layers, I think there are very few companies that can help these banks. And so that's obviously areas that we're investing in, and we're hopeful for future growth as they get healthier.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, nice results here. Just \u2013 I think it's smart to not include TMG Health, I'm just curious about the BPaaS pipeline. How does that look today? How active is it? And then on TriZetto cloud, will you actively mine your legacy accounts to convert them to cloud? Is there any way to size the impact of this potential work if you flip the whole portfolio to cloud? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hi, Tien-Tsin. It's Frank. Let me try to take that. Look, the BPaaS pipeline is really healthy right now. We feel very, very good about the TriZetto BPaaS, the healthcare BPaaS opportunities. Obviously, TMG Health is part of a relationship, BPaaS relationship that we are building with TMG's parent, HCSC. And so that's just one example that we feel good about where we are with healthcare BPaaS. And I think that it's fair to say that our strong performance \u2013 part of our strong performance in healthcare this second quarter and going forward is the result of the investments that we've made in the scaling up of our BPaaS offerings, so good traction there.","As I said in my prepared remarks, the healthcare cloud, the TriZetto Healthcare Cloud that we launched on Microsoft Azure, it's still early days. We have 300 active TriZetto clients that we could migrate over. We absolutely will go back to them and work with them on the migration. And as I said, the economics will generally be a one-time revenue opportunity for us to migrate but then an ongoing revenue opportunity for us to manage, maintain, monitor, upgrade, support those implementations once they're in our cloud. And then of course, there's an additional opportunity beyond that, which is converting them to our full BPaaS offering once they're on our cloud, so I think it's a multi-layer opportunity.","Given that the 300 clients range from small health plans all the way up to the very biggest health plans, each individual opportunity I think is quite different and varied in size. And so I'm not going to give you an overall opportunity, but 300 clients and I think multi-layers of the opportunity as I look over multiple years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Bergin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just on automation, can you give us an update on your automation investments and your progress there? Any quantitative details you could also share, whether it's level of FT (47:38) savings or just client-based implementations? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","It's Frank. I would say that we continue to push forward actively across many areas of the business in looking at applying advanced automation. And I would just remind you that historically, we've always had a practice of automating in our businesses, in our practices. So my comments here are related specifically to what I think of as advanced automation that makes use of new technologies like robotic process automation and artificial intelligence and machine learning and so on and so forth.","We gave you a few examples during our prepared remarks in our Digital Operations business. We have several clients. We have a proprietary Cognizant technology that came to us as part of the TriZetto acquisition, which we've now expanded, not just to serve healthcare clients but to serve a broad range of clients. That combined with the work we're doing with third-party automation providers, we now have hundreds of thousands of \u2013 we process hundreds of thousands of transactions across many clients. But we're not stopping there. We are working to automate in our Digital Systems & Technology business, particularly infrastructure, application value management, quality engineering services. All of these are opportunities for us to automate, and we continue to do that. So that's the second part of it.","The third part of it is that as we're building out industry solutions, as Raj spoke about, we often find that, for example, in the digital automation fabric that Raj mentioned, machine learning and artificial intelligence are important components there as well. So across the business, we continue to push forward very hard in automation.","It's hard to give you quantitative numbers. We're seeing automation benefits anywhere from 10%, 20% productivity to 30% productivity. There's a wide range in there. And I think we'll continue to see those benefits as the impact of automation broadens across the business. And I think that's part of the reason that we will continue to drive utilization higher as we automate more.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This is Damian Wille on for Ramsey. I'm hoping you can help us frame how much of your digital sales come from cross-sell versus signing a new logo. And along the same lines, if you could speak to how much of the digital cross-sales you think of as a push from you or a pull from the client. Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hi, Damian, it's Frank. Let me try to address that. I would say just it has been historically been Cognizant's pattern that in any period \u2013 month, quarter, year \u2013 the vast majority of our revenues come from cross-sell to existing clients. The foundation of our business model, as you know, is serving a small number of clients, serving them very deeply, building multiyear-long relationships with our clients. So that continues to be the case with digital.","I would remind you that core to our competitive advantage in digital is this notion that we're able to use the knowledge that we have of our clients' technology environments, our clients' operating model to help them as they look at transforming their business model. And so our perspective on digital is this transformation of the business model, the operating model, and the technology model simultaneously. That's really where we feel we have a really strong core competitive advantage, and that advantage is strongest where we have existing relationships. And we've had a long history of serving the client and understand their technology and operating models in detail. So I would say that a significant portion, certainly the majority of our digital revenue comes from cross-selling to existing clients.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph A. Vafi - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I was wondering if you could comment on sustainability of onsite utilization rates at this level if hiring picks up again and if shift to digital drives shorter project durations and potentially a higher onsite mix. Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Joseph, this is Karen. I'll talk about that, and obviously Raj and Frank can chime in. But running at 93%, where we were for Q2, is fine. Onsite utilization, as long as it doesn't get above say 95%, is absolutely fine. We can continue to grow at the pace at which we expect to continue to invest in the business. So while it certainly came up from Q1 over the last couple of quarters, utilization has ticked down both onsite and offshore. So bringing it back up into a 93% \u2013 94% range is very comfortable for us and we can continue to invest and drive the growth that we want.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","I have nothing to add to that, Joe. We could say that as we continue the process of building out regional centers in the U.S. as opposed to our historical model where folks have been more onsite in our client locations, I think that that will help drive utilization actually higher, because when we have people in a physical location, our ability to redeploy them across clients and so on and so forth, the project then becomes higher.","Now that's a longer-term trend. Our journey of building out regional centers is well underway, but we have some ways to go on that. So I think as regional centers become a greater portion of our overall onsite workforce, I think that will be a contributor to being able to take onsite utilization up higher.","And I think, operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes, our final question will come from the line of Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arvind Anil Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys, congrats and thanks for fitting me in. So it looks like these digital projects are certainly gaining scale and clients clearly value your consulting and advisory services. Can you talk a little bit more about your consulting capabilities and how you're looking to scale at onsite hiring and leveraging consultants on management? And part two of that question is the impact on margins by hiring more onsite consultants.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Let me try to address that. So first just the data, as said in my prepared remarks, consulting is now just shy of 6,000 people. It has been a focus of ours for more than a decade. We continue to grow it. Our consulting capability is \u2013 I would say in the last few years we've really, really focused it and emphasized the vertical aspect of consulting very, very hard. So I think our 6,000 consultants, the vast majority of them are deep domain experts in the industries where Cognizant is strong. And increasingly now the work they do is very focused on digital transformation and leading various aspects of our clients' digital transformations.","We will continue to grow, and we will continue to scale Consulting. We remain very committed to that business. You're absolutely right. The Consulting team is becoming a more and more integral part of our client account management teams as they build long-term relationships with clients beyond the technology organizations, and so that's a trend that we view as positive and will continue.","And then in terms of margin impact, I think proportionately I don't see Consulting growing dramatically as an overall part of the total company revenue, so I don't think that it has a meaningful margin impact one way or the other. We continue to be very comfortable with our ability to grow that part of the business and still maintain our overall margin goals as we think about 2018 and 2019.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","And so with that, I'll wrap up. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions, and we look forward to talking with all of you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year\u2019s 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. Additionally, we have loaded an investor presentation onto our website. This presentation covers the key points discussed on this call.","The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza ","Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call. This morning I\u2019d like to cover three topics; first, Cognizant\u2019s current view of the industry and where our clients are headed; second, a few highlights from our 2017 performance, which includes full year revenue growth of nearly 10%; and third, how coming off a solid year, we plan to use our momentum to deliver a strong 2018.","Let\u2019s begin with how we see the current environment. In recent years the big story in tech has been the rapid rise of digital native players like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Today another important story is being written with entirely new players. Companies that have long stood as the pillars of our economy are emerging as a new generation of digital heavy weights. ","These firms many of which are longstanding Cognizant clients, are already leaders in financial services, insurance, healthcare, manufacturing and other industries. With Cognizant as their partner, they are combining their industry expertise and assets built over decades with powerful technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, analytics, robotic process automation, cybersecurity and hybrid cloud to create entirely new performance thresholds and customer experiences. ","This blending of industrial with digital promises to dramatically improve the way the world\u2019s industries serve our needs and improve our lives. Digital technologies have become so integral to remaking business models and core processes that no enterprise can ignore them and still remain competitive. That\u2019s why the rate of digitization across industries and countries continues to rise, and why digital now accounts for a substantial and growing percentage of new enterprise IT spending. ","Most clients realize that competition today is not about being either digital or physical, but rather about being both digital and physical. Hybrid business models are the new way work will get done at the enterprise level. ","As we continue our productive partnerships with our digital native clients, we\u2019re also focused on building a strong position in the digital industrial economy. We are resolved to be the go-to-partner for this new generation of digital heavyweights, helping them figure out what stays physical, what goes digital and what becomes a mix of both. ","Cognizant is only one of a handful of companies with a range of capabilities to help clients transform at every level of their enterprises. So we believe we are in a strong position to pursue this huge market opportunity for digital at scale transformation. ","Now let\u2019s review Cognizant\u2019s 2017 performance. Throughout 2017, we stayed focused on executing our plan first articulated a year ago to accelerate our shift to digital services and solutions. As a reminder, the three elements of our plan are; to scale our three practice areas, maintain a robust core business, and fully implement our margin improvement and capital return programs. ","During 2017, we made significant progress across all three elements. Here are a few highlights; first, we delivered four consecutive quarters of consistently solid performance at the top and bottom lines. Our 2017 revenue grew nearly 10% to $14.81 billion which was within our guided range for the full year. Second, we took a number of actions to improve our cost structure and slightly exceeded our full year non-GAAP operating margin target. Third, our 2017 digital related revenues grew almost 30%, well above company average and accounted for about 27% of total annual revenue. In addition in 2017, our portfolio of digital services generated above company average margins. ","During the year, we also initiated Cognizant\u2019s first quarterly cash dividend, returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through an accelerated share repurchase program, and launched the second phase of our share repurchase program, underscoring our confidence in the long term growth of our business. Overall, we believe our 2017 performance demonstrates the consistency of our execution. ","Let\u2019s now turn to the third part of my discussion, how our forward momentum will deliver a strong 2018. Beginning with guidance, we expect Q1 revenue to be within a range of $3.88 billion and $3.92 billion. And for 2018, we expect revenue to be within a range of $16 billion and $16.3 billion or growth of 8% to 10%. ","We are confident in our ability to deliver a 21% non-GAAP operating margin in 2018. We remain on track to achieve our 22% non-GAAP operating margin target in 2019, while continuing to invest strongly in our business for growth and differentiation. And reflecting our confidence in our momentum and the benefits of the new US tax legislation, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 33% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per share. ","Propelling us forward is the comprehensive building, investing and operational strengthening of our business that we accomplished last year, all of which we will continue in 2018. Our three practice areas, Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations, and Cognizant digital systems and technology are proving very effective at anticipating our clients\u2019 needs and providing the most effective services and solutions for the parts of their enterprise they need to transform. ","We continue to invest to broaden and deepen our services and capabilities and have intensified our focus on developing more end-to-end, industry-specific solutions. At the same time, we\u2019ve expanded our geographic footprint adding new delivery and operation centers as well as collaborators [ph] in our key global markets. And through last year\u2019s five acquisitions, we welcome to Cognizant talented professionals who are highly skilled in management consulting, digital strategy and marketing, user experience, industry focused platforms, and content creation. ","When you put it altogether, the Cognizant difference is our penetrating knowledge of our clients\u2019 business and technology environments and the problems they must solve, coupled with our ability to use technology to transform their entire enterprise. Think about what goes into this; Cognizant is able to engage with clients on their strategy, on their approach to customer interaction, on their product and service portfolio, on their financial and people models, their underlying business processes, operations, user interfaces, applications data and infrastructure. ","We have the end-to-end capability, the domain knowledge, the global and local delivery, ahead of the curve investments, and non-negotiable client information to be entrusted with such a critical undertaking and to deliver from strategy all the way through expected results. There are simply no shortcuts to building all of this capability and making it work for clients. ","Let me wrap up by returning to the subject I\u2019ve spoken about in the past calls. As you may know, Cognizant\u2019s enduring belief is that we must enable a broader range of people to have the stem education and skills they need to thrive in this new digital era. This belief is consistent with Cognizant\u2019s ambition to be central to the digital economy and to contribute significantly to the communities in which we operate. ","And so today, we are thrilled to announce the formation of the Cognizant US Foundation, a non-profit focused on providing stem and digital education and skills training for US workers and students. We\u2019re establishing the new foundation with an initial grant of $100 million, which is supported by recent changes in the US tax laws. The foundation will focus on education programs in multiple cities and states across the US to help improve opportunities for US workers and their families. ","As you may know in today\u2019s rapidly expanding digital economy, there are far more open jobs for technical work than there are trained workers to fill them. In fact, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 1.4 million person gap in 2020 between software development jobs and qualified applicants. This skills gap threatens the competitiveness of American businesses. ","To help close this gap, the Cognizant US Foundation will fund and develop stem education programs, public private partnerships, and other initiatives designed for high school graduates, community college and college students, veterans and others in the workforce seeking specialized technical skills for digital business jobs. As part of Cognizant\u2019s overall social responsibility focus, we\u2019ve been enabling stem education for a dozen years. The work of our new foundation will build on our global commitment to train tomorrow\u2019s technology professionals, reskill and upskill today\u2019s workers, and give back to the local communities where the company does business. ","Our company runs on highly skilled talent. We are one of the largest employers of technology workers in the US. Last year we added more than 6,000 US citizen and permanent residents to our workforce. And over the next five years, we plan to hire at least 25,000 US workers. To support our growth, we have recruiting, training, and reskilling efforts underway in several American cities with plans to extend our training programs to other cities in the near future.","As the economy becomes ever more technology intensive, the need for workers to be career long learners is going to increase substantially in the years ahead, and Cognizant is determined to be at the forefront of enabling this. ","Okay, now let\u2019s turn it over to Raj, who will discuss how we\u2019re working with clients to speed them along their digital transformation journeys as well as the specifics of our business segment performance. Raj?","Raj Mehta","Thank you, Frank. When you ask our clients what sets Cognizant apart, they\u2019ll say it is our ability to create solutions that transform how they engage with their customers, run their operations, and modernize and secure their IT backbone. This year, to drive increasing value to clients and further strengthen our foundation for profitable growth, we continue to develop and deploy our broader portfolio of industry platforms and solutions across our three practice areas. ","Examples include Cognizant MedVantage for the life sciences industry, Cognizant LifeAdmin Core for insurance, and Cognizant ClaimSphere Clinical Plus for healthcare to name a few. We also offer digital capabilities that cut across industries such as cloud enablement, legacy transformation, intelligent process automation, and more. Each of our practice areas has clearly defined its range of solutions and capabilities, and the distinct value they provide. ","This has made it easier for clients to understand the full range of our capabilities. Given the increasing complexity and scale of the processes and systems within our largest clients, we\u2019ve continued to evolve our client engagement. We\u2019ve been embedding chief marketing officers and chief digital officers in each of the industries and key geographies that we serve. These leaders are supporting our aggressive drive to continue expanding our presence well beyond the CIO to other decision makers within our accounts. ","In addition, we\u2019ve continued to evolve our account leadership team, which are focusing on more output and outcome based results. They are helping clients optimize their legacy environment and fully leverage Cognizant\u2019s increasing localization and integrated delivery. Last year, we skilled over 100,000 associates in high-end digital capabilities in areas such as data science, design thinking, cybersecurity, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and automation, and this year we\u2019ll continue our substantial investment in training our associates. ","At the end of the day, of course what matters to clients are outcomes. So let me offer an example of digital transformation work we\u2019re doing for one of the world\u2019s largest healthcare companies. In the medical device segment, where this client operates, market leaders realized that the quality of their field service and their ability to comply with regulatory changes are differentiators. ","Working with a client, we can see the future of predictive services of seamless parts, management across the digital supply chain, and building quality compliance. We prototyped a future state for the client using Cognizant\u2019s MedVantage, our integrated sales, service, complaint handling, and quality management cloud solution. We are now rolling out our solutions to more than a dozen of the client\u2019s operating companies spread across 50 countries to meet the need of thousands of users. ","Once our deployment is complete, we believe that client will be able to achieve significant benefits that include a 5% to 10% increase in revenue from service contracts, a 30% increase in the productivity of field service personnel, and a significant reduction in regulatory citation. This case study conveys the tangible value we can create for our clients, value in the form of increasing revenue, lower cost, and reduced error rate. ","Now let\u2019s turn to the financial performance of our industry segments and geographies in the fourth quarter. Banking and financial services grew 5.4% year-over-year. In the quarter, we had double-digit growth in our insurance business and in our mid-tier banking clients. In insurance, the growth was driven primarily by large strategic deals. ","We see growing interest among the insurers, and they are using advanced technology. Examples include watching for secure data, sharing, drones for property inspection, and artificial intelligence to help decide personal injury claims. ","Moving to banking, while certain large banking clients\u2019 spending has continued to be under pressure, we see the beginning of a recovery as these clients sharpen their focus on an investment in digital technologies. We are prepared for this transition by all the work we\u2019re doing to help them optimize their spending on their legacy systems and operations, and then apply these savings to driving digital transformation across the enterprise. ","Turning to healthcare, our revenue was up 11.9% year-over-year. We saw consistent demand across payer clients and increasing interest in our digital, analytics, cloud and virtualization solutions. Healthcare delivery is shifting from fee-for-service to a value-based care model that is focused on effective consumer engagement with data driven insights. ","As a result, healthcare organizations seek new ways to deliver consumer centric care while driving operational efficiency. This is leading to increased collaboration and partnerships across peers and providers. Our differentiated offering, which combines software and services position us to capitalize on these fundamental changes within the healthcare industry. The addition of TMG Health extends our position as a leading software-as-a-service healthcare partner in a growing market for government programs. ","We now provide products and services to more than 430 organizations that support more than 70% of the Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid markets. Within life sciences, we had a strong fourth quarter particularly in biopharma. Among our life sciences clients, we see growing interest in digitizing core business processes like clinical development and regulatory operations, as well as in transforming the patient and care experience. ","Turning to products and resources, we increased revenue 13.7% year-over-year. We continue to see strong growth from our manufacturing and logistics clients, which offsets sluggish growth in retail. Our strength in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utility areas result from our emphasis on leading the digital offerings. CXOs increasingly engage Cognizant to create smart products and transform their business models. ","Communications, media, and technology had another strong quarter of broad based growth, up 19% year-over-year. In Q4, we had solid growth across all the sectors, with expansion in areas like creating and curating digital content. As you know, the digital economy is all about content and context, the right content to the right person at the right time through the right channels to create meaningful experiences. ","And in Silicon Valley, our clients are relying on us to help support their operations not only in the US, but also globally, where they tend to have smaller operational footprints. Looking at our geographies, our international markets crossed the 3 billion revenue mark in 2017, reflecting our successful growth campaign. We\u2019ve made good progress in integrating several recent acquisitions including Netcentric, Zone, Adaptra and Brilliant Service.","We now operate in 38 countries and much of our growth has been enabled by successful localization across our 37 centers, in which more than 30 languages are spoken. Europe grew 18.1% year-over-year in Q4, including a 640 basis point positive impact from currency and the rest of the world went up 17.5% from a year ago, including a 200 basis point positive impact from currency. ","As a sign of our growing European reputation for delivering digital interactive solutions to C-suite decision makers, the Football Association which is based in the UK selected Cognizant as their digital transformation partner. We will be developing and managing digital solutions to make it easier for soccer\u2019s 800 million global fans to build a deeper relationship with the sport and drive its growth. ","To sum up, over the past year, we\u2019ve focused considerable energy and investment in strengthening our foundation of profitable growth and extending our capabilities to help clients succeed in their transformational journeys. Karen over to you.","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you Raj and good morning everyone. Q4 performance was solid, rounding out our full year result which were within our expectations and reflect successful execution of our strategy to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. Fourth quarter revenue of 3.83 billion was within our guidance range and increased 10.6% year-over-year, including a 120 basis point positive impact from currency. ","Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses and realignment charges was 19.7% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.03. In the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 22.4% and excluded the $617 million one-time impact of the recently enacted US Tax Reform Act, resulting primarily from the deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings on foreign subsidiaries. ","For the full year 2017, revenue of 14.81 billion represented growth of 9.8% year-over-year, including a 10 basis points negative impact from currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.7%, slightly above our guidance of 19.6% and non-GAAP EPS was $3.77. As part of the capital return program laid out one year ago, we repurchased $1.5 billion of shares in 2017 and initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share beginning in Q2. ","In the fourth quarter, we launched the $1.2 billion phase of our capital return program through a $300 million ASR. We are currently evaluating the new US tax legislation and in particular the longer term impact that this legislation may have on our overall capital return program.","We are supportive of this legislation as it levels the global playing field and increases the competitiveness of US companies. The implementation of a modified territorial tax system will permit capital to flow across markets with greater ease allowing more flexibility for future investments. ","As a first step, we are pleased to report that our Board has approved a significant increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.20, reflecting our confidence in the strength of the business, coupled with the benefits of tax reforms. This increase will bring our dividend more in line with technology peers, while allowing us to continue to invest strongly in the business both organically and inorganically. ","Additionally as Franc described, we plan to significantly expand our ongoing commitment to stem education through our planned $100 million contribution to the Cognizant US Foundation. ","Now let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and technology services represented 57.3% of revenue and the outsourcing services 42.7% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 10.2% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand for digital solutions. Outsourcing services revenue grew 11.1% from Q4 a year ago, as we continue to see strong growth in digital operations and infrastructure services. ","Turning to fourth quarter, 39.5% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts. We continue to make progress towards shifting the mix of our business over the longer term towards more fixed price or managed services arrangements. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as those with the potential to generate at least 5 million to 15 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 357. ","And now moving to an update on margins in Q4 we continue to take actions that we expect will improve our cost structure and operating margins, while allowing us to continue to invest in the business for growth. These actions resulting in approximately $3 million of charges in the quarter, related to the realignment program. Going forward we may incur additional costs related to advisory fees, severance and further optimization of our real estate cost. ","Additionally, as we accelerate our pursuit of broad based, high value digital transformation work, we will continue to reassess less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital market place. ","In 2018, we expect to make further progress to our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019 through continued focus on driving higher value services in addition to continual improvement in our business, focusing on leverage such as sustained higher levels of utilization, optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively. ","We have also invested in further automation of our systems and processes in key areas such as customer management and forecasting of supply and demand. We enter 2018 on solid footing after the steps we took in 2017 to right size our cost structure. The implementation of these savings initiatives allows us to continue to invest in our digital capabilities, while still delivering improved margins in 2018 and 2019. ","Moving to headcount, another key metrics, offshore utilization in Q4 moved higher as we continue to effect structural changes in our headcount management. We expect that these changes will help improve our resource alignment, help drive greater operational efficiency and best improve our profitability. ","We added 3900 net new hires in the quarter, while annualized attrition of 17.9% during the quarter including BPO and trainees decreased over 400 basis points from the previous quarter. Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 80%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduate doing our training program was 83%, and onsite utilization was 92%. ","Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash and short term investments. We had strong operating cash flow in the quarter, generating $836 million, reflecting improved profitability of the business. Receivable were 2.9 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 71 days down one day from the year ago period. ","Our unbilled receivables balance was 357 million, broadly flat from the end of Q3. We\u2019ve build approximately 63% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. Our outstanding debt balance was 873 million at the end of the quarter, which included a $75 million outstanding balance on our revolver. Our diluted share count was 589 million shares for the current quarter. ","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full year 2018. For the full year 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $16 billion to $16.3 billion, which represents growth of 8% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time of which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. ","We expect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 will be immaterial to evolve revenues. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect to deliver revenue at the range of 3.88 billion to 3.92 billion. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $1.04. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 589 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 24%. ","For the full year 2018, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 21%, and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $4.53. This guidance anticipates the full year share count of approximately 585 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 24%. This guidance includes the impact of the $1.02 billion share repurchase, which we anticipate will be phased in over the balance of 2018. ","Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes stock based compensation, acquisition related expenses and amortization, realignment charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the additional impact of the enactment of the US tax reform act and our planned contribution to the new Cognizant US Foundation. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment in areas such as immigration or tax. ","Before I close, I would like to comment briefly on our longer term tax rate. As you know, our tax rate is determined by a combination of factors globally, including our geographic mix of earnings and related income tax rates and the jurisdictions in which we operate recent changes to tax legislation such as the US Tax Reform Act, and tax structures in various international markets. Based on what we know today, we anticipate that our tax rate will be in the 24% to 26% range beginning in 2019. ","In summary, our solid execution in 2017, along with continued investment in the business has positioned us well to deliver another strong year of revenue and earnings growth in 2018. ","Operator, we can open the calls for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Bryan Keane","Just wanted to ask about the large banking showing signs of improvement. Do you think that\u2019s just a little bit of the tax reform coming through to spending, just trying to think about what could cause a little bit of pickup in that large banking side?","Raj Mehta","Bryan, this is Raj. Look, I think within banking, we\u2019ve always had with our mid-tier banking accounts the demand environment and it\u2019s been quite healthy, where the challenges has been on some of the large money center banks. And given obviously, we are starting to see a pickup obviously some with the tax reform, but some of the regulation changes, and you\u2019re starting to see a lot of investments that are starting to come in in the forms of digital transformation. ","And I think we\u2019re positioned very well for those to capture that growth, but obviously we continue to balance along with additional engagements in digital. There\u2019s still a focus on some of the optimization around the legacy work and we\u2019re making prudent decisions in terms of balancing both revenue and margins on outlook. ","Bryan Keane","And just one follow-up for Karen, just the first quarter \u201918 revenue guidance, this is a little stronger than we anticipated. Anything to think about that is pushing those numbers higher, is that just a little stronger demand, extra days, just thinking about the seasonality there versus demand. ","Karen McLoughlin","On a year-over-year basis Bryan, there\u2019s a little bit of currency impact that\u2019s helping with the growth as well as sequentially. But honestly, we think the year\u2019s off to a solid start, so we think Q1 will play out quite nicely. ","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now live. ","Darrin Peller","I just want to start off first with the embedded expectations for, I guess currency and M&A in the outlook, and then really more on the margin side, if you could help us just bridge a bit \u2013 a little more detail bridging the gap to the 21% operating margin expectation for the year from where you are now. I know it\u2019s been a \u2013 it\u2019s part of the plan over the few years, but maybe some more specifics on the gross margin and then some of the variables. ","Karen McLoughlin","Sure Darrin, it\u2019s Karen, let me take that. So let\u2019s start with revenue guidance. So in the 8% to 10% revenue guidance, there\u2019s about 100 basis points of currency right now that we see as the benefit year-over-year, so 7% to 9% on a constant currency basis would be the growth projection. There\u2019s no incremental M&A built into that, so just obviously the full year impact of the deals that we did last year, so Netcentric and Zone, which we did in Q4 and then obviously the TNG contract you\u2019ll get the full year impact versus this year, we\u2019d about five months of that. So that obviously helps with the growth rate, but beyond that there\u2019s no large deals or no M&A built in to the guidance at this point.","And then on the margin front, obviously we\u2019ve guided to approximately 21% non-GAAP operating margin. A lot of that is driven by the benefit of the cost savings we\u2019ve implemented in 2017 that will carry over into 2018. We\u2019re also, as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re seeing, as the business shift to more of the digital work that has higher value; it\u2019s been higher margin work. So as we\u2019re seeing that start to continue to become a bigger piece of the overall pie that will continue to drive margin expansion as well. And then we\u2019ll continue to focus on continuing leverage around pyramid, will sustain high levels of utilization. We believe there\u2019s more work to do in terms of scaling the corporate functions and really driving the leverage out of that. So it\u2019s no individual lever, but there\u2019s a number of pieces that will come together to drive the expansion. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. You line is now live. ","Brian Essex","Karen I had a question for you on the taxes. Is there anything operationally that you\u2019re changing, I mean tax rate in longer term coming in under, I think where we expected? Are you changing billing policies, transfer pricing, and might this potentially fix longer term issues of where you\u2019re generating cash and where that cash gets trapped geographically?","Karen McLoughlin","Brian there\u2019s nothing certainly that we\u2019re doing in regards to the outcome of the US Tax Reform Act, obviously overall that is helping to drive the rate down. As you know in India over time the rate will increase as tax holidays start to expire and so that\u2019s why in the guidance we\u2019ve put a rate of 24% to 26% to accommodate a little bit of that increase as we look out into the future. But today, the rate has been and will continue to be based on a number of items including all the various geographies in which we operate, and nothing unusual that we\u2019re doing though because of that. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Just wanted to double check on the margin outlook, just any guidance on how we might see margins progress throughout the year and how it might be different than past years. And I know Karen you don\u2019t give gross margin guidance per se, but can you give us some high level views on gross margin specifically. I know you mentioned utilization pricing, I think you also mentioned contract profitability focus, so anything you can offer there will be great.","Karen McLoughlin","So Tien-Tsin as you mentioned, we don\u2019t give gross margin guidance and certainly don\u2019t intend to at this point, but I think what you\u2019re going to see is margins will bounce around a little bit during the year, a lot of it will be depending on hiring, the ramp up hiring. So as you saw in Q4 we did add about 3900 net resources. We also in Q4 gave raises and promotions related to 2017. Typically we\u2019ve done that in Q3, so depending when we do that this year that obviously has a bit of an impact in the quarter that that happens. So our intention is to target the approximately 21% on a full year basis, but that won\u2019t be a linear path throughout the year. It will really depend on the timing of investments that we make. ","Operator","Your next question is coming from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. You line is now live.","Jim Schneider","I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little more color on the revenue outlook and how that\u2019s likely to progress through the year. First of all, does it assume that the banking and financial services revenue growth rate will continue to improve ratably through 2018, given some of Raj\u2019s comments, and then secondly, can you maybe the comment directionally on your hiring plans throughout the year?","Francisco D'Souza","Jim let me try to take that. We expect revenue to unfold in roughly the same way its unfolded in past years. From a seasonality standpoint Q2 tends to be our strongest quarter from a revenue growth standpoint. Q3 a little less so, and as we get in to the holiday season in Q4 the revenue growth tends to be a little slower. So that\u2019s kind of the pattern we expect. I don\u2019t see anything unusual unfolding this year. I think from the financial services we don\u2019t have significant improvement in the environment baked in to our current outlook. As Raj said, we see some green shoots, but certainly not calling a significant turnaround in that business. So that\u2019s I would say modest assumptions baked in to our guidance for financial services for the year. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jason Kupferberg from Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ","Jason Kupferberg","So we\u2019re starting off the year here with really the same 8% to 10% topline growth outlook as last year, and obviously in \u201917 you came in more or less at the top end of the forecast. So I just want to get a sense of the visibility you feel you have on the 2018 outlook today versus what you had on \u201917 a year ago. I know that the visibility on the discretionary piece tends to kind of firm up more in March, April, May timeframe, but it does sound like there may be some encouraging data points among the money center banks, so just overall comments on visibility would be real helpful thanks. ","Francisco D'Souza","Jason I would say, we set guidance sort of the same way at the beginning of the year every year. So I don\u2019t think there is any meaningful difference at this point in \u2013 as we said here at the beginning of \u201918 versus where we were at the beginning of \u201917. We go through a very thoughtful process of bottoms-up almost account \u2013 an account by account forecast of revenue for the year, that\u2019s based on our client teams\u2019 best views of what we have in backlog plus our pipeline, plus some factor for business at this point aren\u2019t identified. We use that same methodology every year. So I would say that our visibility at this point to 8% to 10% is the same as it was last year at this point. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is now live. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar","I want to ask a margin question, so if you made no other realignment type changes, how much 2018 margins go up just because you\u2019re in a better place. And then I also have a sub-part question on margins which is at some point as the one-off actions like the alignment in structuring end, would you expect a narrowing of difference between GAAP and non-GAAP items. ","Karen McLoughlin","Ashwin I think in terms of the 21% that we\u2019ve guided to for 2018, I think a lot of that\u2019s going to come from shift in the business and actions that we\u2019ve already taken. As we\u2019ve talked about for some time now we\u2019ll continue to look to optimize the pyramid, the automation continues to become a bigger piece of the work that we\u2019re doing both for clients as well internally for ourselves. So there\u2019s a number of things that are taking shape that don\u2019t necessarily require what I would call a realignment charge to execute on. They are just how we will manage the business going forward. So we\u2019re very comfortable the 21% target that we\u2019ve set for ourselves for this year. ","And then as we move in to 2019, obviously we haven\u2019t given guidance beyond 2019. But as you know today the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is driven by a number of items including stock comp, FX gains and losses which we can\u2019t predict. So, excluding one-time items those things will continue to be the big drivers of the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP and then from time to time there maybe one-time items, whether it be realignment or tax reform or the donation that we\u2019re making to the US Foundation later this year. So those obviously will continue as they occur. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Bryan Bergin from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. ","Bryan Bergin","I wanted to healthcare business, any outlook there? Can you comment on the launch of your pipeline and do you see 4Q performance somewhat as a baseline for 2018?","Francisco D'Souza","I think healthcare continues to do well for us, especially given all the investments that we\u2019ve done as you\u2019re aware of the TriZetto and now with TMG. I think as we look out in to 2018 I see that continuing. We\u2019re seeing strong traction specially around the digital space and with interactive after modernization and just all the work around digital engineering and a very strong pipeline developing, continuing with our BPaaS deals, not just around Facets but also around TMG. And I think as you know there\u2019s some potential mergers that are out there and I think we are positioned well for potential work that may come down in to those transactions. So I think overall the investments in healthcare serves us well and we see a strong growth in 2018. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Keith Bachman","Karen this is for you. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about how FX is impacting the margin guidance that you\u2019ve given. Some of the disclosure in 10-Q would suggest that there\u2019s a pretty strong tailwind the margins with the headwinds, the hedges you haven\u2019t placed rather. Not clear how the dollar is impacting the margin though. But if you could just talk a little bit about FX broadly speaking in terms of the impact of the margin guidance? ","Karen McLoughlin","Sure Keith, if you think about it there\u2019s really three currencies that drive both top line and potentially bottom line impact for us and it\u2019s really the pound and the euro and some of them with Swiss Franc, but the smaller impact and then the rupee. The pound and euro tend to be a natural hedge, so whatever movement we see in those currency effects bottom revenue and cost essentially in line, a little bit of a difference, but it doesn\u2019t have a material impact to the margin line. The big driver that can impact margins is really the rupee. ","But the rupee frankly has been fairly stable for the last several months; I mean it\u2019s sort of been hovering in the 63 to 64 rupee to the dollar rate. So that\u2019s not having a significant impacts on the margins at this point. And then as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we typically hedge about 50% of our rupee exposure in any given year, and that\u2019s consistent from year-to-year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. ","Glenn Greene","Maybe Karen just a higher level, obviously one year later, but how are you feeling about that 22% margin goal after 19, but or worse or sort of neutral relative to the initial goal, and then just a quick update on the pricing landscape and the environment? ","Karen McLoughlin","So I think in terms of the 20% target that we set for 2019 for non-GAAP operating margins, I say we feel neutral when we\u2019ve set those targets to ourselves and made a commitment to our shareholders around that. We had done a lot of work in terms of how we would get there over the years. I think we are extremely pleased with the way the company performed last year and everybody really rallied around making those improvements while continuing to invest for the long term growth in the business. So I think we\u2019ve done a great job so far of managing both revenue growth and expanding margins and I think we\u2019re very comfortable with the trajectory that we\u2019re on there. ","I think in terms of pricing, pricing has been very stable. Very similar to the trends we\u2019ve seen over the last few years where certainly clients are looking to continue to optimize cost if there is legacy or business as usual, environments and redirect those dollars to transformation dollars. But certainly what you\u2019re seeing is some of the digital work and some of the more transformative work is higher value work. That is higher priced work and that is also obviously a big part of the margin shift that we\u2019ve been seeing and expect to continue to see. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mayank Tandon from Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. ","Mayank Tandon","With the ongoing shift at digital, can you comment on the challenges you\u2019re facing in terms of hiring the best talent and the right talent for the type of work and then the implications for wage pressure and employee attrition as you shift your talent based on more digital type work. ","Francisco D'Souza","Mayank, its Franc I\u2019ll touch on that. Look whenever you \u2013 you\u2019re thinking of a key point, whenever you have these big technology transitions you do have contractions, not contractions but rather shortages in pockets of the workforce skills. That\u2019s why we invested very heavily last year and will continue to invest very heavily this year in retraining the workforce. Last year we retrained about a 100,000 of our associates with variety of new digital skills. That\u2019s an ongoing effort. ","Digital skills are a little different than say past generations of technology because you have a number of different skills. There isn\u2019t sort of one or two main predominant skillsets, when you talk about digital you actually have lots of skillsets, so that the ongoing training is important and we\u2019ll continue to do that. ","I do think that\u2019s part of the reason that we have had somewhat higher employee attrition, that\u2019s also a phenomenon we\u2019ve seen in the past when we invest in retraining, then it becomes attractive sometimes for competitors to take people that we\u2019ve invested in in making the training efforts. We continue to feel comfortable though that we can continue to stay ahead of that, and that the training efforts and the training engine that we have is strong. ","I\u2019d also say that a part of the reason that we announced today is the formation of the Cognizant US Foundation is to try to address this problem on a broader and a more systemic basis. We believe that the skill shortage within the US is very real and that we \u2013 given the fact that we are probably one for ourselves for Cognizant we\u2019re probably one of the largest in-house training operations in world. That we can take some of that knowledge and externalize it and use it to train the workforce in the US outside of perhaps the traditional IT work force and use that to create new sources of talent for the entire industry. ","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. ","Edward Caso","I was curious on the size of digital engagements, are they rising, what pace are they rising at? And as they do get larger and more transformative of traditional systems, is that bringing back some of the traditional competitor. So help us with your relative positioning to your market given as the digital world evolves?","Francisco D'Souza","Ed its Franc, look for some quarters we\u2019ve been seeing, now we\u2019ve been talking about this concept of digital at scale. Certainly something that we\u2019ve seen over the last or over 2017 that after an initial phase of call it, piloting or experimenting our clients, these new digital heavy weights that I talked about, the firms that are looking combine digital and physical that are leveraging existing assets, existing positions in industries are strongly investing in putting a digital layer on top of their physical assets and their capabilities. That\u2019s driving larger scaled digital projects. ","We think about large scale digital as projects that involve or they transform the business model, the operating model and the technology model of our clients. So that trend continues to unfold, and I think will continue to unfold through 2018. And as I said in my prepared comments, we think that there are very few companies in the world that have the end-to-end capabilities, they can work with the client on digital, all the way from strategy, all the way through execution. ","And this is hard work, right. It\u2019s not easy stuff both executing for clients, but also building the internal capabilities and stitching them altogether in a way that\u2019s effective at the client interface. And we think that we are very well positioned because of the investments that we\u2019ve been making not just in the last couple of years but going back a decade when we started building consulting and so on. ","So over a very long period of time we\u2019ve build strong foundational capabilities to do digital end-to-end, to do kind of large scale integrated programs for client end-to-end. And we really think there are very few companies in the world that have that range of capabilities. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Frank Atkins from SunTrust. Your line is now live. ","Frank Atkins","Wanted to ask if you\u2019ve seeing any difference in client behavior as a result of the tax changes, or if the tax changes impact your M&A philosophy at all going forward?","Francisco D'Souza","Let me take that and I\u2019ll ask Raj if there\u2019s anything to add. I think Frank its surely to tell if there have been real changes to client behavior as a result of the US tax reform, maybe I\u2019ll give you an update next quarter if we see anything, but right now it\u2019s just too early to tell. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s fundamental change to our M&A philosophy as a result of tax reform. We\u2019re assessing that. As you know tax reform will allow us to access cash that was overseas for some period of time. That may change the geography of M&A, but I think the philosophy will remain largely where it\u2019s been. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Arvind Ramnani from KeyBanc. Your line is now live. ","Arvind Ramnani","I wondered to kind of really dig in to a topic. You\u2019ve touched upon a couple of times, and as you enter this new age of compute with a richer set of technology options and also with technology strategy becoming comparative differentiator for very traditional companies. How is this demand environment changing, and have client expectations changed, and also if you can comment on how Cognizant is positioned? Specially I\u2019m looking to see if you can comment on how you\u2019re enriching your consulting experience, your M&A priorities and also do you feel better for the demand environment over the next two or three years, or has it made it harder to manage the business?","Francisco D'Souza","Arvind let me set the stage and then I\u2019ll ask Raj to comment. Look, I think I\u2019ve said this for a while, right, I think the macro trend here in my mind is that the world in general is becoming more technology intensive. So businesses are becoming more technology intensive, governments are becoming more technology intensive, societies are becoming more technology intensive as a result. We\u2019re using more technology in our personal lives, we\u2019re using more technology in the business world. ","So as the world become more technology intensive that sets the backdrop for our demand environment, which is that, our clients whether those are businesses or government need access to skill, they need access to capabilities, they need to access large scale program management and governance to be able to develop, deploy, integrate all of that technology so that it actually delivers results. ","So that\u2019s the macro and then I\u2019ll let Raj comment a little bit about the more specifics. ","Raj Mehta","Arvind I think when Franc touched on it a little bit earlier, right. When you look at companies, many of our clients \u2013 digital is not just about the front end, the user experience, it\u2019s really about being able to make changes at the business level, the operating level and as well as the technology. And there are only a handful of the companies that can make that kind of impact for the companies and provide all the governance and execution that\u2019s behind it. And I think we are well positioned for that and we\u2019re seeing that. As these projects become larger in scale, Cognizant continues to benefit from those. ","Francisco D'Souza","Operator I think we have time for one more question. ","Operator","Certainly our final question today is coming from Joseph Vafi from Loop Capital. Your line is now live. ","Joseph Vafi","May be ask the growth question one more way Franc, if you could parse out where you\u2019re seeing growth this year, digital versus non-digital relative to that 8 to 10 points of growth that you outlined for the year, especially relative to your comments early on about legacy companies becoming digital giants. And it seems like you\u2019re placing your bets more on the digital side and maybe versus some of the older technologies that they are continuing to deploy. ","Francisco D'Souza","I think that as a macros it\u2019s going to vary a little bit industry by industry. But as a macro statement our clients are going to continue I think to optimize legacy and invest in digital growth. Now having said that, I think it\u2019s important and I\u2019ll make this point that optimizing the legacy is still in many cases a really solid and good business for us. We know how to run clients legacy systems, we know how to optimize them, we know how to keep them up and running. And these legacy systems are still very much the backbone of our clients operations. ","So they are not going away and they are very important because digital gets build on top of legacy. In fact, sometimes I say that \u2013 we talk about legacy, but actually these legacy systems are our clients\u2019 heritage, right. And so they are really important to have that backbone. So we\u2019ll continue to invest in that business, we\u2019ll continue to stay very relevant there, and there\u2019s a lot of value to be added to clients to just being able to go in and say, look, we can help you run your existing traditional legacy environment, more efficiently, more effectively, lower unit cost and so on and so forth. ","On top of that, we have to continue to invest in digital to remain relevant. And so we are doing that. Our digital revenue last year grew almost 30%, 3x the company average almost in \u201917. So we\u2019ll continue to make those investments, that\u2019s an ongoing process, but I think I can say to you with confidence that that process is well underway at this point. We are very competitive across the industries that we serve. We\u2019ve got good differentiation, our clients look at us as very credible players in digital. So, those two trends will continue to play out in to 2018 and I feel pretty good about how we\u2019re positioned. ","And with that I think we\u2019ll wrap up the call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. I would say that we are confident in our ability to deliver a strong 2018 and all of us look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. Additionally, we have loaded an Investor Presentation onto the Investor Relations portion of our website. This presentation covers the key points discussed on the call.","The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Francisco, please go ahead.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to hear about our 2016 financial performance and our outlook for the upcoming quarter and year. For 2016, we finished within our guided revenue and EPS ranges. Our Q4 revenue was $3.46 billion, up 0.3% sequentially and 7.1% year-over-year. Our full-year 2016 revenue was $13.49 billion, which represented 8.6% growth over 2015, including a negative currency impact of 120 basis points.","Turning to guidance, we're confident that the investments we've made position us well to deliver strong results in 2017. For Q1, we expect our revenue to be within a range of $3.51 billion to $3.55 billion. And for the full-year 2017, we expect our revenue to be within a range of $14.56 billion to $14.84 billion, representing full-year growth of 8% to 10%.","Now, as we customarily do during our first call of the year, let me provide some color around client demand and our strategic outlook. For some time now, we've been speaking to you about our client's dual mandate. On the one hand, they have to run better and optimize their core operations; on the other, they have to run different and invest in the digital technologies that are reshaping business models. Over the last few quarters, we've seen clients' relative emphasis on these two shifts towards digital.","For some time now, you've been asking us to break out our digital revenue. We've defined Cognizant's digital revenue as work with clients to help them win in the digital economy by applying technology and analytics to change consumer experiences to drive sustainable growth, deploying systems of intelligence to automate and improve core business processes, and improving technology systems by deploying cloud and cyber security solutions and as-a-service models to make them simpler, more modern, and secure.","Our digital revenue for the full-year 2016 represented approximately 23% of total revenue and is growing well above the company average. Going forward, we expect that trend growth weighted towards digital to accelerate and will periodically break out our digital revenue to give you a sense of how that shift is progressing.","Our investments to-date have positioned us well to solve our clients' digital challenges, but we know there is more to do. We've long prided ourselves in making the investments our clients require to stay ahead of their changing needs. That's why we're excited today to announce a plan that will accelerate Cognizant's shift to digital services and solutions.","The plan has three elements, and is the result of many months of careful planning between management and our board that culminated in our Cognizant 2020 strategy, which as you know, we've been executing since last summer. The plan has been complemented by productive conversations in recent weeks with Elliott Management and other shareholders. As you know, we announced this morning a cooperation agreement with Elliott. We believe this plan is a constructive outcome that reflects the best interest of Cognizant's shareholders, clients, and associates.","Now, with that perspective, let me discuss the three elements of our plan to accelerate our shift to digital. The first part of our plan began with the re-alignment that we announced last quarter of our horizontal teams into three practice areas across business segments. These three practice areas are designed to address the needs of our clients as they transform their business and technology models.","Cognizant Digital Business helps clients architect and implement new digitally-enabled business models. Cognizant Digital Operations reinvents and manages our clients' most essential business processes. And Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology simplifies, modernizes, and secures client applications, platforms, and infrastructure.","Going forward, we'll invest to scale these digital practice areas aggressively across industries and geographies both organically and through acquisitions. With more than 90% of our revenue in Financial Services, Healthcare, life sciences, Retail, Manufacturing and entertainment, we're at the center of the FinTech, health tech, and smart product revolutions. Our clients are depending on us to keep them at the vanguard of that shift.","We will also continue to invest extensively in training and re-skilling our team and in substantially expanding our local workforces in the U.S. and other local markets around the world where we operate, as agile development and the pervasive influence of technology increases the value of co-location and a consultative approach. To complement this organic investment, we are intensifying our efforts to acquire companies, expanding our intellectual property, industry expertise, geographic reach, and platform and technology capabilities. We've recently ramped up this activity and we expect to accelerate the pace further in 2017, while keeping to our strategy of focusing primarily on tuck-in acquisitions.","As the second element of our plan, we will continue to ensure that our core business, which includes service offerings related to IT infrastructure, applications, and business process services remains robust and healthy. These offerings are critical to fulfilling Cognizant's digital ambitions, because our clients' digital futures are built upon the backbone of their traditional systems.","Having deep knowledge of our clients' core systems is a significant advantage as we work with them to build new digital capabilities. Our clients are looking to run their operations more effectively to redeploy capital to fund their digital investments. We've carefully analyzed and identified advanced automation and delivery efficiencies.","In addition, we will make careful choices among business opportunities to avoid less profitable areas to balance growth and margin. While this strategy might lower our revenue growth in this part of the business, we believe it will be offset by strong digital revenue growth resulting in robust, higher-quality growth for the company overall.","Executing the first two elements of this plan, will migrate our business mix to higher value, digitally-oriented IP and platform-based revenue. This, along with opportunities to leverage our scale, makes it possible for us to remove our historical margin cap (08:28) and allow margins to increase gradually over the coming years. At the same time, we will still invest strongly in the business for growth.","And finally, we also took the opportunity to carefully consider our current cash balances and our future cash generation prospects. We believe that with Cognizant's strong cash profile, coupled with our debt capacity, we can continue to make the necessary investments in the business, while prudently returning capital to shareholders.","Beginning in 2017, we will launch a robust capital return program, initiating a quarterly cash dividend and a share repurchase program that will return approximately $3.4 billion to investors over the next two years and 75% of our U.S. free cash flow in subsequent years.","Before I turn the call over to Raj, let me summarize. We believe that the opportunity before us is greater than any we've seen before and we're optimistic that the plan we've announced today will allow us to capitalize on the prospects ahead. We're serving large and growing markets. We have a structure and strategic approach in place that positions us well to serve this increasing demand. We will continue to invest in capabilities that help clients become digital in every part of their businesses and are confident that we can expand our margins and return capital without compromising that purpose.","Clients in 2017 are looking for digital capabilities at scale and are affirming that we've made the right investments by turning to us for integrated, high-impact, strategic initiatives. We're committed to creating value for both our clients and shareholders over the long-term and we see significant opportunity ahead of us.","Now, Raj will discuss our performance and Karen will provide more financial details. I'll be back to take your questions. Raj?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you. Frank has talked to you about our plan to accelerate our shift to digital, which now accounts for approximately 23% of revenue. We're pleased with our position in digital market, and a number of prominent industry analysts and sourcing advisors acknowledge the expanding depth and breadth of our digital capabilities.","Leading independent observers including Gartner, IDC, Forrester, Everest, and others have ranked us among the top global players in categories such as strategy and consulting, Internet of Things, intelligent automation, artificial intelligence, business analytics, design thinking, workplace services, and digital operations.","Frank outlined key priorities for our path forward. I would like to elaborate on how we are operationalizing them. Last summer, we began to implement several transformational initiatives and entered 2017 well-positioned to advance our Cognizant 2020 strategy and accelerate our journey. Let me touch on some of the highlights.","First, we're accelerating our shift to digital by establishing new practices, developing the skills of our people, and scaling up our local workforce. For example, we are expanding the number of client innovation spaces, we call collaborators, with locations in the U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pacific. In addition, we are supplementing our expertise with select acquisitions. For example, Idea Couture provides digital innovation, strategy, and design services; Mirabeau specializes in digital marketing and customer experiences; and KBACE adds cloud strategy and integration skills.","As we scale our digital capabilities, we are also scaling the way we bring digital to market. We have segmented our client base, and we better aligned our client-facing teams to bring Cognizant's expanded portfolio of capabilities to a broader range of buyers within our clients. This allows us to sell more effectively and productively. Second, to ensure that our core business is robust and healthy, we unified our delivery capabilities, allowing more holistic and cost-conscious deliver. Leveraging automation and scale will improve our efficiencies in utilization and pyramid optimization. And we will continue to deploy very commercial and delivery models including managed services, fixed bid, output and outcome-based pricing, and platforms.","Let me give you an update on our three practice areas. In our Digital Business practice, we offer insight, digital strategy, and implementation. We're helping clients to realize the superior experience and financial benefits of the app economy. Our approach combines data science, design thinking, holistic process knowledge, and deep industry expertise. For example, in the digital customer experience area, we're helping a global package delivery leader digitally transform the last mile deliveries by moving from cumbersome, handheld devices to smartphones, benefiting multiple stakeholders with a superior process and delivery experience.","Next, our Digital Operations practice is focused on transforming and hosting key processes, while leveraging automation and digital technologies. We enable core process transformation, driving deep business impact through automated, data-driven platforms and industry utilities. Our approach helps clients reengineer, digitize, manage, and operate their most essential business processes. Along these lines, we're helping a financial services client to more than double productivity in mortgage information processing by leveraging robotic process automation and self-learning, cognitive technology.","Finally, our Digital Systems & Technology practice helps clients simplify, modernize, secure, and transform IT backbones to run their business better. This practice continues to provide a critical foundation for the broader enterprise transformation efforts with our clients. For instance, we're helping a global agricultural company transform the majority of their application portfolio with agile and DevOp tools.","Now, an update on our key industry segments; our banking and Financial Services segment which consists of banking, capital markets, insurance, and transaction processing clients was down 1.5% sequentially and up 3.5% year-over-year, as many continue to struggle with the macro economic situation. Going forward, business drivers for institutions includes intensifying focus on customer centricity and on expanded revenue streams. They're shifting investment towards the areas offering transformational benefits including digital, automation, cloud, and agile development. We recently acquired Adaptra in Australia to augment our insurance expertise including Guidewire capabilities.","Our Healthcare segment, which consists are of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients grew 1.2% sequentially and 5.6% year-over-year. Going into 2017, our clients are focused on investments in digital transformation of their business, consumerism, and value-based reimbursements. Though there is a slight uptick in discretionary spend, our clients are currently tracking the future of the Affordable Care Act under the new administration and are cautiously proceeding with new initiatives. Our Healthcare clients continue to see significant value in our combined TriZetto and Cognizant offerings. Both smaller and larger payers are showing increasing interest in platform-based solutions.","Now turning to our performance by geography; from a geographic standpoint, North America grew 0.2% sequentially and 7.2% year-over-year. Europe declined 0.4% sequentially after a 3.5% negative currency impact, and grew 2.7% from last year after a 9.5% negative currency impact. Continental Europe grew 7.4% sequentially and 21.9% over the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by ramp-ups from recent wins in Germany, France, and the Nordics.","The UK declined 6.8% sequentially and 10.8% year-over-year after a 4.2% and 15.4% negative currency impact, respectively. Finally, we saw continuous strong transaction in the rest of the world which was up 2.9% sequentially and 17.8% year-over-year. Digital transformation is indeed accelerating among our clients and we're excited to be well-positioned to help them succeed in the New Year.","Before I turn the call over to Karen, let me comment briefly on a topic that I know is in the minds of many of you. As you know, there has been considerable discussion recently on the topic of skilled immigration in the U.S. This has been an ongoing discussion for many years. Cognizant's business growth requires us to attract and retain the best and brightest talent to meet our client's needs for technology, business processes, and consulting solutions and services.","The plan we have announced today will require us to continue to build our teams in the U.S. and in other geographies around the world where we operate. Consistent with this need, we continue to focus on taking steps to ensure that we have access to a robust supply of talent in the U.S. In 2016, we hired over 4,000 U.S. citizens and residents. To support this, we have built out a robust network of over 20 U.S.-based delivery centers and plan to add additional capacity in 2017. Over the next several years, we plan to significantly increase the size of our U.S. workforce.","For over five years, we have had an active program to recruit qualified students from the undergraduate and MBA schools across the country. We continue to scale up this program. As we scale up our M&A program, we expect this to contribute to our local workforce around the world. And, finally, to address the longer-term talent needs, we continue to make investments in training and retraining programs that help U.S. workers obtain in-demand technology and business skills.","Now, I'll turn over the call to Karen to discuss our financial performance.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. You heard from Frank and Raj how we are accelerating our shift to digital, while ensuring that the core business remains robust and healthy. Additionally, as an ongoing commitment to creating shareholder value, we are also enhancing our financial model in two principal ways. Before getting into details of the quarter, I'd like to explain our new financial strategy in greater depth.","First, we are instituting a robust capital return program that rewards our long-term shareholders. Given our size and scale, our strong cash flow profile, and the confidence we have in our future growth opportunities, we are stepping up our capital return commitment to our shareholders. We have thought very carefully about our future cash balances in making these decisions and, despite a considerable capital return program, we expect to maintain balance sheet strength and sufficient financial flexibility to run our business and take advantage of both organic and inorganic investment opportunities that may present themselves in the future.","We are announcing an expanded share repurchase program and, subject to board declaration, announcing the initiation of a dividend. Over the next two years, we expect to return a total of approximately $3.4 billion in capital through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We are initiating a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share starting in Q2 which will amount to approximately 1% dividend yield based on yesterday's closing price.","We plan to utilize $2.7 billion of cash to step-up our share repurchase program significantly over the next two years. This plan includes a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase which we expect to commence in Q1. We anticipate spending an incremental $1.2 billion during 2017 and 2018 to buy back stock in the open market. The capital return plan is expected to be funded by current U.S. cash balances, future U.S. cash flows, and incremental debt financing. Beginning in 2019, we plan to return 75% of U.S. free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","Second, as Frank said, we are changing how we manage our operating margins. We will strive to balance our revenue and profitability, and in doing so, we'll move beyond the historical 19% to 20% non-GAAP operating margin target. We will accelerate our pursuit of broad-based, high value digital transformation work and reassess less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace.","We will leverage our scale to improve cost in 2017 and 2018 through cost optimization efforts and intelligent sourcing. And we will aggressively use automation to drive the optimization of traditional offerings such as application, infrastructure, and process services. Some of these efficiencies will be offset by critical investments in building new digital capabilities as well as potential pricing pressure in some traditional lines of service.","Given our evolving mix of business towards higher-margin digital revenues and our focus on driving continuous improvement in our business, we believe that we can expand our margins to 22% in 2019, while ensuring sufficient investments in the capabilities and solutions required to drive digital transformation for our clients.","But what gives us confidence that we can deliver these higher margins? In 2016, we conducted a comprehensive review of our cost structure including our delivery and SG&A cost. This initiative helped us to identify 360 basis points to 440 basis points of margin enhancements that we can generate over the next three years through levers such as increased employee utilization, an optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure, and leveraging our corporate functions spend more effectively. The implementation of these savings initiatives will allow us to continue to invest in our digital capabilities, while still delivering improved margins over time.","These financial targets are based on our current knowledge of industry trends, and we will continue to monitor and evaluate the possible impact of any potential events such as changes to immigration or tax policies or changes in pricing and wage inflation trends, which can have either a negative or a positive impact on our margin profile and overall financial model. As a management team, we remain very confident in our business and believe these changes to our financial model will enhance shareholder value over the long-term.","Now, let me give you details on our fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter revenue of $3.46 billion met our guidance and represented growth of 0.3% sequentially and 7.1% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $23 million or 70 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $51 million, or 160 basis points.","During the quarter, we adjusted our estimate of 2016 incentive compensation downward to reflect the performance of the business during the year. This revision positively impacted our Q4 operating margin by approximately 215 basis points.","Non-GAAP operating margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 18.7%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 was within our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.88. Our non-GAAP operating margins in Q4 were below our normal range due to certain investments that we made in 2016 in our Digital Operations business in certain geographies, combined with approximately $20 million of costs incurred in the quarter due to the ongoing FCPA investigation.","While these expenses will continue to negatively impact non-GAAP operating margins in 2017, we expect that the optimization efforts that I just outlined will offset the negative impact of these expenses and begin to drive margin improvements in Q2 and beyond. For the full-year 2016, revenue of $13.49 billion represented growth of 8.6% year-over-year including a negative currency impact of 120 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.5% and non-GAAP EPS was $3.39.","As a reminder, the remittance of cash from India to the U.S. that occurred in the second quarter had an incremental tax impact of $24 million in quarter four and $238 million for the full year. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.04 per share impact on our Q4 GAAP EPS that was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the non-recurring nature of the transaction.","Turning to additional details on our financial performance, consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.5% and 42.5% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 0.5% sequentially and 5.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue was roughly flat versus last quarter and grew 8.7% from Q4 a year ago, driven by strength across Cognizant Digital Operations and the infrastructure portion of Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology.","During the fourth quarter, 39.3% of our revenue came from fixed-priced contracts. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 329.","We added 4,400 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 15.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 350 basis points from the year-ago period. Total head count at the end of the quarter was 260,200 employees globally, of which 243,700 were service delivery staff. Offshore utilization was 74%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was 79%, and on-site utilization was 90% during the quarter.","Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $5.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this is up by $329 million from the quarter ending September 30 and up by $626 million from the year-ago period.","Moving on to receivables, which were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter; we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 71.8 days. This is down almost three days compared to last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $349 million, down from $424 million at the end of Q3. We billed approximately 56% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables.","Our outstanding debt balance was $881 million at the end of the quarter and there were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Turning to cash flow, operating activities generated $598 million, financing activities generated $11 million of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were $87 million during the quarter.","Before turning to guidance, I would like to take a moment to update you on our ongoing FCPA investigation, which is being conducted under the oversight of the audit committee. The investigation has progressed significantly. We have identified a total of approximately $6 million in potentially improper payments relating to company-owned facilities in India, an increase of $1 million from what we reported at the end of the third quarter.","During the fourth quarter we recorded an out-of-period correction of $1 million. To-date, of the identified $6 million in potentially improper payments, we have now recorded a total of $4.1 million in corrections. We have continued to aggressively implement remediation measures, including in compliance, the real estate function in India, and procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in India.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and for the full-year 2017. For the full year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $14.56 billion to $14.84 billion which represents growth of 8% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.","For the first quarter of 2017, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.51 billion to $3.55 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be at least 18.7% during Q1 and at least 19.5% for the full-year 2017 as the benefits of further margin optimization begin to accrue. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.83.","Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. Our guidance does not assume any potential impact from events like changes in immigration or tax policies. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 611 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%.","For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $3.53. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 597 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%. This guidance also includes the impact of the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase which we expect to commence in Q1 subject to market conditions. We will provide additional details on full share count impact once the purchase has been completed.","Operator, we can open the call for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, so I thought that's nice, exciting stuff with the new plan. I guess I'll ask the revenue impact or revenue implications of some of these changes in this period from 2017 to 2019. Can you comment on that and what that might look like and maybe what you expect your digital revenue mix to be by 2019? Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hi, Tien-Tsin, this is Frank. Thanks. Yeah, we are excited about the plan that we have announced today. I think that we've been talking to you for some time about this shift to digital, and this gives us an opportunity to really accelerate that shift. What I would say is that, as we think about that shift to digital, we will of course emphasize the growth in the digital side of the business; making the investments that we need to scale up both organically and inorganically, that side of the business.","And as we said, we'll continue to be thoughtful about growing the core business, making sure that we invest to stay competitive there. We think that the core business is an important part of our ability to serve clients and our ability to be an integral part of their digital futures, because as you know, most of our clients are building their new digital capabilities on the backbone of their traditional systems.","Having said that, we do expect that in the core business we're going to make thoughtful choices about the business areas on which we focus and, if appropriate, pivot away from lower margin part to that business. And so, that may have somewhat of an impact on revenue, but we think it'll be offset by growth \u2013 above-company average growth in the digital side of the business. So, as we execute on this plan our commitment is to continue to deliver high-quality, sustainable growth and we think this plan enables us to do that.","As it relates to our digital revenue, as you know, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we're breaking it out for the first time for you based on feedback that we've received from all of you. It was approximately 23% of revenue in 2016. And as I said, we expect going forward that it will continue to grow above-company average. I don't have targets for where it'll wind up, but we'll just periodically report progress to you on that number so you can get a sense of how that shift is unfolding.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. All the best with the new strategy here. Just curious on slide 9 you talk about 120-basis-point to 200-basis-point impact, does that incorporate, I guess, the shift you said to more U.S. and other non-Indian locations? And does that \u2013 what kind of pricing assumption is based in there, and is there any higher implied visa cost in that number as well? Thank you.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Ed, good morning. This is Karen. So, as you mentioned on slide 9 of the investor deck that's out on the website, we talk about the different components of the 22% non-GAAP operating margin target in 2019. And as you mentioned on the right side of that slide, in particular, we talk about some headwinds that will result in about 120 basis point to 200 basis point impact over the next three years.","That's a combination of all of the things on that part of the slide, which includes the talent strategy, current industry pricing trends, and then some of the investments that we're obviously making in digital and automation and so forth. Really, what that assumes is no change in pricing based on what we've seen to-date, so no further deterioration. And as Frank talked about, we're going to be fairly selective in the types of work that we'd go after particularly around the core business in the future.","And then around the talent strategy, as both Frank and Raj talked about, obviously we've been expanding our local hiring and retraining and so forth in various geographies around the world, but assumes essentially that we continue on that path with no significant changes in terms of immigration policy or so forth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Could you give us a sense of your spending intentions of your Financial Services customers for 2017, clearly, given big changes with a new administration, higher net interest margin and attempts to roll back Dodd-Frank?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. Hi, David. This is Raj Mehta here. Look, with our Financial Services clients, they're obviously in much better shape going into 2017 than they were in 2016. And as you touched on, the increasing interest rate environment some roll-backs in regulation, I think it's a little too early for us right now. We're cautiously optimistic about what that means in terms of spending patterns moving forward. But right now, it's a little too early for us to see the impact of those changes.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Congrats on this shift in strategy. Just touching on the digital one more time, 23% of total revenues, I appreciate that statistic. Can you just touch on, again, I guess \u2013 I know someone else asked the growth profile of that over time or what it can get to. What is it growing at right now? And then what is the rest of your business, the components of the rest of your business growing and if you could break us down now that we have that piece the growth profiles of each of the other pieces along with digital itself today?","And then, Karen, just a follow-up on liquidity and capital return strategy, can you give us a little more granularity, the sources of capital and cash coming for the buyback and the dividend? And what target leverage ratio you have now? Thanks again, guys.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Sure, Darrin. So, on the digital growth, as Frank mentioned in his prepared remarks, it is growing significantly above company average; he did give a specific number. But I think, as you would expect and as others have seen, it is certainly been the big growth driver for quite \u2013 for the last, certainly, several quarters and the last couple of years now and we would expect that to continue.","Obviously, it does mean that other parts of the business \u2013 some of the core parts of the business are growing slower than company average. And then from an industry perspective, as we saw last year, obviously, we had some slower growth in banking and Healthcare, some of which was specific situations around Healthcare with M&A and so forth, but certainly a little bit slower growth there. So, I think very consistent with what others are seeing in the marketplace and the demand from clients which is that digital will be the high-growth driver for the coming years, and we would expect that to continue to be a meaningful driver for us.","In terms of the sources of cash, at the end of the year, we have about \u2013 as you'll see when we file our 10-K, we have about $1.1 billion of cash in the U.S. today, and the cash \u2013 the funds for the dividends and the buybacks will come from our existing cash balances in the U.S., from U.S. free cash flow that we will generate over the next coming years. And then we will, as necessary, lever the balance sheet up a little bit.","As you know, we have a revolver today, which has about $750 million of capacity in it and then, if necessary, we would take debt on beyond that, but certainly, our intent is to maintain a very strong balance sheet, maintain very strong investment-grade rating if and when we went to the rating agencies to do that, and to maintain a lot of flexibility for both organic and inorganic investments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, and congrats on the transition from me as well. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talked about, obviously, you're going to ramp up your level of acquisition activity as you kind of accelerate into digital businesses. Do you have a set target in terms of what you might anticipate to spend? How aggressive you might be on that front? And then maybe a follow-up with how the pipeline looks as you head into the New Year?","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. Brian, it's always been the case that we focus first on the quality of acquisitions and we're selective on making sure that the acquisition \u2013 particularly as we look at the tuck-in acquisitions that they are focused on achieving one or more of a specific set of goals that we're looking for: technology, industry, capability, geography. Those are the major criteria that we look at.","So, as a result of that, I don't have a specific spend target or a specific volume target, but as you know and as you saw, we did a number of acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2016, and I would expect that the pace would continue at that level or maybe a little bit even ahead of that. We also, in 2016, did a couple of investments and the first time that we've taken investments in promising companies that we think are complementary to the company and I think you should expect to continue to see us doing some of that as well.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got that. And maybe just to follow up, are you seeing a change in the valuation and competitive nature of these deals, or are you kind of shooting above where most of that deal competition is in terms of size of deal or what you can bring to the table from a Cognizant point of view?","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","I'm looking to Karen as well to see if she has a different perspective. I don't think that we've seen the market change meaningfully in terms of valuation for the kinds of firms that we're looking for. Obviously, there are valuation differences between what I would think of as traditional services, digital services, and then platform or IP-based companies, but those are well understood. I don't think there's been meaningful change in that over, let's say, the last 12 months.","And as I said in my prepared comments, we continue at the moment to focus primarily on looking at tuck-in acquisitions to expand our digital capabilities. Really right now focused on expanding digital across the industry segments and focusing on expanding digital across the geographies around the world where we operate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, and congratulations on the capital allocation program. My question is on immigration. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about \u2013 I understand fully that you're increasing your hiring in the U.S., but if there are changes to the current H-1B program as it stands today, potentially a salary bid process or some other process that would change kind of the minimum floor on labor rates, would you consider accelerating the hiring in the U.S., or would you be more likely to sort of just continue to request H-1Bs at the same level as you are now? Maybe just comment on the broader outlook there from a policy perspective. Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Jim, it's Frank. Look, first of all, I would say that it's very difficult for us to speculate on potential changes to the program there. As you know, even currently, many alternative proposals out there, and over the last several years, have been even more. I would say that our intent has always been and continues to be to scale and to hire in the U.S. as aggressively as we can. As Raj said in his prepared comments, last year we hired over 4,000 citizens and permanent residents. But we also have to continue to supplement that with talent from around the world, because we do see shortages of talent in certain areas.","We are trying to address that by focusing on retraining and re-skilling. But I think going forward you should expect to see that that will continue to be somewhat of a balance. We will continue to be as aggressive as we possibly can on scaling up and focusing on local recruitment, but I believe that there will be some prudent balance between those two things going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on that question and one other. But just to be clear, so in the context of raising the margin target to the 22%, you haven't factored in anything sort of extraordinary for, sort of, the visa reform. I just want to understand the context of it. Is it just too speculative at this point and you'll deal with it in an extraordinary \u2013 sort of on an extraordinary basis?","And the other question I had is just for Karen, sort of, just thinking about the cadence to get to the 22% margin target in 2019 and I would assume there's a certain normal level of revenue growth embedded in that to get a fair amount of SG&A leverage, which would be a key part of the margin story.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. So, Glenn, this is Karen. On the immigration and what's baked into the margin, I think, as we said in our comments and it's highlighted also in the deck that's on the website, we have assumed sort of current status for immigration. We've obviously assumed that we will continue expanding our local hiring in the markets in which we operate, but we have not factored in any material changes to the immigration policy. At this point, it is just too speculative to try and make that determination. So, we will address that if and when the time comes.","In terms of the cadence to get to the 22%, as we mentioned, our guidance for Q1 assumes that we have flat margins with Q4, and then on a full-year 2017 basis, that we'll be at least 19.5%, which is where we landed for the full-year 2016. So, what you will see is that the benefits of the margin optimization, those actions are already starting to be underway and will continue to increase as the year goes on and as we move into 2018. And so, we will see improvement as we go through the year.","And as we mentioned, in my comments, that's a three-year program to generate the 360 basis points to 440 basis points of margin opportunity, but the vast majority of that happens in the first two years. And so, you'll see some improvement this year to offset some of the pressures we've seen \u2013 or the investments that we made last year. And then as we move into 2018, you'll get the full benefit of the 2017 actions as well as incremental actions that will happen in 2018. And then in 2019 is when we would expect to generate the 22% non-GAAP operating margin base for the full-year 2019. So, it'll be phased; it will incremental each year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. One question and a quick follow-up. On top line, when I look at fourth quarter results, Cognizant came in towards the low end of guidance for revenue, but the first quarter guide for 2017 shows a solid pick-up in top line growth. I think the midpoint of the range is something like 2% sequential. I remember last year I think Cognizant's growth was down 1% sequential 1Q 2016, so I'm just curious on the change in demand you're seeing there for a stronger pick-up starting in this first quarter?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, I think, Bryan \u2013 this is Karen. As you said clearly, Q1 this year looks like it will be much stronger than Q1 last year. I think we are seeing good demand across the business at this point. Last year, if you remember, in January is when the banking sector really started to fall apart and that put a lot of pressure on our Q1 numbers. We have not seen that this year. We have our January results. January came in exactly as we expected. So, we do think that Q1 is off to a good start.","The other thing is a small impact but impacted sequential growth a little bit is, as we have said when we did the TriZetto acquisition, part of our objective there is to move into more annuity stream revenue versus just pure license sales. So, if you remember Q4 is always their strongest because of the license sales. We've started to make that transition, so it's a little bit less of an impact than it would have been in prior periods with them as well which obviously helps fund the overall Q1 number.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. And I'll just add to that, in addition to Financial Services, we're starting to see some \u2013 we had a lot of M&A in Healthcare in the beginning of 2016. So, we're starting to see some resolution, at least some of the discretionary spend. As you know, one of the large M&A transaction has been decided on and you're starting to see some discretionary spend starting to happen on that since that didn't move forward. And so you have a little bit of clarity in that. Plus, in addition to that, we have \u2013 we've talked a lot about our platform play that TriZetto BPaaS opportunities and you're seeing good traction in those areas as well. That's helped bring the stability with Healthcare.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph A. Vafi - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I think first if maybe \u2013 this would be little more theoretical but is there a way to quantify how much work that maybe being done right now by visa holders could be migrated back to offshore facilities without impacting service levels? And then secondly just a housekeeping item, is the accelerated buyback built in to the guidance on the EPS line for 2017? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hey, Joe. It's Frank. I'll let Karen answer the second part of your question while I think about the first part.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Joe, I think as we mentioned, we have baked in an estimate of the impact of the ASR into the share count. So, nothing in Q1 but in the full-year share count for Q2 \u2013 or I'm sorry, for the full year rather the 597 million does assume that we are able to start \u2013 launch the ASR sometime in Q1.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. And Joe, to the first part of your question, it is somewhat theoretical. What I would say is that, as I said I think in my prepared remarks, as we shift towards digital, those are the kinds of services where the value of colocation with the client is actually higher. You need to be close to the client. You need a more consultative approach. And so, I expect that those services will require us to continue to have folks on-site and scale up, as we said, our workforces around the world.","I think if you look at the traditional business, there might be an opportunity to optimize a little bit around the edges in terms of what I think of as shoring, that is moving work to other parts of the world, but I don't think that's a significant opportunity. It might move the ratio between our on-site and offshore teams by a point or two, but I don't think it's going to be substantially higher than that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering, do you think raising the margin profile, just given the commoditization and your efforts to invest in digital, might make you a little less competitive? And can you give us more color on the current margin profile in digital? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. Obviously we thought long and hard about this, Joseph. I think that we think we've landed in a good place that balances our ability to invest in the business. We were careful to make sure both when thinking about our income statement and our balance sheet that our first priority was to make sure that we protected our ability to invest in the business, to continue to do the things that will allow us to make the transition to digital; and at the same time, be prudent about, in the case of the balance sheet, returning capital to shareholders, and in the case of the income statement, increasing our margins. I think at 22%, we feel like we're \u2013 it's a good solid place to be. It's a balanced margin profile, and puts us squarely in the competitive set, but also allows us to make the right investments in the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of outlook for the various pieces of Healthcare in 2017? I think you spoke very briefly on that so maybe talk a bit also about what you're seeing in pharma? And then does guidance \u2013 top-line growth guidance for this year also include the impact of the acquisitions that you've done so far and what would that be? Thanks.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. So, I'll kick it off and talk about just guidance for the year and, Karen, you can jump in on the acquisitions. But look, I think, overall we're pleased that we're off to a good start in 2017. Obviously, when we entered the year in 2016 we had the M&A overhang on the Healthcare deals and the financial Brexit and other issues that we had in the Financial Services industry.","So, going into 2017, we're on to a positive start. I think there's still some caution out there. There is still \u2013 clients are still, obviously, nervous about what will happen with Affordable Care Act and they're waiting to see what the current administration will do towards that. But overall, we're seeing good pick-ups in terms of some of the discretionary spend in Healthcare. And in addition to that, like I touched on earlier, we are seeing a lot of traction on our BPaaS solutions that we've had around TriZetto. And I think we'll see continued acceptance of that model within other payers as well too.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Moshe, this is Karen. On the M&A front, obviously, we've made a couple of small acquisitions in Q4, and then we have the investments that we did earlier in the year in ReD and a couple of other acquisitions and in Measure as well. ReD and Measure, remember, don't generate any revenue for us. Those are just investments. So, there's no revenue there. And then from the rest of the group, it's less than 2% of the revenue. So, about 1% of revenue for the year would be from the rest of the acquisitions; it's very small.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Good. So with that, we'll wrap up. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. And, as always, we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release with the company's first quarter 2013 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Francisco, please go ahead.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to report that Cognizant's first quarter performance was strong and ahead of our guidance for the quarter. First quarter revenue was $2.02 billion, a sequential increase of 3.7% and an increase of 18.1% year-over-year. We maintained our non-GAAP operating margin at the high end of our target range. The revenue includes $8.2 million from the C1 Group acquisition, which we closed this quarter. This acquisition involves 6 companies from C1 Group that will expand our capabilities in Germany and Switzerland. Germany is the largest IT market in Europe, and I'm particularly excited about what this acquisition does to enhance our front-end presence in that market with the goal of bringing the strength of our global delivery model to German clients.","Before turning the call over to Karen to outline our financial results, Gordon and I would like to cover 3 topics with you today: first, we'll provide a perspective on customer spending and market demand; secondly, we'll provide you some color on our execution against our 3 Horizon strategy; and finally, we'll share information about our continued drive to ensure that we have the team and operating discipline in place to continue to scale the business. I'll provide you with the headlines on these items, and then I'll ask Gordon to provide you with further details. We'll also spend time on the call today to provide you our thoughts on the emerging topic of United States immigration reform, of which you've no doubt heard.","Let's start with -- let's first start with customer spending and market demand. While economic uncertainty is leading some companies to be more cautious, we are encouraged that market demand remains healthy. This demand comes across the 2 dimensions of run better and run different. As a reminder, run better is where we help clients manage their current businesses for greater efficiency and effectiveness. And run different involves helping clients improve the positioning of their businesses for the future. We haven't seen a material shift in decision-making or in the demand environment amongst our customers. As we look across our business, while there continue to be pockets of weakness, we're encouraged the majority of our businesses are experiencing positive demand and growth characteristics. Gordon will walk you through the specific areas of strength and weakness in the business in a few minutes.","Secondly, let's touch on the 3 Horizon model. You'll recall that we introduced the 3 Horizon model 3 years ago to manage reinvestment in our services portfolio, and I'm pleased to say that this approach has decisively helped us to stay well positioned ahead of the rapidly changing complexion of market demand. We continue to see positive momentum in our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 businesses. As a reminder, last year, we were pleased to share with you that our Horizon 2 businesses, consulting, business process outsourcing and infrastructure management, represent about 20% of total company revenue. These businesses continue to grow nicely, and I'm pleased with our competitive position in each one.","And with our ongoing focus on investment, the Horizon 3 offerings continue to gain traction faster than we had expected because of the strength of market demand and the distinctiveness of our value proposition. As a reminder, Horizon 3 is a class of emerging offerings in 3 areas: new markets, new delivery models and new technologies.  This quarter, I'd like to share 2 noteworthy aspects of our Horizon 3 business, one regarding new technologies and one regarding new delivery models.","In the area of new technologies, we've often spoken to you about growing client adoption in social, mobile, analytics and cloud, the so-called SMAC technologies. Over the last 18 months, we've built out our capabilities in each of the SMAC areas, both in terms of end-to-end services and also in terms of intellectual property and thought leadership. Our solutions in these areas are a key part of our service to help our clients run different and we have a solid pipeline of SMAC opportunities. This year, we expect to deliver about $500 million in SMAC-related services. While the significant majority of this work will be done with our existing client base, I'm also pleased to see many new clients whose first engagement with Cognizant is in the SMAC area. Our progress in the SMAC area is validated -- is validation of our run different value proposition, our strategy of reinvestment and a testament to the strength and versatility of our client relationships.","Another aspect of our Horizon 3 efforts is in the area of new delivery models. A critical goal of new delivery models is to break the linearity between revenue growth and headcount growth, or in other words, to drive nonlinear revenues, and we are doing this with solutions that address the changing dynamics in our clients' industries. To that end, we're in the process of launching our portfolio of Cognizant BusinessCloud solutions, which enable clients to quickly deploy a range of on-demand business and IT solutions without the larger capital outlays and longer implementation time lines that are sometimes associated with traditional on-premise solutions.","The portfolio includes offerings that leverage 2 models: software as a service delivery models or SaaS, which centrally hosts software and associated data on the cloud; and business process-as-a-service or BPaaS, which integrates the SaaS platform together with people and process capabilities to deliver an end-to-end business or technology outcome for a client. Our investment in BusinessCloud will address the increasing client demand for business models that deliver outcome with a cost mix that's increasingly variable rather than fixed.","Let me offer a few examples of our BusinessCloud solutions that enable this type of business model. Our assetSERV platform helps organizations manage digital content like images, videos and audio and to access them anytime, anywhere across multiple devices. As the quantity of digital content that organizations have to manage explodes, the platform is of particular interest to sales and marketing departments and also to functions like engineering and human resources. assetSERV reduces the cost of managing digital content, improves the time to market and increases the quality of content. We have sold assetSERV to 6 clients and have more in the pipeline. Our Cloud360 solution provides the client organization with a one-stop platform to manage applications across private, public and hybrid clouds. In addition to lowering the total cost of managing applications and improving their performance, Cloud360 makes it easy to rapidly deploy and scale systems up or down based on realtime response to changing business needs. More than 15 customers are using Cloud360.","And one of our newest BusinessCloud solutions is a clinical solution that supports the entire clinical trial process for life sciences customers, fundamentally changing the way research and development is performed. The solution reduces cycle time through a process and technology automation so drugs can get to market faster, and improves collaboration across all the participants in the trial process via social and mobile capabilities and virtual global trial teams. It also enhances data visibility through global portals and dashboards and provides proactive analytics to identify and mitigate risks earlier in the drug development life cycle. I'm excited about these solutions and others that are emerging out of the Horizon 3 area.","Let me close with a few words on operational excellence. As we scale the business, we continue to look ahead to make sure we have the internal operating strength to deliver well and maintain our track record of deep customer and employee satisfaction. That requires continued focus on operating excellence across our people, process and internal technology systems. To that end, we announced today that Sridhar Thiruvengadam will take the role of Chief Operating Officer of Cognizant. As COO, Sridhar's role will be to ensure that our people functions, our internal systems and technology and our other core infrastructure are solid, cost-efficient, secure and scalable. Sridhar is a Cognizant veteran who's been with the firm since its inception, and I'm confident that he will provide strategic leadership and vision in developing the blueprint to optimize and scale Cognizant's global backbone to meet the future demands of the business.","I'd now like to hand the call over to Gordon to discuss the proposed immigration reform legislation and then to give you color on our operating results. Karen will then review our financial results, after which we'll open the floor to Q&A. Gordon?","Gordon J. Coburn","Thank you, Francisco. Before I discuss business performance for the first quarter, I'd like to update you on immigration. We realize that immigration reform and its impact on Cognizant is of great interest to many of you, so let's go through the facts, as well as our thoughts and expectations. On April 17, 8 senators, known as the Gang of Eight, introduced a bill addressing comprehensive immigration reform. The bill included inputs from constituencies with interest in family reunification, illegal immigration, border security and many other dimensions, including high-skill labor.","This bill serves as a starting point from which the U.S. Congress will begin to debate the issue. We were and continue to be an active participant in this discussion, including the effort to increase the number of high-skilled visas and streamline the green card process for permanent residency. This last point is quite important to us as we are one of the top applicants for green cards in the nation. This is part of our business model of hiring the best talent globally, many of whom want to make their permanent residence in America. We're also a large user of H&L temporary work visas. We're unable to find all the talent we need domestically each year, and we must source globally. Many of the people we bring to the U.S. on H&L visas we expect to stay here permanently as they get their green cards. We also recruit heavily in the U.S. with over 75 full-time recruiters to identify experienced talent. In addition, we recruit hundreds of students from U.S. universities, but that is not enough to serve our clients.","Although the recently introduced bill includes some important fixes to the green card process, there are also some clauses that would be detrimental to  Cognizant. These clauses include higher fees on visas, a requirement to pay above-market salaries to visa holders, potential restrictions on access to visas and constraints on the ability to have visa holders serve our clients. On the surface, one would be quite concerned when reading this proposal. However, it's very important to remember that this is the very beginning of the legislative process. As the House takes up the issue over the coming months, we expect that it will come at many of these issues, including the issues of importance to us from a very different perspective.","Based on our conversations in Washington, as well as our conversations with our clients, there is a clear understanding that the legislation as written would severely damage the U.S. economy, cost a tremendous number of high-quality jobs and create significant diplomatic and international trade challenges. Clearly, most politicians would not want these unintended consequences. Fortune 1000 companies across many industries rely on global talent to help them run their businesses and help them to innovate. They depend on the world-class minds that we bring to the table, as well as the efficiencies which enable them to invest for the future.","We are highly confident that our clients will weigh in on the issue at the appropriate time. It's business as usual for us and our clients. We will continue to work with our legislators to develop a comprehensive immigration reform package that strengthens the American economy. The current legislation does not meet that test, but we believe the final legislation, if any, will achieve that goal.","Now let's get back to the business. We're pleased to have delivered another strong quarter of industry-leading growth that was broad-based across our portfolio of services and geographies. We're encouraged by what we see in the market and by our competitive position both for the current year and longer term. I'd like to give you color on 2 areas that Frank just outlined, the demand environment and our services strategy. We're particularly pleased with the demand patterns across our industries and services as our ability to meet clients' dual mandate of run better and run different continues to gain traction. While there are some pockets of weakness, they are clearly outweighed by areas of strength.","Within Horizon 1, we continue to help customers drive higher levels of efficiency and productivity and drive reduced total cost of ownership through best-in-class processes and methodologies. Within Horizon 2 offerings, growth of our BPO practice was driven by continued cross-selling of our vertically aligned business process solutions into our existing customer base, as well as winning new logos for Cognizant. Notably, we saw good traction in leveraging our newer centers in Minot, North Dakota and Des Moines, Iowa to support our newer clients across financial services, health care and the technology segment for their BPO requirements.","Let me add, more generally, we're quite pleased with our continued progress in expanding our U.S.-based operation centers, which serves as Centers of Excellence across our service offerings. IT infrastructure services had a robust quarter with good wins across multiple industries, specifically financial services, retail and communications. During the quarter, we won a significant deal with a large financial services firm that involves building out a dedicated global operations center supporting a broad range of core infrastructure around systems, networks, databases and storage. The client found our model -- our operating model unique, combining consulting with highly productized and industrialized services that be sourced modularly. The quarter also saw traction around integrated infrastructure and application solutions, a trend that is gaining momentum with every passing quarter. Our ability to provide integrated support across applications and infrastructure is yielding solid results, helping clients to lower their total cost of ownership while raising service levels through a seamlessly integrated team.","Finally, Cognizant is increasingly being recognized for the differentiation we bring to clients in the next generation of IT infrastructure services, defined by mobility technologies, virtualization and enterprise application solutions that deploy and manage smartphone and tablet applications. In this context, we're honored that Forrester Research recently named Cognizant as a leader in the North American workplace services outsourcing wave for 2013, and called out our compelling vision for the future of workplace services, top score for client feedback categories and well-articulated strategy.","Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, also saw a strong quarter, and we're very happy with the way CBC is shaping up and driving mind share amongst CXOs, resulting in stronger market share gains. Across strategy consulting, program management consulting, operations consulting and IT strategy, we saw healthy traction with marquee clients. We believe our deep domain expertise and management consulting strength has not only enabled us to deepen existing client relationships but has also enabled us to win new clients based on the strength of our consulting value proposition.","Looking at our performance from an industry perspective. During the quarter, our financial services segment, which includes our banking, capital markets and insurance clients, grew 5% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. The performance was primarily fueled by strong growth in banking, which continues to see an uptick in demand. Demand is driven by ongoing cost optimization among our larger clients, a steady pickup in regulatory projects and the growing importance of mobility and analytics.","Health care, which includes primarily payer and pharmaceutical clients, grew 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. We saw a pickup in consulting work as our payer clients continue to deal with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and in particular, the upcoming go-live date of health care insurance exchanges. As expected, work for our pharmaceutical clients continued -- work for our pharmaceutical clients remained constrained as that industry continues go through disruption due to the impact of patent cliffs. We expect spending in this segment will remain conservative as customers take a cautious approach with respect to their IT-related investments. However, there is increased interest in leveraging the SMAC stack to run their businesses differently.","Our retail manufacturing segment continues to show steady performance, growing 4% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. The potential for growth in this segment remains strong and our pipeline is robust. Demand in the retail segment remains healthy, with a growing need to focus on omni-channel commerce to address structural shifts in consumer buying behavior. Our other business segment also performed as expected during the quarter.","Moving on to our performance by geography. Growth in North America played out as anticipated. Europe grew by almost 7% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. As Frank mentioned, we completed the acquisition of 6 companies of the C1 Group during the second half of the quarter. Excluding revenues from the C1 Group, we grew 4% sequentially in Europe, further evidence that the trend of European clients adopting long-term outsourcing programs continues to gain traction. Our growth in the rest of the world continued to remain strong, growing 4.8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. We're especially pleased with our performance in Asia Pacific where we're seeing solid traction across the region, particularly in financial services, retail and manufacturing, and life sciences.","I'll now hand the call over to Karen to comment on our financial performance and guidance.","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning to everyone. As detailed in our press release, our first quarter revenue grew 3.7% sequentially and 18.1% over last year to $2.02 billion, ahead of our guidance of $2 billion from last quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.9%, at the high end of our target range of 19% to 20%, while our GAAP operating margin was 18.1% for the quarter. Consulting and technology services, formerly known as application development, represented 49.7% of revenue; and outsourcing services, formerly known as application management, was 50.3% for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 14.2% year-over-year and 2.2% sequentially. Outsourcing services grew 22.1% year-over-year and 5.3% sequentially.","32.9% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts during the first quarter and grew by 24% year-over-year, reflecting further acceptance of the output-based managed services model of engagement by our clients. As expected, on a sequential basis, our pricing was stable during the first quarter. We closed the quarter with 1,000 active customers, and the number of accounts which we consider to be strategic increased by 7. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 221. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic customers embracing a wider range of Cognizant services at an earlier stage in the relationship.","Our fully diluted share count for the quarter was 305.2 million shares, an increase of approximately 1.4 million shares from Q4. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 216,000 shares at an average price of $75.88 for a total cost of approximately $16.4 million. Since the end of the quarter, we have repurchased an additional 915,300 shares at an average price of $62.80 for a total cost of approximately $57.5 million. Today, the company announced that the Board of Directors has authorized an expansion of our existing stock repurchase program by $500 million, bringing the total authorization under the current repurchase program to $1.5 billion. To date, 14.8 million shares at a cost of $940.5 million, have been repurchased under this program.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $119 million from December 31. The slight reduction in our cash balance was primarily due to the acquisition of the C1 Group, as well as employee bonus payouts in March.","During the first quarter, operating activities generated approximately $73.5 million of cash. Financing activities generated approximately $16.9 million of cash. This was comprised of net proceeds of $33.3 million related to option exercises and related tax benefits, as well as our employee stock purchase program. This was partially offset by expenditures of $16.4 million towards our share repurchase program. We spent approximately $72.2 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. During 2013, we continue to expect our capital expenditures to total approximately $400 million. In addition, during the quarter we had cash outflow of $139 million, net of cash acquired, related to the C1 acquisition. Based on our $1.7 billion receivable balance on March 31, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 76 days, up 4 days from the fourth quarter but essentially flat with the first quarter of last year. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $206 million, up from $183 million at the end of Q4. Approximately 62% of the Q1 unbilled balance was billed in April.","Net headcount increased by approximately 6,000 people during the quarter, including approximately 450 employees of the C1 Group. 29% of gross additions for the quarter were direct college hires while 71% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 162,700 employees globally, of which approximately 151,600 were service delivery staff. Attrition in the first quarter was 12.3%, higher than the Q4 attrition of 10% and Q1 2012 attrition of 10.6%. As we have discussed in the past, there is no consistent methodology in the industry to report attrition. We have historically reported attrition by annualizing the turnover which occurred within the quarter, including both voluntary and involuntary. Our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO and employees in our training program. Utilization decreased slightly on a sequential basis during Q1. Offshore utilization was approximately 67%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 71%, and on-site utilization was down slightly to 92% during the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our growth expectations for the second quarter of 2013, as well as the full year. For the second quarter of 2013, we are projecting revenue of at least $2.13 billion. For the full year 2013, we expect to continue to deliver industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we reaffirm our revenue guidance of at least $8.6 billion. This represents full year growth of at least 17%. As we previously discussed in February, our revenue guidance includes $90 million of expected revenue from the recently closed MediCall and C1 Group acquisitions but excludes the impact of any further acquisitions that may be closed during the course of the year.","During Q2 and for the full year 2013, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.06, which translates to GAAP EPS of $0.97. This guidance anticipates a Q2 share count of approximately 305 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.5%. Our guidance excludes any nonoperating FX gains or losses. For the full year 2013, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be at least $4.31, excluding estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.30 and acquisition-related expenses of $0.06, and our GAAP EPS will be at least $3.95. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 305 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.3%. It also excludes any nonoperating FX gains or losses.","Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","We noticed this morning a number of amendments that have been introduced, including some by Senator Hatch, trying to really address outplacement. On that topic, you also mentioned your trends on U.S. workforce and other green card capabilities. I think what we're looking to hear is really what your clients are thinking about this topic. I mean, have you seen any feedback from some of your customers in the sense of potentially looking to lobby Congress on the efforts? Could really you discuss how low unemployment is in technology and the potential implications of this provision?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, Darrin. The clients have made it very clear to us, they are happy to weigh in. The discussion is when should they weigh in. It's very important to remember this is going to be a long process. The Senate is going to make some amendments, their bill will come out and probably get passed next month. And then, the House is going to discuss it over a matter of many, many months, and obviously, the bill that comes out of the House, if any, will look dramatically different. So clients and the lobbyists for our clients, many of them think the right time to weigh in is much later in the process, not at this point. It's interesting. Senator Rubio, who's one of the Gang of Eight, this past weekend said publicly on one of the talk shows that the Senate bill as written, and I quote, \"cannot pass the U.S. House of Representatives.\" That's the person who wrote the bill who said that. So there's going to be a lot of discussion, not just in amendments to the Senate bill that will go up for vote next month, but much more importantly, with what happens with that House bill, which will probably look fundamentally and dramatically different. So the answer is clearly, our clients are saying, \"We will weigh in.\" But they are thinking very strategically about when is the appropriate time to weigh in.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Milunovich with UBS.","Peter Christiansen - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Peter Christiansen in for Steve Milunovich. I just want to dig a little bit more into the immigration reform issue and talk about what you're speaking -- what you're talking to your strategic accounts and what is your message to them. And also, in planning for contingencies, would -- in terms of the outplacement conditions, would the use of local subcontractors or even badge trading would those methods be feasible and how would it affect your business model?","Gordon J. Coburn","It's interesting. It's not so much what are we messaging to our clients, it's what are our clients messaging to us. They are reaffirming that we are essential to them running their businesses and being competitive in the environment. So our clients' messaging to us is, \"Cognizant, we need you. And we're going to help make sure you're around so you can continue to serve us both so we can be competitive in the global marketplace and so we can continue to innovate.\" And obviously, we're messaging a similar thing to clients, and I think both clients and us understand, once again, that the bill as written will not look like the bill that is ultimately passed by Congress, if anything is passed by Congress, because the bill as written would do dramatic harm to the U.S. economy. When we think about contingencies, remember there are so many permutations of what this bill would look like. If you look at the bill right now, it contradicts itself in places, so we obviously have various contingencies that we can leverage. There's no one silver bullet by any stretch of the imagination. But the fundamental issue that Congress is going to have to deal with this, is there are not enough U.S. tech workers. Unemployment, according to the government statistics, for tech work is less than 4%. Based on what I've learned at business school, that is full employment. So it's not as simple as you can say, \"Okay, Indian firms and U.S. firms that leverage global workforce can no longer do this work.\" The problem is there are not enough replacements, the U.S. economy will shut down. So I think when you think about contingencies, you have to think about contingencies that are realistic, and we're obviously -- we work through various scenarios. But there's so many permutations right now, to start talking about specific contingencies, I think, would be counterproductive.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso of Wells Fargo.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Are you receiving any pushback from clients on decision-making as they sort of watch this whole visa situation sort of progress here? Are you seeing any of that? And then the second question I had is are -- if the worst or semi-worst case happens, would acquisitions potentially be part of your response?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So obviously, we gave fairly healthy guidance just now for Q2. If we were seeing pushback from clients, we would not have taken such a bullish tone. We are not seeing any pushback. We are seeing decisions being made. The demand environment is quite healthy. People want our services. People need our services. I think the biggest change in the market is it's not just for cost efficiencies they need us, they're now looking to us very aggressively to help them to innovate and run their businesses differently. In terms of contingencies and would acquisitions play a role in it, would it not, that all depends on what a final bill would look like, if there is a final bill. So obviously, we think about a broad range of contingencies. But I wouldn't want to speculate on any specific contingency because, quite honestly, this -- the bill is going to morph, and right now, even in the bill as written, there's a lot of things that aren't clear.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JP Morgan Chase.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Looks like the over -- it's a safe bet on the immigration question, there's a number of questions you'll get there. I'll ask about -- actually I'll just ask about capital allocation. Happy to see the buyback. I'm curious, did you guys consider a dividend? And are you a buyer of the stock at these levels, even with the uncertainty with the immigration reform? It looks like you bought some stock back, but I'm not sure if you were held back with anything pre-earnings?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So let me start with what we bought back. Obviously, we were in the quiet period, but we had a 10b5-1 program in place the triggered as the stock declined, so that's why you saw repurchases this quarter even though we are in the blackout period. We spent a lot of time thinking about capital allocation. Long term, I think it's important that we articulate a fully comprehensive capital allocation strategy. We're not quite ready to do that yet because the market is changing so quickly and the opportunities for us and things like Horizon 3 are so tremendous right now. We don't want to box ourselves in until we fully understand that roadmap. We have been opportunistic on share repurchases. Obviously, by increasing the repurchase authorization today, we signaled we'll continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases. At this point, we weren't -- there was not active discussion about a dividend. When we think longer term about capital allocation, obviously, any Board of Directors would include all types of components of that. But that's not something that's a near-term item.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","If I could, just a clarification. Is there any sense you can give us on where you stand relative to the various thresholds or caps, the 75%, 50% kind of thresholds, if you took out the green cards? Just a snapshot of where you are today of your U.S. employee base versus the visa holders. And then secondly, if you could just talk a little bit about the consulting business. I believe you said it grew 2.2% sequentially. I just wanted to see if there's any color -- so it's a little slower than the corporate weighted average sequential growth. If you could just talk about was there any issues there. Or is that just kind of the broader macro slowdown and all consulting getting hurt? But more broadly just talk about the growth of the consulting business if you talk -- if you look at calendar year '13.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, let me touch base on your demographic question, and then Frank will comment on consulting. I understand why people want all these statistics, obviously to model all the potential scenarios that could happen, and there are so many potential scenarios. But as we've said in the past and we're going to continue to say this, for competitive reasons, the information on the demographics of our workforce we've never released, we do not intend to release going forward. In the end, we know investors want us to drive industry-leading growth, and that's what we're focused on. And I'd be reluctant to divulge the demographic statistics because I think that would disadvantage us as we compete in the marketplace, as we navigate these issues. So I appreciate why you asked the question, but we think it's in the best interest of the company, for competitive reasons, not to make that public. Frank, let me -- why don't you comment consulting?","Francisco D'Souza","The consulting and technology group, as we talked about it, includes both our pure play management consulting business and also our application development business. And you can think of that as somewhat of a proxy for discretionary spending, or it's a lot of discretionary spending in there. And that's playing out and played out in the first quarter just as we expected seasonally. Typically, in the first quarter, there's a little bit of softness in that business as budgets tend to get finalized in Q1. And we see the incremental discretionary spending kicking in towards the end of Q1 and then really into Q2. We've seen that same trend in past years. In the last couple of years, that trend hasn't quite held because of the sort of volatility in the marketplace. But generally speaking, in normal years, you see that in Q1. So I don't think there's anything to read into that. I think it's just normal seasonality of Q1 where discretionary spending tends to be a little softer than the rest of the year as budgets get finalized.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just hoping you could give us a sense of the potential client disruption that it cause, some of the things in this bill. I think one of the things you said is it would damage the U.S. economy. So I guess I just wanted to know how easy would it be for clients to switch to other employees, either be multinationals or some other group, because I think the relationships are a lot stickier than people think. And then secondly, you guys kind of highlighted the green card issue. We're hearing that workers applying for a green card would be excluded from some of the H-1B visa count, so just wanted to get if you're hearing the same thing and kind of why you emphasized the green cards.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So Bryan, I think you've hit a critical point. The work we do is extraordinarily sticky. We are deeply embedded into our clients. We are doing mission-critical work for our clients, both on ongoing maintenance and support, but equally importantly, on innovation work. And it's not like our clients could go out and hire these people. These people don't exist. That's the important thing here. There is a shortage of IT talent, based on virtually every study that you see, so the stickiness of our client base is absolutely tremendous. Bryan, what's the second part of your question again?","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on the green cards. I know you guys emphasized it, and then we're hearing that even -- potentially, that some of the guys even applying for green cards would be excluded from some of the counts on H-1B visa people?","Gordon J. Coburn","Yes. So the answer is if you look at the currently proposed Senate bill, some of those are excluded from the H-1B calculation. There's some amendments floating around that clarify some of that. But once again, I want to remind you that there's lots of permutations, there's lots of language that still has to be cleaned up in the Senate bill. But I think we should also have realistic expectations. The Senate bill that eventually gets passed next month will have clauses that are significantly detrimental to our industry. So when people see that, I don't think they should be surprised. That's certainly our expectation. That's very, very different than what would ultimately become law because the House hasn't even begun to debate this. And there's lots of different constituencies in the house that fundamentally don't agree with what's in the Senate bill. So it's -- the real action will happen after the Senate bill is passed, which will have some stuff we expect that would be negative for our industry. And then that as the House deals with this in the fall, you'll start to see something that we believe, or hope, will be palatable to our industry. And not just to our industry but much more important, palatable to our clients because it's going to be the clients that are going to weigh in and say, \"If you had everything that's in the Senate bill today, you would be doing irreparable harm to the banking industry, to the insurance industry, to the health care industry and many others.\" And I don't think senators and congressmen want to hurt the core American industry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I'm actually going to change the topic here at the risk of losing a visa question. But on the financial services front, I think you talked about a large deal you signed. Can you give us some color around what the sizes of the deals are there? And then you're off to a good start in the beginning of the year. Maybe you can give a little color around your view of annual guidance. Are you leaning towards a conservative because of the macro side of things? So first question is on financial services. What are you seeing on the large deal front? When did you sign it? Are you seeing more of those? And then the second one just on the guidance side.","Francisco D'Souza","Yes, let me take that. We're -- I was very pleased with our performance in financial services in the quarter. We grew 5% sequentially. And if you look at what's happening there, banking continues to do well. That growth is coming from both our largest clients who are expanding their work with us. But as you said, in prior quarters, we're also starting to see a pickup with mid-tier banks, particularly in the U.S., that are beginning now to more aggressively adopt the global delivery model. We're seeing demand both, as Gordon said, on what we think of as run better and on the run different side, so there's a continued focus on cost consolidation and push for productivity benefits. We see regulatory work starting to pick up. But some of that spend is coming at the expense of dollars that might otherwise go to discretionary development spending. And we're also starting to see growing importance of financial services as a result of mobility and analytics, as our financial services clients start to look at the digital bank kind of topic. When we look at guidance for the full year, we're pleased with how the year is playing out. We think that as we look to Q2 and the rest of the year, demand patterns are playing out as we expected and that gives us confidence that we're certainly on track to meet the full year guidance that we provided you. I think that it's fair to say that, assuming that the current demand trend continues to play out, we think there's some scope for outperformance in the full year. And obviously, we'll update you on that as we progress through the year.","Gordon J. Coburn","Yes, and let me just add to our thinking and philosophy on guidance this year. We realized, given all the macro events both in the economy and the political world that's going on, people are -- would like to understand that our numbers have certainty to it. So we decided to take a conservative stance on our guidance, leave ourselves some room to absorb some macro hiccups, if they were to occur. But as Frank mentioned, I think it's important to understand, if things continue to play out the way they currently are -- we had a nice momentum coming out of Q1 into Q2, and that's one of the key things that we look for each year. And that played out the way we like to see this year. So if that continues to play out and we don't have macro hiccups, certainly, we think there is room for outperformance this year. But we want to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arvind Ramnani with BNP Paribas.","Arvind A. Ramnani - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Most of my questions have already been asked, but just had a question on the buyback. I realize that's a bit of a subjective process, but what is the process of determining the level of the buybacks? Do you have a particular formula that you use to determine the range of the buybacks?","Gordon J. Coburn","You're right, it is more of an art than a science. Historically, where we've used 10b5-1 programs, it's been triggered by various -- not necessarily one, but various stock price thresholds. And if you look, last year, as we've executed on our share repurchase, we were more aggressive when the stock price was weaker rather than when it was stronger. So it is a little bit of an art versus a science, so there is no specific formula. The nice thing is, at the current levels, it certainly is accretive to our earnings in future years.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So unfortunately, I need to take you back to the visa reform topic. So guys, if the Senate's proposed reforms go through as is, major clients of Indian firms, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Walmart and GE, these clients could face some operational disruption and a lessened access to needed talent. On the other hand, if the visa reforms would primarily affect new visa holders, the client disruption would not necessarily be immediate for these clients, and these clients have many other things to lobby for in congress. So with that as a context, I have 2 questions. Are clients really aware of the risks that come out of these visa reforms yet? I mean, the checks that we've done, I mean, we've noticed clients that are still sort of figuring out what's going on, and they've yet to really react. And then the second question is are you able to ask your clients to lobby on your behalf in Congress when doing so could actually raise a concern about potential risks down the road of working with Cognizant and other Indian firms? So are the clients aware? And can you really solicit their help kind of in this troubled situation?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So Rod, our clients are extraordinarily sophisticated, and we work for the largest companies in every industry you can name. So they -- so I'm not concerned about us having the conversation with them that the bill as written would be detrimental to us and to them. They're sophisticated enough, they already know that, so there's nothing to hide here. Clients are different -- depending on the client, there are different levels of understanding what the bill is today. But as clients are understanding the bill, the clear conversations we're having with them, or they're having with us proactively, is that they understand that this bill would be detrimental to their business. And therefore, they're interested in -- so the discussion is around what is the appropriate strategy to communicate that to the Senate and House. Not \"Hey, don't do this because it's -- because we like Cognizant.\" But \"Don't this because it will hurt our bank or it'll hurt our insurance company.\" That's the message they're going to deliver, and that's the message they believe in. The key question is the timing. It's not clear that the appropriate timing for them to deliver that message is now because the Senate bill is going to pass, the Senate bill is going to have some ugly stuff on it and that's fine. The key is as the House picks it up and then it goes into conference late this year, early next year, I think that's when you'll see clients weigh in, in a significant way. But will clients understand it? Absolutely. Our clients have very sophisticated lobbying organizations. But they're going to lobby not based on, \"Please be nice to Cognizant.\" They're going to lobby on they need these people to remain competitive in the global environment. And if this bill passed as is, it would hurt every bank in the country, it would hurt every insurance company in the country, it would hurt every drug company in the country, and I don't think anyone in the Senate or House wants that to happen.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you spend some time maybe talk a bit about the Healthcare vertical? Are we still expecting to get maybe a better view on where we are, maybe following the June quarter, in terms of demand and fundamentals and kind of the outlook for the industry and maybe we're going to see some better demand coming through?","Gordon J. Coburn","Yes, so if you think about it, Healthcare, let's break into payers versus pharma. Pharma is going to be tough this year. That's baked into our plans. This is a year that's very challenging for pharma because of patent cliffs. The good news with pharma, when they look out to 2014 and 2015, things look okay. When we're talking to CIOs of pharmaceutical companies, in the last couple of months I've sat down with a fair number of them, they said, \"We got to get through '13, but then spending can increase again.\" So I think we appropriately reflected it in our plans, but pharma will be tough this year. Payers is a little bit more of the wildcard because of everything that is happening with health care exchanges and the Affordable Care Act. So payers is one those ones that could be one thing that could generate some upside opportunity for us. I think we've appropriately risk-adjusted it. But overall Healthcare is not going to be a big driver of growth this year, and we didn't expect it to, but it's playing out as expected or a little bit better than expected at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just following up on that. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are seeing some pockets of weakness. Did that refer to pharma or were there other areas that you were talking about? And then, separately in this SMAC stack work, for clients that are new -- I know that, that's not the majority, but for new clients, what industries do they fall in? Is that any different from your overall mix?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, let me quickly touch on the first thing, and then maybe, Frank, you can touch on the second. When I referred to pockets of weakness, primarily, I was referring to life sciences, that's correct. Yes, there are small things here and there, but that's the main driver of that comment. Frank, you want to talk about SMAC?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes, on the SMAC work, most of the work -- or let me say a lot of the work that we're doing in SMAC isn't discrete standalone work. It tends to be work that interfaces or plugs into our clients' bigger IT environment or into their legacy environment. And so by and large, the majority of the SMAC work that we're doing would be in industries that we know, and with our existing client base because we are building on top of an existing infrastructure that we're managing or that we are very familiar with, so largely follow the industry lines that we're operating in today.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a 2-part question here. First, can you give us some estimate of what percent of senior management's time is being spent related to the immigration bill, whether it be garnering political support or doing contingency planning? Do you expect that percentage to increase? And then just a secondary question on gross margins. I know you guys focus more on the operating line, but they were down to what I think may have been the lowest level ever and wanted to see if there's anything semi-structural going on there. Or were there any transient factors in the quarter?","Francisco D'Souza","Let me address the first question, Jason, and then, I'll ask Karen to talk about the gross margin. Look, we're keeping an eye on what's happening in Washington. As the senior leadership team, obviously, we're extraordinarily focused on it. But at the same time, we're making sure that it is not a distraction for the team. I've told the team that the most important thing for us to do here is to continue to run a good business. To focus on adding value to our clients, to continue to deliver the good results. And we've got a team of folks in Washington, Cognizant employees and advisers, that are helping us on the immigration front. I don't have a particular percent of time that I can point to specifically that we're spending. I think we're spending a little bit more time than we have in the past, obviously. But I still really don't think it's a distraction to the business at this point. Karen, do you want to talk about gross margin?","Karen McLoughlin","Absolutely. So Jason, as you mentioned, obviously, gross margin did tick down about 30 basis points from last quarter, and there's really a couple of things. So we talked on the call about pricing being stable, and pricing absolutely was. We did not see any deterioration in pricing for the quarter. What you did see was utilization ticked down a little bit, and some of that is obviously timing of when we onboard folks. We onboarded several -- quite a few lateral hires in Q1, and it will take a little bit of time for them to ramp up and start billing. So utilization bounces up and down a little bit depending on start dates and so forth. So it's primarily utilization-driven. If you remember, back in middle of Q3 last year, we also started our ING transaction, which took our on-site ratio up slightly from where it's been running so -- versus last year on-site ratio. They're slightly higher than where they typically have been so that's also a little bit of the decline. But it's primarily utilization decline. And that, obviously, we can manage. We've managed utilization up and down over the past.","Operator","The last question will be coming from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One quick distinction on the tax rates on GAAP versus non-GAAP. Karen, can you just give us the difference, if there is any, in terms of the EPS calculations that you're citing for the full year?","Karen McLoughlin","There was no material difference in the tax rate for GAAP versus non-GAAP.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","There shouldn't be? Okay, got it. And then on the growth rates of the different Horizons, can you talk a little bit about the expectations for growth for Horizon 1 versus Horizon 3 as we think about the guidance implied for 2013?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, Julio, it's Gordon. I think the way you should think about it and part of it is because of where they are in their life cycle and part of it is due to large numbers versus small numbers. Horizon 3 should grow faster than Horizon 2 and Horizon 2 should grow faster than Horizon 1, and that's the whole philosophy of these Horizons.","Operator","I will now turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you very much, and thanks, all of you, for joining us today. In summary, we're pleased with our performance in Q1, and we are confident that the -- with our outlook for 2013. In a challenging economic environment, we're encouraged that our value proposition of helping clients run better and run different is gaining traction and supporting a healthy demand for our services. So thank you for joining us, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions First Quarter 2013 Earnings call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice-President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q to be filed later today.","I would like now to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. This morning, I'd like to cover two topics: first, a few highlights from Q3, and second, since we're about two weeks away from Cognizant's Investor Day, I thought I'd give you a preview on what we'll be discussing.","Let's begin with the quarter. Third quarter revenue was $4.08 billion, within our guided range and up 8.3% year-over-year. Three of our four business segments delivered a strong performance in the quarter driven largely by the increasing adoption of digital across these segments. And in the fourth segment, banking and financial services, we see good growth in our digital offerings, which continues to be offset by pressure on run-the-bank spending. As a result, our digital revenue in the quarter grew in the low 20% range, well above company average and now over 30% of total revenue, reflecting the continuing shift across segments to digital revenues. Underscoring the relevance of our industry-specific digital services to clients, we continue to see our digital portfolio generate margins above the company average.","Our non-GAAP operating margin was 21.1% for the quarter, putting us on track to deliver on our full-year margin commitment. And quarterly non-GAAP EPS was $1.19. As these results suggest, our sustained emphasis on digital services is helping us win more business with attractive margins and deliver higher quality growth as clients shift more of their spending from traditional IT to digital services. Turning to guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be within a range of $4.09 billion to $4.13 billion. For the full year, we expect revenue to be within a range of $16.09 billion and $16.13 billion, a growth of 8.6% to 9%, and we remain confident in our previously stated guidance of achieving a non-GAAP operating margin in 2018 of approximately 21%.","Over the last couple of months, we have announced three acquisitions to further enhance our digital capabilities. Two of them, which closed earlier this month, relate to the Salesforce Platform where Cognizant has one of the industry's largest roster of certified consultants. We acquired Advanced Technology Group, which provides customer and revenue management consulting and implementation services that are focused on the Salesforce Platform. Advanced Technology Group, headquartered in the U.S., has expertise in implementing automated, cloud-based Quote-to-Cash business processes, a new and fast growing part of the Salesforce ecosystem. Their capabilities will strengthen our cloud solutions portfolio as clients shift to business models based on recurring revenue streams.","During the quarter, we also acquired SaaSfocus, one of the largest independent Salesforce Platinum consulting partners in the Asia-Pacific region with operations across Australia and India. SaaSfocus will expand our end-to-end digital transformation services and Salesforce cloud capabilities in Asia-Pacific. We're especially excited about the anticipated acquisition of Softvision announced earlier this month, which will expand our digital engineering capabilities once completed. Softvision is a leader in software product innovation and development using modern agile software engineering tools, techniques, and processes. Softvision will bring more than 2,800 technologists to Cognizant, increasing our ability to provide software engineering services to our clients from a new Eastern European base in Romania, a fast emerging hub for software developers. We expect the acquisition to close later this quarter.","Adding Softvision to Cognizant will enable us to create one of the world's largest digital engineering companies. Our acquisition activity complements our ongoing organic investment in digital capabilities, domain knowledge, global and local delivery, and overall ability to deliver for clients from strategy through implementation and outcomes.","Okay. So, let's move to my second topic, Investor Day, which is scheduled for Friday, November 16, in New York. Our goal for Investor Day is to discuss our mid-term strategy and growth path over the next several years. This strategy centers on helping clients become digital at scale by digitizing their products and services, personalizing the experiences they offer their customers, fully automating their business processes, and modernizing their IT infrastructures. Clients find digital at scale compelling because it generates new revenue streams, new operating models, and new ways of delighting their customers. And we find digital at scale compelling because of how well positioned we are to seize what's becoming a massive market opportunity.","At Investor Day, we'll also cover the financial objectives we'll seek to deliver for the company and for shareholders including our targets for revenue, margins, EPS, and capital return for the next few years. In addition, we'll give you the opportunity to meet and hear from a cross-section of our executive leadership team. Overall, our goal for Investor Day is to present our plan for the future.","One more point before I turn the call over to Raj. For Cognizant, 2018 has been a year of solid execution across many dimensions of the company. We have accelerated Cognizant's pivot to digital while driving revenue growth, margin improvement, and capital returns. And therefore, we expect our forward momentum to continue to deliver strong results.","And now over to Raj who will give you an update on the performance of our industry verticals. Raj?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thanks, Frank. Good morning, everyone. Cognizant's orientation is digital-first and digital at scale. It's the way we think and the way we work based on what clients need. With that in mind, let's look at how our industry segments performed in the quarter, beginning with Communications, Media and Technology, which had strong year-over-year growth of 17.1%. Within Communications, we are helping clients co-innovate the networks of the future to enable rich complex information to move at speeds more than 30 times faster than what's possible today, leading to a significant improvement in virtual reality, robotics, healthcare, and more.","Within Media, analytics has become essential to our clients' long-term success, and in our Technology vertical, content moderation continues to drive client revenue. We're proud to be working with several of the world's largest born-digital companies, which also engage us to apply AI, software engineering, and IoT solutions to help develop new business models. They know that to retain their customers, they must constantly create new and compelling experiences, and it's worth noting that in the third quarter, two of our technology clients were part of Cognizant's ten largest clients and both are continuing to grow. That compares with just three years ago when our entire top ten were either banking or healthcare clients.","Moving to Products and Resources, we increased revenue 11.5% year-over-year led by strong growth from our retail and manufacturing clients. In retail, we had one of our best quarters in years. Traditional retailers are racing to strengthen their digital business channels to meet the Amazon challenge of frictionless omni-channel experiences, hyper-personalized retailing, and responsive supply chain systems. We're helping retailers implement the next stage of unified commerce and partnering with them to enable enterprise-wide transformation. The example tells a story. A mid-sized U.S. retailer wanted to offer their customers a more engaging experience as well as the convenience of buy anywhere, fulfill anywhere, and return anywhere. We helped the clients a define omni-channel roadmap and implement a cloud-based commerce solution that provides full scale order management. With the new solution in place, our client has increased the number of orders through digital channels to around 1 million a month. And we see plenty of opportunity ahead in retail as clients strive to achieve better consumer engagement and retention by using advanced e-commerce and digital ecosystem management.","In manufacturing, spending among our clients remains strong as they continue to invest in making their products smarter and their consumer experiences richer. This effort is also driving digital initiatives on the factory floor, including more use of AI-driven autonomy to augment human decision making. The newest phase of manufacturing uses automated and digitized systems to bring together physical with digital. This phase combines machine to machine communication, Internet of Things, analytics, and big data to provide much better visibility into operations.","For example, we're working with a global industrial manufacturing leader to improve their overall plant efficiency and transform their operations, while saving them several hundred million dollars over the next few years. We're doing this by reducing maintenance downtime, improving throughput, lifting worker productivity, and enabling increased levels of automation. Our engagement will cover more than 20 global manufacturing sites and create digital trends of their environment. These are virtual replicas of what's happening on the factory floor in near real-time and continuously analyze incoming data streams. Clients will use this analysis to manage the performance of their machines, lines, and plants with the aim of achieving significant gains in up time and productivity.","Now let's turn to banking and financial services, which grew 2.6% year-over-year. Banks realized they need to break away from their legacy IT foundations and become digital at scale. That's the best way to reinvent their business models, improve their customer engagement, and achieve the technical agility needed for rapid learning and adapting. As mentioned on prior calls, our banking clients' intense focus on continuing their run-the-bank spending has affected a substantial portion of our work for them. But even with that, these clients are stepping up their spending on advanced technologies to transform their businesses. And as we extend our portfolio of services, our banking-related digital revenue has seen solid growth. We believe this growth will increasingly offset the pressure we are seeing on the run-the-bank spending.","We're optimistic about the shift for two reasons. First, all banks realize they must rewrite their futures with digital. And second, our banking clients headquartered in North America are beginning to see their spending on technology rise with a growing portion of that spend allocated to digital transformation. In Europe, we expect banks to follow a similar trend. So, the expansion of our digital services is starting to bring growth back into a number of our large banking clients. This is especially true in the areas of core modernization and digital engineering services. For example, a major bank sought our help to move their legacy applications onto a cloud-native architecture to reduce cost and complexity, increase their output productivity, and become more agile. Drawing on our deep knowledge of the bank's systems, we worked with Pivotal Software to re-factor legacy applications onto the Pivotal Cloud Foundry, an open-source platform. We demonstrated how seamlessly we can integrate legacy technologies with cloud-native architecture. We are able to dramatically reduce the time it takes to release code, and we provide the bank with agile capabilities such as auto-scaling and auto-recovery.","Now let's look at Healthcare where revenue was up 9.6% year-over-year. For healthcare providers and payers, the focus continues to be on improving efficiencies and advancing patient care and satisfaction. We continue to invest and position our healthcare practice to capture demand as clients shift their underlying business models from fee-for-service to value-based care. To complement our strong position in the payer market, we have expanded our scope to include the provider network of doctors, hospitals, and other clinicians. And we see continuing traction in this network. During the quarter, our healthcare consulting practice, Cognizant's largest consulting practice, had very strong growth.","Turning to our Life Science practice, we excel at helping biopharma and med tech companies thrive in a world of shrinking patent expirations by improving their product development and manufacturing processes in a stringent regulatory environment. We are encouraged by a couple of developments that are driving growth in this practice. First, we see continued traction in our platform solution. Our Shared Investigator Platform is now live at five large pharmaceutical clients. This cloud-based collaboration platform makes it easier for critical trial researchers to access, share and analyze data. We have another five clients signed up with implementation expected over the next few quarters. And along with the license revenue from our Shared Investigator Platform, we will typically realize consulting, implementation, and processing services.","The second development fueling growth is a number of large enterprise transformation deals in the process of ramping up. For example, we're working with one of the world's largest medical device and pharmaceutical companies to help drive several of their billion dollar brands in more than a dozen markets across the globe. Our clients needed to create an agile, efficient, and scaled global marketing organization, so we're enabling this with our assetSERV digital asset management solution. It's a cloud-based pre-configured platform that helps enterprises manage end-to-end content life cycle and deliver engaging customer experiences. We're helping the client support new ways of working by enabling reduced duplication and spend, enhanced collaboration, greater asset use and reuse, and leveraged scale.","Overall, the story of our industry segments continues to be one of steady execution and progress. We are resolved to be our clients' go-to transformation partner. To that end, we continue to invest significantly in digital engineering, interactive intelligent process automation, platform solutions, analytics and AI, and core modernization, all of it is directed at helping our clients drive digital at scale.","With that, I'll turn it over to Karen. Karen?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. The business performed within expectations in the third quarter as revenue of $4.08 billion was within our guided range and increased 8.3% year-over-year, including a 70-basis-point negative impact from currency. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had a $33 million positive impact to revenue in the quarter. Europe grew 15.1% year-over-year in Q3, including a 130-basis-point negative impact from currency, and the rest of world was up modestly from a year ago, including a 590-basis-point negative impact from currency. Similar to trends that we saw in the second quarter, results in both the UK and Asia-Pacific were impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients, while acquisitions like Netcentric and Mirabeau are enhancing our digital leadership in continental Europe, leading to a number of recent digital wins.","Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and realignment charges, was 21.1% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19, exceeding our guidance due to solid operating margin performance and a lower non-GAAP tax rate. The Q3 GAAP tax rate of 28% was higher than our previous guidance of 26%, primarily due to higher net non-operating foreign exchange losses driven by the depreciation of the Indian rupee partially offset by changes to our geographic mix of earnings. The board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on November 20.","Before turning to details of our financial performance, I'd like to provide an update on the status of the FCPA investigation. As a reminder, in September of 2016, we voluntarily notified the DOJ and SEC of possible FCPA violations, and during 2016, we recorded out-of-period corrections related to $4 million of potentially improper payments. Our discussions with the DOJ and SEC have progressed to a point where we are now able to reasonably estimate a probable loss and have recorded an accrual of $28 million in our financial statements in Q3. While we believe that we are getting closer to the conclusion of this matter, we are unable to predict with certainty the timing of a final resolution.","Now turning to our financial performance, Consulting & Technology Services represented 57.7% of revenue and Outsourcing Services 42.3% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting & Technology Services grew 6.6% year-over-year, and Outsourcing Services revenue grew 10.7% from Q3 a year ago. Outsourcing growth benefited from the inclusion of our recent acquisition of Bolder Healthcare as well as large client engagements such as TMG Health. During the third quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and transaction-based contracts were approximately 11% of total revenue during the quarter. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as those with a potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 378.","And now moving to an update on margins. In the third quarter, we had solid margin performance as we continued to build on the improvements we've made in our business over the last 22 months such as sustained higher levels of utilization, optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure, and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively.","Specifically during the quarter, we continued to improve our cost structure by further optimizing the higher end of our resource pyramid, resulting in $11 million in realignment charges. Net of hedges, our Q3 margins also benefited from the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the prior year quarter by 74 basis points. Solid margin performance allowed us to absorb the wage increases and promotions in the quarter, while remaining on track to achieve our full-year non-GAAP operating margin target of approximately 21%.","As we drive towards approximately 22% non-GAAP operating margins in 2019, we expect continued margin improvement to be underpinned by both ongoing operational efficiency and discipline, as well as effecting a shift within our business to focus on higher value services, improving profitability within our portfolio of large structured contracts, and reassessing less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace.","From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate at 22% remains elevated. The value that we create for our clients is predominantly knowledge-based work. So we depend heavily on the insights, passion, and collaboration of our global associates. We believe that the higher attrition is largely the result of increasing global demand for the very skills we specialize in, the growing shortage of technology talent, particularly in local markets and the transition our organization has gone through to build a scalable foundation for expanding our digital leadership. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and management.","Turning to our balance sheet which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash and short-term investments. This balance net of debt was down by $144 million from December 31 and includes restricted short-term investments of $405 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department.","We had strong cash generation in the quarter with cash flow from operations of $862 million and free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow net of CapEx was $768 million. Our outstanding debt balance was $724 million at the end of the quarter, and there was no outstanding balance on our revolver.","During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares, including 1.1 million which represented final share settlement of the $600 million ASR launched in June. Our diluted share count decreased to 580 million shares for the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2018. For the full year 2018, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.09 billion to $16.13 billion, which represents growth in the range of 8.6% to 9%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year.","Based on current exchange rates and the positive currency impact realized year-to-date, the full-year favorable revenue impact from currency is now expected to be approximately 30 basis points versus the full year 2017. This is down from our original estimate of 100 basis point impact at the beginning of the year.","For the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.13 billion. Based on current exchange rates, the Q4 negative impact from currency is expected to be approximately 100 basis points versus Q4 of 2017.","For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $1.05. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 582 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 31%.","For the full year 2018, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 21% and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $4.50. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 584 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 28%.","Our expected GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter and for the full year is higher than our previous guidance due to incremental foreign currency exchange losses driven by the depreciation of the INR against the U.S. dollar, which are not deductible for tax purposes. Additionally, earlier this month the State of New Jersey enacted legislation that would result in an incremental annual income tax expense of approximately $70 million beginning in 2018. However, we intend to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies during the fourth quarter of 2018, which we expect to significantly reduce this income tax expense resulting from this enacted legislation.","Accordingly, our Q4 and full-year estimated tax rate reflects the anticipated implementation of these tax planning strategies. We are maintaining our full year EPS guidance despite the outperformance in Q3 to absorb the higher than expected tax rate. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, realignment charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, the tax effects of the above adjustments, and adjustment to the one-time 2017 incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Reform Act, and our initial contribution to the Cognizant U.S. Foundation. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment including areas such as immigration or tax.","In summary, our solid execution in Q3 along with continued investment in the business has positioned us well to deliver another solid year of revenue and earnings growth in 2018.","Operator, we can open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. . Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Donati - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. This is Justin Donati on for Ed. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, can you break out the organic revenue growth in the healthcare unit ex-Bolder?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Good morning, Justin. This is Karen. We have not broken that out, but the Bolder contribution in the quarter was fairly small. We had said when we acquired Bolder earlier in the year that the full-year estimate was about $100 million for the year. So roughly a little over $30 million a quarter is what that's running.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I wanted to ask about the tax rate, it's running I guess a little bit higher and that's causing the EPS to drop lower than consensus. So can you talk a little bit about, Karen, the sustainability of that higher tax rate as we go forward and as we model 2019? And then secondly, Raj, some speculation around CEO succession planning, maybe you can comment on those plans? Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Brian, it's Karen. I'll answer the tax rate and then I'll turn over to Frank to talk about any succession planning that may or may not be happening. So the tax rate, so this has happened before. If folks go back and take a look at the spring, summer timeframe of 2013, when there's a sudden depreciation in the rupee, we have seen this impact before. Because what happens is with so many of our assets being in India and the depreciation of the rupee, we end up with this big foreign exchange movement that is not deductible for tax purposes in India. And so that drives up the consolidated rate. But it doesn't have a long-term impact.","So essentially the impact hits the quarter in which it happens and there will be a little bit of spillover into Q4 just because of the timing of the rupee movement. But if we assume that the rupee stays fairly stable going forward, then we will actually revert back to the guided tax rate. So, if people recall it, earlier in the year we had guided to a longer term tax rate of 24% to 26% with the implementation of the (29:45) tax at the federal level earlier in the year we said people should guide towards the higher end of that tax rate and that is still a reasonable position for people to assume.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","And, Brian, it's Frank. I'll take the question about succession planning. At this point, there are no changes to my responsibilities or to Raj's responsibilities. You addressed the question to Raj, but I'll take it. As I've said before, succession planning is the responsibility of the board, specifically the Nominating, Governance and Public Affairs Committee of the board and we have not made any announcements on that except that you would have seen an announcement recently that as it relates to the chairman of the board, Michael Patsalos-Fox was elected Cognizant's new chairman. And he's been on the board since July of 2012, has a long history and long background in management technology consulting from his many years at McKinsey, and he succeeds John Klein who was elected to our board back in 1998 and who had served as chairman of the board since December of 2003. John will continue to remain on the board.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning. Just want to clarify and then ask a follow-up just on the revenue revision to the year. Can you detail that for us, Karen? Between FX, acquisitions, and what might be incrementally weaker. And then I wanted to ask around the Softvision acquisition, we like that you guys are getting into the software engineering side. What kind of synergies might you expect by putting Softvision onto the Cognizant network? Can we expect something different here versus other deals? And maybe could we expect more in the way of investments going ahead? Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, let me do the revenue roll forward, Tien-Tsin, and then I'll turn over to Frank and let him talk about Softvision and the benefits thereof.","So, from a revenue perspective, I would think about it this way on a full-year basis. So on a full-year basis, essentially the 606 benefit that we've received to-date, this quarter it was a little over $30 million, has essentially been wiped out by the foreign currency movement. So FX and rev rec essentially offset each other on a full year basis or year-to-date, and I anticipate it to be on a full-year basis at this point. And then from an inorganic perspective, it's less than 1 point of revenue at this point. I think it was about 40 basis points in the quarter in Q3 was the impact of inorganic revenue growth. So it's been fairly small.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Tien-Tsin, let me talk about \u2013 it's Frank. Let me talk a little bit about digital engineering and Softvision in particular. When Softvision closes, we anticipate it to close in Q4, putting Softvision together with Cognizant's existing software engineering capability, we think will create one of the largest software engineering capabilities in the industry. Cognizant already has a very strong software engineering capability that we built largely organically over the years. Part of that has come also from acquisitions that we've done in the past, for example, TriZetto and so on, which came with a strong software engineering DNA.","What Softvision will bring to us once it closes is, of course, the 2,800 creative technologists, the base in Romania that we think is a significant source of software engineering talent. And of course, software engineering and digital engineering is the new way of developing software and so we see revenue synergies as we bring that combined Cognizant and Softvision platform to many of our clients across industries, including, as Raj said in his prepared comments, to the financial services industry.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","And Tien-Tsin, sorry before we move on, Katie just pointed out to me that I misspoke. The inorganic impact for the quarter was about a 1.5 point for the year, it's about 1 point of revenue year-to-date. So apologies for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. I was wondering maybe, Raj, could you speak to some of the hiring trends that you're seeing in the market? We're hearing about some of the peers, particularly in India, I guess, pursuing retention payments to improve retention rates. I know you that you guys have focused more on training up within your organization, particularly with regard to full staff developers. And then maybe on the mix shift, how you're seeing the mix shift of head count with that attrition. Are you hiring in places that you're not seeing the attrition, and how you anticipate that to impact margins going forward?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah, Brian. Look, I think overall in terms of head count, look, our global head count increased to about 274,000, up from 268,000 the last quarter. So it's about a net addition of about 5,300. Overall in the year, we were continuing to find good talent in the marketplace in all of our geographies. We hired about 14,000 professionals around the world. And we also have a stated goal of hiring about 25,000 professionals in the U.S. over the next couple of years. So, I think there's a lot of talent in the marketplace. We're obviously addressing some of the attrition. The attrition was a little bit high for us, and we're obviously continuing to investing in cross training our resources, looking at ways of \u2013 in terms of employee engagement, retaining talent, looking at ways of also creating new opportunities in terms of job rotation as well to control that.","But in terms of the \u2013 look, in terms of the mix of the pyramids and geographical split, no major changes. I mean, obviously you'll have certain projects that have some greater on-site component at certain phases of their life cycle but overall no major shifts in terms of onsite and technology delivery. And I think in terms of the margin point that you pointed out, it's important to note, as we continue to hire locally, look, you'll have some resources that will be a little bit more expensive than resources that we have leveraged in the past on visas. But I think overall when you look at it, that the total cost when you include the immigration costs, the travel costs, it's fairly constant, so it doesn't really impact margins significantly, whether you hire individuals locally or leverage (37:40).","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much. I also want to ask two. I want to start, Karen, with you on the margins. If I look at your margin performance this quarter, frankly it was disappointing and I think the stock is reflecting that. If you take out the benefit of currency and the benefit of accounting transition, your margin was actually down year-over-year. And it's unclear to me when you're talking about the 22% margin aspiration for CY2019, you're actually growing more than 100 \u2013 or intend to grow more than 100 basis points. And it's just hard to reconcile how that margin aspiration isn't going to have revenue consequences and cause your revenues to frankly underperform industry growth rates. And I'd like to follow-up with a question as well.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Keith, you also have to keep in mind that in Q3 of this year, which we did not have last year, we also had the raises and promotions, which was about 1 point of margin impact. So when you look at what's happening, certainly in the quarter while there was some benefit for the rupee; on a year-to-date basis, the rupee benefit is about zero. And while there has been some benefit obviously from the new rev rec, we have also had about 80 basis points of true operational improvement through continued driving of utilization as well as managing the pyramid and our SG&A cost effectively as well.","So, we are extremely comfortable with both where the company is performing today, we are exactly in line with the goals that we set for ourselves which was approximately 21% margin this year. And on track to deliver approximately 22% margin target for next year as we have always said, we do not anticipate exceeding the margin target for the year. We will continue to take any dollars that we can and continue to reinvest those in the business above the 21% and continue to drive the shift to digital. We're very pleased with how that transition is taking place. We're very pleased with the solid revenue growth that the company has had for the year and the fact that we are very much in line with the expectations we set out both for ourselves and with our shareholders at the beginning of this year. And this is a big transition that the company is going through, but we believe managing very well both at the top line and at the bottom line and we'll continue to do so.","Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","My follow-up is to Francisco, and I want to ask the question that was asked slightly differently previously. But there has been some newspaper articles written about succession issues at Cognizant. And you are a member of the board. And frankly, your stock has underperformed almost every metric from the last one, two, and three years. And I'm just curious how you think the board takes that into account when thinking about succession issues in terms of looking internally versus externally, and thinking about succession planning. Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Keith, let me just \u2013 I'll come to that in a second. I just want to go back to the point Karen was making on margin and reiterate the point that Karen made, which is that, we've said that for 2018, we will deliver approximately 21% operating margin, and the way we run the business, as we have in the past and as we have for many, many years is once we've set a target operating margin for a given year or a given period, we take that very seriously. We deliver to that. But then we reinvest back in the business anything above that. So our goal is this year not to, as Karen said, deliver above the approximately 21% that we are targeting for the year. But to reinvest on top of that as we run the business \u2013 rather reinvest the excess on top of that back in the business for growth and for the transition that we're going through. And that's sort of the approach to margin.","So as Karen said, in any given period, we'll have some operational improvements that drive margin improvement. We'll have some good guys from other parts from other things that may or may not be inside of our control. The way we look at that sort of is a portfolio of drivers of margin which we then use to say how much do we reinvest back in the business for growth and long-term sustainability.","Look, I have nothing more to add, Keith, on the issue of succession. Except what I said, as I said, the board is constantly looking at this, that the issue of succession planning is the responsibility of the board, and we are continuing to assess and continue to make plans on the topic. We have nothing to announce at this point, and when the board is ready to make announcements, we'll do that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Bryan C. Bergin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on BFSI, were there specific large clients that drove the decel from Q2 and was it all still Europe driven? Just trying to understand what changed there? And can you comment on whether you have any better viability for a potential inflection point in overall BFSI growth? Thank you.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah, Bryan, this is Raj. Look, overall BFSI I think it's still a mix of a couple of different stories going on. Insurance continues to be strong. We're doing really well in the mid-tier banks. It's good to see now that we're starting to see the shift in North America. All of our North American large banking clients \u2013 in the last quarter we saw digital really driving a lot of the growth that we've had, and we're seeing good traction in terms of making that shift on the North American based clients where digital is outpacing some of the losses that we have in terms of just to run-the-bank spending that's going on.","So I think North America is in good shape. Some of the \u2013 I would say a couple of the global banking clients that are outside of North America are the places that we still have some challenges. But I think the good news is we know how to manage that shift, and we expect that over a period of time, those clients as well will significantly start seeing the shift more towards the digital spend.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Hey. Sorry about that. I was on mute. I guess my question is with regards to attrition which remains high, could you break out voluntary versus involuntary and what's the plan to reduce it? Also, if you can break down by level of organization or function, any color there would be great. Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Ashwin, it's Karen. We didn't break out involuntary versus voluntary, but the involuntary in the quarter, there was no real change from where it's been, it tends to obviously be fairly small. There was a small restructuring we did over the summer which was about 200 people at the senior levels. I think what we continue to see is that attrition tends to be skewed towards the very lower end of the pyramid, so the junior staff attrition at the senior levels other than what we did with the involuntary program continues to be very low single-digits.","And we tend to see attrition skewed as usual a little bit more offshore than on-site. So really no changes in the trend. It's just obviously the overall number has continued to remain a little bit higher than we'd like it to be. But I think a lot of that is driven by the market demand that we're seeing both with not just competitors but clients and other companies that I think everybody around the world right now is struggling with the shortage of technology talent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Raj, I was wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit more color on the dynamic you've highlighted for several quarters now about run-the-bank spend versus digital spend. As you look into 2019, what are your clients on the banking side telling you about their, first of all, overall wallet spend expectations? And secondly, whether the pace of the declines in some of the run-the-bank spend could moderate at all?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah, Jim. So, look, I think it's a little too early right now to start getting into 2019 in terms of the budgets that we have from some of our large clients. The good news is, I mean, based on current trends, it does look \u2013 we are optimistic going into next year. Again, as I mentioned right, I think we've made that turn in North America where we're starting to see significant spend start coming in in terms of the digital. I think with especially a lot of the large banking clients, you've had a lot of in-sourcing that has been going on as well, but I think we've managed through that, and we're starting to see growth in all of our large clients. And I think you'll start seeing that going into next year. The challenge, as I mentioned earlier, right, has been some of the banks that are outside of North America as far as headquarters.","Again, you're seeing some in-sourcing and some of the run-the-bank spending. But I think the good news is the relationships are very healthy. We continue to win more than our fair share at those banks. And we're still strategic clients at those banks, and I see the same playbook that we used in North America working for us as those banks continues to shift more of their spend towards digital into next year as well.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys, thanks. Look, let me just start off, I mean, a little bit higher level on a macro basis. Can you just provide a little more color on what you're seeing broadly with regard to IT spend from your clients in discussions as we start to get closer to the end of the year now? Anyone changing their tone around spending given macro trends or tariffs or China or rate concerns or anything else that you're noticing in terms of a pivot in any way one way or the other?","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Darrin, it's Frank. I'll take that. I don't see that happening. I continue to see clients investing in technology, investing in digital. As I think Raj said in his prepared comments, I think it's notable that we had the strongest quarter in digital that we've had \u2013 excuse in, in retail that we've had in many, many years. If you look at the mix of our clients, another data point that Raj had in his prepared comments is that in the quarter, two of our top 10 clients came from the technology space as opposed to three years ago where all of our top 10 clients were in Financial Services and Healthcare. So we haven't seen a shift in demand in the short-term as a result of the, perhaps, what you're alluding to is the volatility that we've seen over the last month or so. We continue to see just clients sort of doubling down now and saying how do we get to digital at scale and continue to play into that demand as we go into next year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I wanted to go back to the margin question. Now kind of appears to be a good time to invest to take digital market share. Why not back off the margins and try to grow faster? And then just building on that, has the cost cutting gotten too disruptive to the culture, and how do you think about that as you continue to drive towards efficiency? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","You know, Joe, I'll let Karen also \u2013 it's Frank. I'll let Karen jump in here. I think that it's not always the case that there's this trade-off between margins and growth. There seems to be this thesis that there's a direct trade-off between margins and growth. And while at some point that is certainly the case, as we've said for a while and in fact 18 months ago when we did the analysis on the topic, a lot of the core operational improvements that we've done in the business to drive growth are good operating hygiene types of things that we think are opportunities for us just to run the engine better. We've had \u2013 in two months, we'll celebrate 25 years as a company.","We had 20-something years of very, very strong growth. The focus during those years was less on operational excellence. That creates lots of opportunities for us to optimize things around the business. And those things are just good operating discipline. In most cases, those things don't have a direct impact on growth. And so while it may seem at the 50,000 foot level that there's a trade-off between margins and growth, at the place where we are right now, I feel like we are optimizing places where the company had excess, where the company wasn't optimal, we were not best-in-class relative to our peer set. We're looking at that carefully.","We had done that analysis when we began this exercise. We had a third party come in and look at our operational metrics relative to competition. We've identified areas that where we are not best-in-class and we're focused on closing the gap. And in many of those cases, as I said, there isn't a trade-off with growth. As it relates to culture, I think we're building a muscle in the place around operational excellence and around operational discipline. I think that's a good muscle. I think it's a muscle that will serve the company well, well into the future. And I think that that is a good muscle to be building, and not one that I think is disruptive to the culture. I don't know, Karen, if you want to add to that?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","No, I think I would echo, Joe, what Frank said. And I think just to add to that, the benefit of what we're doing today is that because we are growing, this isn't really about cost cutting. In many cases, this is about cost avoidance and really leveraging the investments that we've already made more effectively, particularly around corporate functions and so forth. And if you think about where we have done some head count reductions, they've been extremely minor. So in 2017 in the summer, we did a voluntary program that it was a few hundred people took that program. This year we did an involuntary program at the senior level that was 200 people, on a basis of 270,000 people plus, that is an absolute nit. So I think as Frank said, this is about getting the organization to think about operational excellence and discipline along with revenue growth, and we think it's a very healthy exercise for us to be going through.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Karen, what are your assumptions for organic growth for Q4? And then you keep on mentioning pruning or pruning of low margin businesses. Is there any way to kind of quantify the impact of that pruning on the top line growth this year or maybe for the quarter? I think any color here could be helpful. Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, I'll start with the second piece first, Moshe. So on the, what we'd call the long tail accounts, there's been very little revenue impact. Again, this is part of going back to the operating muscle that Frank was just talking about, right, is getting the teams to look at clients where perhaps we're not getting the growth and the margin trajectory that we would like to see and contemplating whether there's truly a strategic relationship there and if not perhaps finding reasonable ways to exit. But the dollars, those are very, very small revenue dollars. And what we tend to see is some of those come with some of the acquisitions we've done in the past where they may have a handful of clients that we would consider strategic clients where we think there's a bigger market opportunity, and then they may have a handful of smaller clients that just won't have the scale to really partner with us in a meaningful way.","So that's a constant thing we look at. But the revenue line, it doesn't really have a material impact. In Q4, in the guidance, obviously, we've assumed both the ATG and SaaSfocus deals which closed in October, but those are small, just a few million dollars of revenue. And then we're anticipating that Softvision will close later in the quarter. But again, in terms of Q4 incremental dollars, we expect that that would be very, very small because we get maybe a few weeks of revenue if that going into the quarter. So beyond that, it's just the acquisitions that we've already done, which is primarily Bolder is the biggest one this year which we said is running about $35 million a quarter of revenue.","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes. The question is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Glad to be back on the call. This one is I think for Frank, maybe Raj. As you're looking forward, presumably a major goal right now for Cognizant is to get your revenue growth to turn and reaccelerate. Can you just talk about what in your view the sort of building blocks for that are, meaning, do you need to get attrition down to a certain level? Do you need Financial Services growth to kind of recover to a certain level? What's the role of acquisitions in that roadmap? Does digital mix need to get to a certain level? How do you think about that?","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Lisa, I would say \u2013 it's Frank. It's a combination of some of the things that you talked about. I would say we are quite comfortable with the digital portfolio as it is right now, but we'll continue to do acquisitions to strengthen that portfolio of services. Obviously once Softvision closes, that will be an important arrow in the quiver as it relates to digital engineering. The second is the turn, if you will, in banking and financial services. As you saw in this quarter, we were quite pleased with the growth in three of our four segments, which all showed good growth. Financial Services, as Raj said, we see the turn happening in North America where the digital revenue growth is now starting to offset the pressure on the run-the-bank spending. When that turn comes to our clients in the Financial Services clients in the rest of the world, then I think that that will remove a drag from a segment perspective. I would point to those two as the two major factors at this point.","And it goes without saying that as we execute against our plan as you've seen for many, many quarters now, the revenue base of the company diversifies away from Financial Services and Healthcare as the other two segments grow faster off a smaller base. And so we view those as large incremental market opportunities in addition to Financial Services and Healthcare that continue to be large opportunities in their own right.","So we think that overall there's a big market opportunity. The digital portfolio continues to grow at very healthy rates, and so it's a question of focusing that digital portfolio on the large market opportunity that we have. And then of course the last lever is our global growth. We continue to expand the footprint of the company to markets outside of our traditional markets in North America and Europe, and so the rest of \u2013 what we call the rest of the world and Asia Pacific continues to be a focus area for us for growth.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Good. I think with that, we'll wrap up the call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. And we look forward to speaking with you again in just a couple of weeks here at our Investor Day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Nelson, you may now begin.","David Nelson","Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everyone.

These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Cognizant's fourth quarter performance played out as we anticipated, rounding out a very strong year for the company. Our fourth quarter revenues were $2.36 billion, a sequential increase of 2.2% and an increase of 20.9% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was higher than our target range at 20.7% for the quarter.","For the full year 2013, we delivered $8.84 billion of revenue, which represented industry-leading growth of 20.4%. The year played out better than we originally expected as we saw an uptick in spending on innovation and discretionary projects, particularly towards the middle of the year. Consequently, we delivered full year revenue, which was about $250 million over our original revenue guidance.","I'd like to provide a perspective on the state of the market, the demand environment and Cognizant's positioning for the future, then I'll hand it over to Karen to provide further details on our performance.","It's very clear that we're now in the midst of a once in a decade shift in the technology landscape. And the shift we are experiencing is propelled by a confluence of technologies: social, mobile, analytics and cloud, or SMAC, to use the term we have coined. In addition, development in areas like center technologies, the Internet of Things, machine learning and 3D printing, promise to further disrupt the status quo in many industries. These technologies are enabling our clients to reimagine and redesign part or all of their businesses -- part or all of their business models. In other words, SMAC technologies are enabling our clients to become digital businesses.","The implications of SMAC are far-reaching. For several years, we've been calling this the Future of Work but, over the past several quarters, it has turned into the present of opportunity. In terms of the specific areas of opportunity, our clients are rethinking how they interact with their customers by driving better customer engagement, allowing anytime, anywhere customer interaction and creating new tailored products and services. In terms of their business partners, our clients are seeking to improve interaction and collaboration, to streamline supply chains and better integrate partners upstream and downstream. In considering the impact of SMAC technologies on employees, our clients are looking to create better experiences by empowering fieldworkers, allowing teams to bring their own devices to the workplace and creating more interactive and engaging collaboration spaces.","And finally, as more industrial and consumer devices become Internet-aware, clients are seeking to find value in new machine-to-machine and machine-to-business connections. I'm excited about the opportunities that these big technology shifts represent for our clients and for Cognizant. Gordon and I have just returned from the World Economic Forum meeting in Dallas and it was clear there that technology is now a CEO-level agenda item. And while our clients clearly realize the tremendous potential of these new technologies, they are also mindful of the continued volatility in markets and demand around the world. As a result, they are grappling with a dual mandate of improving current business performance while investing in technology-based innovation for future growth.","In 2013, our run-better, run-different approach helped client address this dual mandate and was central to many of our digital transformation engagements with clients. Going forward, to continue working with clients to design, build and operate digital businesses, Cognizant and other services companies must have a range of integrated capabilities. First, insight and advisory consulting services to evaluate a client's competitive position and the potential sources of business value from both improvements to current operations and growth opportunities from new technology-enabled products, services and business models. Second, a deep knowledge of industry-specific business processes, as well as changing industry trends in areas like customer demand, regulatory changes and the growth in data. Third, at-scale technology and service operations to deliver those improvements, including familiarity with both in-house legacy system and the myriad of new technologies available in the market. This is important because building a digital business requires integration of new technologies with legacy applications and, critically, legacy data. And finally, a culture of innovation and agility to allow rapid investments in new technologies and evolving delivery models. All of these exemplify an expansion of our market opportunity, as well as increasing C-level relevance from firms such as ours. The capabilities we have worked hard to build at Cognizant over the past decade, both in key industries -- excuse me, depth in key industries, business consulting capabilities, large-scale program delivery and leadership in SMAC technologies has come together to position us uniquely to meet the demand in the marketplace. I'm confident that those capabilities, coupled with our rapidly expanding global footprint and our Three Horizon approach to innovation, will continue to position us as a strong transformation partner to our clients in 2014 and beyond.","Clearly, our Three Horizon model is working well. It is enabling us to optimize our core Horizon 1 IT businesses, build momentum and scale in our new Horizon 2 offerings and integrate new technologies, markets and delivery models through our Horizon 3 initiatives.","During the fourth quarter, our core Horizon 1 services including enterprise application services, enterprise information management and testing did quite well. In addition, our Horizon 2 services, comprised of management consulting, business process services, which we refer to as BPS, and IT Infrastructure Services, continue to grow faster than company average. Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, saw a strong quarter with several new marquee management consulting engagements in healthcare, retail and the high tech segment. While we continue to win standalone advisory work, we see a definite trend where consulting is a key driver of large, more transformational programs. Our pipeline is strong and we continue to expand our portfolio of consulting capabilities and client relationships.","Our BPS practice continues to show solid growth driven by cross-selling our vertically aligned business process solutions into our existing customer base, as well as winning new logos for Cognizant. This quarter, for example, saw some good wins around mortgage servicing, clinical operations and provider services. IT Infrastructure Services had a robust quarter with new wins across multiple industries, including financial services, healthcare, retail and communications. This quarter, we also saw solid wins in remote infrastructure management and service desk solutions, a trend that gets accentuated with every passing quarter.","Within ITIS, we are seeing solid growth in Europe, driven by Germany, the Nordics and Benelux. And in Horizon 3, we're extremely pleased with the accelerated growth we experienced in 2013 across the 3 subsegments: new technology architectures driven by SMAC; new industry and markets such as the public sector and Latin America; and new delivery models that drive nonlinearity.","In 2013, our SMAC revenue exceeded $500 million. Our public sector and Latin America businesses began to gain traction and we successfully deployed our 18 SaaS and BPaaS platforms under the Cognizant BusinessCloud solutions umbrella at more than 150 clients. Our ability to offer our clients an integrated value proposition by combining the capabilities across the 3 Horizons of our business is emerging as a critical differentiator for Cognizant in the marketplace. And recently, Forrester recognized our client value proposition and awarded us the highest score for strategy as evaluated in its application outsourcing Wave study for both North America and EMEA.","Now I'd like to take a moment to recognize a significant milestone in our history. This quarter marks our 20th year as a company. Cognizant has come a long way since our founding as the technology arm of Dun & Bradstreet in 1994. In that time, we've grown from 200 associates helping 1 client to over 170,000 associates having the privilege of serving more than 1,000 of the world's leading organizations.","During this period, we have successfully navigated several economic and business cycles and seamlessly transitioned between several technology shifts. We have done this through an expansion of our services and geographical footprint but, more importantly, by developing enduring characteristics and values such as our client-first approach, empowered teams and an ability to keep challenging the status quo by reinvesting and reinventing for the future. These entrepreneurial characteristics have helped us predict, scent and adapt to market changes, understand client needs and help clients keep challenging their own status quo to navigate the changes in technology and markets to build stronger businesses. Our success is a testament to all of our clients, the Cognizant leadership team, associates and other stakeholders. I extend my thanks to all of them today.","I'd like to hand it now over to Karen to discuss our performance and provide more financial details. I'll return later for the Q&A. Over to you, Karen.","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Francisco, and good morning, everyone. Overall, 2013 was a strong year for us. Our revenue grew by more than 20% year-on-year, while we maintained stable margins and a healthy balance sheet. The fourth quarter played out just as we anticipated, with revenue growth of 2.2% sequentially and 20.9% over last year to $2.36 billion.","Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 20.7%, above our target range of 19% to 20%, while our GAAP operating margin was 19% for the quarter. We generated $1.15 of non-GAAP EPS and $1.06 of GAAP EPS for the quarter. On a full year basis, we generated $4.38 of non-GAAP EPS and $4.03 of GAAP EPS, which were both above our previous guidance.","Let me now touch upon our performance across industries and geographies and also the key highlights of our operational performance. From an industry perspective, our financial services segment grew by 4.5% sequentially and 22.3% year-on-year, with strong growth in both banking and insurance. The trends that we saw during the first part of 2013 continued to play out during the fourth quarter. The key focus areas for our clients were cost rationalization, regulatory- and compliance-driven initiatives and a growing demand for SMAC-related services, particularly analytics and mobility.","As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of Equinox, the Paris-based financial services consultancy, during the first week of October. Equinox has deep expertise in risk and compliance consulting and services some of the marquee financial services clients in France. While still early days, we are happy to share that the integration is progressing well.","Healthcare, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical and medical device clients, registered a growth of 2.2% sequentially and 22.6% year-on-year. Growth in this segment for the quarter was primarily fueled by ongoing work related to Affordable Care initiatives, including extended support for member enrollment and the implementation of direct-to-consumer programs through mobile platforms.","In the pharmaceutical segment, as anticipated, growth continued to be slow because of the impact of the patent cliff. The retail and manufacturing segment was flat sequentially, but up 20% year-on-year. As we had indicated last quarter, Q4 is traditionally a slow quarter for this industry segment, especially retail, due to the lockdown of IT systems for the holiday season. Having said that, we are seeing some interesting trends within this segment as clients look to partner with us on their transformation journey across their supply chain, omni-channel commerce and SMAC-related initiatives.","Our other segment, which includes communication, information, media and entertainment and high tech, declined slightly on a sequential basis as we saw a seasonal tapering in discretionary spend during the fourth quarter. The industries in our other segment tend to have a greater weighting towards discretionary activities with us. On a year-over-year basis, our other segment grew 13.7% during the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 1.9% sequentially and 18.3% year-over-year. Europe grew 3.5% sequentially, performing better than company average. While sequential growth in the U.K. was flat this quarter, Continental Europe saw a solid 8.8% sequential growth. Excluding the impact of the Equinox acquisition, Continental Europe grew 4% sequentially. Overall, Europe grew 31.5% year-over-year. This growth includes our revenue from the acquisitions of C1 Group and Equinox Consulting.","We are encouraged by the structural trends we have seen over the year, as clients are increasingly engaging us in larger multiyear programs spanning across our service lines. In addition to the strong organic growth we saw through the year, the acquisitions of the 6 companies of the C1 Group and Equinox position us well into 2014. Rest of the world showed modest sequential growth, up 1%. This segment grew approximately 26.6% year-on-year.","Now turning to some of our other performance measures. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services each represented 50% of revenue for the quarter and for the full year. In Q4, consulting and technology services grew 20% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Outsourcing services grew 22% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. For the full year, consulting and technology services grew 18% and outsourcing services grew 23%.","During the fourth quarter, 35% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and grew 4% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. For the full year 2013, 34% of our revenues came from fixed price contracts, up from 33% in 2012, reflecting further acceptance of the managed services model of engagement by our clients. As expected, on a sequential basis, our pricing was stable during the quarter. We closed the quarter with 1,197 active customers, and the number of accounts which we considered to be a strategic increased by 7, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 243.","Our fully diluted share count for the quarter was 305.4 million shares, an increase of approximately 1.2 million shares from Q3. To date, 15.7 million shares at a cost of $998.2 million had been repurchased under the current share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion.","Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $387 million from the quarter ending September 30 and up by approximately $884 million from the year-ago period.","During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated approximately $506 million of cash. Financing activities generated approximately $30 million of cash. We've spent approximately $107 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. Our full year capital expenditures for 2013 were approximately $261 million, slightly below our previously communicated expectations of $300 million due to the timing of certain payments. Based on our $1.88 billion receivable balance on December 31, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 73 days, down 2 days versus last quarter. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $226 million, down from $254 million at the end of Q3. Approximately 62% of the Q4 unbilled balance was billed in January.","Let me now provide some color on our business operations for the quarter. Our continued efforts to drive best-in-class execution have resulted in further improvements in our key delivery and operating parameters. During the year, we focused heavily on taking up utilization and optimizing our operations, freeing up resources for longer-term investments. We entered 2013 with a 71% utilization rate and exited the year 9 points higher at 80%, and we did this while concurrently improving our service delivery to clients. Sequentially, utilization was down slightly as we ramped up hiring at the end of the year and saw an improvement in the attrition rate. Offshore utilization was approximately 74%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 80% and on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter.","The results of our annual third-party customer satisfaction survey remained high, a good validation that we managed to drive greater efficiencies, while sustaining high levels of client centricity, a hallmark of Cognizant.","We are equally pleased that our annualized attrition during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down significantly to 14.5% annualized. As mentioned in our prior earnings calls, we've put in place a series of employee-engagement programs mid last year and these have paid off nicely. Net headcount increased by approximately 5,000 people during the quarter. 48% of additions for the quarter were direct college hires, while 52% were lateral hires of experienced professionals.","We ended the quarter with approximately 171,400 employees globally, of which approximately 160,600 were service delivery staff. The strides that we have made in 2013 have positioned us well to harness opportunities in the market in 2014. We have significantly expanded our market presence with revenue outside of North America approaching $2 billion for 2013. We have evolved our people strategy and policies to address the needs of the millennial generation by introducing a \"Bring Your Own Device\" policy and implementing TruMobi, our homegrown enterprise solution for mobile devices. And we strengthened our delivery footprint to include many new in-country, nearshore and global delivery centers, including Cebu in the Philippines, Dalian in China, newer centers in Germany and France through acquisitions, Tampa and College Station in the U.S. and, most recently, Costa Rica.","Last fall, we expanded our executive and senior leadership ranks to strengthen our foundation for continued growth. And we continue to focus on our clients' needs, helping them to build stronger, more global and competitive businesses.","Before I jump into guidance, I would like to draw your attention to our announcement this morning that the Board of Directors of Cognizant has declared a two-for-one stock split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend. This underscores our confidence in the strength of the business model and in our prospects for 2014 and beyond.","I would now like to comment on our growth expectations for the first quarter of 2014, as well as for the full fiscal year. Based on current conditions and client indications, we expect to continue delivering industry-leading revenue growth in 2014. For the first quarter of 2014, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $2.42 billion. Our full year revenue projection of at least $10.3 billion represents growth of at least 16.5%.","During Q1 and for the full year 2014, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Starting in 2014, we are prospectively revising the definition of our non-GAAP EPS to exclude net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses in addition to the previously excluded stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. As you know, net operating foreign exchange gains and losses have always been excluded from our guidance, so we believe that this change will better align our EPS guidance with our reported results and provide better insight into the operational performance of the business. For reference, net nonoperating foreign currency exchange losses negatively impacted both our non-GAAP and our GAAP EPS by $0.15 in 2013. As you know, net nonoperating FX gains and losses are challenging to predict, making it difficult to provide a complete financial outlook in accordance with GAAP. We will, therefore, prospectively focus our guidance on non-GAAP EPS. While both GAAP and non-GAAP information will be reported in our press release and filings, we will continue to focus primarily on non-GAAP numbers when discussing results.","For the first quarter, we are comfortable with our ability to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $1.18. This guidance anticipates a Q1 share count of approximately 306 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.5%. For the full year 2014, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be at least $5.02. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 306.5 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.5%. Please note that all of our EPS guidance is before the stock split, which we announced this morning, and will be effective later this quarter.","Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just coming out of the quarter, I mean your topline growth trends are obviously showing some very good strength in the financials vertical and the Healthcare vertical, both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis, overall growth being almost 21%. And yet, when we look at your guidance for 2014 at 16.5%, it obviously implies at least some deceleration, I would think, in some of the key areas. Healthcare, it seems like had the Obamacare working and -- correct me if I'm wrong, but there's more incremental work from that as well as ICD-10 coding, which probably weren't even in the numbers yet. So can you just touch on why any of those might show that level of deceleration or is it just conservatism in the numbers?","Francisco D'Souza","Darrin, it's Frank. Look, let me just -- let's take it in 2 places. First of all, let's look at our 2013 performance overall. We're very pleased with the way 2013 played out. The fourth quarter came in right where we expected. And a lot of the overperformance that we saw in 2013 was driven by, as we've been saying -- as we said through the year, by discretionary spending that picked up in the middle of the year, and we expect to see a continuation of that going into 2014. As I said during the prepared comments, we see a tremendous opportunity and we see that opportunity continuing. We caught that trend early, we think, in 2013. We see that opportunity continuing as we go into 2014 across the segments. Our initial guidance for 2014, if you adjust for an acquisition that we had announced at the beginning of 2013 but hadn't closed, it's actually a little bit stronger than our initial 2013 guidance. So coming out of 2014 on a bigger revenue base, as a company, we're feeling a little bit better than the same time in 2013. So overall, we're feeling good about the continuation of demand, and we saw strong demand pick up for us as discretionary picked -- work picked up in the middle of 2013, we think that will continue going into 2014, really, across the segments.","Karen McLoughlin","Darrin, just to add on what Frank was saying. If you remember last year, we guided to originally 17%, but as Frank said, that did include the $90 million of acquisition revenue from the C1 acquisitions that did not close and the MediCall acquisition. So like-on-like year, we're actually a little bit ahead.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. Just one quick follow-up. Europe, obviously, showed acceleration or continues to show very good trends. I mean, is there any reason to think that can continue to accelerate or, at least, show this type of growth? I mean, from what you're seeing in demand and the secular and structural changes there, do you have enough pipeline there to give us confidence for '14 again?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes. I think, Darrin, we feel good about Europe overall for a couple of reasons. As we've done a couple of acquisition there, as you know, during 2013. That's positioned us well in key markets like Germany and France, we expect to see continued upside there. We see, overall, as we've been saying for a long time, the penetration of the global delivery model in Europe is lower than it is in North America and in other parts of the world, particularly in the continent. And so, we think there's a large underpenetrated market in Continental Europe. And finally, as clients in Europe continue to face economic volatility, the need and the pressure to continue to run their businesses better, more efficient, I think will continue to drive further examination of what portions of work can be moved to a global delivery model. So net-net, we feel good about Europe going into 2014.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the fourth quarter. How would you characterize it? I guess, it didn't seem like there was really any budget flush, it was pretty close to your guidance. So just trying to figure out what is this -- the pickup in discretionary spend that you guys are talking about, did that really continue in the fourth quarter or did you see it kind of take a pause?","Francisco D'Souza","Bryan, I would say Q4 played out exactly as we expected it. Historically, our fourth quarter, if you look back, has been a slower quarter, and that happens for a couple of reasons. Typically, the retail sector doesn't begin any new discretionary projects during the peak season and discretionary spending overall tends to slow towards the end of the year for obvious reasons as projects come to an end and new ones don't necessarily pick up. I think this year a couple of things accentuated the Q4 trend a little bit. We had a very strong Q3, as you know, and so the comparable was a little more difficult. In addition to that, because so much of our overperformance in 2013 overall was driven by innovation and discretionary spending, the tapering off of discretionary spending that we've -- you typically see and traditionally see in Q4 was a little bit more accentuated this year. But I'd be very clear, as we go into 2014, we see that strong trend that we had, that we benefited from during the middle of 2013 to continue going into 2014. I'm very, very optimistic about this new wave of technology and what it represents for our clients and the opportunities that it will bring for both of our -- for our clients to build stronger businesses and for Cognizant to participate in that.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 more questions. On the consulting side, you noted a pickup there, but it didn't show up in, really, in sequential revenue growth. So did that bode well, I guess, for future revenue growth in '14 on the consulting side? And then just secondly, just an outlook on pharma, obviously, with the whole patent cliff situation being curious, how you guys are feeling about '14 for that.","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. So Bryan, I'm assume you're referring to the pure consulting practice, not the overall consulting and technology services piece. But in consulting -- I mean, certainly, the pipeline has been quite strong. Obviously, the Equinox acquisition will continue to help drive consulting revenue. Some of those projects initially, if their standalone consulting projects are not necessarily significant dollars but then they obviously lead to the pull-through of revenue typically is what you expect, and that's where you'll start to see the larger revenue pickup. So I think we're feeling very good about the way the consulting practice has integrated into the broader organization and is helping to drive that revenue. On the pharma side, certainly, obviously, 2013 continued to be slow for pharma. I think, at this point, we would expect that 2014 will continue to be slower than company average, certainly baked into our guidance. We have not assumed any significant strengthening in the life sciences or pharma segment at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to ask on the SMAC revenues. I think the 7% of revenue now is just great. What's the target for 2014? And Frank, would you consider SMAC spend as discretionary? Just trying to think about definitions here.","Francisco D'Souza","Yes. Tien-tsin, it's really hard to -- SMAC has become so pervasive across the business that it's very difficult to quantify and to forecast exactly where it's going to land or whether it's discretionary or not. Let me put some color around that. It was that -- it used to be the case when 2.5 years ago or so when we started talking about SMAC, that we had discrete social or mobile or analytics or cloud engagement. And they typically tended to be smaller pilot projects where clients were sort of trying to get their arms around what the implications of the technology was. Today, we're seeing that SMAC is really woven into the fabric of virtually almost -- virtually everything we're doing, particularly on the development side. Mobile becomes the front-end, analytics becomes tied to large scale data warehousing or enterprise information management projects. And so, it becomes very hard to split out SMAC. So I'm not going to actually try to give you a number for how much revenue we expect from SMAC for this year. I think in terms of thinking about whether it's discretionary or not, I would think now that a good proxy is it's probably still about 60-ish percent, although this is just a guesstimate on my part, about 60-ish percent discretionary. And I would say 30%, 40% has become more business as usual or built into the kind of regular upgrade and maintenance that we do because, as the stuff gets out into the field, then there's the regular upgrade maintenance cycles that kick in.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. That makes sense. And then just, Karen, a question for you on the margin front. I know the SG&A has been trending down. Just for modeling purposes, as we think about '14, the mix or the trend on SG&A versus gross margin, any help there will be great.","Karen McLoughlin","Yes. So from a modeling perspective, Tien-tsin, I would not expect any significant changes in gross margin in 2014. And then, obviously, we do want to continue to invest in the business, and the vast majority of those investments do take place in the SG&A line. So we fully intend to bring our margins in -- within the 19% to 20% on a non-GAAP operating margin basis, and we'll continue to invest in the business accordingly to drive the growth.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, got it. Good Stuff. Gordon, if you're listening, hope you get a speedy recovery there.","Francisco D'Souza","Thanks, Tien-tsin. I'm sure he's listening. But we -- I spoke to Gordon last night and he's doing fine. I'm sure he'll be back in a week or so recovered, well recovered, from his little surgery yesterday.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to sort of delve a little bit more into the trends you're seeing in Europe, particularly with regards to the economic situation in the U.K. picking up. Would you expect your U.K. growth rate to pick up correspondingly? Want to delve a little bit more into that 4Q trend, was that a blip or what happened there?","Francisco D'Souza","I think","[Technical difficulty]","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, your conference will now resume.","Francisco D'Souza","Folks, sorry about that. We seem to have a bit of technology trouble here with the snowstorm outside on the East Coast, apologies. Ashwin, I don't know where we dropped, but I was just going through our situation in the U.K.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If you don't mind repeating because I think at the very beginning it dropped off.","Francisco D'Souza","Okay. Apologies. So look, as I was saying, we have a pretty -- we have -- we feel good about our -- I broke it down by the U.K. and the Continent. Let me start with the Continent. The Continent, I think we feel good about the -- our position there. Given that there's continued economic volatility, I expect that the bulk of our conversations in 2014 and the work we'll do will be more on, what we call, the run-better side of the business. The acquisitions of C1 and Equinox have built strong front-ends in France, Germany, Switzerland and so on, and that gives us additional opportunity to capture market that -- as that becomes available. And of course, as we've said for some time, the global delivery model is underpenetrated in Continental Europe and so that provides a good runway ahead for us on the Continent. In the U.K., I think as the economic picture improves there, we're starting to see initial conversations -- we're having initial conversations about new SMAC-related discretionary work. But I think, Ashwin, it's too early to call that a trend yet. I'll certainly watch it carefully over the course of 2014, but too early to call that a trend yet.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And with regards to M&A, I guess, 2 sub-questions. One, what's the ongoing impact in 2014 from part market [ph] impact? And then given that you have $12 per share of cash on the balance sheet, I mean, any thoughts on stepping up in any transformational deals out there? How are you thinking about that?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. Ashwin, this is Karen. Let me take those questions. So in terms of the acquisition impact on 2014, it's very minor. Because, if you remember, we closed the C1 acquisition actually in the middle of -- or beginning of March last year, so there's about 2 months of incremental there. So that's less than $20 million of revenue. And then Equinox, on a full year basis, is about $40 million of revenue, but -- so that's about $30 million incremental, so it's very small incremental impact this year. So that's your first question. On the second question regarding cash, we continue to evaluate our cash needs for the coming years. Clearly, we are interested in continuing to acquire organizations, if we can find the right organizations at the right value that we think makes sense for Cognizant to help us drive long-term growth. And we will continue to evaluate our needs for cash with the board and provide guidance on that at the appropriate time.","Operator","Our next question is from Sara Gubins with Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is there anything that would suggest your -- that your outperformance versus the market might narrow in 2014?","Francisco D'Souza","Look, we feel -- Sara, we feel comfortable that we can maintain our industry-leading growth rate going forward. The -- our market opportunity, as we outlined during the prepared comments, we feel very good about. We think that this once in decade sort of technology shift that we're going through, driven by these new technologies, creates significant opportunity for us. And we continue to invest, as you know, substantially to capture those market opportunities. If you think about the opportunities that are available to us, there's sort of the new technologies, that's one axis on all of the work that we've talked about relative to social, mobile, analytics and cloud, so that's one growth vector. There's a second growth vector that relates to new geographies that we -- where we feel we're underpenetrated. So if you think about our geographic footprint, we think that there are still opportunities for us with -- in an earlier question I addressed the European opportunity. But we continue to believe that there are opportunities for us in other parts of the world and we're investing there. We've talked to you about the rest of the world -- we call the rest of the world, which is Asia, the Middle East. We made good -- some good strides, early strides but good strides in Latin America last year. So we think there's opportunity to grow from a geographical standpoint. And then, of course, when we look at the industries that we serve and new industries where we don't have a presence, we think that the opportunities there continue to be significant. The existing industries continue to represent good growth avenues for us. But then, we have new opportunities. For example, we touched briefly during the prepared comments on the public sector. Again, a place where we made good strides last year in 2013, and we expect to continue to grow in those -- in that industry as well or in that sector as well. So if you think about it, across 3 growth vectors, new geographies, the new technologies and new industries and new markets, we think there's still a lot of upside here. And since we're investing ahead of many of our competitors because of where we maintain our operating margins, we think we have an opportunity, and we'll continue to maintain industry-leading growth as we go into '14.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then following up on that, given the plans to stay in the 19% to 20% non-GAAP margin range and the benefit of rupee depreciation, can you talk about the areas of incremental investment that you will be making in 2014 that will keep profitability in that target range, but also focus on driving growth?","Francisco D'Souza","I think I would mirror what I said a minute ago and, in fact, if you look at our Horizon 3 investments, Sara, they're largely in those areas. So we're investing in new technologies all of the SMAC capabilities. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments, going beyond that, so we're looking at new areas like the Internet of Things, centers, artificial intelligence and machine learning. So we think those are all -- those all represent new technology areas that have considerable opportunity. Then we're looking at new markets, particularly Latin America. We have to continue our focus, pushing into new geographies. As our clients globalize their businesses, we need to be there, side by side with them. And then, of course, new industries. The one other area that we are also investing quite heavily in is in platforms. And the new -- what we call, new delivery models to drive nonlinear revenue growth. As I said during my prepared comments, during '13, we launched 18 Cognizant BusinessCloud solutions. These are our SaaS or BPaaS platforms, and we'll continue to invest to build out both new platforms like the 18 that we launched, and also deepen our penetration for the existing 18 that we've launched during 2013. So that's, I think, the bulk of our investment.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steven Milunovich of UBS.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Regarding North America, growth has slowed the last couple of years from 34% to 22% to 18% last year. Do you expect growth to further decelerate? Given your guidance, I assume you do, to maybe 15% or so. Just kind of curious what's behind that?","Karen McLoughlin","So Steve, obviously, we don't provide guidance for the geographies. But I think, certainly, we continue to think that North America is a very robust market and we'll continue to have good penetration. The big question mark, obviously, will be around discretionary spend this year. That's typically what provides upside for us in the guidance. And so, that -- a lot of that will depend upon the strength of the U.S. economy. Obviously, what you're starting to see is North America is a more mature market than, particularly, Continental Europe or rest of world for us. So you do have the law of large numbers a little bit. And so, we would expect that some of our emerging geographies will grow faster than North America. But clearly, we think there continues to be a significant expansion opportunity in North America, particularly as our service offerings expand. So what we've seen over the years is -- obviously, the Horizon 1 businesses, so core application maintenance and development, were really the legacy of the company. But as we've added in the new services, BPO, consulting, infrastructure and now, ultimately, our Horizon 3 service offerings, that opens up a whole new market within our customers. And so, we continue to see that expansion of market opportunity, both here in North America, as well as across the world.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's great. And Karen, do you have any thoughts on how healthcare growth is going to play out by quarter? Your compares are much easier in the first half of the year but, on the other hand, I would think the underlying business itself might actually be stronger in the second half.","Karen McLoughlin","I think -- again, with healthcare, particularly on -- if we think about the payer side of the business, and separate pharma from payers, we do expect that the payer side of the business will continue to have nice growth going into 2014. We've talked about the fact that there's still a lot more work related to the Affordable Care Act as we move into '14 and potentially beyond there as well. I think it will be, really, a question as to when some of that work starts, there will be work with both our traditional payer clients, as well as we would expect some work helping the various states as they continue on their transformation journey around the Affordable Care Act as well. So I think typically you see that type of spending start to pick up, as you mentioned, into Q2 and into the middle part of the year just as people release budgets and so forth. So I don't think that would be any different than this year. Pharma, as we've talked about, I think we will have expect to continue to be slow in 2014 at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just want to go back to the topic of the U.K. Francisco, I think it will be really helpful if we can get some more color on why did we get the slowdown during the quarter. And maybe by verticals, was is one vertical in terms of kind of the actual impact that we had during the quarter? And then should we expect -- and again, it is a bit unusual for you guys to have it. And then should we expect the U.K. to recover during, at least, the first quarter of this year and after that? And then was there any FX impact on numbers during the quarter?","Francisco D'Souza","So Moshe, I would say that what we saw in the U.K. largely parallels what we saw in other parts, in North America, for example, as it relates to the discretionary spending and the impact, therefore, on Q4. You just really have this phenomenon where discretionary spending really tends to slow in the fourth quarter as clients wrap up the year, as budgets come to an end and clients start to think about the new budget year and so on and so forth. And because 2013 was a year where so much of our overperformance was driven by discretionary spending during the middle of the year, you just saw a natural tapering of that towards the back half of the year, particularly in Q4, the last quarter. So I wouldn't -- I don't think there's anything more to read into the U.K. than that frankly. The -- in terms of where I see the U.K. for this year, as I said, we continue to see, to believe that the U.K. will perform well in 2014. As I said earlier, early signs that discretionary spending may pick up in the U.K., but I'm not ready to call that a trend yet. But I feel like if you look at our positioning, we're well positioned there in the key industries in which we serve. We're extremely strong in financial services, in retail, in -- of course, insurance is part of financial services. And so, I feel that we've got good market position. We've taken our thought leadership around SMAC and the new technologies into the market, and I think that we'll benefit from that during 2014. So I feel good about the U.K. for 2014, but too early to call the trend on discretionary spending there yet.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Karen, any FX impact for the quarter?","Karen McLoughlin","It was very small, Moshe. So there was a little bit of pickup in revenue because of the movement in the pound and the euro during the quarter. But it was just a few basis points, so nothing material.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","How would you describe your visibility into IT budgets this year? And is that pointing to any type of an inflection point or just stability versus 2013?","Francisco D'Souza","I think I would characterize it, at this point in the year, we're just kind of right where we would expect to be for, in what I would consider to be a normal year. Budgets are -- IT budgets are close to being finalized in most cases with our clients at this point. And when we look at the trends, I would say, overall, in North America, IT budgets are modestly up, which is somewhat different than it has been in past years, maybe a little bit better in past years. In the recent past, we've seen flat to modestly up budgets. This year, I would say budgets are up a little bit more than they have been in past years. But having said that, Katy, I think that the important point here, what's really important, and it's always been the case that our opportunity is driven somewhat by growth in IT budgets. But it's in a sense being -- more importantly, being driven by this, what we call, the dual mandate, where clients are saying, \"Look, I've got to be more efficient and more effective to be able to free up a disproportionate amount of dollars to reinvest in innovation and growth.\" And so, what we are benefiting from and what we expect to benefit from is this continued drive towards the dual mandate, or driving efficiency and effectiveness on the one hand to free up budget dollars so that those dollars can be invested in innovation and growth. So our focus is really, as much as it is on the increase in the budget, it's to figure out with our clients how we can drive greater degrees of efficiency and effectiveness, move to managed services and other kinds of opportunities to be more effective in the work we're doing for them or in the work that they may not have yet chosen to use a provider for so that we can help them to free up those dollars to invest in discretionary projects.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And are you seeing any impact on deal sizes from the increased penetration of SaaS?","Francisco D'Souza","I'm sorry, from the increased penetration in SaaS? Of SaaS? Is that the...","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Software-as-a-Service, yes. Are the deals sizes smaller when you're integrating a SaaS project versus a legacy application project?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes. I think if you look specifically at SaaS implementation versus a corresponding on-premise implementation, while some -- in some spaces, the deal sizes are smaller, particularly for what I would think of as the more standard implementation. I think it's also the case that we're seeing a greater number of transactions. And so, net-net, we think that the market opportunity expands as a result of SaaS because what we're seeing is that our business -- our clients' businesses are becoming more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive. And so, while some transaction sizes maybe becoming smaller, we see a greater number of transactions. And because of that, we think it's an overall expansion of our market opportunity and our markets in it and the addressable market.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just lastly, I know it's really early, but what verticals are most interested in Internet of Things?","Francisco D'Souza","I would say that it's -- we see a lot of interest in sort of in the industrial space. Anybody that has a -- machines, equipment that -- where you can think about asset optimization or operations optimization, those tend to become -- so you see that in health care with medical devices, you see it in traditional manufacturing, you see it in heavy industrials. I think that's a good, immediate opportunity set because the ROIs are large and immediate on that.","I think we are a little bit beyond call time, but given that we had a little technical glitch, we'll stay on for another -- last question. Operator, we'll take this as our last question.","Operator","Your last question is coming from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In your conversations at Davos, did you get the sense that this -- obviously, the CEOs are getting the opportunity, but do you sense that they're really fully understanding it and, therefore, willing to deploy dollars against it in the near term?","Francisco D'Souza","I think so, Ed. I have to say that I was surprised by the strength of the conversation in Davos around these new technologies and I was also surprised pleasantly that the conversation has moved on quickly beyond social, mobile, analytics and cloud for some of these new areas like the Internet of Things and centers and machine learning and so on and so forth. I think in a sense the events of the last few years, with the financial crisis and so on and so forth, Eurozone crisis and so on, perhaps CEOs' attention was focused on issues around those things, and this wave of technology got less focus and attention and I think that's now starting to change. And I think there was a broad recognition that these new technologies do really represent a once in a decade sort of opportunity to change the rules of the game in many industries. So I sense that there is a willingness to invest and I sense that we'll see significant change in that mindset, or it's already started to change, and I think you'll continue to see that as we go into '14.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The other question is on the BPO business, can you sort of quantify the size of it, growth rates and maybe what trends you're seeing? We're sort of getting mixed signals from some of the pure plays.","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. But let me comment on the size and the growth and Frank can add in any color. But I think as we've talked about, Ed, we look at the Horizon 2 businesses as a group. They are approximately 20% of revenue, so that's consulting, BPO and infrastructure services. They're all about equal in terms of revenue size, so they're all in that sort of 6% to 7% revenue range. They continue to grow significantly faster than company average and our BPS pipeline at this point is very robust. And I think the big trend that we're seeing, particularly in that space, is this notion of integrated solutions. So typically, when we have a client who is looking to do BPS work, they're also looking to be able to have a partner who can provide other services, particularly around the IT end or the consulting services, to really bring that integrated solution to them, which obviously plays very well into our strengths.","Francisco D'Souza","Thanks. I think on that note, we have to wrap up. Listen, I apologize for the technical glitch on the call today. And I thank everybody for joining us and for your questions. I'm really delighted with our performance for 2013 and we look forward to another strong year of industry-leading growth as we go into 2014. We'll talk to you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Katie.","Katie Royce","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.","Brian Humphries","Well thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us in today's call. Over the past few months we've initiated what we expect will be a multi-year evolution of our business aimed at returning or company to historical levels of performance. We view this as a systematic process of revitalizing the company and one we're pursuing with rigor and urgency.","Today I want to clarify where we are in this project and where we're headed by briefly covering our Q3 performance and then reviewing how we\u2019ve begun to operationalize the conclusions of the transformation office, including our refined strategic posture, which aligns to our client's digital imperatives and our plan for resetting our cost base to facilitate investments in growth.","Let's begin with our third quarter earnings. Q3 revenue grew 5.1% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.25 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $1.08. In an uncertain economic climate our year-over-year performance in North America improved modestly in the third quarter.","As we've discussed in prior calls, our ability to accelerate the Company's top line growth depends on revitalizing our North America performance and in-particular our banking and financial services and healthcare businesses, both of which were under new leadership.","While we have more work to do, we now have highly engaged strategic leaders running these businesses who bring a fresh perspective and huge client-centricity. Arguably, even more important than the modest year-over-year growth improvement we've seen is the new energy we have in our North America leadership team and our clients are noticing this.","At a global level, in Q3 banking and financial services was up 3% year-over-year in constant currency and healthcare was down 90 basis points year-over-year in constant currency.","In banking and financial services against the backdrop of growing demand for DevOps and some insourcing of skills we see cost pressure in the traditional business with growth opportunities in digital with particular interest in cloud, digital engineering, AI and analytics and interactive.","Similar dynamics exist in healthcare, but here revenue growth also continues to be impacted by rate reductions and volume discounts from clients in the midst of merger integration. Our momentum continued in our other two business segments, Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology both posted double digit revenue growth in constant currency year-over-year.","Later in our call Karen will take you through the details of the quarter including the business segment and markets commentary. Let's turn to my second topic, operationalizing the conclusions of the transformation office. As a reminder, upon joining Cognizant in April, we established a transformation office to identify, prioritize and put into action key initiatives aimed at accelerating our revenue growth and unlocking the full potential of Cognizant.","Following six months of engagement by 250 of our leaders we have now identified amongst other things our strategic focus operating on commercial models, global delivery structure and our cost base and processes and tools required to enable us to be fit for growth.","As a result, we are now in execution mode, putting into action key initiatives aimed at facilitating investments in growth, going to market with a sharper strategic focus, working more closely with our clients, continuing to evolve our skillsets and creating a leaner and simpler operating model.","Let's start with our strategy. I continue to allocate significant time to face to face meetings with the C-suite of our clients. I find these meetings essential because they allow me to gain insights into the key trends by industry, customer pain points and desired business outcomes.","Clients across all industries are confronted with the risk of being disrupted by next generation, nimble digital native competitors, but they are redirecting their focus in investment to digital and embracing DevOps and technologies like cloud, digital engineering, analytics, AI and automation.","We spent the past few months sharpening our strategic posture to align directly with client's needs to become modern, data enabled customer centric and differentiated businesses. Our strategy has two parts. First, protecting and optimizing our core portfolio, which includes; efficiency, tooling and automation, delivery optimization, protection of renewals, strengthening our industry alignment and scaling our international footprint. ","And second, winning in four key digital battlegrounds; data, digital engineering, cloud and IoT. These four areas enable clients to put their data at the core of their operations, improving the experience they offer their customers, tapping into new revenue streams, defending against disruptors and reducing costs.","The two parts of our strategy reinforce each other. It's our core portfolio that has built our strength in the market. For instance, our deep relationship with clients who lead their industries, a reputation for responsive and reliable delivery and our historical strength of the application there mean that we know how to help clients transition from managing their current legacy state to enabling their digital future.","We are investing aggressively and are determined to win in these four digital battlegrounds and as we do so, we expect to accelerate our revenue growth. I want to offer a bit more context about these four areas starting with data which at the heart of our strategy because it's at the core of our client's competitiveness.","No matter their industry clients must quickly get better at storing, managing, reporting, analyzing and reusing their data. Clients need to leverage enormous amounts of data to fuel AI based platforms that can transform customer experiences, drive automation, and provide management insight.","This is causing a shift from legacy to next generation data services like data modernization, AI and machine learning. We're helping our clients make the leap from systems of record to systems of insight and engagement. It starts with data engineering including basic things like customer and product hierarchies.","Turning to digital engineering to compete effectively, clients need to become software-driven enterprises and to do so they are replacing traditional application development with digital engineering to build leading edge consumer grade experiences and infuse software into their product services and customer experiences.","Cloud our third digital battleground is just as critical to clients' digital journeys, given that an estimated 50% of all workloads hit on public and private clouds today, a figure set to rise to 80% in a couple of years.","Our clients need help migrating their workloads as well as the entire spectrum of client management, including monitoring, notification, provisioning and orchestration, governance and security. We aim to significantly enhance our partnership with leading scale companies, hyperscale companies and SaaS vendors.","Our fourth battleground is IoT, an exciting space given that 75% of businesses are expected to increase their IoT spending in the next five years, and 40 billion plus devices are expected to be IoT connected by 2025. The adoption of IoT enabled by five generation technology is sparking an explosion in distributed and edge computing. A vast array of sensors and industrial IoT devices and solutions will proliferate across businesses, cities, and environments of all kinds, significantly changing used cases and accelerating adoption.","For clients, IoT offers the ability to instrument everything for constant insights, if you look back at our recent acquisitions such as soft vision, which expanded our digital engineering capabilities and Zenith Technologies, which expanded our IoT portfolio and our life sciences domain expertise, we've been methodically deepening our expertise in areas that we believe will provide the greatest value to clients while generating the best return for Cognizant.","Our latest step along that path is our agreement to acquire Contino, a leading consultancy that specializes in helping global 2000 clients speed their digital transformations by leveraging enterprise DevOps methodologies and advanced data platforms.","Cognizant's approach to cloud migration, core modernization and cloud security is we're shaping how enterprises build their infrastructures and these cloud capabilities will enable us to offer transformative cloud based solutions to our clients. We expect this transaction to close later this quarter.","The refinement of our strategic posture also highlights a subset of our portfolio that is not in-line with our strategic vision for the company and therefore an area to exit. Within digital operations, we had a content operations business that offers a wide range of business process services to clients across all industries.","Some of these projects involve ensuring proper brand and business experiences such as integrating our health care patients or determining whether online maps are accurate, but within one subset of the content operations business. Our work is largely focused on determining whether certain content violates client's standards and can involve objectionable materials.","We've determined that this subset of work is not in-line with our strategic vision for the company. While we intend to exit this work, we recognize the cleansing, the web of objectionable content is a worthy cause and one in which companies have a role to play. For this reason, we have decided to allocate $5 million to fund research aimed at increasing the level of sophistication of algorithms and automation, thereby reducing users exposure to objectionable content.","Over the coming quarters, we intend to comply with our contractual obligations and determine the best path forward with effective clients. Exiting this subset will impact our financial performance in the coming year and also affect approximately 6,000 roles. In the months ahead we expect to work with our partners to explore ways to transition roles to alternative vendors, thereby reducing the impact to our valued decisions.","As a reminder, other Cognizant digital operations content work will continue. In recent quarters, I've discussed the importance of simplifying our organizational model to enhance role clarity, empowerment, and accountability whilst ensuring we further increase our client centricity and optimize our cost structure.","Over the last few months, the transformation office and feedback has identified a series of measures to help us progress against these goals. And today, I want to give you an update on some of the decisions we have taken. These actions include returning to our simpler two-in-a-box model of client partner and delivery partner for a more seamless client experience and greater agility in front of the customer.","Our previously announced consolidation of the delivery organization under one delivery leader reporting to me, significantly increasing investments in automation and tooling to enable more streamlined and efficient processes, higher productivity and lower delivery costs.","Combining Cognizant digital engineering capabilities with Cognizant\u2019s Softvision, thereby creating a powerful team focused on software product development and application modernization. Extending our global brand, developing greater thought leadership by industry vertical and better positioning Cognizant in the market as a leader in digital by uniting all marketing under a recently hired CMO reporting to me. Strengthening Cognizant consulting capabilities in select geographies and verticals, plus complementing our targeted capabilities with greater partnerships with a leader again, reporting to me.","Aligning our specialists sales capabilities to the service lines albeit with an industry intersection point to ensure the highest competencies and capabilities are available to our client partners.","And lastly in our commercial teams, the implementation of more leveraged sales compensation programs and the development and deployment of a RAD model or retention acquisition development to optimally segment our clients and future clients, thereby allowing us to better hunt and farm.","These changes for the most part will become effective January 1, 2020. Against a strategic backdrop and a set of organizational decisions aimed at ensuring strategy execution today we are also announcing a cost reduction program.","In any people intensive business costs reduction always involves difficult choices. Would we deny to evolving their skillsets and freeing up capacity to invest in growth we've made the decision to remove approximately 10,000 to 12,000 mid-to-senior level associates from their current roles in the coming quarters.","This gross reduction is expected to lead to a net reduction of approximately 5,000 to 7,000 roles as we aim to rescale approximately 5,000 associates, thereby lessening the impact on our associates and allowing us to reduce lateral hiring. These numbers exclude the approximately 6,000 roles impacted by our decision to exit a subset of our content operations business.","But as previously stated, we expect to work with our partners to explore ways to transition these roles to alternative vendors, thereby reducing the impact on our associates and also reducing any associated charge.","Establishing a healthier cost structure is but a means to an end and that's to drive revenue growth. We\u2019re free of cost. We've identified a series of investments that require funding, including the previously announced hiring of approximately 500 revenue generating associates over the coming year a combination of customer facing and sales support professionals who will help us expand existing accounts and generate new ones.","Significant investments in Cognizant Academy our internal learning center and in technical skills as we aim to reskill and redeploy our talent towards digital imperatives. Accelerated investments in tooling and automation and increased investments in marketing and branding as we aim to strengthen our international operations and the DDER digital brand.","Karen will provide more detail on our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan, including the expected completion date and run rate savings along with the charges we expected to incur. We will take great care to treat our associates with the dignity and respect they deserve and to minimize any internal distractions caused by our actions as we get the Company back to achieving its full potential.","I've been in CEO role now for a full seven months, which has given me the opportunity to considerably deepen my knowledge of our operations, our market opportunity, and our clients. And three things are resenting the cure to me. First, we built an enviable position in a large and attractive market that's expected to continue growing at a steady rate.","Most of our clients we serve are still in the early stages of their transformation. They need our expertise and a distinct set of digital technologies coupled with or intimate knowledge of their technology environments to fully digitize their businesses.","Second, the significant time I've been able to spend with our top accounts convinces me that our clients love working with us and actually wants us to succeed.","In fact, they want us to step up and do even more for them. It's my observation that Cognizant is one of those rare B2B organizations that is a so-called loved brand. The reservoir of clients for us, we built over the years is one of our most distinctive assets. And third, the company is brimming with talented and engaged associates around the world. Our associates are driven to grow and develop new capabilities and easy skills in our portfolio of solutions and then how to apply them to help our clients drive in a digital economy.","In summary, the leadership team and I are fully aware that we have a multiyear project ahead of us. My optimism about Cognizant\u2019s future is pragmatic and comes from the winning spirit of our associates around the world who are passionate about contributing to the long-term success of our clients. Notwithstanding a backdrop of macro demand uncertainty that gives us clients for prudence. I'm convinced that much of what we need to do to increase Cognizant\u2019s competitiveness is within our own control.","A relentless focus on growth has defined Cognizant's performance since its finding a quarter century ago and that determination and focus are as strong as ever. We're determined to unlock the organization's growth potential and return Cognizant to its historical position of being the bellwether in the IT services industry.","With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen, who will give you an update both in our operational and financial performance as well as the view as to how we will see the fourth quarter. Karen?","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Brian and good afternoon everyone. Third quarter revenue of $4.25 billion was above the high end of our guided range and represented growth of 4.2% year-over-year or 5.1% in constant currency. Digital revenue growth within the mid-20% range and represented over 35% of total revenue.","Moving to the industry verticals where overall company performance continues to be impacted by Financial Services and Healthcare. Financial Services growth was up 3% in constant currency driven by the ramp up of several projects and insurance and banking performance which was consistent with last quarter.","Within Banking, our performance continues to be impacted by a few of our largest customers. Consistent with the last quarter, two of our top five accounts continue to grow while three remain under pressure, a trend we expect to continue through the remainder of the year. As we had expected when we did our last earnings call, insurance in Q3 benefited from a ramp up in project based work. However, in Q4 we anticipate a continuation of trends seen over the course of this year where executive transition is underway and several of our clients slowing the decision-making process, particularly around larger deals in the pipeline.","Moving onto Healthcare which declined 0.9% year-over-year in constant currency, within our Healthcare vertical, performance continues to be primarily impacted by large clients involved in mergers. The continued shift of work to a captive at a large client and the continued year-over-year impact from the completed ramp down of an account in which we were the subcontractor to a third-party.","Additionally, in the quarter we were impacted by a charge related to an ongoing contract dispute with a large client. This charge impacted both revenue and margin. Life Sciences again grew double-digits year-over-year, benefiting from continued demand within digital operations. Large enterprise transformation deals, migrating from on-premise to cloud-based environments and momentum within our industry-specific platform solutions such as our shared investigator platform and smart trials.","Zenith also contributed to growth in the quarter and we are pleased with the early success we have seen this acquisition. We expect similar year-over-year trends in Healthcare in the fourth quarter. Products and Resources grew 13.4% year-over-year in constant currency. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth.","Growth was broad-based across verticals, as results continued to benefit from strong growth within our digital business and demand for digital engineering, cloud infrastructure, IoT and analytics solutions. You do expect to see slower growth on a year-over-year basis in the Products and Resources segment in the fourth quarter, as we lapped the ramp up of work with new logos and the contribution of acquisitions made in Q4 2018.","Our Communications, Media and Technology segment grew 10.6% year-over-year in constant currency. In Technology, growth was driven by revenue from recent acquisitions and demand for our digital engineering services, partly offset by slowing demand for content services. As Brian mentioned, we have decided to exit certain types of content work within our digital operations practice but is not in line with our long-term strategic vision for the company. I will provide some more color on the impact of this to our Communications, Media and Tech practice as well as the overall company in a few minutes.","Turning to geos, Europe grew 8.8% year-over-year in constant currency, reflecting weakness in the UK from macroeconomic uncertainty. In Continental Europe, we saw strength in Life Sciences, driven in part by our Zenith acquisition. While a few of our larger banking relationships in Europe remained under pressure. We did see good growth in several of our newer logos including the partnership with three finished financial institutions.","The Rest of World grew 11.1% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strong growth in Products and Resources, Insurance and CMT that was partially offset by softness in banking, driven by the weakness with several of our large clients. Over the coming years, there's a significant opportunity to gain further market share within Europe as well as the Rest of World. And we intend to increase investments in these markets in the coming quarters.","Turning to margins, our GAAP operating margins and diluted EPS were 15.7% and $0.90 respectfully. Adjusted operating margins which excludes realignment charges was 17.3% and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.08 in the third quarter. While up by 120 basis points from Q2, our adjusted operating margin was down 120 basis points year-over-year, below our expectations primarily due to employee compensation and benefit costs outpacing revenue growth and the ongoing dispute with a large healthcare client which negatively impacted operating margins by 40 basis points.","These headwinds were partially offset by the impact of lower incentive-based compensation and cost savings realized as a result of the targeted actions at the senior levels of our pyramid to simplify our org structure that we took in Q2 and Q3. The cumulative savings from actions taken in Q2 and Q3 are now expected to result in annualized savings of over $100 million with approximately $50 million realized in 2019.","However, we have more work to do to right-size our cost structure and are not satisfied with the amount of cost reduction achieved in the quarter as we did not achieve our full potential around pricing levers, aligning bill rates with promotions and pyramid optimization.","Also, we experienced a longer than previously anticipated timeline to align revenue and headcount growth as we continue to hire and reskill our workforce to be better positioned to capture digital demand in the market. Attracting and retaining our talent is a key factor to our long-term success. While reduction of our attrition rate currently running at 24% annualized remains a long-term goal, we do expect this rate to remain elevated for the next few quarters as we undergo this transformation.","Turning to our balance sheet, our cash and short-term investment balance as of September 30, stood at $3.1 billion, up approximately $75 million from June 30, to down $1.4 billion from December 31, reflecting over $2 billion of share repurchases completed year-to-date and approximately $380 million deployed on acquisitions. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $419 million related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department.","We generated $620 million of free cash flow in the quarter. DSO of 78 days was down slightly sequentially but up two days year-over-year, which negatively impacted free cash flow by approximately $100 million. This was primarily due to the customer dispute I referenced earlier. Our outstanding debt balance was $747 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver.","During the third quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for approximately $219 million and our diluted share count decreased to 551 million shares for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased over 31 million shares for approximately $2 billion. As of September 30, we have 519 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","Through our cash generated from operations, remaining cash on the balance sheet and our revolving credit facility, we continue to have access to plenty of liquidity to fund both our existing capital return program as well as future acquisitions.","Before I turn to guidance, let me provide an update on the outcomes of our transformation office including the 2020 Fit for Growth Plan that we announced this afternoon as well as the content work that we intend to exit. As Brian highlighted, we are moving rapidly to implement the key initiatives identified by the transformation office aimed at accelerating our revenue growth.","Our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan is expected to run for two years. This program is designed to simplify the way we work, reduce our cost structure and fund investments in the business which will enable growth. As part of this plan, we expect to remove 10,000 to 12,000 mid to senior level associates from their current roles. We will make every effort to identify productive roles based on client demand and our model assumes that approximately 5,000 associates will have the opportunity to reskill for new sales or delivery roles within the company.","We expect the remaining 5,000 to 7,000 associates to exit the company by mid-2020 either through attrition or role elimination. As Brian said, anytime we make decisions that impact our employees, we take it very seriously. We believe these actions are critical for the long-term health and competitiveness of the company. We expect the charges will also include charges related to optimizing our real estate portfolio. These actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2020 and will result in annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in year 2021.","While we will begin the execution of the plan in Q4, we do not expect the material savings impact in the fourth quarter. These cost reduction activities will be occurring at the same time that we accelerate investments in sales resources, branding, talent, reskilling and lean and automation enhancements across the company and further investments in our four key digital battlegrounds including M&A.","These actions are an important step to building a strong foundation to support our future growth ambitions and success in our chosen digital battlegrounds. Our commitment to all associates during this time of transition is to ensure that we preserve the qualities, value, then culture that make Cognizant a great company for employees and clients alike.","Additionally, as Brian mentioned, we have determined that certain content work within our digital operations practice is not in line with our long-term strategic vision for the company. And we intend to exit this work over the course of the next one to two years. This transition is expected to impact approximately 6,000 associates around the world. In addition to continuing to meet our contractual obligations during this period, we will ensure that our associates are treated fairly and with the respect that they deserve.","In the months ahead, we will work with our partners to explore ways to transition the work and roles to alternative vendors and we'll provide impacted associates with a number of transition assistance programs including retention bonuses, severance packages and the opportunity to participate in various reskilling programs.","While the exact timing for the completion of this transition is uncertain, we do expect there to be a small impact to revenue within the CMT practice in the fourth quarter. And as a result of this decision, we estimate that we may lose revenues of between $240 million to $270 million on an annualized basis within our Communications, Media and Technology segment.","We anticipate revenues will ramp down over the next one to two years and therefore the impact on 2020 revenues may be lower than the expected annualized run rate. This is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted operating margin subject to the timing of the ramp down and other factors. We expect to incur a wind down charge related to the transition of these associates and any related assets such as real estate and equipment.","The total expected charges associated with this Fit for Growth cost transformation plan, including the wind down of certain content work is expected to be in the range of approximately $150 million to $200 million. We will provide a more detailed update regarding the phasing of the impact when we provide our 2020 guidance on our Q4 call.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2019. For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 4.6% to 4.9% year-over-year to $16.75 billion to $16.9 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth within the range of 3.5% to 3.8% to $16.7 billion to $16.74 billion on a reported basis, reflecting our assumption of a negative 110 basis points for foreign exchange for the full year.","This guidance continues to reflect the muted outlook for Banking and Healthcare. This implies fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 2.1% to 3.1% year-over-year to $4.21 billion to $4.25 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth in the range of 1.7% to 2.7% year-over-year to $4.2 billion to $4.24 billion on a reported basis, reflecting our assumption of a negative 40 basis points for foreign exchange in the fourth quarter.","This outlook reflects our expectation for slower organic revenue growth in Q4 as a result of a more cautious macro outlook in the UK and continued headwinds in Financial Services and Healthcare and the impact of exiting certain content work. For the full year 2019, we now expect adjusted operating margins to be between 16.5% and 17%, reflecting Q3 actual and the longer than previously anticipated timeline to normalize the revenue growth and headcount trajectory and additional costs from recent acquisitions. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.95 to $3.98.","This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 560 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes realignment charges, charges under our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan and other unusual items, if any; net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, clarification, if any, by the Indian government as to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India Defined Contribution Obligation and the tax effects of the above adjustments.","In the context of the Fit for Growth Plan we announced today, we are targeting adjusted operating margins in 2020 to be in the range of 16% to 17%. While the cost program outlined today coupled with annualized savings from Q2 and Q3 will increase margin rates. This increase is being mitigated in the near future by two major things. First, our full year fiscal 2019 margin rate reflects lower incentive compensation payouts given our underperformance versus target.","Our goal in 2020 is to perform at plan and therefore have target payouts to be a normalized part of our cost structure in line with company performance. This is a margin rate headwind of 120 basis points year-over-year that we plan to absorb. We are investing meaningfully in a number of areas including revenue generating resources, Cognizant Academy, tooling and automation and marketing and branding. These important investments will help us accelerate growth rates. However, in the short-term, they negatively impact margins by approximately 150 basis points.","With that, we can open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good afternoon and thanks for going through all this. That's fantastic. Brian, I'd like to double click on one of the investment areas in sales and marketing, clearly, one of the most critical areas to reaccelerating top line growth. You mentioned a few things, the 500 new salespeople, the return to the two-in-a-box model. Can you provide maybe a more holistic view of the major changes you're planning to make to Cognizant's sales strategy and sales coverage and overall go-to-market model? Thank you.","Brian Humphries","Yes, hi Lisa. So I'll give you four examples. First of all, it's important to clarify to roll up the client partner and returning to two-in-a-box, I think really simplifies Cognizant's go-to-market team in front of the customer. So we traditionally used to have two-in-a-box of client partner and delivery partner. A few years ago, we moved to three-in-a-box and we were returning to what we traditionally have had with greater clarity of roles and responsibilities.","Therefore, between the client partner and the new role that we will term an engagement delivery partner. Second point, we will actually add more headcount in sales or the commercial function than before. I've referenced this in our prior call. We are adding approximately 500 headcounts. Not all of those are quota carrying, but some for instance will be business finance people or indeed commercial lawyers, but it's all with a view to helping us show up to more clients and have greater agility and for the clients with greater responsibility.","The third major thing relates to how we want to compensate our commercial teams. As of January 1, we will move to a more leveraged sales compensation plan with at least 70% of the base fixed or at most and then 30% variable. And within the variable portion of their compensation, there will be strict parameters in terms of what they are required to sell that will enable us to ensure that people do not follow the path of least resistance, which is what they sold yesterday, but more readily embraced the things that we need them to sell, which is part of our digital strategy.","And then the fourth thing we will deploy something we spend a lot of time working on the last four months, what I call a RAD model. That is a term to address how you think about sales segmentation in the purest form, how you tier customers, Tier 1, 2 and 3 based not just on what you sell them today but more readily on what you have the potential to sell them on.","So potential versus current and then you tier customers between an existing customer or that you want to retain or potentially develop subject to your share of wallet or a customer that you want to acquire. And according to where a customer sits in that nine box, then the degree of sales coverage that they get or visits from somebody like myself changes.","So those are four examples of what we're doing to try to ramp our commercial momentum. Obviously in addition to that, I've talked previously about greater alignment with strategic partners. I referenced in today's script the notion of going to market more readily with hyperscale players, but we have some tremendous partners in industry verticals like Temenos, Guidewire, Adobe and the like that we want to embrace further and make sure we go-to-market with together.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo.","Edward Caso","Hi, good evening. Thank you for all the detail. Could you flesh out a little bit more of the commentary around \u2013 it sounded like an inability to get pricing and it is \u2013 is that going to take time for the sales organization to get going and the workforce to be sort of calibrated here? I mean, sort of when do you think you can get those \u2013 start to get some of the pricing for the value that you're hoping to give?","Brian Humphries","That's inherently a complex topic because we have a series of activities that we have from time and materials staff augmentation through to managed services or more fixed price type bids. But let me decompose your question down and Karen, perhaps you can comment as well on this.","With regards to the sales teams, their ability to ramp ultimately also depends on where they've come from before and if they know the client itself or if they know the industry. Our intent is of course to hire people who are able to sell business outcomes, who have the gravitas and the wherewithal to speak with the C-suites, understand the industry pain points and sell a business outcome.","So you need to expect them to last. However, as we deploy these salespeople and for the clients, they build relationships subsequently build a pipeline, the pipeline is ultimately progress and eventually turns into TCV, which later turns into revenue. For that reason that we spoken previously around the impact of these 500 headcount that we've agreed to hire, it's more a negative impact in terms of our cost structure into short-term.","However, I don't view it as a cost. I viewed as a investment that will have an appropriate return over time in the form of sales force gearing. So OpEx to gross margin dollars or indeed OpEx to revenue dollars and we are anticipating the revenue return from that to really kick in more in Q4 next year or indeed the first half of FY2021.","Look, the pricing dynamics are important. Karen can comment on those. I just wanted to add one point. If the client partner is the quarterback on a deal, they need to be surrounded with world-class experts that are aligned to a key practices and have competencies in those areas, whether that is artificial intelligence or analytics or digital engineering or cloud or otherwise.","We spend a great deal of time in recent months honing in on the model that we think will give us greater competency and greater technical capability to support a generalist client partner in front of the client. We do want to allocate more pricing power back to the client partner, but they will have to operate within certain bands or parameters as the deals are pricing on a quarterly basis. We will review those, that it will be some notions of checks and balances.","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. And so let me talk about a couple of things in pricing. One is what I would call market bill rates and pricing for new deals and renewals and so forth. If you look at the digital business, pricing continues to be very strong there. Obviously, you have a high demand in that business and the short supply of talent. So by definition bill rates continued to be strong there, where you do continue to see pressure on deals and particularly with renewals and vendor consolidations and so forth.","It's in the core part of the business, the heritage application maintenance, et cetera, part of the business where we do continue to see pricing pressure on those transactions. The other piece which we are referring to in the script is also around, what I would call contract hygiene. So the ability to get COLA increases, to get rolling changes when we promote people.","As you know for several years that was something that just was not commonly done in the industry. And it's something that many firms have started to reinitiate into their portfolio over the last few years. We've made some progress this year where we have automated COLA adjustments and so forth, but I think we still have a lot of opportunity to continue to get better at that and enforcing contract terms. And in particular, when we promote people to either rotate them into new opportunities that are appropriate for their new level or to get rate adjustments within their existing clients, so both of those are opportunities that we continue to see as we move forward.","Edward Caso","Thank you. The next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Hi, thanks so much and appreciate all the detail here. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the cost, the soft cost, the hard cost to attain the $500 million to $550 million in savings from Fit for Growth. How much disruption might there be on both culture and then also on the revenues, aside from the 250 that you called out from getting out of the content work?","Brian Humphries","I would say, the majority of the people we're targeting through this exercise are senior to mid-level executives. They tend to be not declined partners in front of clients, but some degree of middle management that has crept into the system over the years. Of course, we're spending a huge amount of time bringing our team through these changes and making sure that they are contextualized and that people know we are investing in growth.","To be honest, I feel as though there's a degree of swagger coming back in Cognizant these days. Client partners, in my opinion, will be delighted with the news today that we are returning to a two-in-a-box model. And they do appreciate the fact that we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to reinvest back into the business, including more coverage and giving the sales folks an opportunity to earn more than ever before via having a more leveraged sales compensation plan.","Of course, that is not for everybody and there will be some degree of disruption. But we aim to mitigate that as best we can. And as I said, not only we are adding more people in deploying segmentation, but we're also honing in on optimization of skills via competency model that will be measured on a more thorough basis going forward. So look, it's very hard to control this. It's a people business. We're spending a huge amount of time communicating, contextualizing but we feel it's the right thing to do.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Bachman","Hi. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a clarification. The question, Karen, the clarification, just to be clear on the content ops is whatever we think the normalized run rate for Cognizant in 2020, we should go ahead and take an additional amount out from our revenue expectations of, I don't know, $150 million or something. As we assumed that content ops gets at least partially taken out next year.","And then my question is directed to Brian. Brian, you talked about swagger in the last comment. And on the last conference call, I think you said win rates had gone up, but I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about what you see as the economic backdrop. A number of companies, the IT services side have called out some incremental weakness, but juxtapose that against what you've seen in your time there. I think frankly, putting a lot more initiative into the sales side, if you could talk about a little bit about your win rates and how those might bounce out. Thanks very much.","Karen McLoughlin","So Keith, it's Karen. Let me just cover off on the content situation. First, you're right. As you think about the model for next year, it is appropriate to take some portion of our estimate of the 240 to 270. As we said, it will not \u2013 we don't expect it at this point to all go away at the beginning of the year. We think that we'll phase in throughout the year, although I would say it would be more heavily weighted to the first part of the year.","The other thing I would also like to find out what that range is that it does assume that in certain of the client's situations that they may exit more than just this specific digital operations work, that they may choose to transition more work. So this is our best estimate at this time of what we think the annualized impact would be. And obviously, we'll provide as much color as we can as we understand further the transition plans.","Brian Humphries","And Keith, with regards to the second question, yes, of course, it didn't go unnoticed with us as well, but we're delighted to have beaten consensus and indeed our guidance for this quarter. But bear in mind, we had set guidance prudently and we're also walking into the coming quarter having read the dynamics in the industry. So we remained somewhat I would say prudent going into this quarter as well. The backdrop is uncertain.","However, I would say, if I look at the micro element within Cognizant. First of all, growth is permeating the company. We're going back to our roots, is back to basics and I think people are actually delighted with that. We found appreciation of focusing on growth as opposed to margin rate. We have very deliberately insisted on a significant uptake in executive presence with customers, I'm leading by example myself. And that permeates the organization as well. And then of course, Karen and I have been working on what we announced today for a number of months now.","And so we've been trying to start looking at deals, not with today's cost structure but envisaging the economic value of deals over time with tomorrow's cost structure, which as you know, we're aiming to reduce and we know in Cognizant that once we get our foot in the door with clients, because we have confidence in our teams and confidence in our delivery, we tend to land and expand. And hence that\u2019s also the reason we're deploying the RAD model going forward to make sure we accelerate new logos and cross sell and upsell.","So, those are the positives, but again, the backdrop is uncertain. Certainly in the UK it's an uncertain, I would say in North America, what we found is there is continued compression in legacy businesses and pricing pressure under renewals continues at a steady rate, but the digital imperatives remain key.","I've been pleasantly surprised as I've dealt with C-suite executives throughout the world, that digital is certainly not viewed as a cost center expense. It is very much viewed as a critical enabler both on the defense as well as on the offense for these companies to disrupt or indeed to avoid being disrupted by more nimble next generation companies. And that is an area where on the contrary I do not see demand constraints. I see more supply constraints given the nature of the teams we need to fulfill those demands.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi Group.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hi Brian. Hi Karen. It's good to see the velocity on Fit for Growth initiatives. I want to start by asking if you could provide maybe a framework for how investors should think of the trajectory of growth over the next couple of years as these initiatives unfold. I mean, will we see perhaps a flattish type pace before higher growth kicks in. And that's I guess including the impact of the CMT the content ops. And then in the meantime, what are your thoughts on providing metrics to the investor community that help us if you are on the right track?","Karen McLoughlin","So Ashwin in terms of growth, I think obviously, it's early to give guidance for next year although certainly we would expect that we will start to see some acceleration over versus constant currency organic growth this year. Q4 is obviously a little bit light and Q1 does tend to be a slower quarter for us. So when we give guidance in February, we'll have a little bit more color on how we see the rest of the year playing out in terms of incremental revenue from the sales hires and so forth.","We I think as we had talked about this before, we do not anticipate any significant revenue next year from that investment. It really takes about 12 months for the sales teams to ramp-up and actually generate a revenue that becomes incremental to us. So I think that would be more back ended and certainly into 2021. And now all of that obviously excludes the impact of the content, moderate content work in the digital operations practice. But excluding that, that's how we would expect it to play out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Thanks. On the $500 million to $550 million of gross annualized savings, what's the net savings there? Because it sounds like there's a drag from investments on adjusted operating margins in fiscal year 2020, but can we expect a positive impact of margins there after in fiscal year 2021. I\u2019m just wondering if there might be some one-time investments in fiscal year 2020 that go away so that fiscal 2021 and beyond we'll see some net drop to the bottom line.","Karen McLoughlin","Yes. So I think, obviously Bryan as we\u2019ve said, and as you heard on the call we were assuming a target range of 16% to 17% next year, roughly in-line with 2019. As we talked about on the call, there is about a 120 basis points that we have to make up given the lower incentive-based compensation this year. And then on top of that, the investments in sales and training and so forth.","I think it's premature obviously to give guidance beyond 2020, but certainly, we think the investments we'll make in sales will start to pay off in 2021. I would anticipate that certainly the investments that we're making in branding and training and rescaling and so forth, and those will continue on for quite some time. I think we think that perhaps those are areas that we've under invested in recently and so those will become part of the core of the organization going forward. But certainly, this is still a relatively linear business. So as we look to accelerate revenue growth in the future, that should certainly help to stabilize and provide some margin opportunity depending year to year on the investments that we want to make in the business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity.","Rod Bourgeois","Hey guys. Hey, a lot of work done here in seven months. If I go back over Cognizant's history, it's had a distinctive ability to mine its large clients for additional revenues. Clearly that client mining performance has slowed in recent years. And so my question here is whether you're seeing ways to rejuvenate Cognizant's client mining ability. Are there corrective measures being made or new initiatives specifically on the front for client mining? The RAD model makes a ton of sense here, but I'm also wondering if there are practical changes beyond the RAD model to better connect with the large clients.","Brian Humphries","Yes. So, hi rod. It's a good question and look, if I look back over the last four years and the data will tell you that we have been growing new logos but not really accelerating new logo revenue and really the pipeline and the TCV in the last 18 months or so, stop this year performing where we needed it to be. But the bigger issue was to your point, the install base accounts and we had stopped mining or upselling and on the contrary because of pricing erosion at the time of renewals that became a little bit of a drag on the business.","So very much at the core of the RAD model is of course hearing customers, make some potential, not based on where we are today. And of course segmenting customers than between acquisition customers versus a customer that you already exist in that you want to develop or where you already exist that you're simply trying to retain.","So the RAD model was key to achieving this. Sales compensation is also key because in our existing accounts, what we want to do is get much more leverage in the sales compensation program and put parameters into portion of people's compensation such that they are not just enticed but they're also obligated from their earnings point of view to cross-sell the portfolio into digital and beyond as opposed to simply selling what they sold yesterday, which has traditionally been a path of least resistance.","And then the third thing of course, as we're thinking about upselling and cross selling, a lot of that leads to different decision makers. It's more project based, it's more pod cultures in digital engineering. It's line of service. So, distinctively changing out some client partners, we've done a good job on that in some of the accounts I've seen for us in the last few months.","These are client partners that joined Cognizant in the last year or so, or 18 months, a different background, a different compensation model. But again, I don't think about the salary of a salesperson as a cost. I think about it as an investment and therefore I think about it in terms of sales gearing both on a gross margin level versus OpEx or indeed on revenue basis versus OpEx.","And then last but not least, we were really trying to segment our own capabilities into a four box great sellers who understand the industry and understand the technology is in the top right hand quadrant. You also have a bunch of people who are very competent with technology but not really sellers. Some of those you can migrate across to more commercial skills. Some of them will simply remain presales types oriented, presales oriented people.","Some people are frankly great sellers but don't really understand the industry well enough or the customer pain points. We obviously have to educate them and then the people in the bottom left that are the worst of both worlds, not particularly good commercial skills in terms of getting a PO signed but certainly not technical either. Those are the people that most likely you'll see exit the company going forward, particularly in a sales comp plan where with a higher variable portion of compensation they will not be earning as much as they have been previously.","And then one of the final actions we've taken to ensure cross selling is to put all of these so-called CSE's. These are our more specialists salespeople aligned into the practice and service lines to ensure a great deal of focus on competency assessments, certifications, and then need alignment with our partners that intersect nonetheless with verticals to make sure we have the right skill sets and indeed the right go to market partnerships to do QBR with more of our partners and make sure we end up with asymmetrical accounts where clients can, our partners can bring us into their accounts and vice versa. We can bring them into ours and leverage the best of both worlds.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company.","Bryan Bergin","Hi. Thank you. First I just wanted to clarify on the content ops, is there an opportunity to sell this practice or is this more so a wind down and transfer and then within banking and healthcare, can you just give us a sense on these large clients how close you may be to seeing any inflection in the trajectory there or at what point are they just not among the top clients?","Brian Humphries","So I think in banking and healthcare we have some tremendous examples actually and I've seen some of these myself have accounts that we have really turned around in the last two years through different account teams, much more focused on digital. But that's a blueprint or a qualification that we need to bring more broadly across the company. You will see some inflection points, particularly in healthcare as we get into FY20, because we will be rounding the tougher compares.","As you know, many of our healthcare clients for in particular merged into two and ended up with a very different rate dynamic for Cognizant. And we will be running that once we get to Q1 next year. In banking it's less obvious in the sense there wasn't a single inflection point or ongoing trends, some captives, some insourcing, particularly in a world of DevOps.","But as I said earlier, well the legacy business or traditional areas of the business have been under some pressure of price renewals. I do see opportunity for us to better participate in a digital spend that these banks have at their disposal and have been prioritizing and that's what we're setting out to achieve in the coming years, of course.","So no major inflection point, but I will say I am pleased with the revised energy I'm seeing in the North America team now in particular and the new banking leader and a new healthcare leader they seem to be going down well with clients. And that's always a good positive leading indicator.","With regards to the content moderation business that's something we're working with our partners on right now to understand how to best transition the work. Whether it is one of the options or reference or another, we will determine that in the coming periods. For now, we've taken a restructuring charge against it, but our intention is to work very aggressively with partners to make sure that we can transition our employees with minimal disruption. And of course, financial consequence of that is of course minimal charges as well.","Katie Royce","Okay. And this is Katie. I think with that, that will end today's call. Thank you all for your questions and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2012 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com.","The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. On the call this morning, we'd like to cover a few topics. First, I'll provide highlights of our first quarter results and our revised 2012 guidance. Next, Gordon will discuss our detailed operating results with a particular emphasis on the trends we've been seeing in the demand environment for our services over the past 90 days. And then Karen will come back and cover our financial metrics and revised guidance in more detail, at which point I'll return to put some color around the investment that we continue to make over the remainder of 2012 to ensure that we maintain industry-leading growth. As always, we'll leave time at the end for questions and answers.","Our first quarter revenue grew nearly 3% sequentially and nearly 25% over last year to over $1.71 billion. These financial results slightly exceeded our guidance and demonstrate continued industry-leading growth. While we delivered solid performance in the quarter and we continued to gain market share relative to our competition, we did not see as strong an acceleration in growth as we typically see coming out of Q1 and into April. This has led us to take a conservative approach and to reset our full year 2012 revenue guidance to at least $7.34 billion.","When we provided our prior 2012 outlook in February, we anticipated a softer and volatile European business but expected North America to be on a normal revenue trajectory. However, when we looked at revenue for the month of April, the acceleration we usually see in our North American business coming out of Q1 is slower than what we anticipated. This trend was particularly evident in the banking portion of our financial services segment and the pharmaceuticals portion of our healthcare segment.  Gordon will provide more detailed characterization of demand in these segments shortly.","While our full year performance will be below our prior expectations, we're very pleased that our forecasted growth rate continues to lead the industry. The drivers of demand remain intact, as reflected by business development metrics that remain at high levels, both in relative and absolute terms. We're confident that Cognizant will meet our revised growth targets for 2012 and continue to lead our sector in growth.","In support of our continued confidence in the business this morning, we announced an expansion of our existing share repurchase program $1 billion from its current $600 million approval level. Karen will provide more details on this expansion shortly.","Our confidence stems from the belief that exceptional execution over differentiated strategy distinguishes us from our peers. Our unique reinvestment approach affords us the ability to invest in superior client-facing teams, deeper industry expertise, and importantly, the right portfolio of services to meet clients' rapidly evolving needs.","In our core business, what we call Horizon 1, we continued to drive growth by deepening penetration in existing accounts, entering new accounts and expanding to under-penetrated geographies. Horizon 2 offerings, such as Business Process Outsourcing or BPO, IT Infrastructures Services or ITIS and Cognizant Business Consulting or CBC have achieved critical mass and have been leading the company in terms of growth rates as they scale across the industries and geographies. And we're pleased with our progress around our newly formed portfolio of emerging Horizon 3 offerings, in which we have seeded investment. In a short period of time, the focus on these services has created strong interest with our clients.","Today, we will again use our 3 Horizon model to explain how we are addressing the changes happening in the marketplace.","I'll now hand the call over to our President, Gordon Coburn, who'll walk you through the demand environment in our core Horizon 1 and 2 businesses. Gordon?","Gordon J. Coburn","Thank you, Francisco. Although we had to reduce our full year growth expectations, due primarily to the performance of our core Horizon 1 businesses, it's very important to keep in perspective that these businesses are still extraordinarily healthy, as demonstrated by our continued industry-leading growth. We believe that the market for our Horizon 1 and 2 businesses is under-penetrated, which provides a strong -- which provides strong opportunities for continued growth, and that our unique financial model, global delivery network and intimate client relationships positions us to capture an outsized share of that market.","The longer-term demand environment remains strong. We are helping clients navigate secular shifts in their industries while at the same time driving more efficient and effective operations. For Horizon 1 services, we continue to see broad opportunities to expand our global delivery model. Our clients continue to turn to us to help drive greater levels of productivity through best-in-class methodologies. At the same time, the dual mandate of driving both operational efficiencies and innovation has resulted in a notable increase in large transformational deals across our business.","Clients are reinvesting savings generated from these cost-optimizing programs into initiatives that will enable them to rethink their business model, rewire operations or reexamine which activities are core to their competitive edge versus which would have been -- which would be better handled by a partner like Cognizant with deeper, more scalable expertise.","From a demand standpoint, this is creating newer opportunities for partnership with our clients across multiple service lines. Within Horizon 2, our addressable market is expanding, particularly within the BPO area. Our core BPO offerings continue to show solid growth, supported by expansion of work with existing clients and recent wins with new clients. The vertical focus of our BPO practice based on deep knowledge of the industries we serve, coupled with the ability to deliver value via wage arbitrage, productivity improvements and technology-enabled modernization and automation drives our competitive strength.","This is evidenced in some of our most recent wins, including several multiyear deals with major healthcare payer firms to provide claims processing, enrollment and several other industry-aligned services. We've also added another multiyear deal involving the delivery of clinical data management and drug safety services, this time for our pharmaceutical firm in Asia-Pacific. ","Within ITIS, we continue to focus on scaling across industries and clients. ITIS is becoming more mainstream as clients continue to adopt the global delivery model, which is fueling \"higher than company average\" growth in the space. Q1 brought us some key wins in the space, particularly in Financial Services and Healthcare. Of note, we won a key ITIS deal with a Scandinavian financial services client this quarter. Growing interest in ITIS projects has kept our pipeline robust.","Cognizant Business Consulting continues to grow faster than the company average. We continue to see a growing interest in large-scale IT and business transformation work as well as cost optimization projects. Importantly, as recognized by industry analysts, we have built a strong upstream consulting organization focused on delivering value-added consulting. To illustrate, we recently won an assignment with a major retailer to analyze the current state of multichannel operations, store operations, merchandising and ERP and create a roadmap for business transformation. Additionally, for a top 10 insurer, we are defining the future functional state of their customer relationship landscape.","Now let me shift to an industry view of our business. In Financial Services, which includes our banking and insurance clients, we saw mixed results between these 2 subsectors, particularly in North America. Our overall banking sector remained flat during the quarter. This was driven primarily by softness among our top North American backing clients. While we expect our banking sector to grow in 2012, the pace of growth will certainly be slower than we expected 3 months ago. This is especially true among our large North American clients, where there remains a heightened focus on cost optimization due to the macroeconomic and regulatory pressures which are driving fundamental changes in their business models.  As a result, their IT spend acceleration with us is not as strong as we originally anticipated and as many of them indicated at the beginning of the year. Among these larger clients, there's a slower ramp in discretionary projects.","Interestingly, the same industry dynamics are resulting in robust growth among our midsized banking clients. Generally, these clients are not as far along in their transition to a global delivery model, and the industry pressures are serving as a catalyst to accelerate this transition.","Our insurance customers saw a strong growth of 6% in the first quarter, and we expect continued solid growth both in Q2 and for the rest of the year. Across insurance, we continue to consolidate positions with existing clients and added several new logos this quarter. As such, our insurance pipeline remains healthy.","Within healthcare, it's another mixed story. Our pharmaceutical business declined 4% sequentially in Q1, while the payor side of healthcare grew 7%. To some extent, the softness in the first quarter for the pharmaceutical industry is a normal seasonal pattern. However, the Q1 weakness was more pronounced this year than in prior years. The industry continues to go through a significant transformation due to the large number of drugs coming off patent. The pullback on discretionary spend as a result of this patent cliff has had a more significant impact on our rate of growth in this industry than we anticipated 90 days ago as we see our pharma clients underspend their original plans for the year.","Our revenue mix in the pharma industry is more weighted towards discretionary work than our overall company mix. Therefore the slower-than-anticipated revenue discretionary spend is impacting us. We expect our growth rate for this subsector to lag the overall company growth rate in Q2 and for the rest of the year.","Meanwhile, the payor side of healthcare continues to be driven by changes in the regulatory environment. It grew 7% sequentially in Q1. We continue to see an increased number of large-scale complex transformational opportunities in this space.","Moving to our performance by geography. As I just highlighted in our Q1 North America performance, we saw sluggishness in banking and life sciences. Excluding these subsectors, business is generally playing out as expected, with clients increasing spend on both cost-containment and innovation-related initiatives.","Despite protracted economic issues, which constrained spending by some clients and increased demand for cost containment by others, European revenue grew 3.5% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. We had several significant wins during the quarter, including a large SAP program for a U.K. utility company, a managed-services-based application outsourcing engagement for a French life sciences company and a large enterprise application development and maintenance program for a major consumer goods company.","While we did have a solid quarter in Europe, our expectations remained cautious in the short term for this market. However, as we have stated before, Europe remains an attractive long-term market for us. After all, the overall European IT services market is roughly the same size as the North American IT services market. Yet the penetration of the global delivery model in Europe is currently a fraction of that in North America. As such, we believe Europe merits our continued focus and investment. In particular, we continue to focus on building local teams on the ground across key markets in Europe to address the specific needs of European clients.","We are also systematically ensuring that we have the capability to deliver the full range of Cognizant service offerings in discrete European markets to meet client demand. Despite representing a small revenue share, we were very pleased with the strong growth in Asia-Pacific and rest of the world, which grew 7% sequentially and 47% year-over-year. Growth in the sector was driven by a few key wins in some of our high-growth service areas, like ITIS, such as our recent win with a large global bank to provide IP infrastructure and application support across all critical areas of the bank from 3 different global locations.","This program, which is designed and delivered as a utility service across the bank, emphasizes a strong transformational agenda which is targeted at optimizing costs while enhancing the end user experience.","I will now hand the call over to Karen to comment on our financial performance and guidance. Karen?","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. As detailed in our press release, our first quarter revenue grew 2.9% sequentially and 24.8% over last year to over $1.71 billion versus our guidance of at least $1.7 billion.","We were pleased with the growth across our business segments and geographies. Although the first quarter played out as we anticipated and we have seen acceleration in demand as we entered Q2, the acceleration is slower than we would expect at this time of year. Given this, we have taken a conservative stance towards our assumption for reacceleration of growth for the remainder of the year, and we are accordingly revising our full year 2012 guidance.","For ease of reference, we have included a fact sheet with the earnings release to provide key data on revenue by industry and revenue by geography, which has already been discussed by Gordon. ","Now let me discuss some of our other results, and I'll begin with revenue and customers. Application development represented 51.4% of revenue and application management, 48.6% for the quarter. Development grew 27.9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Management grew 21.7% year-over-year and 2.7% sequentially.","We saw fairly balanced growth between development and management as clients expanded outsourcing projects to address their 2012 savings objectives. 31.3% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts during the first quarter. As expected, on a sequential basis, our pricing during the first quarter was stable.","We closed the quarter with 805 active customers, and the number of accounts which we consider to be strategic increased by 5. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 196.","Turning to costs. On a GAAP basis, cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was approximately $984.5 million and included $4.6 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional staff, both on-site and offshore, required to support our revenue growth.","We increased our technical staff by over 2,200 during the quarter and ended the quarter with over 131,600 technical staff. First quarter SG&A including depreciation and amortization expenses was $408.9 million on a GAAP basis and included approximately $26.8 million of stock-based compensation expense.","Our GAAP operating margin was 18.6% for the quarter, and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 20.4%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This is a normal pattern for us in Q1 and positions us well to absorb promotion and wage increases scheduled to start taking effect during the second quarter.","We have further extended our Indian rupee expense hedging program with over $3.7 billion in outstanding hedges of our rupee expenses, which will mature each month through 2015 at an average rate of approximately 51.9. We had $11.1 million of interest income. In addition, we had a $6.7 million loss on nonoperating income. This included a net foreign exchange loss of $7.3 million. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.4%.","Our diluted share count for the quarter was 309.2 million shares, up slightly from Q4. During the first quarter, we repurchased just over 600,000 shares at an average price of $70.84 for a total cost of $42.7 million. This morning, the company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the expansion of its existing share repurchase program by $400 million, bringing the total authorization under the current repurchase program to $1 billion. To date, 6.2 million shares at a cost of $423.3 million has been repurchased under this program.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with almost $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments. During the first quarter, operating activities generated $101.7 million of cash. Financing activities generated approximately $7.1 million of cash. This was comprised of net proceeds of $49.8 million related to option exercises and related tax benefits as well as our employee stock purchase program, partially offset by expenditures of $42.7 million towards our share repurchase program. We spent approximately $60.5 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. And during 2012, we expect our capital expenditures to total approximately $370 million.","Based on our approximately $1.4 billion receivable balance on March 31, we finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 75.6 days, up from the last quarter and up from 73.7 days from the first quarter of 2011. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $187 million, up from $140 million at the end of Q4. Approximately 60% of the Q1 unbilled balance was billed in April.","Net headcount increased by almost 2,800 people during the quarter. 30% of gross additions for the quarter were direct college hires, while 70% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 140,500 employees globally.","Attrition in the first quarter was 10.5%, marginally higher than our Q4 attrition of 10.1%. As we have discussed in the past, there is no consistent methodology in the industry to report attrition. We have historically reported attrition by annualizing the turnover which occurred within the quarter, including both voluntary and involuntary. Our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO and employees in our training program.","Utilization decreased slightly on a sequential basis during Q1. Offshore utilization was approximately 67%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who were in our training program was approximately 78%. On-site utilization was 93% during the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our growth expectations for the second quarter of 2012 as well as the full year. As previously mentioned, we have adjusted our full year guidance to reflect the slower-than-anticipated acceleration in demand coming out of Q1. For the second quarter of 2012, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.79 billion. This represents sequential growth of at least 4.6%. We have significant revenue visibility into our second quarter guidance due to the high level of recurring revenue and long-term nature of our customer relationships. In fact, today, as in typical quarters, we have customer commitments for well over 90% of our second quarter revenue guidance.","For the full year, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $7.34 billion. This represents growth of at least 20% compared to 2011. As has been typical in past years, we expect the majority of our growth for the remainder of 2012 will come from the ramp-up of clients that we won over the past month and years.","During the remainder of 2012, we intend to closely monitor our spending while continuing to invest in our Horizon 1, 2 and 3 businesses. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to remain in the range of 19% to 20%, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.","Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.80 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.87, which excludes estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.07. This guidance anticipates a Q2 share count of approximately 309.5 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25%. Our guidance excludes any future nonoperating FX gains or losses. ","For the full year 2012, we expect our GAAP EPS to be at least $3.36 and our full year non-GAAP EPS to be at least $3.62, excluding $0.26 of estimated full year stock-based compensation expense. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 309 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25%. It also excludes any future nonoperating FX gains or losses.","Now I would like to turn the call back over to Francisco to comment on the demand environment in our Horizon 3 businesses and plans for the remainders of the year. Francisco?","Francisco D'Souza","Thanks, Karen. I'd like to end our prepared comments by putting our Q1 results and our projected 2012 results into context. I want to make sure that we don't lose sight of the fact that our performance in terms of first quarter sequential growth and our outlook for Q2 and for the rest of the year is at the very top of our peer group.","Relative performance compared to our peer group is the best indicator of our competitiveness. We continue to increase our market share, and we are still benefiting from the investment that we've made over the years to gain advantage in the marketplace.","As we look forward, our objectives for the remainder of 2012 and beyond are clear. We're focused on running our company in a prudent manner today while at the same time making the necessary investments to ensure that we remain competitive in the long run and continue to post industry-leading revenue growth","Our priorities going forward are as follows: First, our teams are laser-focused on working with our customers in order to ensure that we maintain our track record of winning a disproportionate share of opportunities in our robust pipeline; second, we'll maintain our focus on operational excellence to  maintain our target operating margins within the 19% to 20% range on a non-GAAP basis. We're confident that we can deliver this while still protecting our core areas of investments. And finally, we continue to invest in our Horizon 3 services to ensure that we remain the best partner to help clients to deliver on the dual mandates of both cost-saving and revenue-generating solutions that address the specific needs of their businesses.","We're pleased with the progress that we're making in our Horizon 3 areas. Though these services don\u2019t meaningfully contribute to revenue today, they lay a foundation for strong future growth and differentiate us as top leaders. We remain focused on 3 key areas within Horizon 3. The first area is new markets, which includes new geographies like Latin America and new industries like the government. The second Horizon 3 area in which we are focused is new delivery models, including platform-based services that break linearity between revenue and headcount. And our third area of Horizon 3 focus is based on the strong client interest that we're seeing in what we are calling the SMAC stack,  that is, the new emerging corporate IP stack based on social, mobile, analytics and cloud, or SMAC, for short.","Though driven by technology change, the SMAC stack has far-reaching impact on all aspect of business models. Let me give you some examples of the traction we're seeing in some of these H 3 areas. In our new markets area, we are selectively pursuing public sector clients around the world. And we've achieved a number of significant wins recently, including the World Bank, the U.K. Financial Services Authority and the healthcare services area of 1 of the 50 states from the United States. These examples illustrate our success leveraging our core competencies in IT and application services and deep domain expertise in banking and healthcare to unlock avenues of growth in new markets. In another example, this time in our new technologies or SMAC area, this quarter we were -- we added 3 more of our largest banking clients to the list of companies that consider us their preferred mobile solutions provider, one of which also selected us as a preferred social computing provider after we developed a social media command center to monitor what their customers were saying about one of their subsidiary brands on the Internet.  This example illustrates our ability to rapidly develop solution offerings based on new technologies and, equally importantly, leveraging our strong client-facing teams and solid relationships with our clients to rapidly scale these new offerings.","Our Horizon 3 offerings, while in their infancy, lay a solid foundation for Cognizant's long-term growth. At the same time, as Gordon highlighted, there remains ample -- growth opportunity in our core Horizon 1 and 2 services.","I'll end by saying that we continue to remain optimistic about the market opportunity ahead of us and about our ability to capture an outside share of that market based on our competitive position and approach to investing for long-term growth. For over a decade, we have demonstrated that reinvesting in our business in the form of more intimate client teams, deep-industry insights and a robust portfolio of services generates consistently higher growth rates than the rest of the industry. That remains true today.","We'd now like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess my one question, maybe if you can just give us an idea on North America and the expectations for growth in the second quarter, maybe the same thing for Financial Services, just to give us an idea of what the second quarter might look like and then just the balance of the year.  And then maybe just as a follow-up, if we can get an idea -- I know you give it usually in the Q, but just your growth in your top 5 and your top 10 clients?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, Tien-Tsin. Let me comment on North America, then Karen can talk about the top 5 and 10.  In North America, we would expect in Q2 where we guided to about 4.6% overall growth. North America, we would expect to drive that growth, so it will probably grow a little bit faster than company average. And we're assuming Europe would grow a little bit slower than company average in the second quarter. And that's -- that obviously bakes in all our assumptions about the slower-than-expected acceleration in Financial Services. Karen, do you want to talk about the top 5, top 10?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. Top 5 for the quarter was 14% of revenue and top 10 was 25% of revenue.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, maybe I can just sneak in one more, just your strategy for buying back stock. I'm curious, obviously stocks indicating weaker. I'm curious if it's going to be 10b5-driven, opportunistic?  What's the strategy?","Gordon J. Coburn","We have in place a 10b5 program from before increasing the authorization today. How we'll use the additional authorization, I think it will be somewhat opportunistic, certainly depending on where exactly this stock price settles down. We're in no huge rush to do it, but certainly depending on valuation, we would look at doing it on an accelerated basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the wage increases that you may be giving this year. Karen mentioned sort of controlling expenses and just curious how that part of the equation worked into it?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, Ed. Let me be very clear on this. We're still growing at a great pace. Yes, we're certainly disappointed. We had to take our growth from 23% down to 20%, but that's still tremendous growth. That change in full year expectations has no impact whatsoever on our plans for salary increments. We communicated earlier this year that our salary increments for our junior middle population go into effect this month and for more senior people, at the end of the quarter. Those plans are unchanged. The magnitude of the salary increases, I think, are going to be very consistent with what we're seeing at other top players in the industry. We're expecting approximately 8% offshore, that excludes promotions and low single-digits on-site. So no change in our plans.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the visa challenges, and how that's causing you to change or not change your sort of workforce deployment?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. We've been evolving our workforce deployment for a number of years now. As we have scale, as we have credibility in the U.S. market, we're certainly doing more U.S. hiring, both of lateral hires and the last 2 years, college hires. We now recruit at 15 to 20 campuses, we hired several hundred U.S. college students this year. The challenge is there are not enough U.S. IT workers. It's very simple math. We're not graduating enough. So we can certainly continue to supplement what we can find locally with talent from around the world. We continue to have access to visas. That access to visas has not caused us any revenue leakage. Clearly, there's a very significant cost to it that's baked into our plans. We certainly monitor the situation carefully, but it has not impacted the business.","Nitin Mohta - Macquarie Research","Last question, given the lower -- the still low attrition here and then its lower forecast, are you going to be pulling back your growth, your hiring expectations for this year?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, Ed.  Absolutely. Remember, the way the business model works and is supposed to work, is that we can flex up and down our lateral just-in-time hiring. Obviously, now that we're expected to grow at a slower pace this year, we'll still add a lot of people. But we will add not -- fewer people than what we would have otherwise, so we'll continue to do lateral hiring, but the pace of lateral hiring, obviously, will not be as fast as if we were growing at 23%. We're obviously going to honor all of our offers from colleges for the people who are joining this year. So there's no change in plans for that, but certainly the pace of hiring will not be as fast and it will be adjusted for the revised guidance. It's exactly the way the model should work as the demand environment changes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right, guys, so the lack of acceleration in the U.S.  Can you elaborate more, almost mathematically whether this reflects a weaker pipeline, decision slowness or is there a situation where there's cutbacks at existing large clients that's offsetting the benefit of new deals that are currently ramping? If you could give us a little more specificity on what's mathematically driving the lack of acceleration.","Francisco D'Souza","I think, let me -- this is Frank. Let me take a crack at it, and then I'll ask Gordon to jump in as well. I think what we're seeing in North America is at the first level that, as we said coming into the year, that IT budgets remain flat, perhaps at the slightly upward bias year-over-year. The -- and when we look at the overall level of deal activity across the business, we continue to be -- to see a number of deals in the marketplace. Clients are actively out there. What we have seen, though, is that some deals are, particularly in financial services and in life sciences, are shifting out, particularly on the discretionary side. We saw a slow start to the year. We talked to you about that in the first quarter. What we would normally expect to see at this time of the year, as we've said to you in past years, is that coming into the second quarter, we would see a -- quite a significant acceleration in growth as budgets get finalized and you start to see the full quarter impact of approved budgets. That's what we -- we've seen that acceleration this year, but not to the extent that we would have expected when we gave you our prior guidance. And that's really what -- that phenomenon is really what's caused us to temper our full year expectations.","Gordon J. Coburn","I think that's accurate. And as you said, particularly pronounced in life sciences and the large banks. And why the large banks and not the midsized banks?  The midsized banks, there's still a lot of low-hanging fruit. So one of the ways that they can control their cost is to transition existing activities to global delivery. Obviously, the larger banks have already done most of that, so therefore they look at are the activities necessary or are there ways to reduce the total cost of ownership?  So it's -- given the pressure in the industry, we understand what's happening. Clients are being very transparent with us about their need to do this.  In some cases, their need to understand budgets; in some cases, the need to move things around. It's a challenging time out there for some of our clients. But once again, the good news is our clients are still growing with us. It's just issue of the pace of growth is not as robust as we would like.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And Gordon, can you just elaborate, kind of as a follow-up, is the -- has the pipeline actually contracted over the last 3 months?  Or are these discretionary projects remaining in the pipeline, they're just further down the road in terms of when they'll get funded?","Gordon J. Coburn","Oh, I think it's the latter. The discretionary projects, particularly ones that were originally in scope for this year, are obviously ones that are priorities for clients. So when they don't have the dollars, you, generally, you're not seeing them say, \"Okay, we'll never do it.\"  They're saying, \"Yes, it's not going to make this year's cut.\"  Will there also be examples of projects that are shuttered? Yes, of course, but that's the small piece of it. The bigger piece is clients are saying, \"I have to make tough decisions on what I can afford to do this year.\"","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One question on Europe and a quick follow-up to Rod's question in the North America. But on Europe, it looked like to us in the first quarter, the trends were a little bit are milding [ph] better than at least we would have expected, especially following last quarter's results. A, is that kind of trend with confidence in your view sustainable through the rest of the year out of the European sequential growth rates, or was that also seasonal? Can you give us a little more color on what drove the pick-up there sequentially? And then just back to North America, and in the bank side, specific to drivers, what are the drivers specifically that are going to leave that to come back down the road? I mean, obviously, right now capital markets, banks are a little weaker. Can you give us some specific examples?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, let me take Europe, and then Frank will talk about Financial Services. In Europe, I would not, not expect the trend of strong performance that we saw in Q1 to continue. Our assumption is that, as I've mentioned earlier, in Q2, we would expect North America to grow faster than Europe. The strength in Europe in Q1 was somewhat isolated.  It was 1 or 2 accounts that primarily drove that growth.  Outside of that, Europe really -- outside those 1 or 2 accounts, Europe really played out the way we were originally anticipating for the quarter.","Francisco D'Souza","And when we look at -- let me just sum it on the question about banking. When we look at our banking clients, I think that in North America with the banking clients, the incredible volatility that many of our clients are seeing right now is causing them to pause, particularly as Gordon said, the bigger clients who have significantly already leveraged the global delivery model, that's causing them to pause and to sneak out a new floor. What I expect is that once that industry stabilizes and then starts to -- and we start to see spend reemerge, because many of the banks do realize that they need to continue to innovate for growth and they do need to -- and there's also some drive based on the regulatory changes that are happening in the industry. So my expectation is that, that growth will reaccelerate, but it will probably take 1 quarter or 2 for that to emerge. And certainly, our current planning assumption is that banking, while we expect to see growth, will not be at the company average for the remainder of this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So Gordon, I think in the past, and Francisco, we've talked about this idea that as growth eventually decelerates for the model over some period of time that you guys would actually allow the margins to rise essentially to offset some of that potential impact. How far along are we in that thought process? Is this really just a temporary situation, or are you beginning to think about the potential for letting the margins expand at this rate with the growth beginning to decelerate?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, Julio. Let me be absolutely clear about that. I don\u2019t think we are anywhere near that issue. There is, in our belief, a lot of growth left in this business. Once again, put it in perspective, yes, we came down from 23% to 20%.  Compared to any other industry, that's -- that would be exponential growth. Even in our industry, it's dramatically above others. So we don't view the fact we took growth down by 3 points this year, especially given everything that's happened in the economy, as a signal or inflection point that growth, long-term growth for the industry is over. We still think there's a lot of growth left for this industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Hickey with Atlantic Equities.","Christopher Hickey - Atlantic Equities LLP","Could you provide us a little bit more color on dynamics in the pharma business, please? Specifically, color around the client behavior.  It seems some of the challenges the pharma companies are facing are fairly structural. So just trying to understand why the discretionary plans changed in a 3-month period?","Francisco D'Souza","I think it's a -- this is somewhat of a normal pattern that we see. As we've said in our prepared comments with pharma, although this year, that trend was more pronounced than we've seen in prior years. We see pharma companies, as a general trend, every year, once they go through their budget process, in the first quarter, they will then sort of assess what their view of is of demand for that year, and based on that, moderate or regulate their discretionary spending for that year. And so, while you're right that many of the issues that pharma are facing are longer-term structural issues, there is the quarter-to-quarter volatility that we always see in the Q1, Q2 timeframe based on what their outlook is for that particular year. This year, we saw that, as we said during the prepared comments, pharma as a group declined 4% in the first quarter. That's unusual. We normally, in past years, have seen that sector be roughly flat, maybe slightly up. It's unusual for us to see a decline, even in the first quarter. So the severity of that was a little more than we have seen in the past. And as a result of that, we're expecting that this year will be a weak year for discretionary spending in pharma and that for the full year, pharma will lag the overall company in terms of growth.","Christopher Hickey - Atlantic Equities LLP","If I could just sneak in a quick follow-up. Given what happened there and also the change in the banking dynamics in Q1 and also if we go back a year ago, the European situation, are you comfortable with your internal forecast, then, and that this is genuinely just changing dynamics of the end clients rather than anything else?","Gordon J. Coburn","The answer is, yes we are. The March, April timeframe each year is a very critical period for us, because that's when we see what is the pace of acceleration -- and which really sets the tone for the rest of the year. And quite honestly, it's tough to get that exact. When we look at the differences, it was primarily, as we said, financial services, life sciences. We understand why those things happen. So I don't think this is a breakdown in processes or a breakdown in our ability to forecast. But it's a very dynamic environment out there. And of the entire year, this March, April time point and the information we learn in March, April sets the tone for the year. So it's -- that's when we get, really get to understand what clients are going to do and how fast they're going to do it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Guys, can you comment on the third quarter?  Do you expect third quarter to be an acceleration from 2Q, or is it pretty much going to be similar to 2Q in terms of how spending plays out? If I use the low end of your 2Q guidance, it implies that Q2 year-over-year growth might actually be lower. And I just want to find a bit, is that caution or is that something you're seeing in the business LAMPs continuing that way?","Gordon J. Coburn","We think that's the appropriate assumption at this point. So if you back-calculate Q3 and Q4, we said, we're essentially saying that we expect sequential growth to be steady for Q3 and Q4 compared to Q2. We think that's appropriate right now based on the pace of acceleration that we're seeing. Once again, would we like it higher? Of course.  But we're still very proud of the fact that we're expecting to grow at least 4.6% in Q2. And we're quite comfortable that, that pace of growth would continue for the remainder of the year.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And can you provide a breakdown of pharma and payor within healthcare and maybe a similar breakdown between banks, insurance and other financial services within BFS side?","Gordon J. Coburn","Just give us a second. If you look at banks versus insurance to start with, I'm rounding a little bit here. But banks is about 2\/3 of our BFSI segment, and insurance is about 1\/3. And if you look at healthcare versus life sciences, there it's a little bit more weighted towards healthcare.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I wanted to get your perspective about the application maintenance versus development. In terms of the Q2 guidance and the remainder of the year, what are your assumptions with regard to which of those drive the growth? And what the percentage contributions may be?","Gordon J. Coburn","If -- my expectation is that for the year, we would see maintenance revenue grow faster than development revenue based on the revised guidance. The exact numbers are, obviously, always difficult to predict. But obviously, we think it will be a bit of a weaker development environment this year. So probably faster growth and maintenance.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Then maybe as a follow-up, with regard to the Horizons 1, 2 and 3, could you map similar assumptions? It sounds like Horizon 1 may be more discretionary versus 2 and 3. Can you flesh out some perspective as to the assumptions about those 3 buckets?","Gordon J. Coburn","Think about that a little bit differently. Don\u2019t think about it so much as maintenance versus development. Think about it as where they are in their life cycle. So Horizon 3 is all the brand-new stuff where we're planting the seeds for the future. So on a percentage basis, it will grow very fast. But as a impact on revenue, it will be minimal, because it's growing off of a negligible base. Horizon 2, which are the businesses that have recently hit critical mass, certainly, I would expect those to grow faster than the business overall. If you look at Horizon 2, obviously, both ITIS and BPO, we put it into the maintenance category. Consulting would be the discretionary category. And then in the Horizon 1, which is the vast majority of our revenue, that's the one where I think we would expect greater strength in maintenance than development.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","My question here is, first, what do you think in your opinion is the delta in the back half of the year spending? Is that discretionary spending? And if it is, what's your confidence in that delta and why?","Gordon J. Coburn","Are you saying delta for over-performance of guidance or to get to guidance?","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Either one, Gordon, whichever one you want to take first. Both would be great.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So to get to guidance, we're assuming there's no acceleration in growth rates compared to Q2. So, yeah, the math kind of works out to same sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 as we're projecting in Q2. So there's no hockey stick whatsoever built into our guidance. If there were to be over-performance for the year, that, I think, would come more from the discretionary work, because, obviously, we're being quite conservative on our assumptions for discretionary work based on the trends that we're seeing in March and April.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then is there anything outside of sort of what that particular piece is? I mean, discretionary side, I mean, you've lowered it once here. How do we have confidence that the back half of the year and visibility increase on the back half of the year, are you taking less of a cut at discretionary spending? I'm just trying to get a full feel for how you would characterize the lowering of guidance and what gives you confidence that this is the only time you're going to have to do it?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. As I said earlier, March and April are the critical period for us, because that's when people start spending their current year budget. So we now have that under our belts, so we understand what the trajectory is. And that -- so that gives us much a better ability to forecast what people are planning, because now they're actually spending those dollars, and we're seeing it at the pace that they're ramping it up. Obviously, we've -- obviously, we're being conservative on discretionary spend, which I think is appropriate in this environment. And the fact that there is no hockey stick in the back half of the year I think is very important. So we're not assuming that there's this great rebound in discretionary spend in the second half of the year. We're assuming it will kind of continue at the pace of growth that we're seeing in Q2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In banking, do you think Cognizant is reaching a full penetration level inside these larger banking clients? I guess in other words, there isn't a lot of -- maybe there isn't a lot wallet share gains left in those large banking clients?","Francisco D'Souza","I think that in the traditional services application, development, application maintenance, that might be true in some of the very largest banks. But remember that we've got a whole range of new services, IT Infrastructure Services, Business Process Outsourcing, consulting and so on and so forth, not to mention the Horizon 3 services that we're now working on, where I think there's still plenty of growth available. What I think is also the case, though, is that as penetration rates increase in some of these larger banks, it does make us, perhaps, more sensitive to their ups and downs in their business environment because in past cycles, what we've seen is that as our clients, whether in banking or in any other industry, as they come under cost pressure, that serves somewhat as a catalyst to move more work to a global delivery model. That tends to -- that trend tends to be somewhat muted as penetration rates in these banks increase. So I think there's a little bit of an offset there. But in general, I don\u2019t think that even in the largest banks, I would say, that penetration rates across our full range of services are -- we're fully penetrated. I think there's still growth there.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, just one quick follow-up. I think, Gordon, you said Q3 and Q4 look probably pretty similar. But isn't Q4 usually seasonally weak?  So just wanted to get your thoughts there.","Gordon J. Coburn","Q4 can go either way. When it's seasonally weak is in years that are very robust. Obviously, we're not going to see clients spend at their full budget capacity early in the year. So I don't think we're going to have a situation where clients run out of budget dollars during the year. So it's -- where you see that is where people run out of dollars. And given the pace, there's -- typically, clients are under-spending their budgets early in the year. So, I'm not particularly concerned about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Your thoughts about the recruiting for the remainder of the year, just given the fact that the additions during the quarter were kind of light?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. Let me -- that sort of sets up to hit on just people in general. Our people statistics are unbelievably good this quarter. We had 10%, 10.6% attrition. And that's an all-in number. Just by comparison, that number was 15% last year. And even last year was a pretty good year. So we are doing terrifically in terms of both attracting people and retaining people. Our slots on colleges are the best they've ever been. Our yield ratios are great. Our -- as I think we may have mentioned on our last call, our most recent employee satisfaction survey, highest scores in our history. The headcount additions in Q1 are light. That was intentional. And part of the reason why is we onboarded our -- all of our college students last year on schedule, so we didn't defer any of it. So a lot of people joined us sort of Q3 of last year, so we have a lot of people coming out of the training program and becoming available for billing, so -- during late Q1, Q2. And that's why we didn't have to, obviously, do a whole lot of lateral hiring. And you never do a lot of college hiring in Q1. So the light attrition -- additions in Q1 make sense. In Q2, we're now starting to onboard the current year class. So you'll certainly see a pickup in the number of additions of college students in Q2 compared to Q1.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then just a quick comment, a quick follow-up. Did you have any project cancellations during the quarter? Anything that's kind of notable?","Gordon J. Coburn","Nothing, no trends. We always have normal course-of-business cancellations. We had 1 larger project that's ramping down due to some M&A work in one of our industries. That would be the only one that's material, and that actually had nothing to do with the economy. That was due to M&A.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a little bit more color on the North America financial services, specifically, the large banks. Was it more specific to capital markets?  Or was the weakness broader-based across both the consumer and commercial banks as well as capital markets?","Gordon J. Coburn","No, it was broad-based at the large banks, more pronounced in capital markets, yes, but not -- certainly not isolated to capital markets. Some of the broad banks just have set overall cost-containment goals at the corporate level.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay.  Then just a quick follow-up, sort of the timing on when you saw the weakness. We obviously heard from a lot of your peers throughout the quarter. And it seems like a clear trend that there was some apparent weakness, even at the beginning of March, let's say? Did you kind of see this sort of slower ramp of demand throughout the quarter?  Or did it become very apparent as you kind of went into the beginning of the second quarter?","Gordon J. Coburn","No, remember, it's compared to expectations. So January is always soft. That's exactly what we would expect. February picked up a bit. The key is what's happening in the back half of March and April, because that's normally when you see the significant acceleration. And we did not see as much acceleration in -- coming out of March and into April.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay.  And then just quickly, the expectations for pricing for '12?","Karen McLoughlin","We would continue to expect pricing to be stable as maybe a slight upward bias but essentially stable overall. Because if you remember, most of our rate increases kicked in, in the early part of last year in 2011.","Gordon J. Coburn","The pricing was flat in the first quarter sequentially, so it played out just as we anticipated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Price with BB&T Capital Markets.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Many of my questions have been answered. But I did want to ask you about whether the continued volatility and uncertainty in BFSI -- it doesn't seem like that's really going to end anytime soon. If that drives any increased urgency in your part to expand and diversify your vertical footprint maybe more quickly away from that industry.","Francisco D'Souza","It's Frank.  Clearly, we're seeing volatility in some of our industry segments, financial services, as we said, also parts of the healthcare segment, we saw volatility. Clearly, our long-term growth is -- growth objective is to continue to diversify the business into new geographies, into new industries.  It's part of our Horizon 3 effort to look at new markets, like, as I mentioned, the government and -- new industries like the government and new markets like Latin America. That's an ongoing process. I wouldn't expect to see that shift happen rapidly, given the concentration that we have in Financial Services. So while it's a long-term strategic objective, I wouldn't expect to see significant changes there over the short run.","George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, and then just one more. We've been hearing about a trend of an increased desire by clients to increase the mix of higher-end on-site resources. Part of this, I think, is probably a follow-on from what's going on with visas. But I think there's more to it than that. How are you addressing that? And, I guess, what are the -- more importantly, probably, what are the implications for your global delivery mix going forward?","Francisco D'Souza","No, I think that to the extent that we're seeing that trend, it's -- I would say that it's confined to some of the newer, what I would think of as higher-value services, what we have been characterizing as our Horizon 3 services and some portion of what we would characterize as Horizon 2 services. So for example, our management consulting business and some of our new practices in areas like mobility and social will require a much stronger on-site presence.  But this has been, I think, a key strength of Cognizant over many, many years. We think that we've invested over many years in building extraordinarily strong front-end teams. And in fact, I don't see that, that trend presents any sort of challenge for us. I'm very comfortable with our front-end teams. And in fact, I think it's a point of differentiation for the company. So I don't expect it to change our mix. I think that it's an area of strength of Cognizant's. It's one of the reasons that I'm very optimistic about our growth prospects going forward.","And with that, let me wrap up this call by thanking all of you for joining and saying that I'd like to reaffirm that we're very confident in our ability to deliver our revised 2012 revenue growth guidance and maintain our position as the growth leader in our industry. Our businesses remains incredibly healthy, and we continue to invest in our long-term future. So thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we'll see you on the next call.","Operator","This concludes Cognizant Technology Solutions' First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2013 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com.","The speakers on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Francisco, please go ahead.","Francisco D'Souza","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Cognizant's third quarter performance was strong with revenues of $2.31 billion, a sequential increase of 6.7%, an increase of 21.9% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was slightly above our target range at 20.4% for the quarter.","On the back of our strong second quarter performance, we are extremely pleased with this solid third quarter. As a result, for the second time this year, we are raising our full year revenue guidance. We now expect 2013 revenues of at least $8.84 billion, which would represent industry-leading growth year-on-year of at least 20.3%.","Growth was broad-based across our portfolio of industries, services and geographies, showing, once again, that we are staying relevant to changing client needs. The results also validate our strategy. Our singular focus in the market around helping clients running better and running different is working and our discipline of internal focus embodied in our 3-Horizon model is also working.","With solid execution against our strategy, this quarter, we were able to grow market share in new discretionary programs and drive faster-than-expected ramp-up in a number of outsourcing deals won in prior quarters, resulting in quarterly performance, which was stronger than we anticipated.","Gordon will provide an update on our 3-Horizon model in a few minutes, including our progress in new markets, new technologies and new delivery models.","I'd like to now spend some time on the running better, running different client strategy. Clients are looking for service partners who can address their dual mandate of driving greater performance from the current business while improving the positioning of their businesses for the future. We are hearing this on the ground in our engagements and we have also heard it during the various Cognizant community client events that we have hosted around the world this year. We remain well-positioned to address this dual mandate.","On one side of the dual mandate, we are working to aggressively reduce clients' total cost of ownership and generate higher levels of productivity by leading many of our clients to best-in-class delivery models with corresponding managed services and output-based commercial models. Our ability to drive results in our traditional areas of business has attracted good recognition amongst research analysts, sourcing advisers and consultants.","For example, recently, Gartner positioned us in the Leaders quadrant of their 2013 Magic Quadrant for CRM Service Providers worldwide. The Everest Group recently recognized Cognizant as a global leader and star performer in their peak matrix for health care, payer, IT outsourcing for 2013. And IDC recognized Cognizant as a leader in life sciences sales and marketing IT services in the IDC MarketScape. These forms of recognition demonstrate our ability to help clients on important business and IT issues.","On the other side of the dual mandate, we continue to engage with an increasing number of CIOs and other C level executives, who are struggling with the pace of change in their industry or who want to rethink their business models. Transformation is high on their agenda. At the core of many of these client conversations is SMAC. SMAC, as you know, stands for social, mobile, analytics and cloud. While SMAC provides a challenge to some clients' business models, it also creates tremendous opportunities for them to generate business value. For example, there is growing interest in using SMAC technologies to develop better one-to-one relationships with customers or leverage smart connected products. These opportunities to generate business value go beyond the IT of SMAC into other Horizon 3 areas such as new delivery models like Cognizant BusinessCloud solutions, which Gordon will elaborate on later.","These are innovative solutions to clients' transformation needs, and we are pleased with our ability to help clients on these topics and meaningfully impact both their bottom and top lines. I'd like to hand it over to Gordon to discuss our performance, and then to Karen to provide more financial details.","I'll return later on for the Q&A. Over to you, Gordon.","Gordon J. Coburn","Thank you, Francisco. Our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 businesses continued to perform quite well. The third quarter saw a solid growth in both outsourcing services, including application maintenance, business process services and IT infrastructure as well as consulting technology services, including our traditional application development work.","Our Horizon 2 services, including consulting, IT infrastructure and BPO, once again, performed well during the quarter. Cognizant business consulting, or CBC, continues to be a critical differentiator for us as we compete, win and execute transformational engagements across various industry segments.","With a view to expanding our consulting portfolio, at the beginning of October, we completed the acquisition of Equinox Consulting, a specialist financial services consulting firm based in France. Besides providing management consulting across investment banking, asset management, retail banking and insurance, Equinox brings to Cognizant deep regulatory consulting expertise, including Basel 3, Solvency II and Dodd-Frank. With a talented team of consultants from Equinox now part of Cognizant, we're well positioned to provide consulting expertise not just to marquee financial services firms in France, but also leverage those capabilities across Europe.","BPO saw a continued traction during the quarter, largely on the ramp-up of a number of wins in prior quarters across financial services, insurance and health care. These wins were primarily across vertically-aligned business processes such as enrollment, claims, clinical and safety operations, mortgage processing, provider credentialing and newer opportunities around regulatory changes in the context of health insurance exchanges and TRICARE, which is the health care program of the Department of Defense's Military Health System.","IT Infrastructure Services continue to grow nicely. Within this service, our clients increasingly recognize our global scale and competitiveness. This is evident from our recent wins in providing clients with end-to-end infrastructure management services, data migration and operation support. The rising interest in this service area is fueling our strong growth and continues to keep our pipeline robust.","Our Horizon 3 offerings continue to gain significant traction with our clients and service a good illustration of our strategy of reinvestment for the long term. As we have said previously, we expect $500 million of SMAC revenue this year and we continue to invest in building out our SMAC capabilities.","In addition, we continue to invest in other areas within Horizon 3, including newer markets and industries. We're currently leveraging our broad range of existing service offerings to enter and grow these newer markets.","One example is the public sector, which includes government and quasi-government agencies across the U.S., U.K. and other regions. Similar to the private sector, many governments are facing significant transformational changes -- challenges. They are under cost pressures, while at the same time, need to run different to address changes in policy, customer expectations and new technology architectures.","A core part of our government strategy is to take advantage of the overlap between government and existing practices such as health care and financial services. This year, we won over a dozen public sector engagements globally and see good opportunity for further growth.","Earlier this year, Frank touched upon Cognizant BusinessCloud solutions, another critical investment area within Horizon 3. This is our growing portfolio of platforms and solutions that enable clients to quickly deploy a range of on-demand business and IT solutions without large capital outlays and long implementation timelines.","Our business cloud portfolio includes offerings that leverage 2 models: Software as a Service, or SaaS, which hosts softwares and associated data on the cloud; and Business Process as a Service, or BPaaS, which integrates a SaaS platform with our people and process capabilities to deliver an end-to-end business or technology outcome.","We've already rolled out 15 platforms and solutions to over 150 clients. Although revenue is still quite modest, these solutions are gaining traction in the market. One advantage for clients is that these solutions run as utilities. This utility model provides a common platform accessible to clients on a pay-as-you-go basis.","While we shared examples of Cloud60 (sic) [Cloud360] and assetSERV on our prior calls, let me touch base on 2 more examples, Order Management as a Service, or OMaaS, and TruMobi. Designed to be a multichannel, subscription-based platform for order management in the telecommunications market, OMaaS can be configured to the specific needs of service providers and resellers, integrating web and in-store customer experience for shopping, ordering, fulfillment, social and care and provides realtime analytics and reporting capabilities for improved decision-making. We recently deployed our OMaaS platform for Go Wireless, a Verizon Wireless premium agent, to help launch their online commerce capability and enhance business performance through innovative service offerings to their customers.","TruMobi, another Cognizant BusinessCloud solution, is a unified end-to-end mobility suite for application provisioning, security, integration and life cycle management of mobile devices. As an example of a TruMobi deployment, recently, Cognizant was selected by Max Life Insurance, India's largest non-bank-owned private life insurer, to leverage next-generation mobile technologies for transforming the way its agents do business and engage with customers.","Moving on to our performance by industry. Our financial services segment grew by about 5% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Within this segment, we continue to see strong focus on cost optimization, initiatives around regulatory compliance and risk management and the adoption and integration of SMAC solutions to align with shifts in customer preferences. Healthcare, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical and medical device clients, had a very strong quarter, registering growth of 11% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. Growth within the segment was driven by our payer clients, including preparation for the launch of the new health insurance exchanges. Our work included strategy consulting, systems readiness assessments, connecting payers to the exchanges and quality assurance, as well as ramping up BPO operations to handle ongoing customer queries, enrollments and claims.","Manufacturing, Retail and Logistics grew 6% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. Demand within this segment was driven by multichannel e-commerce implementations and integration efforts, supply chain consulting and implementation initiatives and increased adoption of SMAC solutions.","Our other segment, which includes communications, information media and entertainment, as well as high-technology, grew 5% sequentially and 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in the high-tech segment due to increase in discretionary spending.","From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 6% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Europe saw a 7% growth sequentially and 37% year-over-year. While Cognizant has traditionally been strong in the U.K., Switzerland and the Netherlands, we're quite pleased with the results we are seeing from targeted investments in Germany and France. In these regions, we are seeing our win rates go up in strategic deals and the acquisition of 6 companies in the C1 Group and, most recently, Equinox Consulting provides us even greater leverage to compete in such deals. The C1 integration is playing out well and our combined capabilities have already resulted in multiple new logo wins.","Growth in the rest of the world continue to remain strong, growing 12% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Rest of world demand continues to be fueled by strategic investments and enterprise-level transformation programs. For example, global foundries and independent semiconductor foundry, with fabrication plants located in Singapore, Germany, Malta and the U.S., selected Cognizant as its partner for application services.","Another noteworthy engagement is with the Singapore-based NTUC FairPrice, the region's largest supermarket chain with over 270 stores, to provide improved customer experience through e-commerce channels for product ordering and delivery.","Finally, let me provide some color around our business operations for the quarter. We're quite pleased with our efforts in driving best-in-class execution across key delivery and operating parameters and are happy to have received external recognition for many of these initiatives. On the talent side, we continued to hire some of the best talent globally, both in the open market, as well as from campuses in 18 countries. We provide these hires with world-class training and career growth opportunities to help support rapid career advancement.","Let me highlight 2 achievements during the quarter. First, Cognizant was ranked #1 by the American Society for Training and Development for excelling in creating an innovative and vibrant learning culture. And second, Cognizant was identified as the #1 recruiter by the Economic Times for attracting the highest number of talent from top management schools in India, competing with the world's best management strategy consulting, consumer goods and investment banking firms.","As we've discussed in the past, we ramped up hiring towards the end of last year and early this year, allowing us to meet the increased demand that we have witnessed during the second and third quarters by consciously taking up our utilization. During the third quarter, we started on-boarding the graduates from the class of 2013. Given the current pace of on-boarding, we will have all of the 2013 graduates, who accepted our offers, on-boarded by the end of this year, well ahead of our original plans.","Finally, let me touch base on attrition. Annualized attrition, including BPO, was about 19% for the quarter. As we stated last quarter, attrition tends to pick up during the second and third quarters as a result of the timing of bonus payouts, performance management actions as well as associates leaving for higher education.","In response to higher-than-expected attrition during the second quarter, we have put in place a number of employee retention programs starting in August. Though these programs have a lag effect, they are now paying off quite nicely as we have witnessed a downturn -- a downward trend in our attrition numbers for the months of September and October. We anticipate that this positive impact will be reflected in our fourth quarter attrition numbers.","I'll now hand the call over to Karen to comment on our financial performance and guidance. Karen?","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning to everyone. As detailed in our press release, our third quarter revenue grew 6.7% sequentially and 21.9% over last year to $2.31 billion, ahead of our guidance of $2.25 billion from last quarter.","Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 20.4%, slightly ahead of our target range of 19% to 20%, while our GAAP operating margin was 19% for the quarter.","We generated $1.13 of non-GAAP EPS and $1.05 of GAAP EPS for the quarter. The over performance in non-GAAP operating margin was primarily the result of increased utilization during the quarter and the impact of the rupee depreciation and of our hedge losses partially offset by promotions and wage increases, which were effective July 1.","Turning to some of our other performance measures. Consulting and technology services, formerly known as application development, represented 50.8% of revenue. And outsourcing services, formerly known as application management, was 49.2% for the quarter.","Consulting and technology services grew 20.9% year-over-year and 7.3% sequentially. Outsourcing services grew 23% year-over-year and 6.1% sequentially. 34.9% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts during the third quarter and grew by 15% sequentially and 27% year-over-year.","As expected, on a sequential basis, our pricing was stable during the third quarter. We closed the quarter with 1,133 active customers and the number of accounts which we considered to be strategic increased by 7. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 236. We continue to see a trend towards our newer strategic customers, embracing a wider range of Cognizant services at an earlier stage of the relationship.","Our fully diluted share count for the quarter was 304.3 million shares, a decrease of approximately 171,000 shares from Q2. To date, 15.7 million shares, at a cost of $998.2 million, have been repurchased under the current share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion.","Turning to our balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the third quarter with approximately $3.36 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $460 million from the quarter-ending June 30. During the third quarter, operating activities generated approximately $478.9 million of cash, financing activities generated approximately $28.3 million of cash. This was comprised of net proceeds of $35.2 million related to option exercises and related tax benefits, offset by expenditures of $6.9 million towards stock repurchases made in connection with our stock-based compensation plans.","We've spent approximately $31.8 million for capital expenditures during the quarter. And during 2013, we expect our capital expenditures to total approximately $300 million.","Based on our $1.89 billion receivable balance on September 30, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 75 days, at the same level as the second quarter. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $254 million, up from $224 million at the end of Q2. Approximately 62% of the Q3 unbilled balance was billed in October.","Net headcount increased by approximately 2,100 people during the quarter. 59% of gross additions for the quarter were direct college hires, while 41% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 166,400 employees globally, in which approximately 155,900 were service delivery staff.","Utilization increased on a sequential basis during Q3. Offshore utilization was approximately 75%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are on our training program, was approximately 81%. On-site utilization was up to approximately 94% during the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our growth expectations for the full year 2013. For full year 2013, we expect to continue delivering industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we are pleased to revise our revenue guidance upwards to at least $8.84 billion. This represents full year growth of at least 20.3%. This guidance includes $10 million of expected revenue from the recently closed acquisition of Equinox.","During Q4, we expect to operate close to the high end of our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. But for the full year 2013, we expect to be slightly above our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%.","For the full year 2013, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be at least $4.37, excluding estimated stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses of $0.36. Our GAAP EPS will be at least $4.01. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 305 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27%. It also excludes any Q4 non-operating FX gains or losses.","We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, I'll ask, just the implied fourth quarter revenue growth at 2% seems a little below trend. How much of that is, let's say, conservatism versus maybe some pull-forward of work into third quarter, maybe something a little weaker you saw in October? Any color on that would be great.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, Tien-tsin, happy to do so. First of all, keep in mind, we're going to grow at least 20.3% this year, which is an acceleration from last year's growth, even though it's off of a higher base. No different than prior years, Q4 tends to be seasonally slower. We clearly do not anticipate a budget flush this year. And as our retail practice continues to grow, as you all know, retail tends to be quite slow in the fourth quarter due to the lockdown of systems around the holiday. So there's nothing unusual in Q4 for us. If you look historically, this guidance is sort of generally in line with what we tend to do, but certainly, we'd see no budget flush. But I wouldn't read that into anything other than it's a normal seasonal Q4.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great, makes sense. Just a quick follow-up, should we expect you to disclose your 2014 growth targets linked to the equity compensation in early December? Is this still the practice that you plan to put out?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. It's something that we've put a lot of thought into it. As you know, in recent years, we've reported our PSU grants at 8-K filing in early December. Prospectively, we do not plan to file an 8-K for ordinary grants to our officers. Obviously, we'll continue to comply fully with all 8-K disclosures. The reason we're doing this is, clearly, in the last couple of years, there's been the trend among most companies not to disclose this information and there's no requirement, obviously, to do so. Disclosing the revenue targets for the awards has taken on a bit of a life of its own in recent years in terms of people extrapolating the PSU targets to be a proxy for subsequent year revenue guidance. Given that we haven't completed our budgeting process at the time we do the PSU grants, we think it's more appropriate to provide our thoughts on 2014 in February when our budgeting process is complete. But let me be very clear on this so there's no confusion. The -- our expectations regarding next year's growth prospects have no bearing whatsoever on our decision to no longer disclose the PSU metrics. And we fully intend, as part of our normal practice, in February to give 2014 guidance.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Milunovich with UBS.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You mentioned that your fixed-price contracts increased to 35% of the total. Where has that been? Where do you think it's going? What are the margins on that? And are there particular kinds of business you do where fixed-price makes more sense?","Gordon J. Coburn","So the trend towards fixed-price is a long-term trend, it's one we believe very strongly in, as the overall business model moves away from traditional input-based structures to more of output-based and managed services and SOA base, so we like moving towards fixed-price contracts. We push our clients towards that. Obviously, you have a wider scattergram of results, by definition. But on average, we're certainly pleased with the profitability on it because it gives us the ability to share in the productivity gains that we can deliver and the efficiency gains. So it won't be a steady movement up, obviously, quarter-to-quarter. But over time, I would certainly expect it to move up and something we're pushing for. It's a win-win for us and our clients.","Operator","And the next question is coming from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two quick questions. First, I just wanted to check your earlier comment about not anticipating a budget flush. Is that because you're not seeing it and you're getting indications that it won't happen or you're just not forecasting it? And then second, I think I heard that the CapEx guidance is down about $100 million versus what you've been expecting last quarter. Can you talk about what's driving your expectations for CapEx for the year and if there's anything that's being pushed back?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. Let me comment on budget flush and then Karen can comment on CapEx. It's not that we're not forecasting, we're not seeing it. It's early November. If we're seeing it, it would be happening at this point. So part of it is clients spent their budgets as they went along during the year rather than being conservative and holding money back until the end of the year. So I don't view a lack of a budget flush as a negative, I actually view it as clients had the confidence to spend as they went through the year. Karen, do you want to comment on the CapEx?","Karen McLoughlin","Yes, Sara. So in regards to CapEx, obviously, what we've looked at is, as we've taken utilization up across company, what we've realized is that's allowed us to better optimize our facility usage offshore. And so what we've -- essentially all this is, is movement of the timing of the spend. So we're continuing on the same plan for our real estate expansion, we've just been -- shifted some of the timing of those payments into next year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Gordon, in your prepared remarks, you've talked about a couple of areas where you focused, I guess, less in the past. Infrastructure was one, public sector was another. Could you provide some more details as to what you're doing in these areas and, particularly, with regards to infrastructure. Will that offering, over time, potentially increase the capital intensity or is this more a software-based solution?","Francisco D'Souza","Ashwin, it's Frank. Why don't I take that question. We've been talking for quite some time now about the infrastructure business. It's one of our, what we call, our Horizon 2 businesses along with business process and our management consulting business. And for some time now, it has been growing at a healthy rate, faster than company average and we continue to see good growth from that business and, in fact, from our entire Horizon 2 portfolio going forward. The -- as we've said in the past, our approach with infrastructure services is primarily an asset-light approach. That's not to say that we don't have some infrastructure and some hardware and physical capabilities, data center and otherwise within the infrastructure business. But by and large, our approach is to focus on what we think of as next-generation infrastructure management, which is around asset-light and cloud-based offerings, which tend to be much less asset-intensive and, therefore, much less capital-intensive than the traditional infrastructure business. As it relates to the public sector business that Gordon talked about, that is one of our new Horizon 3 initiatives. It falls into the bucket of new markets that we've been pursuing. And we've been quite pleased with our progress there. As Gordon said, we won a number of new clients over the last 12 or 18 months in that space, and what we're really focusing on there as an entry point is to focus on areas of the public sector in the U.S. and other parts of the world that are adjacent to other parts of Cognizant's core business, particularly health care and financial services. As you know, governments around the world have different initiatives around health care and financial services and, because of our commercial experience in those areas, we find those are good opportunities for us to leverage that knowledge into serving the public sector. So we continue to expect to see growth in that. It's still emerging in a relatively small part of the overall business, as most of our Horizon 3 offerings are, but one that we think has tremendous growth potential going forward.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So the infrastructure is clearly an enhancement of the remote infrastructure offering that you used to have?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes. I think that's right, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So on 3Q Healthcare vertical, obviously, really strong. Was there any kind of one-time \"budget flush testing\" because of the Obamacare implementation that was coming up at that time, something that might affect next year's 3Q growth rate?","Gordon J. Coburn","I would not think about it as a budget flush, but there's a one-time surge. But a lot of that surge will be ongoing because the work we're doing isn't just put it in place and walk away, but it's the ongoing support. But definitely, there was a surge that kicked in, in Q3.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Capital Markets.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was wondering, could you -- do you think Healthcare will outgrow the consolidated business next year? And if you could give us any updates on any changes you've made kind of with the immigration bill being a little more dormant in your business model?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. Let me touch base on Healthcare. We're not finished with the planning cycle. Clearly, the payer side will be healthy next year. The question will be what does pharma look like as some of the companies are dealing with patent cliffs. So it's too early to know, is it going to grow faster than the company average or not? Yes. We'll, certainly, as we get into February, have a better view on that. Do you want to comment on immigration?","Francisco D'Souza","Joe, I don't think there's anything new for us to say on the immigration front. We continue to track the issue carefully, to participate actively in the conversations in Washington. There's been some new activity in the House of Representatives, and we're continuing to track and follow and participate in that. As we've said in the past, we think that -- obviously, we're supporters of immigration reform. We think that things that are -- that immigration reform will be good for the country. We hope that the bill will come out in a play. So if there is legislation that comes out into plays that's good for the country, good for our clients and, therefore, will be good for Cognizant. And we'll continue to update you as things go along, but I don't have much new information to give you this quarter.","Gordon J. Coburn","But if you look over the last 6 months or so, clearly, there's a far greater understanding in Washington related to some of the clauses that were of concern to us and far greater understanding about how it could hurt American competitiveness. So with the tone of discussions are -- have changed a bit and we certainly view that as a positive.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","There's been several articles in the mainstream press since the Infosys settlement the other day that said the U.S. Attorney's office is looking at other service providers. Are you able to comment whether you're on that list or not or what you've been asked for?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. I'm happy to -- obviously, it's not appropriate for us to comment on another company. But as we've said many times in the past, we have an extraordinarily robust process for our visa integrity. We have separate groups that do visa processing and visa compliance, with the visa compliance group reporting to the general counsel, so we have multiple layers of checks and balances to make sure we are both following the letter and the spirit of the law. And no, we have not been approached in any way related to this topic.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you also talk about the size of your wage increase, I believe, kicked in July 1, particularly in the context of that higher attrition and what the margin impact was in the quarter?","Gordon J. Coburn","The wage increases were roughly what we anticipated and had been indicating to the market for a while. Low single-digits on-site, upper single-digits offshore, so it landed right where we expected. I don't have the exact calculation of the gets and takes because, obviously, you have attrition and pyramid shifts and so forth. But no surprises on wages.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line the Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Could you update us on your thinking as it relates to acquired growth? You mentioned that you're happy with C1 and Equinox and how they look to be adding. If you think about CY '14, could you just update us on how investors should be thinking about the opportunities for acquired growth? And specifically, perhaps detailing -- do you see it as a couple of points of growth on whatever your organic basis might be?","Francisco D'Souza","We've said several times in the past that our -- and there hasn't really been a change in our overall approach and philosophy in that we look to do acquisitions to add specific capabilities, to expand in new geographies or to deepen our experience or expertise in a particular industry. Those are sort of the 3 screens we use. Ideally, a company, a target that we look at would have several of those attributes. The -- we've also said that our approach to acquisition is to look at tuck-in acquisitions. Obviously, as we get bigger, our definition of what constitutes a tuck-in acquisition gets bigger correspondingly. The C1 acquisition, for example, this year, was a little bit bigger than what we've done in the past. I think you'll start to see that -- or you'll see that trend continue -- for us to continue to do tuck-ins, but they'll be a little bit bigger. I also think that given all the changes in social, mobile, analytics and cloud, our focus on the Horizon 3 areas and so on, you'll see us focusing, as we go into 2014, in those areas. So I would say that there may be a modest uptick in the number of transactions that we would do as we go into next year to respond to some of the changes that are going on in the marketplace. But the philosophy of what we do and how we approach acquisitions will remain consistent as it has been in the past.","Gordon J. Coburn","And let me just add to that, we're really getting quite good at integration of these acquisitions and capturing the revenue synergies. Look at C1, within a matter of months, we were winning new logos that we would not have won without them for a broad range of services. So we're learning how to really capture the value from acquisitions in terms of both strength in the core business and strength in the business of the acquired company.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company.","Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Frank and Gordon, a recent industry data suggest that the market is seeing a higher volume of contracts with shorter timeframes, and these contracts are expiring more rapidly than in the past. And these contracts are being broken up and then taken away from the incumbents at times and awarded to best-of-breed providers. Are you seeing that trend in the market? And how does that affect your business, especially your win rate versus the competition?","Francisco D'Souza","Mayank, I don't think this is something that -- to the extent that it's happening, I don't think it's something that's new in the marketplace. I think the data that you're referring to is, refers to this trend that we've seen for some time now of the very, very large megadeals getting broken up into sort of what I think of as smaller best-of-breed types of deals, and that's a trend that we've seen going on for a long time. So we play very well in that trend because, as you know, we're very focused in certain areas of the market, whether those are industries of service lines, and we compete very well. So as these big deals get broken up and get rebid out as smaller piece-parts deals, that tends to benefit us. Again, I want to make sure that I'm clear here. I don't view that as a new trend, that's something that's been going on for several years now. We are seeing a number, perhaps more of those deals coming up for rebid because, typically, those large deals were 5- to 10-year life deals. And so, I think you'll see more of those come up for rebid in the coming years. And I think that will continue to benefit firms like Cognizant.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Arvind Ramnani with BNP Paribas.","Arvind A. Ramnani - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Clearly, you're seeing a robust demand for your SMAC services, but can you provide some more color on your cloud computing business? And after you help your clients move from on-premise solutions to a cloud solution, how does it impact your maintenance related to revenues?","Francisco D'Souza","I think -- it's a good question. I think the easiest way to think about this is that while in general there are some parts of our business where a movement to cloud reduce -- creates lower total cost of ownership for the client and, therefore, a potentially smaller revenue opportunity for Cognizant over the life of that client system. What's also happening is that as businesses become more IT-intensive, the number of units is going up. So you sort of think of it as, in some parts of our business, we see contracts perhaps getting smaller, but numbers of contracts getting larger. And so in the net, we think that the market is actually growing and we think that, as we look to IT spend for next year based on the early indications that we've had talking to clients, we think that IT budgets will have a slight upward bias going into next year. So we don't see a material reduction in the size of the opportunity available to us as a result of the cloud. We just think that the complexion changes a little bit from what it's been in the past.","Arvind A. Ramnani - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Great. Yes, that make sense. One other question is, some of your competitors have increased their spend on acquisitions, partly focused on the SMAC business. Conceptually, are you looking to kind of increase your spend on acquisitions as it relates to the SMAC business?","Francisco D'Souza","As I said earlier, our acquisition approach remains the same as it's been historically. As we look at new capabilities, which has always been one of our acquisition screens, certainly SMAC is one of the important areas there that we continue to look at. Look, I think we've got -- we've had a very early -- we've a head start. We started early in the SMAC area. In fact, I think we were one of the first firms to talk about SMAC as a concept. So I don't really think we're going to need to acquire our way into what I think of as the bread-and-butter SMAC business. I think we've got very strong positions in those businesses at this point. And I think we're competitively well positioned there. But of course, we're continuing to push forward. We look at, as Gordon talked about, the business cloud platforms. We're looking at advanced analytics capabilities. We're looking at third and fourth generation mobile technologies. And as we look at those, we clearly look at acquisitions where they make sense to bolster our capabilities there. But I feel very strongly that the core of our SMAC offerings are solid.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I just wanted to ask about headcount growth again. Sequentially, it's the second quarter in a row we only had about 1% sequential headcount growth. So I guess, should we expect a pickup there to revamp up on the headcount growth or is there more room on utilization that -- expect utilization to continue to increase enough to fulfill the demand?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. We're pretty much where we want to be on utilization now. It took us a couple of quarters to get to where we want to be. We had a big jump in Q3. So I would expect it would level off now. You'll have timing differences because when college gets joined because, obviously, you can't bill right away. So -- but on a more steady-state basis, we're roughly where we want to be on utilization.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So therefore, we should see headcount growth probably pick up to fulfill the demand?","Gordon J. Coburn","Headcount growth should align more with revenue -- quarterly revenue growth, yes.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, super. And then just quickly for Frank, just kind of a big picture question. The pickup in discretionary spend, does it feel more temporary or does it have some legs to it as we head in through the calendar year? In particular, just curious on if the government shutdown had an impact, do you think, on clients' thought process and spending?","Francisco D'Souza","I think with the caveat that we have, the normal Q4 seasonality that we see every year, I think that demand, the discretionary demand, appears to be sustainable going forward. When you look at the markets in which we operate, the U.S., the Europe and now, increasingly, the Middle East and Asia, the economies in these parts of the world have stabilized. Clients are turning their attention back to this dual mandate that we've talked about, the idea of continuing to drive cost savings while investing in innovation and growth. And as I've said earlier, the early indications and the conversations that we've had with clients around 2014 budgets appear to indicate that budgets will have a modest upward bias going into next year. So overall, it feels to me like the demand environment is stable. I would say it's stronger than it was a couple of quarters ago. And I think that, as best as I can see, will continue be the case for the coming quarters.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Sanford C. Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. So I just wanted to ask about market growth and share gains and then a clarification question. What is Cognizant's current view on how fast its overall market is growing? And do you see anything going forward related to your business mix or law of large numbers that would slow the amount of share gains that you're -- that you've been reaping?","Francisco D'Souza","I think the overall market, Rod, is not -- is growing low single-digits. IT and operations budgets are growing sort of, depending on which part of the world you're looking in the 1% to 4% -- 3%, 4% range. So that -- if you look at the big market, that's how I would characterize it. Of course, the trend from which we've been benefiting over several years now has been a greater shift of that existing spend to the global delivery model. And that continues to be a strong trend in North America, in Europe and in the other parts of the world where we operate. So I think from a -- the standpoint of movement to a global delivery model, penetration rates remain relatively low still. And so we continue to expect a healthy growth in that respect. And so, we continue to expect that the -- there'll be good solid growth in the business. Now when I look at the second part of your question, obviously, we've said before, right, the -- when you look at the law of large numbers, clearly, percentage growth rates will come down over time, that's just an outcome of the law of large numbers. But when you look at absolute opportunity for us to gain share, I think, the company is still extremely well positioned. I think we -- the strategy of reinvestment that we've had of keeping our operating margins within a stable range and reinvesting back into the business for growth continues to pay off. And for the foreseeable future, I expect that to continue to be the case.","Gordon J. Coburn","And let me just add 1 or 2 things, Rod. On gaining share, as we've now achieved critical mass in Horizon 2 businesses, at BPO infrastructure and consulting, we can actually compete in larger deals. So that actually helps us accelerate our gain share there. And on Horizon 3 and a lot of the platform businesses, as we're now starting to bring those to the market, that's really starting to tap an entirely new market for us. So we think -- we certainly think there's opportunities for us to continue to outperform the market, and that's how we set our measures of success, is are we growing materially faster than the market?","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then I don't think you specified, but in terms of the offshore market growth rate, I mean what -- where do you peg the offshore market's growth rate right now?","Gordon J. Coburn","Yes. I think NASSCOM has it at 12%, give or take.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. But is that -- that's not necessarily the relevant market for you. I'm just trying to get a sense for what you think your addressable market is growing.","Gordon J. Coburn","I'm not -- I think that's probably -- we think we're growing and materially faster than our addressable market. We're growing 20% this year. NASSCOM's number is 12%, that doesn't seem unreasonable.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right. And then just a clarification on the 8-K, I mean some investors will view that as pulling back some on disclosure. I guess the question is, I know you addressed this a bit earlier, but what was the factor that changed your mind to not release the 8-K? I mean, there was a lot of consternation about the 8-K, particularly last year, and there were arguments last year that you shouldn't release the 8-K and then you decided to. So I'm just inquiring what was the factor that changed your mind to not release the 8-K this year?","Gordon J. Coburn","So I think it's several things. One, we've really become an outlier in doing so. There's obviously no requirement to and we are one of a small number of companies that do so. Some of it is investor feedback. And then I think a very important part of it is we're not done with the budget cycle yet. So -- and it starts to take on a little bit too much of a life of its own in terms of it was a marquee event, and I'm not sure that was healthy. But as I said, let me reiterate it, don't view us as not providing that information anymore in any way, shape or form, a comment on our growth prospects for the future. We just think it's more appropriate to give guidance in February, which is in line with virtually everyone else in the industry who gives guidance.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Do the investments that you've made in Europe allow you to block market share in a country like France or Germany up to the levels that you've seen in the U.K., Switzerland and Netherlands over the next year or 2 or is that market share ramp much longer and requiring more acquisitions?","Gordon J. Coburn","Clearly, it doesn't happen overnight. What Equinox has gotten us in France and C1 has gotten us in Germany is we now have a solid local presence of nationals in each country. And that's very important in those 2 countries. Equinox -- obviously, we just closed C1. We are starting to win deals, but you don't go -- you don't become a market leader overnight. So it's a path that takes many, many quarters. Do we need to do additional acquisitions in those countries? That's not clear. Certainly, I think with what we have now, it gives us the platform to work off of -- will we always look for additional things? Absolutely. But we don't want to bet our business on. We have to find something.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Then just a quick follow-up, where do you expect attrition levels to settle out post the retention plans that you've rolled out in August?","Gordon J. Coburn","I would -- from everything I'm seeing at this point, I would expect Q4 attrition to be below Q3. Certainly, September and October were much better than July and August.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of James Friedman with SIG.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I had 1 question in 2 parts, if I could get them in. First, Gordon, when you look at the verticals with the lens of consulting versus outsourcing, do you notice any differentiation? For example, is Healthcare particularly consultative? And then the second one is that I think that in prior quarters or prior years, you had given a relative growth of Horizon 2 versus the corporate average. Any update in that metric?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. On consulting, what -- we're seeing value creation across all of our industries. We've invested very heavily in consulting. These are industry-specific consultants, so we're really quite proud of what we're seeing in virtually all of the industries. So I'm not sure I would hold up one as consult is more important than others. We've never given growth rates for Horizon 2. I think, last year, we mentioned it's now about 20% of revenue. Yes, from time to time, we may give an update. That business, in aggregate, over time we certainly expect to grow faster than company average. And I think operator, we have time for 1 final question.","Operator","Our final question is coming from the line of George Mihalos with Credit Suisse Group.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to circle back on Europe. You made some very positive comments about the discretionary spending environment. Does that apply to Europe as well? Are you starting to see more green shoots there, specifically in Continental Europe over the last couple of months?","Francisco D'Souza","I think -- it's Frank. Let me -- I think that the short answer to your question is yes, we are starting to see discretionary spending pick up in Europe, the U.K. and the Continent. Probably a little stronger in the U.K. than over in the continent but still good signs, promising signs in the Continent. I think, though, that given the environment in the Continent, both from the perspective of what's going on in the economy and also the penetration rates question with -- where companies in Continental Europe have -- are by -- on average have moved less work to the global delivery model. We continue to also see healthy demand in the sort of traditional outsourcing types of businesses on the Continent. The last thing I'll say about Europe is, and I think just to reiterate a point Gordon made earlier, that the C1 Group acquisition has really significantly improved our competitiveness in Germany both on outsourcing and on discretionary development kinds of work. And so I think that, that gives us a platform to capture some of this discretionary and -- so more run-the-business kinds of demand that we're seeing out there.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And just last question, can you actually quantify what the attrition rate is in, or has been, in September and October? And has the higher rate of attrition caused you to rethink wage increases going forward, or the rate of wage increases going forward, long term?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. We don't break out monthly attrition but clearly, there was a nice downward trend in September and October. Because remember, there's about a 1 month lag effect from when we put programs in because people in the pipeline to leave -- would have left. So we were certainly feeling that we're headed in the right direction. And remember, this is not the first time we've had a spike in attrition over the years. We understand how to deal with it. No, I think we did the right level of wage increases. It was in line with the industry. We had some work to do on communications. We had some work to do to make sure we're sharing the success of the company. And our belief is our employees should share in the success of the company both in revenue and in terms of optimizing the business. So I think we've gotten the message across clearly to our employees.","Francisco D'Souza","All right. Thanks, everybody, and thanks for joining us today and for your questions. I think it's fair to say that we're happy with this quarter's performance and our prospects for the remainder of the year, and we look forward to seeing you again next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions' third quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer for Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. Additionally, we have loaded an investor presentation onto our website. This presentation covers the key points discussed on this call.","The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q filed later today.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Cognizant delivered solid third quarter results. Q3 revenue was $3.77 billion, which is at the high end of our guided range and up 9.1% year-over-year. Three of our four business segments were strong contributors to our performance. Healthcare, product and resources and communications and media and technology averaged double digit growth rates. Our third quarter digital related revenue grew well above company average.","And to further enhance our digital capabilities, we recently announced two acquisitions. Netcentric, a leading independent Adobe partner in Europe and a leading provider of digital experience and marketing solutions for some of the world's most recognized brands. And Zone, a UK based leading independent full service digital agency that specializes in interactive digital strategy, technology and content creation. These acquisitions will broaden our portfolio of digital services and solutions.","To continue with our financial results, non-GAAP EPS quarter for the quarter was $0.98 and our non-GAAP operating margin was 20%. For 2017, we delivered three consecutive quarters of strong execution at the top and bottom lines. This consistent performance underscores the soundness of our strategy and investments and the continuing strong demand for our portfolio of services.","Turning to guidance, we are again raising the low end of our revenue guidance range and expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.78 billion and $14.84 billion. And we expect our full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 19.6%.","Now, we're in the business to help our clients adapt, compete and grow in the face of continual shifts and disruptions within their markets. Therefore, we've systematically built out significant capabilities to enable clients to transition from the physical to the digital world. Today making that shift has become mandatory for them. Most clients now know they must become digital enterprises themselves or more precisely, the right mix of physical and digital. So we work with them to transform their business, operating and technology models simultaneously. This three layer transformation is what we mean when we talk about digital at scale.","In prior calls, we've discussed how we enabled this transformation, applying our deep industry knowledge, innovation, advanced technologies and consulting expertise. More recently, we've also been emphasizing our client co-innovation centers and our platform based software and solutions. The result of developing and integrating all these capabilities and intellectual property is that we are turning Cognizant into a different kind of company that's envisioning and building the digital economy.","Increasingly, we see ourselves as a leading firm that develops repeatable solutions by infusing software and services to deliver business outcomes that make a real difference to clients. And this morning, I'd like to highlight how this new Cognizant is resonating with clients and winning in digital.","The best place to begin is with a few client examples of digital at scale, delivering a competitive upside for Cognizant. For a US car company that's preparing for a future of ride sharing and driverless cars, a team of consultants, developers and social scientists from Cognizant and ReD associates help to reimagine the relationship between driver and automaker. And then they jointly develop a marketplace that offers mobility services to help drivers move around more easily and access services remotely from vehicle diagnostics to smart parking reservations.","For a leading financial institution facing slowing growth in a major business, Cognizant developed an artificial intelligence enabled robotic investment advisor that would appeal to a new market of approximately 90 million millennials and that will enable the firm to achieve its goal of doubling retail assets under management by 2020. To envision and build this digital solution, we brought a cross-functional team from the client together with Cognizant digital business designers, strategists, technologists and financial services experts.","And we also helped a leading life sciences company bring to market new drugs with proven therapeutic benefits for smaller patient populations. We assembled a team of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and technology and design consultants to drive efficiencies in the clinical development process and apply digital marketing techniques. As a result, the client was able to achieve the goal of bringing new therapies to even relatively small patient populations. Absent this new approach, these drugs might not have been economical to develop and market.","The upside for Cognizant is that most of the world's companies are now dealing with these digital at scale challenges in one form or another. And therefore, we can keep combining our services and software in new ways to create repeatable solutions for a wide variety of clients.","Now, enterprise transformation is such a demanding work that we make sure that all our services and solutions are organized from the client's perspective, which is why last year we established Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant Digital systems and technology. These three practice areas, which run across our business segment, mirror our client needs and the parts of their enterprises they need to transform. And Raj will talk about how our digital practices are progressing in solving client's current and emerging challenges.","Within these practices, our value to clients hinges of course on the depth, breadth and currency of our knowledge. So we've been aggressively building high-end digital skills in areas such as data science, design thinking, cyber security, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and automation. But strong digital skills alone are not enough. So, we combine these skills with our industry expertise to speak the language and understand the core processes and technologies of every industry we specialize it. And we draw on this knowledge to build specialized software platforms and industry specific solutions to quickly create new value for clients.","You can see all of this come together for example in the way we've invested to extend our leadership as a fully integrated digital healthcare technology and operations provider. We've made major health care investments, beginning with the TriZetto healthcare administration platform, a leading software platform used by payers and providers. Earlier this year, we moved our TriZetto products to the Microsoft Azure Cloud and launched our healthcare cloud solution, a SaaS platform for healthcare payers of any size.","And having completed the TMG Health acquisition in August, we've now combined TriZetto with the business process services of TMG. TMG Health has further strengthened our scalable business process as a service or BPAAS solution for the government and public health program markets. These investments along with our market leading footprint in the commercial space establish Cognizant as the top solution provider of enhanced government processed platforms, digital solutions and services for commercial and government managed healthcare programs in the US.","Since TriZetto, we have invested in many other platforms in areas such as digital content operations, sales transformation, mortgage servicing and patient safety. All of these technologies and platforms provide the benefit of scale, enabling Cognizant to develop repeatable offerings that can be used by multiple clients across multiple markets. While digital at scale is a heavy lift, Cognizant has the resume to execute this transformation successfully.","It starts with a high level of client trust that encourages and enables the successful co-innovation of solutions with clients. Once we've established for the future, we know how to design, prototype and scale digital experiences to reshape clients, products and business models. But building digital experiences for the front end of a client's business is not enough. We have the deep knowledge to help clients reengineer, digitize, manage and operate their core business processes and build software platform for specific processes and industries. We couple this with a mastery of the technologies, software and tools to develop digital solutions as well as the ability to combine digital technologies with clients' heritage systems and applications. And we provide much of this capability to clients using our highly efficient and reliable global delivery model, which works at scale. And finally, we have the global consulting expertise to advice on strategy, operations and technology and orchestrate all of the knowledge, services, software and solutions that come together to enable enterprise transformation.","Cognizant bring this entire set of capabilities to the table. That's what continues to differentiate us in the marketplace. And by integrating all of these capabilities and intellectual property, that's how we're turning Cognizant into a different kind of company that's envisioning and building the digital economy.","And now over to Raj who will talk about the work our three practices are doing to drive digital at scale for clients and then review our business segment performance. Raj?","Raj Mehta","Thanks, Frank. At the core of our competitive advantage in digital is our ability to lead clients through the three layer enterprise transformation Frank just described. This work is the focus of our three practice areas. Cognizant digital business helps clients conduct business digitally by developing virtual channels with customers and creating smart products. Our experts design, prototype and scale digital experiences to reshape clients' products and business models, all aimed at generating new growth. Cognizant digital operations draws on deep process and technology knowledge to help clients reengineer, digitize, manage and operate their core business processes to lower costs and deliver growth.","And Cognizant digital systems and technology works with clients to simplify, modernize and secure their heritage, IT infrastructure and applications. In addition, our nearly 6000 consultants as well as CEOs, CFOs, Chief Operating Officers and line of business heads in addition to the CIOs, we've long worked with on issues that cut across strategy, operations and technology. Since digital at scale requires our clients to rebuild all three models, Cognizant will often apply the capabilities of all three practice areas on their behalf.","Here's an example of our multi practice efforts. We're partnering with a leading provider of educational content that needed to pivot its business to deliver more affordable next generation learning that is both interactive and immersive. In the first stage of our work, Cognizant digital systems and technology helped the client set up a shared service center. The center consolidated the global systems and technologies, delivering economies of scale and saving tens of millions of dollars and have become the backbone of the clients' more agile and efficient IT operations.","In the second stage, our digital business teams worked with the clients to develop a new operating model for content that leads with digital delivery. To achieve this, the operating model including building learner center design labs that will enable experienced based learning.","And then the next stage, the prototypes from these labs will be developed into interactive content within their client content operations center, which Cognizant digital operations will run. By the way, this was a consulting led engagement, our consultants define the roadmap for the future of content operations and then put together the full range of services and solutions from our three practice areas. By understanding this transformation journey, our clients will achieve efficiencies that can be reinvested in designing, building and distributing tomorrow's educational content.","Now, let's turn to the financial performance of our business segments and geographies. Banking and financial services grew 3.8% year-over-year. We had a solid contribution from our insurance business and double digit growth in our mid-tier banking accounts. This helped to offset the continuing weakness of large money central banks, which remain focused on optimizing their spending on legacy systems and operations as we shift investments to new areas of spend, such as digital.","Among our recent wins in this segment is Voya Financial which engaged us for an end-to-end transformation that included infrastructure, security and data center transition. Voya, a long standing client of ours chose Cognizant for this expanding engagement because of our history of reliable delivery and our advanced as a service model, which will enable them to substantially improve service levels, while lowering their costs.","In healthcare, our third quarter revenues were up 9.3% year-over-year. We saw consistent demand across peer clients and increasing interest in our digital, analytics, cloud and virtualization solutions. As Frank mentioned, our third quarter acquisition of TMG Health extended our position as a leading software and services healthcare partner. In fact, Cognizant now provides products and services to more than 230 organizations that support a substantial percentage of the Medicare Advantage and manage Medicaid markets.","And to further enhance our healthcare consulting expertise, we acquired Top Tier Consulting, a California based healthcare management consulting firm with strength and strategy, operations, IT and business intelligence. We're well positioned to capitalize on the continuing digitization of the healthcare industry as it strives to reduce costs, improve quality of care and deploy new business models.","Let's turn to products and resources and communications, media and technology. Products and resources grew 14% year-over-year. We continue to see strong growth with our manufacturing and logistics clients and our energy and utility clients, which offsets sluggish growth in retail. The strength in manufacturing reflects both our emphasis on leading with digital offerings and the fact that CSOs increasingly engage us to create smart products and transform their business models.","Communications, media and technology had another strong quarter of broad based growth, up 18.2% year-over-year. Third quarter saw a solid growth across this segment, but in expansion in areas like creating and curating content. Our clients are turning to Cognizant to help them transform the delivery of their customer facing channels by improving the experience with personalized and bridge content.","Now, a quick look at our performance by geography. Europe grew 16.9% and the rest of the world was up 19.9% year-over-year. Within Continental Europe, we signed a 10-year agreement to become the strategic provider of IT and business process services for a major Belgian French financial institution. The goal is to transform the technology infrastructure and lay a foundation for more agile, efficient and secure operations. This agreement and the [indiscernible] that Frank discussed.","For example, the managed service platform we're developing will provide a utility for processing structured loans for other European clients. Cognizant Progress is receiving broad validation from industry hours. Everest Group named us one of only two star performers at the top of its leaders, for redefining the customer experience with digital. An IFC Research ranks Cognizant as a leader in this cloud provided research, citing our leadership in public cloud infrastructure consulting, implementation services, managed services and brokerage. I'm also pleased to mention that Fortune magazine has named Cognizant to its new Fortune Future 50 list, the rankings of US companies that are best positioned for future growth.","Clients turn to us to lead them through their enterprise transformation journeys, because they simply do not have the range of skills to do this work themselves. What's more, the technology is constantly evolving and digitally skilled people remain scarce. Cognizant has long invested heavily in the retaining and reskilling of our associates, but building skills when technology changes today requires an expanded approach. That's why we are pursuing several paths to attract, build and retain the workforce of the future.","These include developing and acquiring skills in advanced technologies, exploring new sources of talent and investing in public private partnerships to provide intensive technology training programs. In addition, we're building and expanding our local delivery centers across the globe. That way, we can quickly deploy talent closer to our clients while establishing training hubs with our educational partners to rescale the local workforce. Cognizant is absolutely committed to recruiting and training associates everywhere we operate.","To sum up, to stay competitive, our clients are determined to do digital at scale and they view Cognizant as a go to partner to help them become digital enterprises.","Karen, over to you.","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Raj and good morning, everyone. Q3 performance was solid and we continue to make significant progress on each element of our overall plan. Third quarter revenue of 3.77 billion was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 9.1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses and realignment charges, was 20% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.98.","In the third quarter, we completed the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program and today, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on November 20. This dividend will be payable on November 30.","Now, let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and technology services represented 58.6% of revenue and outsourcing services 41.4% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 11.3% year-over-year, driven by an increased demand for digital solutions. Outsourcing services revenue grew 6.1% from Q3 a year ago.","During the third quarter, 38% of our revenues came from fixed price contracts. We continue to make progress towards shifting the mix of our business over the longer term towards more fixed price or managed services arrangement. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as the potential to generate at least 5 million to 15 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 350.","And now moving to an update on margins. In Q3, we continued to take actions that will improve our cost structure and operating margins, while allowing us to continue to invest in the business for growth. These actions resulted in approximately $19 million of charges related to the realignment program, primarily from severance costs incurred in the quarter. Going forward, we expect to incur additional costs related to advisory fees, severance, lease termination and facility consolidation costs.","Additionally, as we accelerate our pursuit of broad based high value digital transformation work, we will continue to reassess less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace. We remain committed to reaching our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019 by balancing growth and profitability and to date have made significant progress towards this target.","Utilization in Q3 moved higher, as we continued to effect structural changes in our headcount management. We expect that these changes will help improve our resource alignment, help drive greater operational efficiency and thus improve our profitability. While our overall headcount was essentially flat, growth hires were almost 14,000 in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 22.5% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, increased from 16.6% in the year ago period, but declined over 100 basis points from the previous quarter.","While our attrition level was higher than normal, partially due to the continuing impact from performance management and severance programs initiated in the first half of the year, we did see an increase in voluntary attrition during the quarter. While we will of course carefully manage headcount, we will continue to hire and invest in critical skills needed to grow our digital business as well as work to bring voluntary attrition back to more normal levels. Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 79%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates joining our training program, was 82% and on-site utilization was 93%.","Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.7 billion of cash and short term investments. We had strong operating cash flow in the quarter, generating 773 million, reflecting improved profitability of the business. Receivables were 2.9 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables of 74 days, down slightly from the year ago period. Our unbilled receivables balance was 403 million, broadly flat from the end of Q2. We built approximately 61% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October.","Our outstanding debt balance was 823 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on our revolver. As part of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders, we completed the $1.5 billion ASR in quarter three and received and retired 2.2 million shares in addition to the 21.5 million shares received and retired at the commencement of the ASR in March. Our diluted share count was 592 million shares for the current quarter.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2017. Following our continued strong performance, we are again raising the low end of our full year 2017 guidance range to be in the range of 14.78 billion and 14.84 billion or year-over-year growth of 9.5% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rate at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.","For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of 3.79 billion to 3.85 billion. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.95. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 592 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. For the full year 2017, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be at least 19.6% and to deliver a non-GAAP EPS of at least $3.70. This guidance anticipates the full year share count of approximately 595 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 23%. This guidance includes the full impact of the $1.5 billion ASR.","We remain committed to our plan to repurchase an additional 1.2 billion by the end of 2018 and we'll provide additional details on that program at a later date. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, acquisition related expenses and amortization and realignment charges. For the full year, it also excludes the recognition in Q1 of the income tax benefit that was previously unrecognized. Our guidance does not account for an extensional impact from events like changes to immigration or tax policies.","In summary, we have continued our momentum throughout 2017 and we expect to close out the year with solid revenue and earnings growth along with a substantial capital return to shareholders.","Operator, we can open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Just I want to ask actually about your margin performance, especially in SG&A, which stood out, it was especially low versus our model. So a couple of questions there. Just the confidence to have the lower SG&A so far hasn't hurt your sales pipeline, your ability to replenish the pipeline, the backlog and then also just gross margin implications in the fourth quarter and next year, given all the moving pieces with utilization and wages and whatnot. I know, you managed the overall margin, but just kind of any help between the two lines would be appreciated.","Karen McLoughlin","This is Karen. I think we've been very thoughtful around cost management this year. We knew going into 2017 based on the work that we did late last year that there were opportunities to more effectively manage our SG&A spend, particularly around the corporate functions and we've talked about things like facilities and other costs within SG&A. So, well, SG&A overall was down in terms of dollars, Q3 versus Q3 of last year. We're very comfortable that we have protected the investments that we need to make to continue to grow the business.","And, I think you'll see SG&A move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter as we continue on that path. In terms of gross margin, it is obviously trending a little bit lower than where it had been. Part of what happened in Q3 or a significant part of what happened is that we did take up our variable compensation accrual rates during the quarter. Obviously, the business has performed very well this year. It's been a tough year for a lot of our folks as we've gone through a lot of this transition and so we wanted to ensure that, as we move into next year that we can pay out good variable compensation for the year. So that did put some pressure on the Q3 gross margin as of the year-to-date catch up.","What you'll see as we move into Q4 is that raises and promotions will kick in, in Q4 effective in October. Typically that's been in the July timeframe, we did defer that this year with all the transition happening in the company. And then as you said, as we move into 2018 and beyond we'll continue to manage to the operating margin targets that we've set for the organization.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Essex","Karen, I was wondering if you can comment a little bit on contribution of TMG in the quarter, how that might impact your full-year guidance. And the opportunity there is that going to be maybe similar to TriZetto where you have longer sales cycles or how do you think about that and how that kind of builds into the healthcare portion of your platform.","Karen McLoughlin","So thanks Brian, so the TMG deal did close towards the end of the third quarter. So there's a small amount of revenue in Q3 for that transaction. As you may know the vast majority of that work is with one client and then there were a number of other third-party clients as part of that contract. It will start to move towards a steady-state essentially in Q4. We have not broken out the size of the transaction. But it is essentially straight line revenue for the next two years and then it will move to more of a transaction based pricing model in the future. There's a combination of contract structures in that deal, but roughly speaking it will be straight line for the next few quarters of revenue.","Brian Essex","I know you had some in the healthcare segment exposure to some consolidation, the rumors around a transaction with Aetna and consolidation in the CRO market, are you seeing any of that, it doesn't really seem like you are, but just wondering if you - that's coming up in conversation at all.","Karen McLoughlin","Go ahead. I'll let Raj comment on that.","Raj Mehta","Look Brain, I think over our healthcare - healthcare just remains strong for us. Nothing or any conversations or impacts right now of any potential acquisitions, I think overall as you know we've invested a lot in our healthcare business. We see strong growth in both the mid-size payers along with large payer company out there. In addition to that we continue to see a lot of opportunities on our BPaaS solutions.","Karen McLoughlin","I think a move that remains to be seen what happens if some of those deals go through, the Aetna CVS deal for example. I think it's early to tell at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Bachman","Hi, I want to follow on Tien-Tsin's question a little bit on the margins. It looks your guiding operating margins on a non-GAAP basis in Q4 to be called the mid-19 level. And calendar year it sounds Q4 would also still benefit from some workforce realignment. My question is, can I think you said that in next year, calendar '18 you wouldn't anticipate further headcount reductions. But I'm unclear on without the headcount reductions, how do you continue to advance those operating margins, particularly given some of the gross margin pressure that still seems to be exhibiting. If you could talk a little bit about the forces from here, how do you continue to try to march those operating margins up, when most your competitors' margins are eroding.","Karen McLoughlin","Keith, let me break that into a few pieces. In terms of the Q4 margin, we are guiding to a slightly lower Q4 margin than Q3 that is because of the raises and promotions that will kick in in October that's typically about 100 basis points of margin decline. We have obviously not paid all of that into our guidance because we will continue to see some of the benefits occurring from the cost optimization that we've taken so far. So that's what's pushing down the Q4 margins. As we move into 2018 and beyond. We haven't really said that you know we haven't made a statement one way or the other frankly about headcount and what will happen to headcount next year. Margin improvement as we move into 2018 and then into 2019, 2018 will be a continuation of the cost savings that we generated this year and a number of those cost savings didn't start until the mid-summer timeframe.","So we'll get the full-year benefit of that. There are additional cost saving opportunities that we continue to look at, whether it be around facilities or travel or other types of expenses as well as headcount and what that means going forward. And then as we move further into '18 and into 2019, we have said that a lot of the margin improvement would come from the shift in the business towards the higher, you know, continuing to move towards higher margin digital business as well as CPaaS, our platform business becomes a larger part of the organization and starts to mature and starts to reach strong margin profile in that business as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Ellis","I guess another question on this point about, you now, now that you've got utilization levels back to basically their all-time highs, 93 onsite and about 80 offshore. Can you give some detail around, so what you're doing from a pyramid structure and operation efficiency initiatives to centrally take utilization up further as we look forward. I know you've talked about how you're sort of taking Cognizant into a new stage of maturity when it comes to how you're managing the labor model. Can you just give a little bit of color around that? It feels like now you're sort of at the stage where you've gotten - you've kind of gotten back to where you used to be and from here you've got to take it up one leg further.","Karen McLoughlin","So Lisa, I think that's fair in a sense. I think with utilization what we've always said is that as the business continues to grow and mature that utilization rate should continue to trend upwards over time. At 93% onsite we can run the business very comfortably. I think you can get to 94, maybe 95, not sure we can get above 95 on a consistent basis. Certainly offshore as we continue to grow we think there's opportunity to continue to take up utilization. It won't be quarter to quarter, but certainly over the long term that trend line should move upwards. I think as you mentioned another one of the big levers we've been looking at is the pyramid.","Historically, we have had a more top heavy pyramid than our peer group and in part to the business that makes a lot of sense, and other parts of the business we think there's opportunity to optimize that. We are also starting to see things like automation kick in both on the delivery side of the organization as well as in our corporate function. So if I look at my finance organization for example, we're using automation to help streamline some of our processes in the organization which allows us to scale the business without having to add headcount. So I think you'll see a number of those opportunities over the next three years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Schneider","I was wondering if you can maybe just address the financials vertical a little bit. Raj, you provided some helpful color, the difference between the weakness you're seeing from money center banks and with some of the strength in insurance in the smaller banks. Can you maybe give us the sense of, in your client conversations, what they are saying in terms of balancing increased IT budgets potentially in 2018, whether that is part of the conversation or not versus optimization with some legacy systems and kind of directionally where you see their total consulting and outsourcing spend budgets going next year.","Raj Mehta","Jim thanks, this is Raj here. So look at overall financial services, its strong growth that we're seeing on the insurance space clients. Continued a lot of work in terms of digital and obviously looking at new areas in terms of continued optimizing work that we're doing at those clients. The banks it's a mixed story, I mean we're you know as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing double-digit growth on the regional banks. But some of the challenges that exist on these large money center banks that we have and there there's I guess a tale of two stories, right.","There's obviously there is continual focus on the cost optimization. And they're obviously leveraging that to free up some of the dollars in terms of investing on the digital side of the business. Now the good news is, obviously we're engaged in many of those digital opportunities with those banks. And actually our digital revenues is growing at those banks in line with the rest of the company as well too. But we haven't seen there an influx of new budgets, obviously we're seeing the whole focus of in terms of continued optimization, freeing up dollars and investing on the digital side.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan Keane","Just looking as, Francisco, just an overall feel for how you guys are doing in transitioning Cognizant's business model to this new model to plan to get to 22% adjusted operating margins in two years. Just curious, so we had a plan, app plan everything is going exactly how you thought, just wanted to get just a feel for that. And then Karen just on digital is there a percentage of total revenues digital now represents and maybe the growth rate. Thanks so much.","Francisco D'Souza","I'll talk a little bit about the overall plan. I think we're roughly right on track right where we expected to be. I think about the transition or the shift to digital in two pieces that sort of the services that we offer to clients. And I think we continue to make great progress there. I'll let Karen comment on the overall digital revenue, it grew again double digit - at a double digit pace much ahead company average this quarter. The two acquisitions that we announced a few days ago Netcentric and Zone add to that capability. And we feel good about the transition of the service mix to digital. I think it's also important that just to note that as we've said before that today our portfolio if you look at the entire portfolio of digital revenue it is running at a higher margin than the rest of the business.","So overall just a very healthy mix shift going on and I think that that will continue to unfold through 2018 and beyond. The other side of that - of this transition that we talked about when we laid out the plan for you a few quarters ago, at the beginning of this year is on the margin improvement side. And I think we've demonstrated there that we're well on track there. This year, if anything I think we're a little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be. That's good. And we'll continue to, you know, we feel very comfortable as Karen said in her prepared remarks with a target of 22% by 2019. And I think we'll just keep executing on that. And I'll turn it Karen to talk about percent of digit revenue.","Karen McLoughlin","So we did not break out the percentage of digital revenue this quarter. As you may remember last quarter we said it was about 26% of revenue, it continues to grow upwards of 25% year-over-year and continues to become a larger part of the business each quarter. One of the things we've also been looking at with Raj referred to in his comments about the FS is that we're seeing very nice traction nearly across all of the business units and all of the industry. So continue to see very good progress there and will continue to update as there's relevant information on that metric.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Moshe Katri","Going back to the commentary regarding the large money center banks and their spending patterns. Raj, is there any indication about the outlook for 2018, and is there an expectation internally in terms of when some of those deals that you're talking about could actually start converting. Thanks.","Raj Mehta","So look it's a little bit too early right now to start looking into 2018. Obviously I think the bigger opportunity comes as what we've always talked about is digital scale. And many of these large money center banks we have numerous engagements going on. But I think as those opportunities become larger that's when we have an opportunity to see back to the growth that we've gotten accustomed to at those banks.","Francisco D'Souza","Having said that, Moshe it's Frank, I think it's worth adding one additional piece of color for you which is that, Karen mentioned that last quarter digital revenue as a percent of total company revenue was about 26%. We are right around there in financial services as well. So this isn't a story of we're waiting for digital revenue and financial services to convert. We're already doing a substantial amount of work in digital, in financial services. So I don't think by any stretch that we are not a significant player in financial - in the digital aspects of financial services as these big money center banks start to think about and start to execute on their digital plans.","Moshe Katri","But would you say that some of those deals that you're talking to those large banks about could - if they do convert into digital could be pretty significant down the road?","Francisco D'Souza","Again, I want to separate. We are already doing a considerable amount of work. So, yet there are deals that if they convert could be significant going down the road, but we are already - the point I was making, Moshe, is that today digital is already and financial services is roughly in line with our company average. So think about the 26% number, we're right around there in financial services. So we're already doing a considerable amount of work in digital and financial services.","Karen McLoughlin","Moshe, this is Karen, let me just sort of wrap that. I think as both Frank and Raj talked like strong digital business and banking, I think it is too early to say whether or not that results in a net increase in growth in 2018. We're not making any commentary right now on 2018 or whether we continue to see the shift that we've been seeing with the banks today which is they take money from one pocket in terms of their legacy spend or their business as usual spend and redirect that spend to digital. How that balance plays out in 2018 I think it's too early to tell.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Anil Ramnani with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arvind Anil Ramnani","I just had a question on your healthcare business over the past few years your healthcare capabilities has been materially enhanced based on the internal capabilities, acquisitions, your client base. At the same time, the healthcare market has changed and expected to continue to change with value based care et cetera. How do you all think of the opportunity over this space over the next two three years and how do you feel you all are positioned?","Francisco D'Souza","Look I think Arvind, I'll turn it, I'll let Raj answer as well, but it's Frank. Look I think changes is, change plays to our strengths actually. As the healthcare market changes and evolves we have just sort of a very strong end to end portfolio of service offerings whether that's consulting to help our clients figure out what they need to do to respond to the changes, whether that's operating in terms of our BPaaS offerings and our ability to run core parts of the operation for our client or whether that's on the technology front as they think about modernizing and digitizing their technology backbone. I think we're very well positioned both at the business model, the operating model and the technology model level. So as these changes come to healthcare given that we have such a strong portfolio of assets both software assets, intellectual property in the form of our people and capabilities. I think you put that together and we're very - we feel like we're very well positioned for healthcare going forward.","Raj Mehta","I would just add to Frank's comments, I think we've obviously seen a lot of traction around our BPaaS solutions. And then strong growth in the payers rate as well. But I think as we move look out, as the healthcare industry continues to evolve, you're starting to see a lot of providers, large providers come up with the own plans. And I think that's a good opportunity for us as well with Evolution, obviously there are showing a lot of interest in our BPaaS solution as well. So I think we're well positioned and continue to look forward for next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Darrin Peller","First question is about EmblemHealth and the impact on the quarter. How much was that still not thrown over from third quarter last year. And I guess that should be to lay out in the fourth quarter. I think we estimated around 100 bps or so to the overall growth rate, but just whether TMG is outstanding there. And then just a follow up on capital allocation, you finished 1.5 billion accelerated buyback. I know you have a couple of billion in your authorization left. I don't remember ever hearing, but can you tell us what you've - what you guys would want to do for capital allocation towards acquisitions, just given the digital push. And on that topic what was inorganic, what contributed to inorganic growth this year from acquisitions. Thanks guys.","Karen McLoughlin","So Darrin, this is Karen, let me start and Raj and Frank can join in if necessary. We start with the capital allocation question around the buyback, as you mentioned that we completed the ASR in Q3. We have also committed that between now and the end of 2018, we'll allocate another $1.2 billion back to a buyback program we haven't defined that we'll provide more color on that in an appropriate time. We have not broken out the dollars that we're committing towards M&A. But certainly in our capital allocation strategy we have we've held a nice fair amount for M&A deals. We've talked now for some time about ramping up the volume of those deals.","And obviously we've been doing that closed or find rather not closed two deals last week. And certainly our pipeline of M&A deals is quite active and so we would expect to continue to ramp up that volume of deals. And we will keep a nice balance between returning cash to shareholders services both organic and inorganic growth for the organization. In terms of TMG and Emblem, so Emblem as you said did start to lap in the middle of Q3. So small incremental year-over-year revenue growth for Emblem and then in Q4 that will fully lap.","And then TMG as we said we haven't broken out the size of the TMG relationship, but it did start in the last part of the third quarter and we'll obviously ramp to full scale in Q4. In terms of overall organic versus inorganic growth, the inorganic growth in 2017 is very small. We had a couple of [indiscernible] so forth, which were all very small deals that we've closed over the last 12 months, a very small percentage of growth this year has been from inorganic.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan Bergin","I wanted to ask on the marketing related acquisitions you had last week and then others in the past. Can you just talk about how you're integrating them into your tech services or if you're running them autonomously, how that will work? And then what are really the top two or three KPIs you're using to determine the right targets for you? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza","It's Frank, let me take that. When closed the two acquisitions will become part of the Cognizant digital business practice area. So recall that as I said in my prepared remarks, we have - and Raj talked about as well, three big practice areas, Cognizant Digital Business, Cognizant Digital Operations and Cognizant Digital Systems and Technology, these two acquisitions will become part of Cognizant Digital Business. We will continue to let them operate relatively independently, but of course we have a synergy plan which is largely focused on revenue synergies around taking their capabilities and taking those to a broad range of Cognizant clients.","We do a tremendous amount of marketing work today for our clients across all three practice areas. So in Cognizant Digital Business, we're doing marketing work that relates to content, content creation, marketing, marketing strategy, channels those kinds of things. In Cognizant Digital Operations we're doing marketing related work that's largely around content and content management, content creation, and curation that Raj spoke a little bit about in his prepared remarks. And in Cognizant Digital Systems and Technology, we're doing a lot of marketing work that you can think about in the broad area of marketing technology, right.","So across all of our three practice areas, we're doing a significant amount of marketing related work. These acquisitions in a sense will allow us to put a front end on a lot of that work that we're doing and take that to a client in a more integrated and holistic way. And so that's broad plan. So we'll run them relatively independently, let them continue to do the great work that they've been doing for their clients. We'll execute on the revenue synergy by bringing them - largely by bringing them into our clients. We think there maybe some opportunity to cross-sell our traditional services into their clients and we'll continue to execute on that going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Anil Doradla","So Francisco and Karen, you guys talked about the 22% target. So that's about 200, 250 bps from where we're going to exit this year. So if I look at the trajectory, is most of that increase going to be coming in '19 or is it '18 or is it linearly spaced out based on some of the efforts that you guys are doing.","Karen McLoughlin","So Anil, we obviously haven't given 2018 guidance yet, but you should expect to see some benefit next year and then the last part of it will be in 2019.","Anil Doradla","Francisco, you talked about repeatable business in your opening comments. Are you introducing some new metrics to kind of quantify that? Some are the obvious metrics. But are you creating some new incremental metrics to emphasize on some of that repeatable aspect of the business.","Francisco D'Souza","Yeah, I think what I was referring to when I talked about repeatable is the sort of the solution packages and solution offerings that we're creating which we've been talking to you about in the past things like our BPaaS offerings and so on and so forth. By combining sort of our services and software capabilities increasingly together, we're creating these - think of them as solution offerings capabilities that we take to the market. We've always as a company tracked repeat business from our existing clients. And I think that's where you'll really start - where you really see it continue to play out is repeat business from our existing clients because that's going to be the metric that we focus on is to say, are we continuing to be relevant to our existing clients.","And to be relevant to our existing clients, we've got to continue to innovate, we've got to continue to find new sources of value and that shows up in repeat business because every year or every period, our clients are assessing the work we're doing for them and they're choosing to give us new work based on the relevance of that work. So the metric that we use internally is repeat business from our existing customer base which is the metric we've been tracking from the beginning as far as I can remember.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. D'Souza for any closing comments.","Francisco D'Souza","Well, thanks very much. Look everyone thanks again for joining us today and thanks for your questions. We're pleased with the results this quarter and I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

[Operator Instructions]. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2012 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com.","The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, the Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Francisco?","Francisco D'Souza","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Cognizant released third quarter results, and I'm once again pleased with our performance. Revenue grew to just over $1.89 billion, a 5.4% sequential increase and an 18% increase over the same quarter last year. We maintained our non-GAAP operating margin at the top of our guided range at 20%.","Our results reflect broad-based growth across nearly all sectors, services and geographies, with outperformance primarily driven by a stronger-than-expected quarter in banking and Financial Services and Continental Europe. Gordon will provide additional color around this during his remarks.","Our ability to deliver another quarter of industry-leading growth is continued validation of the strength of our approach and the uniqueness of our value proposition. For several quarters, we have been speaking of the dual mandate with which we see our clients grappling. The dual mandate refers to the fact that clients need to drive efficiency and effectiveness on the one hand as they cope with cyclical economic pressures, and they need to invest in innovation and growth on the other hand as consumers, employees and other stakeholders increasingly demand ever greater digital experiences based on new technologies.","Our results this quarter once again show that our intimate client relationships, deep industry and technology knowledge and robust global delivery network position Cognizant to anticipate and deliver the services that clients need to tackle this dual mandate. Our ability to respond to market needs is the result of our focus across 3 horizons of investment. Within Horizon 1, our core application development maintenance, system implementation and testing services continue to show solid performance as clients embrace managed services models that allow them to create a variable cost structure that more closely matches their business demand.","Within Horizon 2, we saw growth rates that exceed the company average. In fact, this quarter, Horizon 2 offerings are approaching 20% of Cognizant's total revenue. In Business Process Outsourcing or BPO, and IT Infrastructures Services or ITIS, growth is driven by clients recognizing our global scale and competitiveness and turning to us for more complex and often larger engagements. We are further strengthening our position in ITIS as evidenced by the data center expansion we recently announced. And in Cognizant Business Consulting or CBC, we continue to differentiate ourselves as thought leaders, evidenced by a number of new local wins and further penetration of Cognizant's existing strategic accounts.","Across both Horizon 1 and 2, we are continuing to see a trend towards larger transformational engagements like those with Philips and ING about which we have previously spoken. The trend is driven by clients' need to achieve significant and rapid impact on their business in response to the pressures brought about by the dual mandate. Our pipeline of these larger engagements remains strong.","Within Horizon 3, we continue to develop offerings in 3 areas: new technologies, new delivery models and new markets. We have spoken about the significant mind share impact that these offerings are having with clients. We are now also beginning to see a revenue impact. This is particularly true within the new social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies that comprise the SMAC stack. At our annual U.S. Cognizant Community event that we held last month, nearly 400 client executives joined us to discuss the impact these technologies are having and will continue to have. What emerged from our 2.5-day conversation is continuing consensus that this wave of technology is having a transformative impact on businesses across industries. Clients recognize a significant disruption that book retailing, music, movies, photography, et cetera, have already seen and understand that these technologies will have an impact to varying degrees across all industries. They also agree that [indiscernible] this transition requires a strong partner who can bring to bear a combination of leading-edge capabilities and a deep knowledge of the specifics of their business and existing technology landscape. Our Horizon 3 investments have prepared us to be that partner.","We also continue to see strong progress in our other Horizon 3 areas of focus. New delivery models, including platform-based services that break linearity between revenue and headcount, and new markets such as government and Latin America.","Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver revenue of at least $7.34 billion in 2012. Our discussions with clients at Cognizant Community, though focused on longer-term transformation, also gave us a view into more immediate demand. Clients indicated that though their budget cycles are just kicking off, suggestions are that overall IT funding will remain flat in 2013. They also echoed the dual mandate suggesting that the benefits that they accrue from the continued adoption of global delivery models would be used to fund innovation and new capabilities.","With that, I'd now like to hand the call over to Gordon, who will provide context on our operating results, and Karen will provide details in our financial results. As always, we will leave time at the end for questions. Gordon?","Gordon J. Coburn","Thank you, Francisco. We're very pleased to have delivered another strong quarter of industry-leading growth that was broad based across our portfolio of services and geographies. We continue to solidify our position in Horizon 1. These services are in central strength that we leverage in order to penetrate existing clients, new clients, as well as new geographies. Our industry-leading position in this Horizon has been recognized time and again by analysts. Most recently, we were named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for customer relationship management consulting and solution implementation services worldwide. Our position in this quadrant speaks to our deep understanding of and vision for developing best-in-class CRM solutions for our clients.","Also the Everest Group recognized Cognizant as a leader in their matrix for health care payer application outsourcing. When evaluated on performance, experience, ability and knowledge, we scored exceptionally high on the success we've had in this market, our scale and scope of services, investments in domain expertise and our global footprint.","Horizon 2, which includes Business Process Outsourcing, IT Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Consulting, continues to grow faster than company average and is now approaching 20% of our total revenue. We have achieved global scale and competitiveness within these offerings, and our pipeline remains strong as the addressable market continues to grow. The value of our vertical focus is particularly evident in our core BPO offerings, which are continuing to show strong growth both with existing and new clients. Our clients want providers that understand their industries and businesses. Our deep knowledge of the industries we serve drives our competitive strength in this area and is further enhanced by 2 factors: the quality and capability of the talent we hire and our focus on continuous productivity improvement.","Our BPO workforce of over 17,000 professionals includes over 1,700 doctors, nurses, clinicians and biostatisticians focused on our health care practice, and over 5,000 capital markets and financial services specialists. We provide support to our clients in 8 languages across 15 delivery centers throughout the world.","IT Infrastructure Services also had a strong quarter driven primarily by deals we closed in the second quarter and significant growth from existing clients. Our ITIS practice now has over 10,000 professionals, and the potential for growth in this sector remains strong and our pipeline is robust. The Infrastructure Services market has undergone a significant evolution as a result of new cloud technologies and associated delivery models. As a result, the market is now demanding Infrastructure Services which are more agile and allow on-demand consumption. Clients want to modernize their IT infrastructure in order to bring consumer IT models to their users, while simultaneously virtualizing their infrastructure, rationalizing their costs and improving productivity through flexible and nimble as-a-service business models.","To more fully capitalize on this opportunity, we recently announced that we are expanding our ITIS capability through the creation of a data center cloud services organization which will offer private and multi-tenant cloud offerings. Cognizant's proprietary enterprise-class cloud management solution, Cloud360, will serve as the front end for provisioning and policy management. Highlights of our data center offerings include: an infrastructure-neutral environment to meet a variety of client needs and support multiple platforms across hosting, storage and network services; tight integration with our existing remote infrastructure management delivery platform; leveraging, as well as enhancing, our existing Horizon 3 cloud offerings; and finally, we're drawing on our traditional strengths in systems integration and professional services by offering true end-to-end infrastructure management solutions.","This initiative requires capital, operations and development investment upfront, but the investment is reasonable and phased. Working with our partners, our initial focus is on setting up 4 world-class Tier 3 cloud-based data center facilities in the U.S. and Europe which will form the backbone of Cognizant's infrastructure cloud. As needed, we will then leverage these partnerships to extend our reach to meet specific client requirements. This hub and spoke approach enables us to control investments while reducing time to market.","Looking at our performance from an industry standpoint, financial services grew exceptionally well in Q3; 7% sequential and 20% year-over-year growth. Growth was stronger than anticipated, particularly among our larger banking clients, which continue to expand their partnerships with us for traditional application outsourcing services, as well as newer technologies such as analytics and mobility. Insurance was, as expected, a success story in Q3 due to existing clients driving demand across virtually all service areas. Cost optimization remains the overarching theme in financial services.","Meanwhile, Healthcare grew 12% year-over-year but was essentially flat sequentially. In the short term, we expect this segment to remain volatile, but demand longer term should accelerate due to a variety of factors. First, the impact of some M&A activity in this sector is clearly contracting discretionary spend as dollars are diverted to deal-related activities. However, we also believe that the very same M&A activity creates a long-term driver for demand as companies restructure themselves and reassess their IT strategy. Second, consumerization of health plans also appears to be driving demand for customer management solutions, including the growing use of analytics. And finally, regulatory changes should continue to be a factor longer term either to address compliance with the Affordable Care Act or in advance of the go-live date in 2014 for ICD-10.","As expected, our retail and manufacturing segment delivered strong results in the third quarter, growing 11% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Our other business segment also performed as expected during the quarter.","Moving on to our performance by geography. Growth in North America and the rest of the world played out as we had anticipated. Growth in Europe was marginally better than expected. This was driven by a number of large deals we closed throughout the year, such as a pharmaceutical client in Continental Europe where we recently won work in the area of application outsourcing, BPO and IT infrastructure management. Banking is also seeing good traction in Europe, both with newer clients as well as existing established relationships across a wide range of services.","The ongoing economic challenges in Europe are beginning to act as a catalyst for longer-term outsourcing opportunities and broader acceptance of the global delivery model. Our European clients must run their businesses more efficiently, while simultaneously investing in innovation. We clearly expect to be a beneficiary of this trend.","We're also very pleased with our performance in Asia-Pacific where we're seeing solid traction both with existing customers, as well as new logo wins across the region, particularly in financial services, retail and manufacturing and life sciences.","In India, we recently won a 3-year application management deal for a large private sector bank and a marquee consulting deal with a leading India-based pharmaceutical company. In the Middle East, we have seen new logo wins across financial services and retail and manufacturing, involving a variety of service lines, including data warehousing, SAP and testing. Australia and Singapore have also seen key wins in the areas of application development, CRM and IT Infrastructure management. We're continuing to strengthen our capabilities and investments in the Asia-Pacific regions, and we're quite pleased with the early results we are experiencing from these investments.","Finally, I'd like to take a moment to talk about our sustainability efforts. Sustainability is an important issue for all companies. At Cognizant, we are driving this effort through a strong focus on environment and education as essential sustainability issues for the ongoing health of our business and industry. This morning, I'll touch on our environmental achievements.","I'm pleased to share that in this year's recently released Newsweek Green Rankings, Cognizant is now ranked #13 in the U.S. and #50 globally. We have reduced our per capita carbon emissions since 2008 and are on track to hit our goal of 40% reduction by 2015. We recycle 22% of water we use and reduced our paper consumption last year by 60%. All this implies cost savings of over $18 million to date.","I'll now hand the call over to Karen to comment on our financial performance and guidance.","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning to everyone. As detailed in our press release, our third quarter revenue grew 5.4% sequentially and 18.2% over last year to $1.892 billion ahead of our guidance of $1.875 billion from last quarter. Application development represented 51.2% of revenue, while application management represented 48.8% of revenue for the quarter. Development grew 18.4% year-over-year and 4.6% sequentially. Application management grew 17.9% year-over-year and 6.2% sequentially.","33.5% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts during the third quarter. Fixed bid revenues have grown by 27.8% over last year, reflecting further acceptance of the managed services model of engagement by our clients. As expected, on a sequential basis, our pricing during the third quarter was stable. We closed the quarter with 821 active customers, and the number of accounts which we consider to be strategic increased by 6. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 208.","Turning to cost. On a GAAP basis, cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was approximately $1.1 billion and included $3.9 million of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to additional staff, both on-site and offshore, required to support our revenue growth. We increased our technical staff by over 4,600 during the quarter and ended the quarter with approximately 140,500 technical staff.","Third quarter SG&A, including depreciation and amortization expenses, was $424.4 million on a GAAP basis and included approximately $18.4 million of stock-based compensation expense. Our GAAP operating margin was 18.8% for the quarter and our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 20%, at the high end of our target range of 19% to 20%.","We have further extended our Indian rupee expense hedging program. As of September 30, we have approximately $3.7 billion in outstanding hedges of our rupee expenses, which will mature each month through December 2016 at an average rate of approximately 53.7%.","We had approximately $12 million of interest income. And in addition, we had a net $3 million loss in nonoperating income comprised almost entirely of FX losses. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24%.","Our diluted share count for the quarter was 303.1 million shares, down by about 4.2 million shares from Q2. During the third quarter, we repurchased just over 1 million shares at an average price of $56.33 for a total cost of approximately $59 million. As of today, 13.3 million shares have been repurchased at a cost of $840.4 million under the current share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with over $2.6 billion of cash and short-term investments. During the quarter, operating activities generated $384.9 million of cash. Financing activities used approximately $25.6 million of cash. This consisted of expenditures of $59 million towards our share repurchase program, partially offset by net proceeds of $39.4 million related to option exercises and related tax benefits, as well as our employee stock purchase program.","We spent approximately $70 million for capital expenditures during the quarter and for the full year, we continue to expect our capital expenditures to total approximately $370 million.","Based on our approximately $1.58 billion receivable balance on September 30, we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 77 days, essentially flat with last quarter. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $214 million, up from $208 million at the end of Q2. Approximately 60% of the Q3 unbilled balance was billed in October.","Net headcount increased by over 5,100 people during the quarter. Approximately 35% of gross additions for the quarter were direct college hires, while approximately 65% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. We ended the quarter with approximately 150,400 employees globally. As we have shown previously, our business model is flexible, allowing us to align hiring and the pyramid to growth.","Annualized attrition in the quarter was 13%, slightly higher than the Q2 attrition rate of 12.1% but slightly lower than the attrition rate of 13.4% in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, we report attrition by annualizing the turnover which occurred within the quarter, including both voluntary and involuntary. Our attrition statistics include all departures, including BPO and employees in our training program.","Utilization increased slightly on a sequential basis during Q3 for offshores. Offshore utilization was approximately 70%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who were in our training program, was approximately 77%, and on-site utilization was 93% during the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our growth expectations for the fourth quarter of 2012 as well as the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we are projecting revenue of at least $1.94 billion. This represents a sequential growth rate of 2.6%. Our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects our view that there will be no meaningful budget flush this year. For the full year, we continue to expect industry-leading revenue growth. Based on current conditions and client indications, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $7.34 billion, reaffirming our guidance from last quarter. This revenue represents a full year growth rate of at least 20% compared to 2011.","We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to remain in the range of 19% to 20%, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Therefore, we are currently comfortable with our ability to deliver in Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.91 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.97, which excludes estimated stock-based compensation expense of $0.06. This guidance anticipates a Q4 share count of approximately 304.5 million shares and a tax rate of 24.5%. Our guidance excludes any future nonoperating FX gains or losses.","For the full year, based on current business trends, we expect our GAAP EPS to be at least $3.42 and our full year non-GAAP EPS to be at least $3.69, excluding $0.27 of estimated full year stock-based compensation expense. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 306 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 24.4%. It also excludes any future nonoperating FX gains or losses.","Now I would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Francisco, I just wanted to ask. I think you said that preliminary conversations you had with some clients talked about flat spend in fiscal year '13. Can you just remind us how that's going to end up comparing to spend this year, this fiscal year?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes, Bryan, thanks. We had about a month ago, give or take, we got -- we ran our annual customer conference, Cognizant Community, where we had 400 or so of our clients, or individuals from across our client base, together for 2.5 days. And we covered a wide range of topics. Most of what we covered was sort of longer term, but we also did have an opportunity to talk to them about their plans and views for 2013. And most of them came back and said, \"While it's still early, the budget cycles are just in the process of getting kicked off.\" They expect overall IT budgets to be somewhat flat going into next year. And I just want to clarify that this is mostly a North American sample. This was our North American Cognizant Community. That's largely consistent with the trend we've seen in past years where IT budgets have been flat with, in past years, perhaps sort of slight moderate upward bias. I think what's really important in -- that the trend with budgets, and we heard it again this year, was this continuing share shift to the global delivery model. We heard that again this year where clients were telling us that as they look to budgets next year, because their overall budget will remain flat, they're going to look to move an increasing amount of work to the global delivery model, not just IT work but now also increasingly business process kind of work, and take the savings that they achieve from that shift and redeploy those or reinvest those back in innovation and new technology investments that they need to make to keep their businesses competitive.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and just a quick follow-up. Originally, you guys stated the revenue growth would likely be fairly evenly split sequentially between second through fourth quarters. But after having a solid 5.4% sequential growth this quarter, you guys are now guiding to a little bit of a slowdown to that 2.6%. Is there anything to read into that change?","Gordon J. Coburn","If you look historically, Q4 has been weaker than Q3 sequentially. Last year, Q4 grew about half the pace of Q3. There are some real seasonal stuff. We have holidays and vacations. Retail in particular, which was a very important growth driver for us in Q3, we do not expect to be a growth driver in Q4 due to the holiday shutdowns that are normally in the retail business. And most importantly, we got clarity with -- at our Cognizant Community that there's not going to be a budget flush. So when we look at our guidance, we had a very solid Q3. We're pleased. We'll continue to good sequential growth in Q4 but it'll clearly be at a slower pace, which is not unlike prior years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Hickey with Atlantic Equities.","Christopher Hickey - Atlantic Equities LLP","The composition of your operating margin was really so different to our expectations with gross margin down quite sharply, offset by SG&A. You mentioned hiring, but were there any other drivers of this? And could you kind of help us separate out currency from any other dynamics within the OpEx and COGS profile this quarter?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. Chris, it's Karen. I'll try to answer that. So FX wasn't actually a huge impact between Q2 and Q3. The real impact came particularly in COGS with the timing of our wage increases. So we have 2 rounds of wage increases over the summer. The first round kicks in, in May so you had the full quarter impact of that first round kicking in, in Q3. And then we also do a second component which kicks in, in July. So that's the primary driver of the movement in COGS. And then down in SG&A, frankly, primarily the timing of payment for visas, some immigration costs. A lot of our immigration filings are done in the early part of the year, and so the SG&A decline that you saw from Q2 to Q3 was the timing of those payments.","Gordon J. Coburn","And just to be clear, the May versus July salary comment, it's not the same people getting a second increase. It's a portion of the population gets it in May and the remainder of the portion -- the remainder of the population gets their increase in July.","Christopher Hickey - Atlantic Equities LLP","Great, that's very helpful. And Gordon, you mentioned the data center spending will be phased over time. To what extent does this change the CapEx profile we should expect over the next few years?","Gordon J. Coburn","I don't think it has any material CapEx impact. This buildout of the 4 centers is costing us around $25 million or so with a CapEx budget of $370 million. It's reflected in that $370 million. So I don't think it has any material impact on the overall capital intensity of the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to inquire a little more about how your revenue outlook has changed over the last 3 months. 3 months ago, it seems you were expecting sequential growth in Q4 of about 4.5%. I'm wondering if anything happened in Q3 that alters your view on Q4's growth prospects. I know you, earlier on the call, cited holidays, vacations, retail seasonality and the expectation of no budget flush, but it seems these factors were clearly known 3 months ago. So I'm wondering if Q3, the strength in Q3 essentially pulled forward some revenues that you were previously expecting in Q4, or if you're now starting to assume that some of the Q4 revenue growth prospects are being pushed out into 2013, either because of the need to be conservative here or because you're actually seeing things not ramp as quickly in Q4 as maybe you thought. Can you clarify any of that?","Francisco D'Souza","Sure. It's Frank, Rod. I think it's mostly reflected in the fact that revenues that we were expecting in Q4 will pull forward a little bit into Q2 and into Q3. It's hard to -- as we look out 2, 3 quarters, we have a general sense of what work clients need to get done over the next 2 or 3 quarters. But to actually predict exactly how that lays out over the -- in a quarter-by-quarter pattern, there's obviously some variability with that. So we had a pretty good sense 2 or 3 quarters ago of how the year was going to -- or what the year was going to look like. We still feel comfortable with that. But how that exactly lays out quarter-by-quarter, there's always going to be some variability. So this quarter, we saw some of the Q4 work actually getting executed in Q3. One other factor I'll point to, it's relatively small, but I will also mention that we do expect some impact to the business from the superstorm or whatever, Sandy. And we feel comfortable that we can absorb that into our guidance. But that also does take out some of the potential upside that we had for the fourth quarter. So I think it's a combination of largely those factors in addition to the seasonal factors that Gordon talked about earlier in the Q&A.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, is the Sandy impact roughly maybe 0.5 point? I mean, we had tried to do some back of the envelope math on that. I mean, is it 0.5 point or could it be more than that?","Karen McLoughlin","It's less than that.","Gordon J. Coburn","It would be less than 0.5 point. It would be measured in millions of dollars but certainly not tens of millions of dollars.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And so it sounds like though there was nothing meaningful that happened in Q3 other than you perhaps pulled forward some Q4 revenues. You were able to  book it faster than you thought. There were no other meaningful changes in the demand trends that causes you to think about a different outlook for Q4. Am I reading that right?","Francisco D'Souza","I think that's right. I think, as I said, we pulled forward revenue or revenue came in, in Q3 that we were expecting in Q4. I will point out though, I think there are 2 important elements of demand that we saw in the third quarter that are important. First of all, as Gordon and I both mentioned in our comments, we continue to see good traction in IT Infrastructure Services, BPO and consulting and the so-called Horizon 2 service offerings, and those represented just under 20% of revenue during the quarter. I think that's an important indicator of the strength of those service offerings. And the other point I would talk about with respect to demand in the second quarter -- excuse me, in the third quarter, was that financial services, the core banking part of our BFS segment and Continental Europe, were a little stronger than we anticipated when we gave you guidance the last time. And so I think those were -- all of those were net positives in demand for the quarter.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And great, Francisco, just to complete that thought, I mean, earlier in the year when you reduced your guidance, it was due to banks and pharma. Are you also feeling better about pharma\/life sciences, or is that still in a similar position as it was earlier in the year from a demand outlook standpoint?","Gordon J. Coburn","Clearly, pharma and Healthcare in general remained soft. As I mentioned, it was flat sequentially, similar to where we had stronger than expected results. And banking and Continental Europe certainly, Healthcare underperformed even our adjusted expectations. So we would expect that trend to continue for the remainder of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe just to follow up on the question about Healthcare. Can you talk about where it was underperforming your expectations? I know that you've talked about patent cliff being an issue this year, but was there anything more that drove the weaker performance in the third quarter?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So if you split the payers from life sciences, on the payers, we were impacted by M&A. There was M&A occurred with several of our large customers, and that did impact near-term discretionary spending. We think it may set us up well for the future once we get through the M&A work, but clearly right now that's a distraction and had impact on some of the programs. On life sciences, the patent cliffs are real now. Obviously, the life sciences companies knew they were coming but now that they've hit and in some cases as drugs have come off patent, the revenue decline is faster than anticipated. That is impacting IT spend in a significant way. So this is one that we knew was coming. I think it's probably hit the life sciences industry a little harder than anticipated, but that sector is going through a tough patch right now. Will it come back? Yes, of course it'll come back. But right now it's a tough sector.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just one last question. Sequential growth in the other category picked up although it was still weaker than financial services and the manufacturing segment. I know that you've talked about that being more discretionary development work. Can you discuss what you saw there in the quarter?","Karen McLoughlin","Sorry, I think Sara, as you said, it was -- sequential growth in the quarter was about 3.8%, so still below company average. Because it does have a higher concentration of discretionary spending, it tends to be a little bit more volatile. But we are seeing -- we've got some very nice new logo wins, particularly in the high-tech sector and starting to see some good traction there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Looking at the -- actually, real quickly, can I just get the additional metrics that you guys usually provide on the top accounts and the on-site\/offshore mix real quick?","Karen McLoughlin","So top 5 for the quarter, Julio, was 14% of revenue. The top 10 accounts for the quarter are 25% of revenue. And the on-site\/offshore ratio was just below 79%. It's about 78.9%. Right movement toward on-site this quarter, primarily due to the ING transition.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","More towards on-site, got it. And just looking at the metrics into next year, if you think about the drivers for the business, obviously, headcount growth and pricing and utilization, a mix of all these things are important to the way we think about the bottom-up build of the model. Any one of those in particular that you guys can call out as you think about strength or weaknesses for drivers that we should be considering into 2013?","Gordon J. Coburn","So let's hit those one by one, Julio. Headcount will simply be a driver with what revenue is. As you know, our model is a mix of the longer terms -- longer cycle college hiring, as well as just-in-time lateral hiring, so we can move that up and down very quickly. So the -- rather than us -- rather than that being a driver of growth, it's a result of what demand is. Pricing is stable, which is good. I wouldn't expect any big overall price increases next year, but we're certainly in a stable environment. So I think ultimately revenue growth will largely be driven by volume next year.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And do you guys have a number or target for headcount adds then in the fourth quarter relative to the revenue guidance?","Gordon J. Coburn","We stay away from giving specific headcount growth guidance, but certainly we will continue to add people in the fourth quarter. Our business is continuing to grow. We had very good headcount additions in the third quarter and we don't give specific guidance for the fourth quarter, but certainly there will be headcount growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Cloud and analytics software companies missed numbers this quarter. Just curious if you're seeing in the Horizon 3 business any delay of projects. I know it's very small from a revenue prospective, but anecdotally, have you seen any delay of those transformative deals in the uncertain macro and fiscal environment?","Francisco D'Souza","I wouldn't -- I don't think we've seen a significant trend that I would point to. I think that as with the Horizon 1 business, where the systems integration business in Horizon 1, I think our projects, specifically in cloud and analytics, tend to be less dependent on short-term movements in how licenses of those or sales of the SaaS companies or the analytics companies tend to do projects. Tend to be longer-term; they tend to be more focused on implementation of those technologies. And so we haven't seen any meaningful change that leads me to having a degree of concern.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham Securities.","Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I had a question, Gordon, Karen and Francisco, on sort of the mix between the headcount additions. I think you said 35% freshers and 65% laterals. That seems to be not consistent with, in prior years, when freshers would make up a larger percentage of recruiting. Can you just talk about that impact?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So it's an important issue that we're working through, Julio. We on-boarded a lot of fresh -- oh, Mayank, sorry. Sorry about that, Mayank. We on-boarded a lot of freshers late in 2011, probably more than we should have at that time because obviously, we thought revenue growth through '12 would be stronger than anticipated. So it's taken us a bit to work through all those people that we on-boarded very late last year, so that's impacted the timing of on boarding the 2012 class. So you're absolutely right, that the -- when I look at the gross hires in 2012, the mix is not as heavily towards college grads as I would have anticipated. But that's largely driven by, I had a very large pipeline or people in training in the classroom at the end of 2011.","Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And should we expect that to shift back to more freshers versus laterals in 2013?","Gordon J. Coburn","I think it should be more balanced, yes.","Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then just finally, as these different services evolve, Horizon 3, 2 and 1, as they sort of change the mix, do you expect to change the types of people that you're recruiting? Does that have any implications on your operating model over time?","Gordon J. Coburn","Let me talk about Horizon 2, and then Frank can talk about Horizon 3. Certainly for Horizon 2 there's a big impact, and it's both extremes. And consulting is a very different profile than our typical engineer. In BPO it's also a different profile, not necessarily a low-end profile. As I mentioned, we have 1,700 doctors, nurses and statisticians. We have 5,000 financial services specialists, but those are very different than engineers. ITIS is obviously closer to the engineers, but it's a broader range of people. And Frank, you want to talk a little bit about Horizon 3?","Francisco D'Souza","Yes, I think you have a very similar dynamic in Horizon 3. We've got a range of businesses in the Horizon 3 portfolio ranging from the new delivery models, which are the platform services we're working on where we're tending to bring in folks more from the traditional ISE [ph] or software background. We've got new geographies, which tend to be largely a similar people profile to the core business. And then we've got the new technologies, which again, tend to be largely similar but obviously focused on these new technology areas. So within Horizon 3, again, a broad range of talent we're bringing in. But I think that I don't see any of this Horizon 2 or Horizon 3 meaningfully changing the operating model. We've been dealing with a changing mix of workforce for a decade now. And I don't see that these will change these -- in the short-term, will change that dramatically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to get, I guess, full clarity on the Healthcare question. Are you expecting the headwinds to leak into 2013? I mean, how should we think about that? And I know you said that it's going to come back, but I'm just trying to get general sense without obviously getting any kind of guidance on just what the trajectory of that business would be.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So I think it's a little too early to tell for the payer side of Healthcare, but for pharma, I think answer is clearly, yes, it will weaken 2013. 2013 is going to be a tough year for pharma. When you talk to most of them, 2014 actually looks okay as they have some new drugs come online. But 2013 is a trough year for them.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then just the same questions, sticking with the regulatory theme. Financial services obviously seems to have rebounded. Have we had a level of stability in that business? And how do you view the IT budgets next year given the regulatory requirements?","Francisco D'Souza","We've had a couple of quarters now where financial services have been a little stronger than we expected. I'm still cautious to call 2 quarters a trend, but I do have a greater degree of optimism with financial services than I had, say, 3 or 4 quarters ago. So I'd like to watch it another quarter or 2 to make sure that we can continue to drive the performance that we've seen over the last 2 quarters of it. I think that when I -- when we talk to banks in terms of budgets for next year, I think it's largely consistent with the commentary that we gave earlier on budgets overall.  Most of our banking clients are saying sort of flat budgets next year with a share shift to the global delivery model, I think that continues. We said -- we've also started to see the midsized banks, we talked about this last quarter, starting to adopt the global delivery model a little bit more actively and aggressively than they have in the past, so that's also contributing to overall performance in that sector. I would also say that as we look to that industry sector, we continue to feel that there is a lot of growth that we're driving because of the deep industry knowledge that we have in financial services, which we continue to invest in. And I think that, that's really positioned us well. So I feel cautiously optimistic, but I'd like to watch it for another 2 -- quarter or 2 to make sure that the trend continues.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, and just -- finally, just for clarity in financial services, is there still weakness in capital markets? And on the regulatory side of the spending, do you expect that to just be part of the budget, or could that provide upside in 2013?","Gordon J. Coburn","So clearly, capital markets, there is a fundamental restructuring going on there, and overall IT budgets in the capital market space is coming down. Now we have less exposure to pure play capital markets firms than others. We tend to have more exposure to the capital markets divisions in money center banks. I think what you're seeing there is they're pushing the envelope on outsourcing and use of global delivery and open to look in much more broader opportunities, in the context of needing to reduce their budgets. Regulatory change for next year? Obviously the election just happened last night and so forth. But in the end, it's going to be neutral to positive for us as regulatory spend may pick up. It's not going to all be incremental spend, clearly. A portion of it hopefully will be, and I think we're well positioned to capture regulatory spend. But how much happens and how quickly and how much of it is incremental, those are questions that, yes, I think we'll get clarity for over the coming months or so now that the election's out of the way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Discretionary [ph] consulting trends playing out. Development's actually been relatively similar to your outsourcing growth rates in the past couple of quarters, perhaps due to implementation around Horizon 2 offerings. But if you can give a little more color on what you see of being drivers underlying more discretionary consulting trends, and it was a little weaker earlier in the year. It seems to have come up a little bit now. How do you see that playing out? And then just a quick follow-up.","Francisco D'Souza","Yes, I think that at a macro level, what's driving discretionary spending is the so-called dual mandate that I spoke about. We have this -- and we spent virtually all of our time at Cognizant Community discussing this with clients, we have this wave of new technologies, the so-called SMAC stack, social, mobile, analytics and cloud. And these, we think truly represent -- and our clients agree, truly represent in some senses the next generation of IT architecture. The impact that these technologies are having and will have on businesses is probably as profound, if not more profound, than what the -- than the impact that the Internet had a decade or so ago. And so we expect that a big driver of discretionary spending will be sort of adoption of these new technologies as clients look to say how do I take social, mobile, analytics and cloud and apply them across our businesses. And we feel like we're very, very well positioned because of our Horizon 3 offerings in that space. So that's sort of the macro commentary. If you sort of take it down to a quarter-by-quarter play, discretionary spending tends to be stronger in the middle of a calendar year because that's the time when clients have -- they're past the budget cycle, budgets have been approved and you tend to get in Q2, and to some extent in Q3, the full impact of those budget approvals. And then as we go into Q3, the back half of Q3 and Q4, discretionary spending tends to slow down as clients go into the budget process. So at a more micro level, that's, I think, the trend that we'll see playing out this quarter or next quarter and going into next year.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right, that's helpful. Just one quick follow-up, again, one of the most notable attributes of Cognizant is its ability to consistently maintain leading growth rate in the top line, again, as evidenced by this past quarter. While this has been achievable in your Horizon 1 offerings for a while, I mean, and getting back to the Horizon 2 and 3, I'd just be curious how you expect to continue to differentiate yourselves in these offerings when you really do see just about every other company in the industry investing heavily in a lot of these same areas?","Francisco D'Souza","I think that when we talk about -- if you think about the strength of the company across all 3 horizons, I think what underpins our differentiation and what has allowed us to drive the industry-leading growth is the fact that we -- I think we truly have a unique and differentiated approach to building domain expertise, creating deep intimate relationships with our clients and making that all feasible in a very seamless way to the client through a world-class global delivery model. Those core underlying strengths underpin our differentiation across Horizon 1, Horizon 2 and Horizon 3. And I think that it is because we are building Horizon 1, 2 and 3 on top of those 3 core underlying strengths that we will be differentiated across all of those Horizons and which, in turn, will allow us to drive industry-leading growth across all of those areas of investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies & Company.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] on the top line, so I'll switch over to margins here. I guess, the non-GAAP operating margins have been at or slightly above the top end of your target range for, I think, the past 4 quarters or so. Does it still make sense for 19% to be the low end of your range? I think it's been forever since you've even been below 19.5% in any given quarter. And maybe as part of that, can you just talk about what you would attribute the great margin performance to being at or above the top end of the range because the rupee are largely hedged on, and it does seem like you're continuing to reinvest in the business. So is it pricing, utilization, some economies of scale emerging? Or what would you attribute it to?","Gordon J. Coburn","So let's start with your first question of is 19% to 20% the right range. And our belief is absolutely yes. We have tremendous opportunities for investment. We're continuing to invest in Europe. You're seeing the results of the investment we're making in Asia right now; it's incredible. So we're going to continue to accelerate that investment. We're starting to invest down in South America now. We're investing in Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 simultaneously. So we're not in the business of selling a one-off piece of software and then moving on. These are long-term relationships with greenfield opportunities, so we want to take as much market share as we can rather than top margin. And the strategy's working. We're growing materially faster than the industry this year. Our brand is the strongest it's been in our history. Our recruiting statistics are the strongest that it's been in our history. And this strategy of reinvestment is clearly working. This year, we have been running at the upper end of the range and part of that is driven by -- yes, we did have to take our revenue guidance down during the year, and we wanted to try to minimize the impact on EPS of that change in guidance early in the year. But as long as the investment strategy is working, we're going to stick with it.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just as a follow-up to talk about the balance sheet. Obviously, the cash balance continues to grow tremendously. I think you're almost up to about 15% of your market cap, and I think the Street realizes you guys need a big cushion on the balance sheet to compete for larger deals against bigger competitors. But should investors be looking for larger share buybacks or some other form of return of cash going forward just to try and enhance total shareholder returns?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure, a couple things. First of all, remember not all that cash is sitting in the U.S., and it's not all accessible for dividends or buybacks. That's a very important point.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","How much of that?","Gordon J. Coburn","Over half of it is outside the U.S. or needs to be outside the U.S. When we look at the strategy, we've been opportunistic on share repurchases. Obviously, when the stock was down, we were quite aggressive on the share repurchases. We still have some gunpowder left on that program. Near term, I think the strategy will continue of opportunistic share repurchases, making sure we have plenty of gunpowder for acquisitions. That being said, acquisitions, we expect to continue to be our strategy of either for geography, industry or technology capability. The definition of tuck under continues to grow as we get bigger. Longer term, we'll have to look at what do we do with the cash, but also part of that is working our strategies for where will the cash be and how is it accessible. And we need to figure out some of those things first.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I wanted to ask first, I know you don't give explicit guidance, but just qualitatively, how we should think about the composition of application development versus maintenance in the Q4. What typically happens in a Q4 in that regard?","Karen McLoughlin","Yes, so I think as you saw a little bit in Q3 [ph] we wouldn't -- Q4, very few clients tend to start application development projects unless it's something small that could be completed in the quarter. So I think we would expect to see maintenance grow slightly faster than the development as it did in Q3 as we go into Q4 as well. And then that trend typically starts to reverse as you get into the middle part of next year.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, Karen, I want to check. Could you just remind us what you include in application development in a general way?","Karen McLoughlin","So it's all of our software implementation, testing, consultings and all the front-end type work that goes along with development and implementation projects.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then lastly for me, Gordon you have this impressive health care practice and you stated repeatedly on this call and in other calls, the deep domain expertise of those professionals. Nurses, doctors, clinicians, et cetera. In the instance that Healthcare doesn't come back -- and I only to split hairs with you because it was a great quarter. But in the instance that Healthcare doesn't come back, at least in the near term, how do you move those people into other parts of the organization to make sure they're utilized?","Gordon J. Coburn","Let's be clear. Healthcare not coming back does not mean Healthcare is negative sequential growth. Healthcare not coming back means it doesn't -- it's a driver of growth, so therefore it's growing well below company average. I don't see a scenario where 2013 Healthcare has negative growth over 2012.","Francisco D'Souza","I think we're just about out of time here, so let's wrap up. I want to thank all of you for joining us for this quarter. We're obviously pleased with our performance this quarter, and we look forward to talking to you again on our Q4 call and full year.

I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com.","The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q to be filed later today.","I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call. This morning I'd like to cover two topics, first, a few financial highlights in Q2 and then a brief update on how we're continuing to gain share with our leading digital services.","Let's begin with the quarter. We're now about halfway through executing the financial strategy we announced 18 months ago. As this quarter's results show, we're making solid progress on key aspects of our plan and we're on track to meet our goals for the year. Second quarter revenue was $4.01 billion, within our guided range, and up 9.2% year-over-year. In the quarter, our digital revenue grew in the low 20% range, well above company average, and is approaching 30% of total revenue, reflecting our continuing shift to digital revenues.","Our portfolio digital services generated margins above the company average, and our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.19. As these results underscore our emphasis on digital services is helping us win more business with attractive margins. And that enables us to deliver higher quality growth for the company.","During Q2, we also launched a $600 million accelerated share repurchase and we're on track to deliver on our commitment to return $3.4 billion to stockholders by the end of 2018.","Turning to guidance, we expect third quarter revenue to be within a range of $4.06 billion to $4.1 billion. We expect full-year revenue to be within a range of $16.05 billion and $16.3 billion, a growth of 8.4% to 10%. And we remain confident in our previously stated guidance of achieving non-GAAP operating margin in 2018 of approximately 21%.","Now moving to my second topic, thriving in today's business environment. Last quarter, I covered Cognizant's execution progress using a three-part framework, digitize, globalize, and localize. Using that same framework, I'd like to talk about how we're continuing to advance our business, starting with digitize. To underscore our digital progress, consider some of the new work we're doing in two areas of growing importance to clients; first, artificial intelligence and analytics; and, second, cloud. Through our digital business practice, we use data and analytics, optimized with machine learning and artificial intelligence, and, of course, intimate knowledge of our clients' businesses to help them drive greater levels of personalization, productivity, and growth.","Incidentally, Cognizant operates one of the world's largest AI practices, measured by numbers of professionals and scope of services. A recent engagement tells our AI and analytics story. A multi-national banking and financial services client needed to stem costly credit card fraud losses. Our client handles some 700 million card transactions a month, of which about 1.3 million turn out to be fraudulent. Using machine learning algorithms we built a solution that runs real-time transactions against multiple newer network models.","With our AI solution, the client was able to understand new fraud patterns, increase their fraud capture rate by 30% and reduce the rate of false positives, that is, legitimate transactions wrongly declined by 100%. We see abundant opportunity to apply AI and machine learning to our client's business to help them improve their operational performance and generate new growth.","Cloud is another enabler of end-to-end digital transformation. By year-end, we expect our global cloud workforce to exceed 20,000 associates. Today, about half of our current cloud focused associates work in our Digital Systems & Technology practice, which brings together applications, infrastructure and security to help clients rapidly deliver new applications and services, support product development at scale and shrink time to value from years to months.","For a major health insurer, we moved 18 business critical applications from their legacy infrastructure to the pivotal cloud foundry platform in just months, managing every step from analysis, design, and remediation to application release and program management. Doing so not only reduced application failures and infrastructure costs, it also helped the insurer move to a rapid software development model, speeding the movement of applications into production with weekly instead of monthly code releases and eliminating the need for downtime due to upgrades or refreshes.","Clients turn to us because we've built the composite of end-to-end capability, domain knowledge, global and local delivery and continuing investment to deliver some (07:02) strategy through implementation and outcomes. And that end-to-end capability includes thousands of certified cloud experts who can accelerate clients' cloud journeys by drawing on our strategic partnerships with all of the major cloud providers, including Azure, Amazon Web Services, Salesforce.com, Workday and more. So we expect our digital portfolio to continue to grow at double-digit rates.","Our second approach to today's environment is to further globalize. We continue to expand our geographic footprint and add new delivery and operation centers, as well as client co-innovation centers, our collaboratories. A key measure of our progress is how well we're able to think globally, think locally and act on both levels simultaneously, which is essential for our largest clients.","We take exactly that approach in helping a global banking client that operates in over 50 countries become fully digital. We've been this client's business partner for more than a dozen years and we fully aligned our operating model to their business by bringing together global delivery, our digital practice areas and consulting along with regional engagement as well as specialized teams to enable the adoption of service transformation through cloud, automation and digitization.","As a result, we've had a transformative impact on our client. We serve them globally through our operation centers in seven countries. We're their strategic partner for implementing a core banking product platform, we provide end-to-end digital business, operations and technology services for their global asset management group. We've enabled the rollout of new customized applications for digitizing their private and retail banking platforms. And we support their global infrastructure of more than 1 million servers and databases and 0.5 million web applications.","Our global clients find this level of comprehensive global engagement compelling and differentiating. With our global foundation, which we continue to scale, we believe several of our non-U.S. markets could each become $1 billion businesses early in the next decade.","A third emphasis is on continuing to localize. In every large scale digital transformation a portion of the work needs to be done close to clients. Core to our localization efforts is our network of client delivery centers in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia.","A quick update on our progress in North America. We now have delivery facilities in over 20 states in the U.S. as well as multiple centers in Canada and Mexico, with plans to expand this network in 2019. We have centers that specialize in key technologies and industries with, for example, Dallas becoming our digital engineering hub, and Tampa focused on Financial Services and Healthcare. And some of our centers are designed to create dedicated educational and community partnerships to speed their development of talent that's specific to our client needs.","So to wrap up, we recently reached a major milestone, 20 years on NASDAQ, a sign of how far we've come and how much our business has grown and evolved over the past two decades. As the world's technology dependence increases and the definition of digital broadens to encompass new technologies, our market opportunity keeps expanding. We're successfully executing our strategic plan to accelerate Cognizant's shift to digital. Our business is solid and we remain confident that we can both invest for growth and achieve our financial targets.","And now over to Raj who will talk about how our industry segments performed in the quarter. Raj?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Over the last several years, we've been investing to diversify our business beyond Financial Services and Healthcare and expand our presence in new industries where we're building a range of digital capabilities for clients. A sign of how well our effort to diversify is working is that the company grew over 9% in the quarter, despite the underperformance of our largest industry segment, and three of our four industry segments delivered double-digit growth.","Let's take a closer look at how our verticals performed, starting with our Communications, Media and Technology, which had strong year-over-year growth of 15.8%. This performance came mostly from our Technology and Media clients and offset slower growth with our clients in the Communications industry, where consolidation and M&A activity are under way.","Among our Technology clients are a who's who of Silicon Valley marquee names. Their rapid growth is enabled in part by our ability to help accelerate digital-at-scale. These digital native leaders deal with billions of users and vast amounts of content, so they turn to us to help them efficiently monitor, verify and manage their ever-expanding volume of information and streamline and manage their ad operations.","For our Media clients, it's a similar story. We look to their strategy of using digital first approach to drive a differentiated customer experience across all their content. These clients seek our help to become digital businesses at the core. And we respond with solutions that span the full content life cycle from creation to consumption. We also provide marketing and advertising solutions that leverage their rich data capture across all their touch points to create personalized offerings in the new digital world.","Moving to Products and Resources, we increased revenue 12.4% year-over-year led by strong growth of our energy and utility clients. Within this segment, we've been stepping up investments in their energy and utility markets to the point where our clients now include 4 out of the top 6 oil and gas super majors, 7 of the top 10 U.S. utilities and 5 of the top 10 electric utilities in Europe. As an example of our energy sector work, we're building a data-driven digital organization for Australia's Endeavor Energy, which supplies electricity to more than 2.4 million people.","Endeavor called our business and SAP experts to design a feature-ready scalable SAP platform. With this new platform, Endeavor is transforming and automating their customer experience, their buying and selling of energy, and their core business processes such as procurement and supplier management. They're now able to deliver better services to their customers.","In manufacturing and logistics, our clients include 8 of the top 15 industrial manufacturers. Here, we continue to see strength in smart product development, industrial automation and investments focused on improving the customer experience and supply chain visibility.","In retail, our business saw modest continuing improvement as the industry maintains a focus on reducing costs in the face of consolidation and profitability pressures. That said, we do see signs of the retail industry picking up as clients work to enhance the customer experience they provide through a point of service applications and better execution of the in-store fulfillment processes. As a result, we are seeing increased demand of our automation solutions, IoT and supply chain optimization.","Now let's turn to banking and financial services, which grew 4.5% year-over-year. We continue to see strong growth among our insurance and mid-tier banking clients as they work to transform their business models, their distribution strategies and their customer interactions by investing significantly in advanced technologies.","In our insurance business, our strong growth was mostly the result of large multi-service deals. For one large insurer we helped design a data-focused strategy to drive customized financial wellness products for retirees. And for another insurer, we're implementing an omni-channel solution to improve the user experience, enhance cross-sell and up-sell capabilities.","Our mid-tier banking clients are also embracing modern IT infrastructures to seize the benefits of digital technologies. For example, we redesigned Bank Julius Baer's core systems, applications, business processes and customer interfaces to automate and simplify transactions as they modernize operations. With this modern infrastructure, the bank can more quickly expand its range of wealth management products and services while improving operational agility.","Now as we've discussed on prior calls, the story among our large money center banking clients remains mixed. On one hand, in today's positive business environment, some of our large banking clients are spending more on new technologies to transform their businesses. And since our digital revenue with the banking segments is seeing strong growth, we believe we're increasing our share of that change the bank is spending.","In fact, we won a number of large scale projects related to blockchain implementation, cloud migration and digital engineering. On the other hand, large banks continue to face increasing pressure on their run to bank spending. As you know, a substantial portion of our work for these large banks is focused on their core IT systems. That said, the strong growth of our banking related digital revenue is helping to offset some of the pressures. And, as our engagement continues to shift from legacy to digital work, we're beginning to see some of our large clients return to a growth phase. We are optimistic about this shift because banks have realized that they have no choice but to rewrite their futures with digital.","Now let's look at Healthcare, where revenue was up 10.1% year-over-year. Within our life science practice, we excel at helping biopharma and med tech companies transform their businesses. And that's why a large life science company has just engaged us to help transform every aspect of its global business. Cognizant is partnering with their IT organization to maintain, build and modernize their full application suite, which will touch nearly every process in the company, from finance, to manufacturing, to drug development.","In another part of our engagement within their core operations, we'll be helping deliver a substantial boost in their productivity through automation, enabled in part by installing more than 100 bots.","Within our Healthcare practice, let's turn to our opportunities in Medicare and Medicaid program servicing. The TMG transaction, which closed last year, has positioned Cognizant as one of the strongest processors of government healthcare programs. In fact, we now process claims and other mid and back office functions for a substantial portion of the Medicare and Medicaid covered lives in the U.S. Our government healthcare programs offered through TMG are positioned to capture continued growth in these segments. And we've added new clients to the TMG platform this quarter. Overall, the story of our industry segment is one of solid execution and continuing product growth.","Now, before I wrap up, I'd like to offer a few comments about our talent base. Given our knowledge-intensive work, we depend heavily on the insights, passion and collaboration of our global associates. And we invest substantially and continuously in their skills and development to maintain our relevance to clients. So, of course, we're unhappy to see our annualized attrition rate reach 22.6% this quarter, we attribute this attrition to three factors: First, global demand is increasing for the very skills we specialize in, at a time when the tech talent shortage is growing. Second, there's our company's ongoing transition as we continue to strengthen and simplify our operations. And third, as mentioned on prior calls, we've implemented more robust performance management over the past 18 months.","In light of these factors, our workforce strategy has several engagement and development programs underway. This includes the use of local delivery centers that Frank mentioned, which enable us to attract and retain highly skilled local talent who can serve multiple clients from a single location without having to relocate. What's more, we expect our regular annual pay increases, which take place in the third and fourth quarters, to help retain our highest performers.","Now, to be clear, Cognizant remains a magnet for top tier talent in the advanced digital technologies of greatest importance to our clients. And last week, Forbes named Cognizant to its Best Employers for Women 2018 rankings, where we made the top quartile of their list. The criteria included working conditions, diversity, pay equity, and how likely those surveyed, would recommend their employers to others. We're proud of this recognition.","Okay. To sum up, we've resolved to be our clients' go-to digital transformation partner and to that end, we will sustain the comprehensive building, investing and operational strengthening of our business.","Karen, over to you.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. Q2 performance was solid. Revenue of $4.01 billion, increased 9.2% year-over-year, including 100 basis points favorable impact from currency. Europe grew 19.2% year-over-year in Q2, including a 6.4% positive impact from currency. And the rest of world was up 3.8% from a year ago, including a 60-basis point negative impact from currency. Results in both the UK and Asia-Pacific were impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. While acquisitions like Netcentric and Mirabeau are further enhancing our digital leadership in Continental Europe, leading to a number of recent digital wins.","Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and the initial funding of the Cognizant U.S. Foundation, was 22%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19, exceeding our guidance primarily due to strong operating margin performance.","18 months ago, we announced a plan to return $3.4 billion to stockholders by the end of 2018 through a combination of $2.7 billion in stock repurchases and $700 million in dividends. With the anticipated Q3 completion of the accelerated share repurchase we previously announced on June 15th, we will deliver early on our share repurchase commitment.","And today, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on August 22. We are committed to maintaining a robust capital return program and anticipate having an update to the program in the coming quarters.","Now let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and technology services represented 57.1% of revenue and outsourcing services 42.9% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 6% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 13.6% from Q2 a year ago.","In the quarter, a large transformational project moved to steady state with a corresponding step-up of operations work. This resulted in a shift from consulting to outsourcing. Additionally, outsourcing growth benefited from the inclusion of our recent acquisition of Bolder Healthcare as well as large client wins such as TMG Health.","During the second quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts. Transaction-based contracts were approximately 11% of total revenue in the quarter, a 200-basis-point increase from Q1, as the EmblemHealth contract switched to a per-member-per-month pricing model.","We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as those with a potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 371.","And now moving to an update on margins, we remain committed to and are on track to achieve our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019. In the second quarter, we had strong margin performance as we continued to build on the improvements we've made in our business over the last 18 months, such as sustained higher levels of utilization, optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively.","Net of hedges, our Q2 margins also benefited from the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the prior-year quarter by 23 basis points.","The strong margin performance in Q2 has set us up nicely to absorb wage increases and promotions along with other investments in the business in the second half of the year while staying on track to achieve our non-GAAP operating margin target of approximately 21% this year.","Additionally, during the remainder of 2018, we intend to continue to improve our cost structure by further optimizing the higher end of our resource pyramid. As a result of these actions, we expect to incur $25 million to $35 million in severance costs. As we drive toward 22% non-GAAP operating margins in 2019, we also remain focused on affecting the mix shift within our business through focusing on higher value services, improving profitability within our portfolio of large, structured contracts and reassessing less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace.","Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. This balance, net of debt, was down by $685 million from December 31st, as we funded the acquisition of Bolder, the $900 million ASR and $100 million to the Cognizant U.S. Foundation with cash on hand. This balance at the end of the quarter includes restricted short-term investments of $419 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department.","We had strong cash generation in the quarter with cash flow from operations of $640 million, and free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow net of CapEx, was $549 million. Our outstanding debt balance was $749 million at the end of the quarter, and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver.","Before turning to guidance, I'd like to take a few minutes to provide some additional color on the change in the revenue recognition accounting standard we adopted in the first quarter. With the adoption of ASC 606, certain types of fixed bid contracts are recognized on a cost to cost basis versus our historic hours to hours or straight-line approach. The cost-to-cost approach results in more revenue during the early stages of a project for us and in more consistent margins over the life of a contract. While immaterial to our overall results for the year, we do expect to see some benefit from the adoption of the new standard on full-year revenue and operating margins.","Of the $52 million impact to revenue in the first six months of 2018, less than $10 million has come from existing contracts as of December 31, 2017. Substantially all of the impact has come from new contracts and modifications. The impact of ASC 606 can vary significantly based on the timing, nature of services, pricing structure or other terms and conditions of new contracts or modifications.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full-year 2018. For the full-year 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $16.05 billion to $16.3 billion, which represents growth of 8.4% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. Based on current exchange rates and the positive currency impact realized year-to-date, the full-year favorable revenue impact from currency is expected to be approximately 60 basis points versus the full-year 2017.","For the third quarter of 2018, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $4.06 billion to $4.1 billion. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $1.13. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 581 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%.","For the full-year 2018, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 21% and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $4.50. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 585 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%.","Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, realignment charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, any future adjustments to the one-time 2017 incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Reform Act and our initial contribution to the Cognizant U.S. Foundation. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment, including areas such as immigration or tax.","In summary, our solid execution in Q2, along with continued investment in the business, has positioned us well to deliver another solid year of revenue and earnings growth in 2018.","Operator, we can open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on the environment you're seeing with respect to financials and specifically, large banks. You talked about the continued pressure on the run-the-bank kind of spend but can you maybe give us \u2013 I think in your slides you talked about seeing some signs of incremental demand at some of the larger accounts. So can you maybe give us a sense about how firm that increased demand is, what kind of services you're seeing those from, and maybe any kind of color in terms of how fast that might develop?","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hey, Jim. This is Raj, here. Look, as we said, right, I mean I think the entire Financial Services story is a mix where insurance and the mid-tier banks are doing really well and where some of the challenges are is on these large money center banks. And I think when we drill in o the large money center banks, we're talking about a handful of clients. And the good news is it looks like our North American banks, the large ones, we are seeing a turnaround there.","And just to give you an example, one of our largest banking accounts went through that shift a couple of years ago, the technology shift. That's really changed. We're seeing very healthy growth at that relationship now and 40% of our work is around digital. And where the challenge still comes around is couple of our European-based accounts.","And I think, as we've said before, right, each one is on a different schedule in terms of shifting towards technology. We're making smart decisions as well too, in terms of making sure that the business that we're going after is profitable business and healthy business for us as well. So we're making some conscious decisions there is as well.","But I would tell you that in all of them we continue to grow in digital, they're all strategic partners. The banking revenue that we have in digital is consistent to the overall digital revenue that we have as a company. And I think we will get to \u2013 we've seen that we can deliver, we can transform these accounts. At these relationships, we impact the client, not only in the digital, but in the operations and their core technologies. So we're optimistic that those will also turn, but it's hard to predict when they will turn.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful color. Thanks. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, on the margin outlook, you kind of talked about the elevated attrition and what you're doing in terms of wage increases to offset that or get that back down. Maybe, Karen, can you address kind of how the back half margins will play out, both in terms of the cost reductions you're making at the top end of the pyramid, whatever increases you're making at the bottom end? And then whether ASC 606 is still going to be a margin tailwind in the back half?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Jim, as we said in the prepared remarks, obviously, we continue to target approximately 21% for non-GAAP operating margin, which, obviously, does suggest a reduction in the back half of the year. Typically, when we do raises and promotions, you'll see about a point \u2013 one to two points negative impact in the quarter. This year we've actually split the timing of the raises and the promotions, so we're currently \u2013 as we just announced, raises and promotions for the bottom half of the pyramid, for more the junior folks will happen in Q3; for the more senior folks that will happen in the Q4 timeframe. So you will see some bump down this quarter and then subsequently in the fourth quarter.","The margin benefit from ASC 606 is a little bit hard to predict. Obviously, as we've said, just given \u2013 it's hard to know the exact timing and specifics of contracts. But we don't expect it to have a material impact on the overall results for the rest of the year, but, certainly, we will see some pressure on margins because of raises and promotions as we get into the back half of the year. But we, obviously, are still committed to our approximately 21% target for the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. So good margin upside here, but it looks like revenue growth came in at the lower end of peers. So wanted to revisit how you're balancing your margin goals versus revenue growth. What level of revenue growth are you aiming for relative to your peers or the industry? I guess, what I'm trying to get at is how you're benchmarking revenue growth when setting your growth targets as you're going into executing the second half of your margin strategy.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Hey, Tien-Tsin. It's Frank. Look, I think revenue was right within the range we guided to for the quarter. So I don't see any \u2013 I don't ascribe sort of anything particularly significant to this quarter's revenue number. And I think we've said in general that as we execute this pivot and accelerate the shift to digital that our focus is on sort of balanced revenue growth. We certainly expect to grow in line with the overall industry.","As Raj said a minute ago, Raj made the comment in the context of Financial Services, but I think it's true across the business. We're being prudent about making choices of the kind of work we go offer. We're focused now on accelerating the shift to digital, focusing on higher margin work, higher value work \u2013 because that's the important work for our clients that has longevity. But I certainly expect to grow in line with the industry and continue to be confident that we can deliver the margin targets that we've laid out for you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Just wanted to follow up on the Q2 revenue coming in at the low end of the range, I guess what caused that number to come in towards the low end versus the high end when you gave guidance, I guess, three months ago?","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","I mean, Bryan, it's \u2013 the range is relatively small. Given our size and scale, I don't think there's anything specific, as I said, a minute ago, to point to timing of deals when they close, timing of revenue. I mean, there's just a number of things, given our size and scale the swing between the low and the middle or the high end of the range is just execution during the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the expanded disclosure. Much appreciated. My question is around BPO. You've talked about that the recent past as being a positive area. Could you sort of get us updated there and really sort of how you're being differentiated in that space? Thank you.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Ed, I'll start and then ask Karen and Raj, if they want to add anything to it. I think BPO or Digital Operations is \u2013 it's one of the faster growing parts of the business, had very strong sequential and year-over-year growth in the second quarter. The business, I would say is doing quite well and our differentiation comes from \u2013 we've said this all along but from the earliest days that we were in that business, our differentiation comes from the fact that we're able to really infuse technology into the operations. And I would say as digital has become a more prevalent set of technologies, our ability to drive real automation into the BPO business, into Digital Operations through things like robotic process automation and IPA and using artificial intelligence and so on and so forth, is really differentiating us.","So I think it's a combination of deep industry knowledge, which we've always had in our BPO business, so we're very vertically-focused, as you know, in that business, most of the BPO work we do is domain-centric, vertically-focused BPO. That's one part of it.","The second part of it is that we've got a \u2013 we've had a \u2013 continue to have a strong platform strategy in that business. So in Healthcare, with the TriZetto and Bolder and TMG, all come with strong platform assets. And then the third part of it is our ability to really drive strong automation using artificial intelligence, IPA, RPA types of technologies to drive productivity in that business. I think you put those three things together and we have a pretty unique position in that market.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah, the only thing I would add to that, Edward, is I think our BPO story has really expanded from the Financial Services and Healthcare and life sciences industry to now, we're very strong players in our \u2013 the Communication, Media and Technology space, we're providing lots of work to a lot of the leading digital companies out there. In addition to that you have a strong story that's being built out in our Products and Resources group as well too. So the BPO story has significantly expanded in terms of where it was a couple of years ago.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Maybe Karen, I had a question for you. As we look at your efforts to localize and optimize your labor pyramid, maybe could you comment on the current visa environment and what you're seeing with regard to company's willingness to offshore, particularly in what appears to be a more challenging visa environment? Are they more willing to balance where the work is done?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Brian, I don't think we've really seen any change from a clients' perspective. You've got some clients who are more willing, you've got other clients who prefer to keep more of the work on-site. So we really haven't seen any shift in behavior from a client perspective.","I think, as we've talked about and others have talked about in the market for some time now, there were certain types of work that clients are looking to do more on-site, some more agile development and so forth. And then when you're in a heavy transformation environment like we are today and a lot more consulting that tends to have a heavier on-site ratio. But overall, I wouldn't say that we've seen any changes in behavior from clients due to any of the immigration concerns.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan C. Bergin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Can you expand upon your efforts to drive more business within the Comm, Media, Tech and the Products and Resources vertical? Do you expect to continue to grow at these double-digit levels? And talk about how you're finding the M&A channel in those verticals. Thank you.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Bryan, I'll jump in and I'll let Frank add as well. Look, the Comm, Media and Technology is a segment that, if you recall not so long ago, we called it as others, but we've seen significant traction. We've been investing heavily into the space. I do think that at some point, right, some of the clients that we have that we're working with will become some of our largest clients for Cognizant. So I think we're making good progress in doing core technology work, digital operations and then helping in terms of \u2013 on the business side as well, too, so a healthy growth.","In terms of M&A, I don't think anything specific that we're focused on CMT, but I think we look at it in terms of broad, just in terms of all the practices, right? If there is a core technology that help expand those relationships, if there's key consulting capabilities that help us broaden and deepen our relationships at those clients, we'll \u2013 or if there's geographic plays or platform plays. So I think that's our approach with CMT as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a two-part question related to demand. One is, I mean, the demand commentary that you guys have seems to be certainly turning more positive, but when I look at specifically at the 2Q performance, 3Q guide relative to consensus, you're a bit light. And then there's a 4Q catch-up, it seems like. So I wanted to ask about the, sort of the visibility, if you will, into that 4Q catch-up to hit your revenue range.","And then the second part of the demand question is, if the ASC 606 accounting pronouncement had been active January 1st of last year, how much of a year-over-year net benefit would it have been? Because I think that's kind of important to size out. Thanks.","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So, Ashwin, it's Karen. I'll try and take those and others can chime in. But if you look at the 3Q guide, and let's just, for argument's sake, say you go to the middle of the range, that would suggest about a 1% sequential Q3 to Q4 growth. That's not unreasonable, I mean that's certainly \u2013 unless there's some unusual furloughs or anything like that. So I think the guidance for Q3 puts us right where we want to be for the full-year. We're not really expecting any significant acceleration in the fourth quarter.","And then in terms of ASC 606, I think really the only color we can give you is the way we've broken it out, which is that because of ASC 606, there's about $52 million of incremental revenue this year. As we said in my prepared remarks, we look at the contracts that existed at the end of last year. It's only about \u2013 it's less than a $10 million impact or benefit that we've received from that. It would be almost impossible to go back and redo all the prior-year contracts, so we really just have to look at it based on the current year results and the benefit that we've gotten, which is primarily due to contracts that have been awarded this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering, has the mix or the service offerings within digital shifted. And how do you balance the need for investments in digital versus the cost-cutting initiatives? Thanks.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah, I don't think \u2013 Joe, it's Frank, I don't think there are sort of quarter-to-quarter meaningful shifts in the digital mix. Of course, as I've said, if you take a longer term perspective, the definition of digital and what constitutes digital has changed dramatically, if you look over, let's say, a five-year period. Five, seven years ago we were talking about social and mobile and analytics and cloud as being the constituent components of digital. Today we're talking more about \u2013 in addition to those things, we include artificial intelligence and blockchain and so on and so forth added to manufacturing. All of these new things that are \u2013 so the definition of digital certainly is expanding as innovation happens and new things, new technologies emerge. So over longer period, yeah, certainly, the mix, if you will, changes. But quarter-to-quarter, I don't think there's a significant mix shift.","And look, I think we're managing margin and investment the way we always have, which is we have a process for thinking about or analyzing the investments that we have, that we'd like to make, that we'd like to allocate capital to. We run the business and as we \u2013 we run the business and every quarter or so, every 60, 90 days, we look at our list of investments, say what investments do you want to? We stagger the investments. We say what investments we want to make this quarter or during this period. We release those dollars and that's how we balance margin and making the investments. That's just an ongoing process.","We've tightened up that process. It's a muscle that we've had in the past. I think we've strengthened that muscle over the last 18, 24 months. I think that's good healthy capital allocation discipline that we have developed \u2013 have had in the past and continue to develop in the company. And I think that's how we look at things quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month, and figure out where to allocate our dollars against the investments that we think are going to have either the most growth return or the most strategic return over a longer period of time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Singh - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. This is actually Amit Singh. Just quickly going back to ASC 606 and the first part is, for your second quarter results, you have benefit on the top-line and bottom-line in margin from ASC 606. How much of that was in the guidance that you provided last quarter? The only thing I'm trying to understand is if you remove the $31 million and if it was not in the guidance then your revenues came in below the guidance range.","And then the second part is, for the full-year, I'm trying to understand what does immaterial mean? Does that mean close to zero? And would that mean in the second half of the year now the ASC would be actually a negative to revenue, margins and EPS in the second half of fiscal 2018?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. So I think, one, if we go back to Q2, right, so when we gave our Q2 guidance, obviously, that was the beginning of May. So we had a pretty good handle on what contracts we're starting and the impact of any contracts, so it was included in our guidance, both from a revenue and a margin perspective. And you can't really break it out because going back to Frank's prior comments, right, we really look at the business on an annual, monthly, quarterly and a semi-annual basis to really look at where do we think margins are going to land, what investments can we make. And we make investments to adjust to the revenue growth and the margin trajectory for the company. So you can't just pull out ASC 606 in isolation because we would have made other trade-offs if not for that. So I don't think you can look it at that way.","And when we look at the full-year basis, I mean, keep in mind, even at the bottom end of our range, we're over $16 billion of revenue on a full-year basis. So 1% of revenue is $160 million, and we certainly don't expect the ASC 606 revenue impact to be even that large. So at a company level, it's not material for the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Raj, in your commentary, you mentioned something in the context of focusing on high growth and high margin accounts. Are we in the process of pruning some of those that are not kind of qualifying within the criteria and that could potentially impact or cap top-line growth down the road, i.e. you guys are focusing on some of the better opportunities out there and obviously they'll be important in the context of top-line growth down the road. Thanks.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. So, look, the answer is definitely yes, right? I mean, we made a commitment to you that we were going to go focus, shift our business towards more high-value added digital work and add healthy margins. And we are being smart and making sure that we're \u2013 the work that we're doing is strategic to our clients and presents a long-term healthy growth, healthy margin opportunities for us, so answer is yes. If there are some work that we feel that doesn't present \u2013 meet that criteria, we have chosen to walk away from.","Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. Moshe, I would say \u2013 it's Frank. I would just add to that. I think the choices are less at the overall client level, although we may do that as well, but more what kind of work within a client we choose to focus our energy and resources on. I would say that if you think in the long run, there're two points I'd make. One is I don't think that the constraint to our business in the long run will be demand. There's lots of demand for technology out there. So it's the smart move to pick your battles carefully and focus on the work that you think is going to be most strategically significant to the client over the long run.","And at some level our constraint is where do you deploy your talent and so we're thinking carefully about how we develop our talent, how do we train them for the next generation and the next generation of work after that. And then how do we deploy that talent against the work that's going to be most meaningful to them, give them the most rewarding careers, help them to be most successful over the long run. So I don't \u2013 even though we are making very thoughtful choices about the kind of work we go after, I don't think the conclusion of that should be that it slows revenue growth in the long run, because I think there's lots of revenue opportunity within the high growth and the strategic high value margin, things that \u2013 areas of the business that we want to go emphasize.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph A. Vafi - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Maybe Raj, if you could \u2013 I don't know if you could answer this or not. But on those financial services clients where there is a mix headwind, is there a way to perhaps predict when we kind of get over that hump on the headwind? I know there's different clients and different schedules, but is it something that we can overcome exiting 2018 or do you think it potentially lingers into next year? Thanks.","Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. So, hi, Joseph. It is hard to predict because each client is different, they're all going through various business scenarios in terms of how they're leveraging technology. But I think one thing that is definitely there, right, all of them realize that it's important to invest in digital. I think \u2013 so I do think that we have the winning formula because I think one of the key strengths that we have is because the size and nature of the work that we do there for these clients, impacting lots of the digital work we're doing, the operations and technology and having the strong domain expertise that we have at the clients, I think they all view us as a strategic partner. And I do expect that as more of our mix shifts towards digital, just like it has in North America, that we'll continue to excel at those accounts as well, but it's hard to predict the exact timeframe because each one of those accounts has a different business scenario going on.","David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Yeah. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Harshita Rawat with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Harshita Rawat - AllianceBernstein L.P.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I have a question on Healthcare revenue growth. It looks like the year-over-year organic revenue growth was very weak, once you adjust for acquisitions. So my question is what's driving the deceleration? And what's the path to achieving mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth in that business?","Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","So \u2013 and really the only inorganic revenue in Healthcare was Bolder, which we acquired in April. TMG is actually \u2013 is a client win that's not an acquisition. So that is organic revenue growth. So I think on a year-over-year basis, the practice grew about 10%, if you back out the Bolder. That was a small piece of it in the quarter, less than $40 million of revenue in the quarter. So I think we continue to see strong growth in Healthcare.","I actually think the comps for Healthcare will get more challenging in the back half of the year because we'll start to lap TMG in Q3 and we don't have another large deal. So if you recall, in 2016, we had the Emblem deal, which started in Q3 of 2016. Last year, we had the TMG contract, which started in Q3. There is not currently another very large platform deal slated to begin this year. So the comps will get a little bit tougher because of that. But outside of that, we continue to see nice strong healthy growth in Healthcare.","David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.","Perfect. With that, I think we'll wrap up. I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and for your questions. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations at Cognizant. Please go ahead.","Katie Royce","Thank you, Jeremy, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.","Brian Humphries","Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining. Earlier today, we announced results for our second quarter. Q2 revenue grew 4.7% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.14 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.94. While we are pleased that we met our revenue and margin guidance, we are not satisfied with this level of performance. Our second quarter results do not reflect what Cognizant is capable of achieving in this market environment, neither on revenue growth nor margin rate. So as we said about correcting these trends, I'm convinced that a large part of what we need to do is in our own control. ","Softness in Banking and Financial Services, which was up 1.7% year-over-year in constant currency, and Healthcare, which was down 1.5% in constant currency, impacted second quarter revenue growth. While certain market dynamics have impacted our results, I believe that much of our weakness in Banking and in the non-Life Sciences portion of Healthcare is attributable to Cognizant-specific issues. ","My interaction with clients in both industries underline that they are committed to investing in innovation to help increase their competitiveness and growth. Specific to our banking practice, we've recently implemented a new operating model, which includes a team solely focused on new logos, a team dedicated to the platinum accounts which are a subset of our largest global clients and a banking practice and solutions team to ensure we develop more compelling thought leadership and better align the key partners.","In Healthcare, factors such as the in-sourcing of a large health care payer client and the spending pullback by clients that are in the midst of merger integration impacted our performance in the quarter. Fundamental market changes are reshaping health care requiring our clients to do more with less and get ahead of regulatory compliance and complexity while dealing with cyber threats and privacy concerns. We have a market-leading position in Healthcare and a position of considerable strength upon which to build. ","I believe industry specialization would be more important than ever with this shift to digital and hence, expect to be spending a great deal of time with our Healthcare business and clients to ensure we turn around this prized asset. Over the past three months, we've changed the leaders of both Banking and Healthcare to get a fresh perspective, new energy and even greater customer focus. On a positive note, we delivered double-digit growth in Products and Resources and in Communications, Media and Technology. I continue to be pleased with our momentum in international markets. Our global growth markets region, which encompasses our non-North America operations, surpassed the $1 billion run rate for the first time in our history. We intend to invest in our international business, which should continue to be a growth driver for Cognizant.","Later in the call, Karen will take you through the details of the quarter, including segment commentary. As you know, I assumed the role of CEO on April 1. Since then, I have significantly deepened my knowledge of the company whilst reviewing the market opportunity, structure and competitive dynamics. Over the last 18 weeks, I've met with more than 100 clients and partners across three continents and conducted over 60 deep-dive strategic and operational reviews of the company. ","I've actively solicited client input on our strategy and the strength of our commercial and delivery teams. I've also spent a great deal of time considering customer needs and buying behavior, our brand position, our business strategy, the effectiveness of our organizational structure, our operating discipline, our portfolio of solutions and indeed, our talent and culture. ","It is clear to me that Cognizant has a proud heritage, significant customer loyalty, a broad portfolio of offerings and engaged and talented associates throughout the world. However, we can position ourselves better to participate in the market opportunity, and this work includes: refining our strategic posture and associated enablers to ensure we better participate in the categories that are most relevant to our clients' needs; developing greater thought leadership and an innovation agenda by industry vertical; accelerating investments in revenue growth, including increased sales and marketing, targeted innovation and enhanced partnerships; significantly lowering our cost structure to facilitate these investments in growth and to ensure we are more cost competitive in deals; and ensuring greater operational discipline and a more performance-based culture to make certain we execute with rigor and focus.","Our path to accelerated growth starts with customers, the lifeblood of every company. It is important that we ready ourselves to address the pricing demands of customers in our traditional areas of strength whilst readying ourselves also for the changing dynamics in digital. Given advances in technology, customers regardless of their industry vertical are faced with an unprecedented pace of change and risk of disruption. Against this backdrop, they are focused on modernizing their environments, extracting value from data, better understanding their own customers and accelerating innovation and cloud migration to increase their competitiveness, security and agility. ","As investments are shifted to digital, budgets in the legacy are pressured with increased focus on cost reduction during renewals. Given our traditional business mix, Cognizant has been exposed to this headwind. We partially offset this via -- through mid-management, automation and other delivery efficiency levers. In addition, given our strong customer NPS, we have often been able to provide incremental savings to clients by consolidating the work of other vendors.","While these strategies may be effective in the short term, we need to significantly accelerate our shift to digital as we consider our intermediate and longer-term future. The pivot to digital requires us to rethink many aspects of our company, including our brands, skills, processes, systems and tools. Client engagements will become more project-oriented, meaning more contracts with lower TCV. Our account teams will need to build relationships with the broader C-suite as budget owners, decision-makers and influencers extend well beyond the CIO.","And we will need more consultative selling skills, more digital talents, more targeted sales compensation programs and more intellectual property and thought leadership aligned by industry vertical. Delivery will be increasingly agile with near and onshore delivery complementing offshore centers. The skills of our associates and our leadership team must further evolve. This is a multiyear transition that is essential to our future.","Against this backdrop, customers are choosing their strategic partners. So as we more readily embrace digital, we must ensure our client-facing resources and our branding represent our strategic ambition. Meanwhile, we need to be even more deliberate in our solutions portfolio, which includes increasing our investment in areas that provide the greatest value to clients while generating the best return for Cognizant. This requires a rigorous capital framework to accelerate our position in emerging categories whilst reducing our cost structure in mature and declining categories.","We have a strong foundation to build from in some of the growth categories. One such example and one I'm extremely excited about is digital engineering. This is a large, attractive market with 20%-plus growth rates. To accelerate our position in this market, we have recently decided to combine Cognizant's digital engineering capabilities with Cognizant's Softvision. Until now, our assets have been distributed across Cognizant, and our structure and operating model have been fragmented and inconsistent. This combined practice with over 11,000 associates and revenue of approximately $800 million would provide a powerful combination of software product development and application modernization services to clients across the globe.","I believe that our focused efforts will ensure greater brand recognition in this important category and allow us to do more meaningful -- more meaningfully participate in the market opportunity. Our increased focus in digital engineering reflects the market opportunity before us and the growing needs from our clients to achieve top line growth, improve customer engagement through superior experience and boost productivity at an accelerated pace. With this combined practice, we will bring together current and emerging technologies, scale cross-functional teams and innovate talent and delivery methods into a single product-centric operating model.","We are building the digital culture into our operating model that influences how our clients conceive, design, engineer and shift digital projects at speed. At the same time, we are leveraging decades of experience and expertise in our clients' technology stack to produce a cloud-ready architecture.","We will finalize our strategic positioning in the coming weeks. However, as we enable our customers to disrupt and innovate the modern, scalable, agile, data-enabled and future-proof architectures, it is clear that we should further accelerate our investments in digital engineering, cloud and IoT. And we must strengthen our partnerships with industry leaders to buttress our own capabilities. That being said, this is not a strategic overhaul but rather a refinement of the strategic positioning, our capital allocation and the enablers critical to execute our strategy.","Against this strategic backdrop, we need to determine the necessary steps to be taken to unlock Cognizant's growth potential. For this reason, we have established a transformation office, which is charged with reviewing six areas of focus as follows: strategic choices, which include where we want to make strategic bets to better expose us to growth categories; organizational structure, which includes our operating model, our matrix and roles and responsibilities within this; talent, which includes attracting, developing and retaining talent, our culture, our compensation structures and our skills; delivery transformation, which includes optimizing our unit cost of delivery across a global delivery model; sales force transformation, which includes compensation plans, customer segmentation, increased partnerships, sales coverage ratios and consultative selling; and finally, fit for growth, which aims to ensure we have the cost structure, processes and tools to facilitate growth. Each work stream is led by a member of our executive committee. It's cross-functional in nature and is set against a comprehensive change management and communications framework. ","We've made significant progress in a short period of time. I'm personally excited about the findings of the transformation office, which underlines to me that we can meaningfully change our competitiveness in this market. We've identified opportunities to sharpen our strategic focus, simplify the organization, clarify roles and responsibilities, empower our teams closer to the customer and free up investments in growth by significantly reducing our cost structure.","But we have more work to do in the weeks ahead, including internal change management and communications to maximize associate engagement. We expect to outline the details of this program, including the execution plan and associated restructuring charges, on the third quarter earnings call.","Happy customers feed the first line of the income statement, so as we aim to accelerate our revenue growth, I want to lead by example by striving to be in front of customers every single day. I've asked for greater innovation and growth focus from our executives and have made some changes in the leadership team, both external hires and indeed internal promotions. Meanwhile, to ensure our senior leaders get closer to our customers and our frontline operations, we've initiated a process to optimize our spans and layers. This has the added benefit of speeding up decision-making, improving communication and reducing costs.","Growth also requires investments in sales coverage, targeted M&A and a competitive cost structure. Therefore, even ahead of the execution of the conclusions of the transformation office, we have moved on a number of things, including: the acquisition of Zenith Technologies, which expands Cognizant's IoT portfolio and extends our Life Sciences domain expertise by enabling us to become a single-source provider of end-to-end smart factory capabilities, a key growth driver in Industry 4.0; the separation of Digital Systems & Technology, one of our three service lines, from our delivery organization to increase focus on that service line; the establishment under one leader of an end-to-end delivery organization aimed at dramatically reducing our unit cost of delivery whilst optimizing delivery KPIs; and the approval to hire 500-plus revenue-generating associates over the coming quarters, a combination of customer-facing and sales support professionals, will help us expand existing accounts as we generate new ones.","Finally, we need to drive more of a performance culture in our client teams. Therefore, we will overhaul our sales commission plans for the new fiscal year, ensuring that we can better attract, retain and reward top performers. The new plans will have a greater mix of variable compensation, ensuring greater meritocracy and better align our overall incentives with the company's strategic direction. ","The growth mandate is now starting to permeate the entire company, informing our big decisions and investments and beginning to reshape the critical behaviors of our employees. As we focus on growth, we've also made some operational and cost structure decisions that Karen will address later in the call. This will help our cost structure in the second half, even ahead of the full conclusions of the transformation office.","Cognizant is a vast organization, brimming with talent. In a time of change, we must engage the winning spirit of our 290,000 associates to get back to the basics that resulted in our long record of success. Leaders are key in transitions. For our most talented leaders who are at the director level and above, we recently implemented a retention program to let them know how valued they are and how committed we are to their continued career growth with us. ","Communication is more important than ever right now, so in recent months, we've also greatly increased communication to our associates. We've stressed that growth is our number one priority and provide a context on which -- on what is needed for us to return to growth. I personally am spending a lot of time meeting with associates, reminding them of our tremendous assets and great heritage that we're building on and the substantial market opportunity in front of us.","Let me wrap up by saying that I now have a much clearer understanding of the market opportunity, which is meaningful, and Cognizant's opportunities and challenges against this backdrop. While we've taken some tactical decisions in the last three months on cost and growth, the true potential of Cognizant and the extent of the work to be done on costs and transformation in the quarters ahead is becoming apparent via the transformation office. The opportunity teed up from the output of these work streams gives me reason to be optimistic. I see plenty of opportunities to take cost out of the business, to invest in growth and to improve our working capital. We will spend more time on this in the third quarter earnings call.","I've covered a lot of ground so let me quickly underscore the five focal points of our work: refining our strategic posture; developing greater thought leadership and an innovation agenda by industry sector; accelerating investments in growth; significantly lowering our cost structure; and ensuring greater operational discipline and a more performance-based culture.","While there is a lot of work to be done to ensure Cognizant returns to its historical levels of performance, I can assure you that our team is up for the challenge and looking forward to winning again. With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen, who will give you an update on both our operational and financial performance as well as a view on how we see the balance of the year. Karen?","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $4.14 billion was at the high end of our guided range and represented growth of 3.4% year-over-year or 4.7% in constant currency. Digital revenue growth accelerated from previous quarters to the mid-20% range and now contributes approximately 35% of our total revenue.","Moving to the industry verticals where overall company performance continues to be impacted by both Financial Services and Healthcare. Financial Services growth was up 1.7% in constant currency, driven by modest improvement in Banking primarily from the contribution of the previously announced partnership with three Finnish financial institutions to transform and operate a shared core banking platform. In insurance, growth continued to be sluggish as delays in decision-making impacted the start of new work from projects in the pipeline. We anticipate some improvement in insurance in Q3 with the ramp-up of several of these projects.","In Banking, we continue to see softness at a few of our largest banking clients and a cautious approach to spend with several of our regional banking clients in North America that were impacted by M&A activity. Consistent with recent trends, two of our Top 5 banking clients continue to show good growth while spend at the other three clients remains under pressure.","We anticipate some cautiousness in overall levels of spend in the banking sector in the second half of the year due to weakness in capital markets across banking, M&A activity with the U.S. regional banks and weak macro factors. Moving on to Healthcare, which declined 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Within our Healthcare vertical, the decline with our payer clients was largely the result of several large clients involved in mergers as well as the accelerated movement of some work to a captive at a large client. We continue the ramp-down of an account in which we were a subcontractor to a third party, also continue to negatively impact revenue. While the ramp-down of the work is largely complete, we expect some continued year-over-year revenue impact in Q3 and a minimal impact in Q4.","For our payer client, moving work to a captive and those involved in mergers, we expect the second half of the year to stabilize near Q2 levels. We continue to expect that there will be meaningful future revenue opportunity associated with integration work that typically follows a merger. Life Sciences had another quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year. We are seeing good traction with digital operation services, managing pharmacovigilance cases globally, large enterprise transformation deals and momentum with our industry-specific platforms such as the shared investigator portal for clinical trials. And as Brian mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Zenith Technologies earlier this week. ","Products and Resources had another strong quarter, showing 12.3% growth year-over-year in constant currency. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. We saw continued positive momentum in retail where we have well above the company average mix of digital revenue in our largest clients. And we continue to see strength in cloud and digital engineering services and increased demand for interactive, IoT and analytics solutions across clients.","Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 14.1% in constant currency. Technology saw double-digit growth, driven primarily by our digital content services and solutions. Through our acquisition of Softvision, we are also seeing good traction for digital engineering solutions with our technology clients. Within Communications and Media, growth was negatively impacted by spending reductions in a few large clients. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect to see some slowdown in the year-over-year growth rate of the technology vertical as we start to lap the significant ramp-up of the digital operations work with several large clients. We expect this to be partially offset by improvements in Communications and Media.","Now moving on to the geographies. Europe grew 14.2% year-over-year in constant currency. In both the U.K. and Continental Europe, we saw strength in Life Sciences. And while a few of our larger banking relationships in Europe remained under pressure, we did see good growth from several of our newer logos including the partnership with the three Finnish financial institutions. ","Additionally, in the U.K., we saw strength in Products and Resources. The rest of the world grew 6.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Results in Asia Pacific continued to be negatively impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. We saw double-digit growth within insurance, manufacturing and logistics and Life Sciences clients in the region as well as good traction with winning work with a number of new clients.","Shifting now to margins. Our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 14.9% and $0.90, respectively. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes realignment charges, was 16.1%, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.94 in the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was in line with our expectations but down approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. ","While year-over-year headcount growth slowed from the prior two quarters, the year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily due to costs related to the headcount growth of 7% outpacing constant currency revenue growth of 4.7% in the quarter; and the impact of contract renegotiations with recently merged Healthcare clients, which negatively impacted operating margins by 320 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively.","Revenue and headcount in digital operations continue to grow above company average, and we saw a slight increase in the on-site mix at senior levels for the organization. This was partially offset by lower incentive and stock-based compensation. The lower segment operating margins in our Communications, Media and Technology segment reflects the growth of digital content services and solutions in this segment, which generate lower margins than other services in the portfolio. ","For the remainder of 2019, we expect margins to improve as we align our cost structure with our revenue expectations. While we expect to be in a better position to discuss our longer-term view of margins in the coming quarters, there are several areas that we can and will address in the second half of the year to allow us to reduce costs to reinvest in areas to drive growth, including attracting and retaining the best talent and expanding our portfolio of digital solutions.","Even ahead of the conclusion of a broader benchmarking exercise, in the second quarter, we took targeted actions at the senior levels of our pyramid to simplify our organization structure. These actions are expected to result in $65 million of annualized savings with approximately half of that to be realized in the remainder of 2019. In Q3 and Q4, we expect to further reduce overall costs through a number of actions, including aligning headcount growth with revenue growth by further slowing the pace of hiring and being thoughtful on where we backfill attrition. Headcount growth on a full year basis will align to our full year constant currency revenue guidance.","We will have greater discipline on capturing improved pricing levers, more closely aligning promotions and wage increases with bill rate adjustments; more rigor around redeploying unbilled resources in our accounts, and we will continue to optimize our pyramid by adjusting our spans of control. And we will have enhanced oversight regarding our use of subcontractors and the balance between subcontractors and full-time associates. We will also have significantly tighter control of areas within SG&A such as disciplined hiring of non-billable resources, further rationalization of our real estate portfolio, tighter control over T&E including significantly reduced travel for internal and other nonclient-facing meetings, limiting business-class travels, relocations, et cetera, and only investing in marketing events that will provide an appropriate rate of return. These actions will help fund our continued investment in areas that support revenue growth. Additionally, the shift to higher-value services such as digital will continue to support higher margins. ","From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate of 23% was up from 19% in Q4 but flat versus the prior year quarter. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and management such as the announced retention program to recognize and retain our best talent. We expect to incur an additional $48 million of compensation-related costs during the remainder of 2019 for this program.","Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy. We have finished the quarter with $3 billion of cash and short-term investments, down $1.5 billion from December 31, 2018. This decrease is largely due to the $1.8 billion of share repurchases completed year-to-date under our stock repurchase program, including over $1 billion of repurchases in the second quarter. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $429 million related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department.","We generated $479 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Additionally, we had an uptick of DSO of 3 days compared to Q2 2018, which negatively impacted free cash flow by $135 million. Approximately half of the DSO increase was due to unbilled receivables related to the billing construct of certain long-term contracts. We believe that we have the opportunity to improve our cash conversion and are initiating a working capital program that we expect will improve free cash flow by several hundred million dollars in the coming quarters.","Our outstanding debt balance was $746 million at the end of the quarter. There was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the second quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 18.7 million shares for approximately $1 billion, and our diluted share count decreased to 564 million shares for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased over 28 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. We have $738 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","For our cash generated from operations, remaining cash on the balance sheet and our revolving credit facility, we continue to have access to plenty of liquidity to fund both capital return and acquisitions. ","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year 2019. For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 3.9% to 4.9% year-over-year or $16.75 billion to $16.9 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth within the range of 2.8% to 3.8% or $16.57 billion to $16.73 billion, reflecting our assumption of a negative 110 basis points for foreign exchange for the full year compared to an assumption of a negative 90 basis points in our prior guidance. This guidance continues to reflect the muted outlook for Banking and Healthcare.","For the third quarter of 2019, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the range of 3.8% to 4.8% year-over-year or $4.23 billion to $4.27 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth in the range of 2.9% to 3.9% year-over-year or $4.2 billion to $4.24 billion, reflecting our assumption of a negative 90 basis points for foreign exchange for the third quarter. For the full year 2019, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 17%. Based on the actions taken in Q2 and prospective cost alignment actions for the remainder of the year, we anticipate adjusted operating margins of approximately 18% in both Q3 and Q4. ","We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.92 to $3.98, an increase from our previous guidance of $3.87 to $3.95, primarily reflecting a lower share count assumption based on the stepped-up repurchases completed in the second quarter and the contribution incentive. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 562 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes realignment charges and other unusual items, if any, net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses; clarification, if any, by the Indian government as to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India-defined contribution obligations; and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment, including areas such as immigration and tax.","With that, we can open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.","Keith Bachman","And welcome again, Brian, your first quarter under ownership, so to speak. And my question is going to be directed towards you. If -- there's a lot of moving parts, it sounds like, both on how I think about the offense of trying to chase revenues while at the same time trying to balance costs. And so we have your margin targets for the year, but just philosophically, how should we be thinking about these two goals of trying to really nurture the revenue line while at the same time trying to optimize the cost structure? How should investors be thinking about this over the course of this longer journey?","Brian Humphries","Keith, well, I mean, the first thing I'll say is I do not believe they're mutually exclusive, but let me start first with revenue and then I'll spend some time on costs. We grew, as you know, 4.7% this quarter in constant currency. Within that construct, I would say we had very muted performance in two of our larger segments, Banking and Financial Services and indeed Healthcare, which represents 63% of the business. So one of the first things we have to do to get back to a stronger growth performance is to actually help turn those businesses around, just the law of numbers becomes meaningful. ","On top of that, I think we are at the stage now of investing more in growth, changing the dialogue internally, prioritizing growth. As you've seen, we have approved, at this moment in time, and I believe over time we will add to this number, over 500 revenue-generating resources or revenue support resources. So the inclination is to get back to what we've always done, which has been to focus on client centricity and revenue growth.","Now cost is, of course, and strategy is important to revenue growth. First of all, what are our strategic postures, how are we exposed to faster-growing categories of the market, which are both technology categories such as digital engineering, our way of working, IoT, cloud, as well as geographic categories. And that's why I'm pleased to see the continued momentum we have in the global growth markets, which is our non-North America region.","Costs, however, are important to growth because you need to have a very efficient and disciplined cost base to be able to take pricing in the deals, to be able to absorb the renewals, pricing pressure that we are seeing in our traditional business as well as being able to invest in the future. I talked in my prepared remarks around the importance of pivoting to digital and the associated parameters of that, smaller TCV contracts, more contracts, a different delivery model, et cetera. ","We also need to invest in people, in M&A and indeed in the brand to make sure that we are more associated not just with the area of the business where we are loved by customers but also with the pivot to digital. Many of these areas are, as you know, key to our constrained assets, both M&A targets as well as even just getting digital resources into the company.","But I will say, I'm four months in at this stage. Having interrogated the data for four months and having spent a great deal of time in the transformation office, I see huge opportunity here on revenue growth and indeed on costs. I'm not going to get into a guidance discussion today around next fiscal year or indeed a multi-year view. But at this moment in time, this, from my perspective, is something that I only see opportunity in, to improve our performance from today's performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Glad to see a lot of heavy buybacks, well done there. Just wanted to ask actually on gross margins. Looks like it's the lowest level we've seen in some time. What's driving this? I heard the Healthcare renegotiations. I'm not sure if that was related there. Maybe any comments on pricing, contract execution, that kind of thing and maybe any outlook on gross margin.","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. So Tien-Tsin, it's Karen. It's really two factors, one of which is the Healthcare renegotiations that you talked about, about a 40 basis point impact in the fall in gross margin and then also the fact that headcount continued to grow faster than revenue in the quarter. Part of that is our digital operations business, which is growing considerably faster than headcount -- than, sorry, company revenue at this point. ","Headcount grew in line with the revenue growth digital operations, but you know that does come at a typically lower gross margin than the IT business. But overall, headcount for the rest of the business did grow faster in revenue, and the vast majority of that cost is sitting in gross margin. And that is obviously one of the things that as we continue to focus on tackling the cost of delivery to the organization, we will be looking to optimize in the coming months and quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson.","Lisa Ellis","Brian, as you're thinking about your overall strategic plan, can you provide a little bit more color on how your -- you believed you guys should be tackling the deterioration in Cognizant's traditional services, meaning shifting away from or reaccelerating, or whatever the right answer is, those more traditional legacy pieces of the business, which just at an industry level, maybe flat or even in structural decline. That strikes me as one of the trickier aspects things to navigate through here.","Brian Humphries","Yes. It's a good question because we have strength in our existing customer base, and if you look at the Pareto, we have very strong positions and are highly concentrated in a set of customers but we need to pivot more to digital. As we are pivoting to digital, as I said, there are different characteristics of the deals, of the skill sets we need, of the delivery models, of the buying decision makers, if you will, on behalf of the customers. And this is an area that we definitely want to invest into the next S curve and make sure we are, from a capital allocation point of view, really prioritizing that. ","Now in the more traditional businesses, some of them actually give us a foothold into the new application modernization, we'll go hand-in-glove as I said, with the digital engineering space as we start thinking about cloud-native applications. But in a broader sense of the word, Lisa, I'm a big believer in drawing hard decisions across your portfolio and trying to understand where you need to be extremely disciplined from an investment and from a cost structure point of view in terms of optimizing legacy whilst investing in the new. And those are disciplines we need to obviously continue to drive here in Cognizant as we're investing in some of these newer growth categories that should accelerate our CAGR growth.","You have seen in the last quarter, we have aggregated all of delivery under one leader. Previously, delivery was fragmented through a number of leaders in the company. And part of the task of that delivery leader is ultimately to drive a much more aggressive stance in terms of how we think about automation and tooling and putting ourselves in a position that we can be what I would term fit for growth in the legacy as well as the broader company. So optimizing the cost structure, in particular, for the legacy and freeing up capital to invest in the new categories, which should be a growth driver for Cognizant going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ed Caso from Wells Fargo.","Edward Caso","Can you talk a little bit about your capital deployment strategies from this space? Obviously, you deployed a lot of capital for repurchase. Where does M&A fit into the equation sort of order of magnitude? And is there more share repurchase to be done in the near term?","Brian Humphries","I'll touch on this and Karen can jump in as well. Look, we saw the opportunity to accelerate share repurchases in the last quarter as an opportunistic situation for us and we took advantage of that. And I have no issues continuing to do so if needed. ","From an M&A point of view, I have rejected some M&A and I have approved some M&A in the last four months. So we would look at that as a means to execute our strategy. We're pleased to have acquired Zenith Technologies, which closed most recently. And obviously, we're using M&A as a means to an end. It is not a strategy, it's a means to execute a strategy. Our priority right now is continuing to refine our strategic posture and making sure, to the prior question, we get our capital allocation correct. But we will look upon M&A as something that we will use to execute our strategy going forward. My emphasis at this moment in time continues to be tuck-in acquisitions that strategically align us to even better our competitive positioning in the market that we deem most relevant to us going forward.","Karen McLoughlin","And I think, Ed, it's Karen. Obviously, the guidance for the share count does not assume any more buybacks for the rest of the year. As Brian said, we will continue to look at that opportunistically. But as you know, we have far exceeded our initial expectations for this year in line with this framework we outlined last year at Investor Day where we said we expect to spend on average 25% of our global free cash flow towards buybacks, 25% towards dividends and 25% for acquisitions with the rest going to India. At this point, there are no changes to that framework. If and when there are, we will obviously update accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen and Company.","Bryan Bergin","Brian, can you give us a sense on just your view of the time frame of what you think it's going to take for Cognizant to address the company-specific issues that you noted in the your -- in the core verticals there? And in the transformation office work streams, has this already been set up and that's in progress? Or is this now to come in 3Q and 4Q?","Brian Humphries","No. The transformation office was set up probably almost three months ago at this stage, to be honest. It consists of six work streams, as I said, each is led by one of our executive committee members. Each one has a steering committee and indeed a working committee below that. We've been very clear in outlining suppositions that I want us to backsolve to and expected outcomes, and as part of that, some short-term wins along the way. ","So we've been also very deliberate, Bryan, in terms of the composition of the teams, making sure we have people that are cross-functional in nature, people who understand the markets both in North America and internationally, people that understand delivery as well as the market-facing commercial teams. I really feel very, very enthused from the output of the work. We've been working extremely hard on that, but it gives me nothing but optimism that there's a huge opportunity for us to free up capital to invest in growth to simplify the organizational structure, clarify roles and responsibilities and ultimately to make us much more successful in the market by accelerating revenue growth and having better solutions to bring to our clients. ","So I feel great about that. It is not a new initiative. It's been well underway and frankly, I'm probably more advance in my thinking in the output of that than where I potentially consider I would be three months ago. With regards to Banking and Healthcare, we changed out the leaders of both. This will be some heavy lifting, if I'm very honest. Some of it is because of Cognizant-specific issues that are reflective of the market reality of some M&A in health care where we are heavily exposed to four firms that have merged. And some of it candidly relates to just the need for us to shift faster to digital, to have more thought leadership, to be the even more client-centric and indeed to add more sales coverage. And those are things that are underway at the moment both in Healthcare and indeed in our Financial Services practice or our Banking practice. ","I should clarify that our Healthcare business in Life Sciences is very strong. It continues to grow double digits. It's one of the areas of our portfolio that I feel best about. We have a strong strategy, a strong leadership team. We know the end-to-end value chain for customers and therefore, M&A is facilitated against that. We are doing a little better in insurance than we are in the core banking business. And as I said on the call, we've made some structural changes in the banking team to really put dedicated teams behind hunting new logos, behind some of our most strategic accounts that we deem platinum as well as more broadly, I believe, that in the world of digital, extra emphasis on thought leadership and an innovation agenda is required. ","And in my dealings with clients over the last four months, it has become very apparent that we are very established in the legacy or traditional models, but our brand attributes and perhaps our thought leadership isn't where it needs to be on the side of the house that is digital. And that is an area that we need to do better in. ","If you do look at the competitive market in terms of what has been announced in the last quarter, it's also clear that there is market growth out there in banking and indeed in health care. And certainly from a banking point of view, we've seen most of our competitors in financial services and insurance grow from the low to the high single digits, and indeed, some even into the double digits. So we have to accelerate quicker, get back on the attack, make sure we hone our thought leadership and get a team that are constantly in front of clients with an agenda around innovation that helps customers think about how they can accelerate or pivot to digital. ","I have not seen in any dialogue with customers any macro concern around their desire to spend on innovation. Invariably, the conversations were very clear. If we show up with enough thought leadership and innovation, they have budgets, and of course, the pivot we need to make is to ensure we are cost disciplined on the legacy side of our business to ensure that we can absorb those cost demands at the time of renewals whilst accelerating our investments into the new.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","I wanted to ask about attrition. I thought it was up a little bit, although year-over-year, it's pretty similar. Where do you expect attrition to go? Do you expect it to stay elevated? Or do you expect it to come back down? And maybe you can just talk about if you guys have lost any key managers or personnel and just thinking about the morale of the company through all these changes.","Brian Humphries","So let me start with the broader question around leadership and then Karen can jump in on the attrition question. Listen, I mean, to be very clear, in a company of 300,000 employees, we will always have leadership changes and it's pretty standard when you have a new CEO who comes onboard. We have been fortunate that at the time of my appointment and indeed before that, the Board secured certain executives to see through a CEO transition, and I'm grateful for their ability to actually get us through that first four to six months of my tenure because it's certainly allowed me the time to get deeper into the business and to make sure that I was ready to run forward.","My perspective is we need a greater emphasis on our customers, greater energy, fresh perspective and candidly in dealing with clients, typically the questions I was asking were how often you've seen our teams, the thought leadership we brought to bear and how we stack up versus the competition and also who were some of the best people in the industry that they recognize and value as people when they are dealing with them. So we have made some very deliberate changes. ","Now, of course, we've also had some other departures and I think that's normal particularly in a company that has had a relatively stable leadership team over the best part of two decades. This is not something I will say that I am overly concerned about. The emphasis on growth is permeating through the organization. The people who are touching customers day in, day out is typically not the executive team but the client partners. And those client partners are really, in my mind, enthused with the renewed focus on growth after a few years of more focus on margin rate, if you will. ","And of course, don't get this wrong. I'm not taking this for granted by any means. We are paranoid that the first line of the P&L is the customer. But from my perspective, this is a very manageable transition we're going through. And we've made some strong internal promotions. The new Head of North America, DK, has been with Cognizant for over 20 years and is ultimately focused and has always been focused across multiple verticals on growth. I'm also pleased to have promoted Pradeep in Delivery, somebody who's been with Cognizant for 23 years, to enable us to get much more focused in terms of optimizing our delivery structures. ","And we've complemented them with some external hires, some executives who used to work with Wipro and indeed more recently Ganesh Ayyar, who was the ex-CEO of Mphasis. So my sense is we want to have the best team we can get our hands on, a team highly motivated, energized, moving with the same speed and urgency that I have and absolutely focused on their teams and on their customers.","Karen McLoughlin","And Bryan, as it relates to the 23%, as you said, it is flat year-over-year. And as you know, there is some seasonality to attrition. So typically, after bonuses are paid in March, we do tend to see attrition pick up. Really no changes in terms of the attrition, in terms of where it's coming from up and down the pyramid, the only exception being the director plus attrition ticked up a little bit based on the actions that we took in June as far as the realignment program. But that was the only real, I would say, significant change in attrition both in terms of geography as well as up and down the pyramid. Now I would expect it's going to continue to be lumpy. As we have said for some time now, the job market is strong and as well as we look to optimize cost structure for the organization, that will in itself likely to create some churn.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider","As you look forward to the next few quarters, sounds like you expect continued muted trends in financials and maybe some improvement in Healthcare as you get to the end of the year. I guess my question is your Q4 guidance sort of implies that things remain muted kind of across-the-board for some time. Is that just the level of conservatism relative to the outlook? Or do you actually see some headwinds in other segments that could be potentially offsetting that recovery?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. So Jim, this is Karen. Let me tackle that. So Q3 to Q4, there is actually a decline in bill days of about two days and that will cost about $47 million on a constant currency basis. So from a modeling perspective, if you were to take the middle of the range for Q3 and then the middle of the range for the full year guidance, that would actually say on a volume basis that Q4 will be flat with Q3. ","There will be some puts and takes. As we've talked about in our comments, we do expect to see some stabilization of Healthcare off of the Q2 numbers, not on a year-over-year basis. It will continue to show challenges but we do expect it to stabilize on a sequential basis going forward. We do expect, as I said, a little bit of slowdown in the technology practice, just given the tough year-on-year comps as we get back into the back part of the year but that was in our guidance both this quarter as well as last quarter so no real change there from that perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","I wonder if you could talk about your positioning in digital. Do you think you're competitive in that business? Or is there catch-up to be done? And I think most importantly, how does one company catch up in digital and close the gap if there is one?","Brian Humphries","So this is Brian. I'll start with our position in digital. There are areas that I've been really blown away with and that have really -- I've left reviews feeling very proud about what we have and feeling that we definitely have a strong foundation to build from. I talked today about the digital engineering team. I have spent a lot of time with Cognizant's Softvision team. But more broadly within Cognizant, we had legacy digital engineering as well as the application monetization efforts that collectively, it really puts us in a position -- if you think about it, 11,000-plus resources with over $800 million of revenue. It puts us in an incredible position to increase our brand recognition and really dramatically change our position in the market vis-\u00e0-vis some of the, let's say, currently known leaders out there. ","IoT is a few hundred million dollars for us and we have broad offerings that are aligned by industry vertical, and I'd expect us to go accelerate that as part of our strategy. More broadly, there are organic investments we need to make. There will be some inorganic plays we need to make there, too. But as I said, I'm not working on something huge at this moment in time and it will be more tuck-ins aligned to our strategy. Of course, behind any organic and indeed inorganic acquisitions, how do you scale digital? Well, you need to have a brand, you need to have capabilities and you need to have systems and tools and the sales and marketing engine to facilitate it. That's why I explicitly called out the fact that we are going through a pivot, which requires us to do some work. It's more project-oriented work, that's good and bad. You need to sell more projects, they have lower TCV, but unlike the legacy business, we will not have the same renewal price erosion that we are faced within the legacy. ","We need to have a set of client partners that are capable of speaking to the right level of the organization that typically will extend well beyond the CIO, different decision-makers and buyers, right from the CMO up to the CFO and indeed the CEO and indeed, know how to speak and how to follow up on what collateral to leave and what use cases to bring in and obviously what industry expertise to bring with them into the conversation. More consultative selling and indeed all these practical things that are very often overlooked but nonetheless critical in my opinion to running a world-class operation, things like sales commission plans that need to change and therefore, we need to orient more of our commission towards aligning our sales into areas of the -- that are aligned with our strategy. So that is not something we've historically done. It is something we will do going into the new year. And indeed, the delivery capabilities from an agile delivery point of view becomes relevant as well. ","I do feel that as we have near, on and indeed offshore capabilities, if you think about something like digital engineering, if we are able to take the guild and pod model that we have and extend it not just from nearshore but indeed off to our offshore centers, I believe we will have a huge advantage over some of the other players that you know. So listen, this is an area that I'm pumped about, I'm excited about the possibilities we have and I've seen a lot of goodness in the operations. We, of course, now need to accelerate our investments in it and make sure that we take this strategy into execution. And rest assured we are very focused on that.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research.","Rod Bourgeois","Brian, so I appreciate your candor in admitting that Cognizant's weak growth in Banking and Healthcare is mostly due to company-specific issues. And my question is do you have a point of view at this point on what Cognizant's growth rate would be today if it weren't for these company-specific issues that you're needing to fix? And I guess on a related note, you're making a lot of internal changes now. I'd like your perspective on whether you think these internal changes will cause additional growth disruption in the upcoming months.","Brian Humphries","So Rod, it's, of course, hard to extrapolate the implication but you can do a sliding scale analysis to understand that for every 100 basis points of improvement in Healthcare or Banking, what is the implied implication on the broader Cognizant story. But given they are 63% of the business, you can clearly understand that these are meaningful shifts to our overall numbers. And every 160 basis points -- $160-or-so million of growth is 1 point of growth for us, and every $6 million of bottom line is $0.01 EPS for us. So these are important levers for us to get right. ","We do have a lot of balls in the air at the moment and that's why we are very, very deliberate around the transformation office. We have staffed it with people who know the company well. They have been surrounded by management consultants both internal and indeed external, and we have a huge operation cadence behind that and a broad framework of change management communication and indeed an execution layer that needs to happen. ","And Rod, by definition, you will always go home at night and wondering if you're going too far, too fast. But I've got to be honest, I have a great sense of urgency. I'm really proud to have this role. I really am proud to have inherited an organization that is, in my mind, full of talent and I want to lead them forward, and I believe that we are going at the right pace to catch up where we need to catch up and to extend our leadership where we think we're in front. ","But we're spending a lot of time around operational excellence and rigor and making sure we contextualize these changes. It's clear, certain employees will be concerned around the amount of work and the hours and the pace in the decision-making. But my belief is that my executive level, I've had a number of executive committee meetings now, we have a cadence of two days every month. We've had some really, really constructive meetings where the teams are on board and we are making the decisions, in my opinion, needed at this moment in time to put Cognizant in a position where we can unlock our true potential.","Katie Royce","Right. And with that, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining and for your questions.","Operator","This concludes today's call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"6131":["Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) Q2 2014 Earnings Call August  6, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","David Nelson - Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer","Francisco D'souza - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Gordon J.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.","David Nelson","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2014 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'souza, Chief Executive Officer; Gordon Coburn, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Frank.","Francisco D'souza","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll start the call today with the highlights of our second quarter results and our revised outlook for the rest of the year. I'll also take some time to put our results in the context of the broader industry trends that we're seeing, using as examples some significant transformational deals that have recently been awarded to us. I'll then pass the call on to Gordon to discuss our detailed operating results, and Karen will provide further details on our financial metrics and guidance.","For the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $2.52 billion, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin, at 21%, was higher than our target range for the quarter and positions us well to absorb wage increases and promotions that take effect during the second half of the year. And in support of our continued confidence in the business, this morning, we announced an expansion of our existing share repurchase program to $2 billion. Karen will give you more details on this expansion shortly.","We delivered solid performance in the second quarter. But due to weaknesses in certain clients and longer-than-expected sale cycles for certain large integrated deals, we're adopting a more conservative stance for the remainder of the year and revising our revenue guidance to at least 14% for 2014 while maintaining our prior full year non-GAAP EPS of at least $2.54. More specifically, there are 2 main reasons for this revised guidance. First, as we've discussed with you in the past, we are seeing a trend in the market towards larger integrated deals. While these deals represent a strong source of revenue for Cognizant, certain deals took longer than expected to close, leading to delays in revenue ramp-up. And second, we continue to experience weakness in certain clients in North America and the U.K. that recently underwent leadership changes, a situation that we described to you last quarter. While we believe that our client relationships remain sound, we will not generate as much revenue in 2014 from some of these clients as we had previously expected. While I'm disappointed that our full year revenue growth will be below our prior expectations, we remain optimistic about the evolving market opportunity ahead of us.","I'd like to spend a few moments putting our results and outlook in the context of what we're seeing in the market, using some specific large important client situations as illustrations. We've spoken to you in past quarters about our clients' dual mandate to run better and run different. On one side of the dual mandate, our clients are under constant pressure to become more efficient in their current operations or to run better, and they continue to look to us to provide ever-greater levels of productivity in their core operations and legacy technology environments by combining multiple service areas, applying advanced automation and implementing best-in-class operations and Lean Six Sigma methodologies. Gordon will speak to you shortly about the details of 3 large deals of this nature that together represent approximately $3.5 billion in total contract value. The largest of these deals is with Health Net, a top 10 managed care organization in the U.S. We've signed a letter of intent with Health Net and expect to finalize the contract before the end of Q3. The Health Net deal alone represents around $2.7 billion in total contract value and is the single largest PCB deal in the history of Cognizant. This engagement builds on our long-standing relationship with Health Net for close to 10 years. Judging by our pipeline, we are seeing increased opportunity in these types of engagements and anticipate this to be a long-term trend. Winning and delivering these deals requires a broad range of integrated capabilities, in which we have been investing over many years: a strong consulting front end, solid client raising skills, deep domain knowledge and at-scale capabilities in technology and operations. And behind deals like these lies a deep sense of trust that our clients place in us, trust that comes from multiyear client relationships and deep levels of engagement within our clients' organizations.","On the other side of the dual mandate, our clients continue to drive -- the drive to adopt new digital technologies to gain competitive advantage or to run different. Where, in run better, we are seeing larger integrated services deals, our run different engagements tend to be sharply-focused, value-focused initiatives that often include the use of new SMAC or digital technologies to reshape aspects of our clients' businesses or industries. Quite often, these tend to be IP-driven, nonlinear, outcome-based engagements. For example, we were recently chosen by TransCelerate BioPharma Inc., an industry body with membership representation from 19 major pharmaceutical companies, to develop a first-of-its-kind, subscription-based platform that will transform the way pharmaceutical companies collaborate on clinical trials. TransCelerate's mission is to bring the global pharmaceutical R&D community together so as to accelerate and simplify the process of drug development. This shared investigator platform, built as an industry utility, will enable the pharmaceutical industry to bring standardization and consistency to clinical trials. In keeping with our past practice, we continue to invest in building our capabilities in new technologies and service areas as well as in new markets and geographies to meet our clients' evolving needs. Our initiatives in digital and SMAC technologies continue to show great traction and drive deeper engagement with our clients.","Let me close by saying that while we know that you are disappointed in our revised revenue outlook for the year, I can assure you that all of us at Cognizant are even more disappointed. But let me be clear, we believe that the market opportunity remains strong and that Cognizant is well positioned to capture a disproportionate share of the growth in the market over the coming years. A new report by ISG, a sourcing advisory group, indicates that demand in the market is at record-high levels. This is also reflected in our strong order pipeline. As part of our recent quarterly management meeting, our global leadership team assembled to take stock and review areas of the focus in view of our revised guidance for the year. Post these discussions, it's clear to us that we have the right strategy, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook of our business.","Our portfolio of services across the 3 horizons has never been stronger, and we continue to hire in large numbers. This quarter, we had a net addition of approximately 8,800 people to our company, our highest since the third quarter of 2011. The run better, run different dual mandate for our clients is more real than ever, and we will continue to push harder in the coming quarters to continue to be our clients' partner of choice.","With that, I'll now hand the call over to Gordon to share more about our performance and to Karen to provide financial details. I'll be back for the Q&A. Gordon?","Gordon J. Coburn","Thank you, Francisco. We're pleased to be able to speak with you today about 3 significant transformational deals, including an engagement with the largest total contract value, or TCV, in Cognizant history. But before I get into the details of these relationships, I want to first discuss our view on current market demand and our strategy to deliver long-term industry-leading performance. While our near-term 2014 revenue outlook of at least 14% growth is below our original expectations, we believe that these near-term, client-specific impacts we are experiencing are not a reflection of market environment or our approach to the broadening market. We remain confident in our strategy and long-term prospects.","Our commitment to industry-leading growth is something we take very seriously, and we believe that our 3 Horizon model is the right strategy to position us for industry-leading growth over the longer term. Given that overall market demand remains healthy and geographies beyond our traditional markets are underpenetrated and showing real signs of adopting our delivery model, it is more important than ever to continue investing to strengthen -- to further strengthen and differentiate our capabilities across our 3 growth horizons. Within Horizon 1, we're seeing a shift towards transformational deals, and we are strengthening our capabilities and client-value proposition for these opportunities. Within Horizon 2, which includes Business Process Services or BPS, consulting and IT Infrastructure Services, we believe that the market is still young, and we continue to invest in scale to compete and win deals based on our industry knowledge and ability to structure integrated solutions for clients. And finally, we're pleased with the revenue and mindshare traction we are gaining in our newer Horizon 3 businesses and services, where we have competitive offerings and differentiation with a strong opportunity to penetrate our top accounts.","For years now, we've been talking about the increasing importance of transformational deals that provide scale and leadership, and we have historically won a number of these deals, particularly in financial services and health care. With these deals, clients look to make large-scale changes to the way they operate significant parts of their businesses or IT organizations. The goal is to dramatically improve their performance in multiple areas of their business. Increasingly, these deals involve solutions integrating multiple service offerings.","Let me now speak about 3 examples of these types of deals. Combined, these 3 deals are expected to generate approximately $3.5 billion in TCV for us. We anticipate these deals will ramp over the duration of the contracts, with the expected incremental revenue in 2015 of at least $200 million. This morning, we are announcing the signing of a letter of intent for a multibillion engagement with Health Net, which provides and administers health benefits to approximately 5,800,000 members across the country. At a total contract value of $2.7 billion over 7 years, this engagement is significant from both a revenue and strategic perspective. Subject to contract finalization and applicable regulatory approval, Cognizant will provide end-to-end business services, including processing membership and claims as well as providing transformational IT and the underlying infrastructure services. Included within this deal is access to certain intellectual property related to the platform used to run the operation of a health care payer organization. We believe that this will allow us to play an even larger role in the health care industry ecosystem going forward. The business model resulting from this deal is expected to be a benchmark for the industry, enabling Health Net to improve its quality of service, reduce G&A spending and increase its agility in launching new products and participating in new markets.","Additionally, we recently won a multiyear transformational deal with a financial services company. This is a good example of how our long-term relationship with a client positioned us to win a large integrated deal covering all lines of business. Our track record in delivery gave the client confidence in our capabilities to leverage some synergies between IT and BPS and to be responsible for efficiently running their core processes, from the origination of new business to back-office support to maintaining critical systems. Providing a comprehensive solution will help not only to improve and streamline their core processes but enhance insight into their business.","Finally, we were selected by Vorwerk, a large European consumer goods manufacturing and direct sales company, to simplify, standardize and centralize the company's IT infrastructure. The transformed IT infrastructure environment will enable this client to achieve higher levels of business agility and service quality while sharpening its focus on its core competencies and driving down cost. Furthermore, this is a good example of how we are beginning to leverage the relationships of last year's C1 acquisition to further grow our business in Europe. These larger transformational opportunities are a testament to our ability to integrate multiple services, including our core IT services, as well as our Horizon 2 services at BPS consulting and IT infrastructure and often our SMAC capabilities.","Let me now turn to a detailed discussion of our Horizon 2 service lines. Our BPS practice had a solid quarter, gaining traction through several strategic wins as well as through the growth of existing project work and expanding into new divisions at existing clients. Capital markets and mortgage services demand in banking remained strong, as does underwriting in property and casualty insurance and claims processing and membership enrollment and revenue cycle management in health care.","Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continued its pace of above-company average growth. As we've discussed in previous quarters, CBC is often a key factor in our ability to win and deliver results in these larger transformational deals. By incorporating consulting and advisory work upfront, we provide our clients with comprehensive and integrated solutions, thus helping them to transform their organizations. For example, CBC recently served as a retail client's digital platform partner in developing their roadmap to drive their digital transformation by launching offerings such as in-store ordering, multichannel fulfillment and mobile point-of-sale. CBC takes a business-led approach in formulating solutions and plays a key role in the implementation of these solutions.","IT Infrastructure Services had another strong quarter. We're well positioned in this growth market, as we are increasingly competing for comprehensive deals requiring the integration of end-to-end IT infrastructure management and application management. The engagement we mentioned earlier with Vorwerk is a good example of this type of win.","From an industry perspective, our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 3.4% sequentially and 16.2% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in insurance, where there is a growing focus on end-to-end managed services. More broadly within BFS, underlying demand drivers from regulatory compliance, real risk time monitoring and fraud and trade surveillance support longer-term growth. Additionally, our financial services clients are looking to us to build and integrate SMAC solutions.","Growth in health care, which consists primarily of our payor, pharmaceutical and medical device clients, accelerated in the quarter, up 4.8% sequentially and 19.2% year-over-year. Within the pharmaceutical sector, several of our key pharmaceutical clients continue to work through the challenges associated with their drug pipelines and with the patent cliff, though we are beginning to see a steady pickup in demand. After a significant step-up in investments in 2013, many of our payor clients are taking a more cautious approach to incremental spending this year, especially associated with their activities with public and private health insurance exchanges. However, we're confident in the longer-term opportunities, given the significant disruption in the health care market that will continue to evolve over the coming years. The engagement with health care -- with Health Net will further enhance our ability to provide clients with both IT services and Cognizant-owned intellectual property platform-led solutions as they face these challenges.","Our retail manufacturing segment was relatively flat sequentially and up 11.4% year-over-year. In retail, continued pressure on discretionary spending among major clients has driven much of the softness in the quarter. Although revenue in manufacturing and logistics was soft in the quarter, we are seeing clients focus on both solutions that can drive operational efficiencies as well as embracing SMAC solutions in areas such as internet-enabled devices, with built-in intelligence to improve supply chain visibility and logistics operations and promote driver engagement through enhanced throughput.","Our other segment, which includes communications, information, media and entertainment and high tech, showed continued recovery, with 10.4% sequential growth and 20.8% growth year-over-year, primarily driven by increased traction with both communications and high technology companies, where we have seen a pickup in discretionary spending.","From a geographic standpoint, North America improved from a slow start at the beginning of the year, growing 5% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. Following a strong first quarter, revenue from Europe declined about 1% sequentially but grew 20.4% year-over-year. The slowdown was driven by the U.K., where we saw a 4.1% sequential decline in Q2. As Frank mentioned, the U.K. weakness came primarily from retail and financial clients which have experienced leadership changes. Continental Europe saw 4% sequential growth and 30.5% growth year-over-year, partially attributed to our 2013 acquisitions. We expect solid growth in the continent, and we anticipate that the structural shift towards larger multiyear outsourcing programs will continue to drive opportunities over the coming years.","The rest of world continued to show good growth, up 5.5% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year. We added several new logos in the APAC region recently and remain encouraged by the growth prospects in that region.","Now let me turn the call over to Karen to provide details on our numbers.","Karen McLoughlin","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $2.52 billion represented growth of 3.9% sequentially and 16.5% over Q2 2013. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 21%, above our target range of 19% to 20%, while our GAAP operating margin was 19.4% for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.66 exceeded our previous guidance by $0.04.","Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 52% and 48% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 6.2% sequentially and 20.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services increased 1.5% sequentially and 11.9% from Q2 a year ago.","During the second quarter, 35% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We closed the quarter with 1,242 active clients and added 7 strategic customers, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 257.","As we discussed on the first quarter earnings call, we have accelerated the rate of share repurchase. In Q2, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for a total cost of $101 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 34.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.13 billion under the previous share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion. Today, we are pleased to announce that the board has authorized a $500 million increase in share repurchase authorization, bringing the total repurchase authorization to $2 billion, of which $872 million is still unutilized.","Our fully diluted share count for the quarter was 612.2 million shares, a decrease of approximately 730,000 shares from the first quarter.","Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the second quarter with approximately $4.13 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $264 million from the quarter ending March 31 and up by approximately $1.23 billion from the year-ago period.","During the second quarter, operating activities generated approximately $408 million of cash, financing activities were approximately a $93 million use of cash and capital expenditures were approximately $39 million for the quarter. Receivables were $1.8 billion, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 76.7 days, up by approximately 1.5 days from the year-ago period. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $298 million, up from $267 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 57% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July.","Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics for the quarter. As Francisco mentioned earlier, we ramped up hiring during the quarter, with approximately 8,800 net new hires, our highest net addition since Q3 2011, reflecting our long-term growth expectations for the company. Annualized attrition of 16.9% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down by almost 200 basis points from the year-ago period. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 187,400 employees globally, of which approximately 175,500 were service delivery staff. 34% of our new hires were direct college hires, while 64% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. Utilization declined slightly on a sequential basis as we onboarded the 8,800 net new hires. Offshore utilization was approximately 74%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 82%, and on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter.","I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 2014 and for the full year. As Francisco mentioned, while we are not where we expected to be in terms of revenue for the second half of the year, the overall services market remains strong, with tremendous opportunity for growth worldwide and across our regions and practice areas. However, given the weakness at certain clients and longer-than-anticipated sales cycles for certain large integrated deals, we are revising our full year revenue growth expectation to at least 14% growth, down from our previous expectations of at least 16.5% for the full year.","For the third quarter of 2014, we expect to deliver revenue of between $2.55 billion and $2.58 billion. During Q3 and for the second half of 2014, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20% as we absorb the raises and promotions in the second half of the year. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.63. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 612 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. Our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance is unchanged. We expect to deliver at least $2.54 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%.","Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Clearly, you cut your revenue outlook, looks like by, I guess, $220 million. I'm curious how much of that $220 million is due to the weakness in the client spend that you called out versus the longer sales cycles. And as a follow-up, do you expect that lower client spend to come back? Or has it been lost in, say, vendor consolidation or what have you?","Gordon J. Coburn","Tien-tsin, it's Gordon. The majority of it is the client-specific issues. The smaller piece of it is the longer sales cycle on the transformational deals, and it's a combination. Some of it is clients aren't spending quite as much as we expected on some projects we were anticipating, and some of it is delays in decisions, where clients -- at clients that had changes in leadership. So -- but certainly, it's more related towards client-specific issues at a handful of clients.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you expect it to come back at some point, Gordon? And how broad-based was it? Are we talking about a handful of clients or something smaller?","Francisco D'souza","Tien-tsin, it's Frank. Look, I think -- we're talking about a small handful of clients, some of our larger clients. And in terms of the spend coming back, look, I think our relationships at across-the-board remain very, very healthy. But given where we are in the year, the dynamics of our business are such that if you don't start projects and ramp up in the early part of the first half of the year, then it's hard to make it up on the back end. But as we go into next year, look, I think we are positioned well with our client base, depending on where budgets come out and so on and so forth, those dynamics. I think we're well positioned to capture our fair share or an unfair share of what our clients are going to be spending and these same clients in the longer term.","Operator","We'll move on to the next question, which is coming from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about the competitive framework here? It sounds like you're -- you and some of your competitors are starting to chase larger and larger transactions. And I'm wondering how much a greater role the advisors now play in it as opposed to your old model of penetrate and radiate. Sort of what's the framework here? And also, talk within the concept -- I know you said pricing was stable, but what's happening with total cost of ownership and what that implies for revenue growth?","Francisco D'souza","Yes, let me -- Ed, it's Frank. Let me talk about the first part, and I'll turn it over to Gordon for the second piece of your question. For several quarters now, we've been talking to you about this trend towards larger, more integrated services deals. And that's really driven at the fundamental level by the fact that increase -- there's an increasing body now of evidence and a track record at Cognizant at combining multiple service areas together, the traditional application development and application maintenance, IT infrastructure and BPO, allows us to combine those service areas together and create a way -- apply techniques like Lean Six Sigma, advanced automation and so on to drive even greater levels of productivity and efficiency. So as our clients face this dual mandate, which is very, very real, of how do I run my operations better in order to fund the investments that I need in order to run different, this trend towards larger integrated deals is something that we're seeing more and more of. I think in that context, the role of the advisors certainly is more pronounced than it had been in our traditional model. But I would also say that the traditional model is still very much the large piece of the business, where it's sort of a more land and expand kind of a model, where we win a client, tend to do some initial project and then expand from there. So that's still the big piece of our revenue growth. I just want to make that clear because we've spent a lot of time in our prepared comments in talking about these transformational deals, which is an important trend, but it's still a smaller part of the overall revenue mix.","Gordon J. Coburn","And it's Gordon. Your question about are people focused on price or rate card versus total cost of ownership, clearly, in most cases, it's total cost of ownership, particularly where intermediaries are involved. Because when you focus on total cost of ownership, you can have a win-win situation, which is the basis for long-term success. So the focus is on efficiency. It's on effectiveness. As Francisco mentioned, it's on automation. It's on process improvement. And as long as we can deliver a lower cost of ownership to the client, that's what they care about, rather than what the rate card is.","Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So does that imply sort of lower revenue growth for you, given this TCO pressure? You're basically less revenue per person.","Gordon J. Coburn","It's not less revenue per person because, if it's lower cost of ownership and I'm pulling the efficiency automation process improvement levers, I can do the work with less people. So yes, it can result to providing the same service with less people and, therefore, less revenue. But remember, that's on the run better side. And what clients are doing is they're freeing up those dollars and then investing them on the run different side. So as long as we can provide services on both sides of the house, that model works well for us.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to ask, the weakness in outsourcing, that's 2 quarters in a row. Just trying to figure out if something structurally is going on. I don't know if SaaS is having an impact; cloud, obviously, are the 2 themes that we see out there. Did that have any impact on the outsourcing business? And then just second question, just on wage hike expected, what percentage wage hike are you expecting in the third?","Karen McLoughlin","Sure. Bryan, it's Karen. I'll take the first part. I think Gordon's going to take the wage part of your question. So as you mentioned, the outsourcing growth has been a little bit slower in the first half of this year sequentially. In Q1, we talked about where we had seen a couple of clients who are actually redirecting revenue dollars from run better to run different, and that was the beginning of a bit of a shift that we had seen there. I think a little bit of that trend continued in Q2, where clients, as Gordon was just talking about, right, they're looking to optimize their spend, redirect investment dollars towards the run different and more transformational side of their business. But as we look out over the long -- the near term and the long term, there's actually a tremendous amount of growth for the outsourcing segment of our business. So keep in mind, outsourcing includes not just the application and maintenance side of the business but also the BPO and infrastructure services, which are continuing to grow faster than company average and certainly will for the foreseeable future. But also, if you think about the 3 transactions that we talked about this morning, that Gordon talked about with the Health Net transaction, the Vorwerk transaction and the financial services client, the vast majority of that revenue actually will be part of what we call the outsourcing segment because it includes application maintenance, infrastructure and BPO. So I think you will continue to see growth out of that segment moving forward.","Gordon J. Coburn","And on your question about wage inflation. First of all, our increases and promotions, a vast majority are effective July 1. We're going to be in line with the other leading players, so that translates into roughly 10% wage inflation offshore and on-site wage inflation in the lower single digits.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Look, I mean, your guidance obviously implies slower trends into the second half of the year. And when we still see some strength now in the financials and health care vertical, and you obviously call out some larger transformational deals like Health Net or others that you've won, I think it'd be helpful for the market if you can just provide a little more detail regarding the pipeline that you actually have now beyond just those 3 large deals, with respect to maybe geography verticals. And maybe give us a little confidence on whether or not the run rate of growth should be able to improve from what you're seeing in the second half, which is really roughly in the 10%, 11% range.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So first of all, the larger transformational deals, the revenue largely kicks in next year, not in the second half of this year because, obviously, we have to get regulatory approvals in addition to all that. So that's -- helps drive next year. We are seeing -- we are pleased with the pipeline. You look at Horizon 2 as an example. We can now compete in larger deals. Because it was one of these things, you had to have scale to compete in larger deals. We now have the scale. So when I look at the pipeline, I don't just look at number of deals, but I look at the size of the deals, and the size is clearly materially larger. When I look at our traditional Horizon 1 businesses, clearly, Europe is a lot better than it had been. And that's a combination of the market's more open to it and, quite honestly, our execution has gotten better as we've done some acquisitions and as we've won some marquee names. We're picking up some traction in the Middle East. In the near -- in the short term, certainly, BFS and health care, we expect to be a bit soft. A little too early to know what that'll be for next year in sort of the core, less so the pipeline, but just take growth of the core existing customers. But I want to be -- and we tried to stress this on the earlier part of the call. This is not -- our adjustment in guidance is not due to the market. It's due to specific clients. And fortunately, sometimes, you are fortunate with what your specific clients are doing. And sometimes, you're unfortunate. This time -- many times, we've been fortunate in the past. This time, we've been unfortunate. But it is isolated to a relatively -- the majority of the impact is isolated to a relatively small number of clients. The overall market demand, we're actually feeling quite good about, as -- and I think you've seen that evidence from many of our competitors.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. I mean, so given that -- those points, I mean, should we expect that the sort of pickup, the 2015 growth rates should look better? Only because if it's just a specific few clients, the core underlying organic story is still just pretty much unchanged. And it looks like you're adding some larger transformational business as well. And then lastly, these clients potentially could come back at some point.","Francisco D'souza","Look, I think -- it's Frank. I think the fundamentals of our industry remain very, very strong, right? Our thesis has been that we operate in a very large market that's highly fragmented, and it gives the opportunity for us to gain incremental share. And that -- those fundamentals still hold. And so I think we're very confident that, with our strategy of reinvesting in the business, there are still a lot of long-term growth opportunities. And in the long run, I think we can continue to drive industry-leading growth. It's too early for me to comment on 2015 specifically. As you know, we go through the cycle at -- towards the end of the year and in the early part of the subsequent year as clients go through the budgeting process and so on and so forth. But when I step back and just look at the overall situation, we're going through this big transition in the market in technology that's creating this dual mandate for our clients. We're still in a fragmented market. We are underpenetrated in key geographies around the world. I think those fundamentals remain strong and allow us to, if we continue to invest, to maintain industry-leading growth.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","It sounded like we saw some delays in project ramps in the back half of the year. What gives us confidence that, that doesn't continue on some of these new projects? And will you be taking over any assets on the new projects?","Gordon J. Coburn","So Joe, I'm assuming you're talking more about the larger transformational deals. It took a little longer just to get all our ducks in a row, and then you run into some year-end timing of when you start doing the work. So some of that did get pushed out from what we initially expected. On the -- we will be picking up some intellectual property as part of one of these deals, which we think we can leverage with other clients. So there will be some asset pickups as part of this in terms of intellectual property. And we're taking on some people who we think are going to be wonderful contributors on a long-term basis.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. So maybe you could just give us some idea of like how the longer-term transformational deals differ from the traditional businesses that you normally do. And give us some idea of how that translates into revenues as we start to see larger pieces of this in your pipeline.","Gordon J. Coburn","I'm not sure it -- they differ materially from a revenue standpoint. As they start ramping up, we recognize revenue depending on the deal, if it's time and material or if it's fixed price. So I'm not sure the dynamics are any different, other than when do you start the ramp-up. The margin profiles, those will differ from client to client. Some are normal margin profiles from day 1. Others, you have an investment phase. But obviously, we can handle the -- we have the room for that within our existing margin ranges.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Regarding the client-specific issues, how much of those are due to leadership change versus customers not spending as much as you expected? And when you see leadership changes, what's your history there? Will the new leaders come in and decide to do something different? Or does it just turn out to be a delay of business?","Gordon J. Coburn","The answer is it's a combination. There are some cases where you have a new leader come in and they want to reevaluate overall IT priorities. Other times, they want to reevaluate their sourcing strategy. But normally, it's they just want to understand what they're spending money on. In other cases, it's situations where a client is just going to spend less money. And that's going to impact us as well. Or that their priorities of sourcing have changed. So it's -- when I look across the handful of clients where we've been impacted, it's no single answer, but it's -- it tends to be some combination of all those.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the integrated deals, is it that the market is buying in a different way, or more that Cognizant is now able to provide a broader set of capabilities, and so you're seeing these larger deals and, therefore, some delays?","Francisco D'souza","I think it's probably -- it's -- the market is, I think, buying in a different way. Steve, I think that there is a growing recognition in the marketplace. And it's a position that we hold as well, that by combining service lines together, we can drive greater levels of efficiency and effectiveness for clients. And as you know, clients across the industries that we serve, we've been talking about this for some time, are under continued pressure to drive ever-greater levels of productivity, efficiency, effectiveness. That's what we call the run better part of the dual mandate. And so creating these large integrated deals is just a natural outcome of that. In parallel with that, since we recognized this trend several years ago, we've been building out the core individual service lines that are required to service these large integrated deals. And largely, those are the traditional Cognizant application development and application maintenance service line, the IT Infrastructure service line and the BPS service line, and all of that wrapped with a consulting layer that Cognizant Business Consulting provides. So we feel like we're well positioned. Our capabilities, the ones that we've invested in over the last few years, really enable us to play in these large integrated deals.","Operator","We'll move on to the next question, which is coming from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","This is a follow-up regarding the large deals. You indicated that you're going to take some assets. Will there be a margin impact from those deals? Anything unusual there? I think that's going to be helpful if you provide some color on that. And then, obviously, you've expanded your share buyback program. On the flip side of it, what's the logic for not introducing a symbolic dividend payment sometime this year?","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. Let me take the first question of, on the larger deals, is there a margin impact. Each -- with these large deals, both the 3 that we talked about here and others, the margin -- the characteristics are a little bit different on each one. Some, it's sort of normal margins or steady margins from day 1. Others, there are an investment period. But let me be clear, the ones where there are investment period, we can handle those within our existing margin profile because they are also larger deals that are coming out of the investment period. So as long as you kind of have these things staggered, you're fine. So we're comfortable with that. But the margin -- the timing of the margin will differ from deal to deal. On capital structure, as we've been saying for a while, we think the right answer for us is to focus on share repurchases. And if you look historically, we've been a -- we've looked at relative valuation of Cognizant to the market in terms of deciding how aggressive to be. And even in Q2, we picked up the pace of acquisition -- of share repurchases from Q1. Obviously, we're signaling that we can -- we expect to continue to do share repurchases with the expansion of the program. We do not have any plans near term to focus on a dividend. Because a dividend, once you start doing it, obviously, you want to continue doing it. And this is still a very dynamic market. We think we're going to end up being a clear leader in the market, and we want to make sure we have the flexibility to do that as acquisitions may come up or other things may come up. So we don't want to box ourselves in, and that's why we think share repurchases are the right way to go, because it gives us more flexibility. And obviously, even before today, share repurchases were accretive to earnings.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple real quick. But maybe just coming back to the client-specific issues, just to be clear, are these just kind of delays in decision-making? Or has there sort of been a reallocation or a cut in either the technology or offshore budgets of the clients for this year? Just trying to -- wanted to understand that a little better.","Francisco D'souza","I think it's a little bit of both, frankly, Glenn. What's happened is, as Gordon said, sometimes, we're seeing clients reassessing priorities, shifting dollars from, say, run better to run different kinds of initiatives. And other times, it's just been just straight delays, frankly, where projects get pushed out. And as I said earlier, when that happens, just given the calendarization and the timing of things during the year, it becomes difficult to, essentially, to catch up in the year.","Gordon J. Coburn","Also, we do see a client here and there where they have a real budget gap that they have to close, which goes against overall industry trends. But it does impact that particular client, and we've seen that as well.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And Gordon, maybe you could help us. I mean, you obviously -- it's a pretty big cut for the back half, a little over $200 million in revenue. The degree of conservatism you're thinking about into the back half, to just sort of like, well, if you're going to cut, cut hard? But I just want to understand how you're thinking of the back half.","Gordon J. Coburn","I think our thinking about it is similar to what you just described.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Charles Brennan with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Charles Brennan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's actually coming back to the idea of 2015, if we can. I know you don't want to give some specific guidance, but the guidance for the back half of 2014 is for slowing momentum. It's something like 12% growth in the third quarter falling to something like 8% in the fourth quarter. That gives us a fairly weak exit run rate. Are you confident that Q4 is the low point of the growth cycle? And then as we look at 2015, you're obviously going to be facing some tough comps in the first half. Is it going to be one of those hockey-stick years, where we're relying on the second half to deliver the growth?","Gordon J. Coburn","So let me caveat my comments with we've not gone through the budget cycle with clients, and we clearly don't want to get ahead of ourselves and talk about 2015. But we -- the issues we face this year are not market demand issues, and you're seeing that from our competitors. They are client-specific to us. When we look at those that are client-specific to us, we think a lot of the -- many of those challenges wash out of the system by the end of this year. So I don't think we have the headwinds from those specific clients as we go into next year, or at least in aggregate. But obviously, we want to go through the planning cycle with the other 900 and -- or other 1,000 clients before we have a full view on 2013. Certainly, we're pleased that we have some stuff under our belt now with these transformational deals that we've won. And certainly, we've been winning other stuff, just doesn't rise to the size that were talked about on the call.","Charles Brennan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just why doesn't lower spend in the second half annualize in the first half of next year? Are you assuming that spend comes back? Or are you assuming that business wins overcompensate for it?","Gordon J. Coburn","In the term -- use the term business wins, not just new logos but growth of existing accounts. Essentially, we have an anchor of a handful of accounts that are offsetting really quite healthy growth at the vast majority of our accounts. And we -- and that anchor doesn't continue to decline as we go into next year, is our belief. But once again, we haven't done the planning yet on what the other 1,000 clients will do. That will be part of the budget process.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just want to dig in a little bit to the mix of revenue attributable to renewals. How is that this year relative to last year? And what are those conversations like with your customers? And I understand that some of your peers have been very competitive, particularly on the outsourcing front, and just want to get a sense of when it comes for -- it comes time for renewal, you indicated pricing is stable. But how are you able to maintain that stable pricing in that environment?","Francisco D'souza","Yes, I think -- this is Frank. Let me -- Brian, let me just step back and say, first of all, that I think there are different kinds of renewal circumstances and situations. And I think, as I said earlier, the vast majority of our business continues to be what I think of as the traditional model in which we've operated, where we tend to have preferred vendor status with a client and we win projects incrementally as the clients identify new work. Now sometimes, that's renewal work. For example, we might be doing an engagement -- a maintenance engagement that comes up, and then the client renews it. That tends to be one renewal cycle. And generally speaking, those fall under the overall sort of master agreement that we have with the client. Those master services agreements will sometimes come up for renewal once every several years. And the competitive dynamics there have largely remained unchanged, I think, over several years. There's nothing remarkable about that. So that's what I consider to be the normal cycle of our business. On top of that, we're seeing this trend towards larger deals. And I think we are benefiting from this trend towards larger deals. There, what's happening is that the client is either taking a traditional, what I would consider to be a more legacy kind of contract, usually that's in infrastructure, and moving it to a global services model and then combining that with applications and\/or with BPO to create these integrated deals. In those cases, the competitive dynamics are such that we're able to drive a lot of additional value by combining those together. We have a very, very strong process historically of understanding what the levers are that we can pull in each of those circumstances and translate that into, as Gordon said earlier, lower total cost of ownership for the client. In those cases, the competitive dynamics are such that the advisors play a little bit of a stronger role. And oftentimes, as is the case in some of the big transactions that we announced today, the scope of those larger deals includes some current scope that Cognizant is already executing. So in a sense, it becomes a renewal, but a much larger renewal because you take the existing scope of work that we might already be executing for the client, you add a lot more around it to create a much larger deal. So that's sort of a second kind of renewal circumstance. So I don't know if that gives you some color around how these renewals are playing out. But overall, we feel good about our competitive position and our ability to win in those circumstances.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just want to touch real quick on attrition. Unless we misheard it, it looked like it spiked in the quarter, and I think some of your peers are having similar issues. Maybe if you can comment on what's being done to address attrition and how that might impact the, I guess, seasonal increase in promotional and salary increase spend that you're seeing going into the back half of the year.","Gordon J. Coburn","Sure. So going from Q1 to Q2, we always see an increase in attrition -- or almost always. The reason why is we pay out our bonuses in March. So people who are waiting for their bonuses who are planning to leave would leave, plus you have people going back for higher education. So we're down about 2 points from second quarter of last year. Still running a little bit higher than we want but certainly in better shape than we -- much better shape than we were last year. That's one reason, obviously, why we gave salary increments at the higher end of the industry, because we wanted to send a strong message to our people about the -- at Cognizant, they can have terrific careers and great growth paths. So we'll continue to watch it. But the key things we're doing is a lot of efforts around employee engagement that we started when we saw a spike last year, and that has helped things. We've given healthy increments, which we think will help things. So continue to keep an eye on it, but the trend is actually -- seasonally adjusted trend is actually going in the direction that we want. Not fully there, but certainly, we've made good progress.","Operator","Our final question is coming from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I appreciate some of the comments around what appears to be conservatism for the back half. But obviously, it's the second straight quarter where it seems like we've been caught off guard a bit by clients' spending plans. So I'm just wondering if this is causing you to rethink, on a kind of more structural basis, any of your internal budgeting and forecasting processes as well as how you might translate the output of those processes to the formal guidance that you give to the Street.","Francisco D'souza","Jason, I think, look, we've -- we're taking a long, hard look at all of our internal processes to understand if we need to adjust how we think about our own forecasting and then, as you said, translating that into the guidance that we provide. I think the reality is that we're going through a somewhat of a transition in the marketplace, as I've said several times over the last quarters, where you have these big technology shifts going on. And that's leading to some -- I think it's leading to 2 things, right? One is great opportunity for us. I feel really optimistic about how we're positioned and the opportunities that are available to us in the marketplace. It also leads to a more dynamic market, a much more dynamic demand environment with shifting client priorities. And that makes it a little difficult to get clear longer-term fixes on exactly where we are in terms of revenue and so on and so forth. We'll continue to do everything we possibly can to strengthen our internal processes and to give you and the rest of our investors a clear -- as clear a picture as we can. That's been our historical approach. At this point, I don't see sort of fundamental internal operational issues that would require us to retool the way we forecast or anything like that fundamentally. But we continue to look at that just all the time and look at how we, ourselves, can run better and run different, just as we explain that to our clients.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And just a very quick follow-up on that. The 2 points of growth -- or at least 2 points, I guess, of growth that you're expecting, you -- renew deals to add to next year's growth rate. I mean, would you characterize the degree of conservatism around those 2 points of growth the same way you would the degree of conservatism for the back half of 2014? Or is it still just a little bit early to really know what those -- what the ramp on those deals is going to look like? Because it seems like that could end up being a very significant swing factor in determining whether or not next year's growth rate could potentially accelerate a little bit versus this year's growth rate.","Gordon J. Coburn","Yes. I think the ramp is fairly clear, based on the assumption of timing of when it starts next year, and we've been a little bit conservative on the timing just to play it safe. Obviously, as we've said in our press release, the Health Net deal is subject to contract finalization and applicable regulatory approvals, which -- so we've got to get through that process. But we've been a bit conservative in terms of when the ramp actually starts.","Francisco D'souza","All right. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us today and for your questions. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.
