My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead.","Mike Wirth","All right. Thank you, Jonathan and welcome back. We missed you. I'd like to welcome everybody to Chevron's first quarter earnings call and webcast. Our new CFO, Pierre Breber and our Head of Investor Relations Wayne Borduin are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement and important information for investors and stockholders on slide 2.","Moving to slide 3, today, I'll make a few opening comments, Pierre will review first quarter results and then we'll take your questions. ","As I've said before, we're well positioned to win in any environment. During our Security Analyst Meeting, we shared that our advantaged portfolio, strong balance sheet and low breakeven, capital discipline and lower execution risk position us well to deliver superior shareholder returns. With the announced acquisition of Anadarko, our story gets even better. It builds strength on strength. We submitted our anti-trust filing yesterday to begin regulatory approvals. And we've begun joint integration planning. ","We know how to integrate two strong companies to create an even stronger one. We've done it well on prior transactions, and we'll do it again. We remain confident that the transaction agreed by Chevron and Anadarko will be completed. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre who will take you through the financial results.","Pierre R. Breber","Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 4, our disciplined returns focused approach to the business continues to drive solid earnings and cash flow. First quarter earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.39 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange losses, earnings were $2.8 billion or $1.47 per share. ","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $5.1 billion. Excluding working capital changes, it was $6.3 billion. We maintained a strong balance sheet with a debt ratio less than 20% at quarter end. During the first quarter we increased our quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, up 6%. Share repurchases during the quarter were around $500 million lower than our $1 billion per quarter guidance. During the quarter, we were restricted from buying back shares in light of the Anadarko acquisition. ","Turning to slide 5, despite lower refining and chemical margins, cash flow was solid and the trend is in line with full year guidance. Working capital effects in the quarter consumed $1.2 billion, generally consistent with our seasonal pattern. Free cash flow, excluding working capital changes was over $3 billion. Other cash flow items included pension contributions of about $325 million asset sale proceeds of around $300 million and TCO co-lending of $350 million. ","We continue to make progress high grading our portfolio. Total asset sale proceeds since the beginnings of 2018 are $2.3 billion and we remain on track to reach the low end of our current three year, $5 billion to $10 billion guidance range by the end of this year. ","Slide 6 compares first quarter 2019 earnings with first quarter 2018. Earnings declined from year ago, largely due to lower crude prices and weaker downstream and chemicals margins. Special items increased earnings by $120 million due to the absence of first quarter 2018, asset impairment. A swing in foreign exchange impact decreased earnings by $266 million. Excluding special items and FX, upstream earnings were relatively flat as higher production was offset by lower realizations. Downstream earnings decreased by about $500 million, mostly due to weaker refining and chemicals margins coupled with unfavorable timing affects. The variance in the other segment was primarily the result of higher corporate charges. ","Turning to slide 7, this compares results for first quarter 2019 with fourth quarter 2018. First quarter earnings were about $1 billion lower than the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange impact decreased earnings by $405 million between periods. This was partially offset by the absence of a project write-off. Excluding special items and FX upstream results were flat between quarters. Lower realizations and listings were offset by lower depreciation and operating expenses. ","Downstream earnings decreased by about $600 million, primarily due to unfavorable timing affects coupled with lower refining and marketing margins. These impacts were partly offset by lower turnaround activity this quarter. The variance in the other segment largely reflects an unfavorable swing in corporate tax items. ","On slide 8 first quarter 2019 oil equivalent production increased 186,000 barrels a day or almost 7% from first quarter 2018. Production exceeded 3 million barrels per day for the second straight quarter. Shale and tight production increased 143,000 barrels per day. First quarter unconventional production in the Permian was 391,000 barrels per day, in line with our guidance and up 55%. Production for major capital projects, increased by 128,000 barrels per day, primarily due to Wheatstone, Hebron and Bigfoot. ","Base declines were 30,000 barrels per day, net of production from new wells notably in the Gulf of Mexico. The effects of unplanned downtime primarily at Gorgon reduced production by 29,000 barrels per day.","Now looking ahead, in upstream we continue to expect 2019 production growth to be 4% to 7% excluding 2019 asset sales. We closed on the sale of our Denmark assets earlier this month and are evaluating bids on our UK North Sea assets.","Our full year guidance for TCO co-lending is unchanged at $2 billion, dependent upon price, investment profile and dividends. In downstream, we expect to close on the purchase of the Pasadena Refinery in the second quarter. We also expect high refinery turnaround activity, which equates to an estimated after tax earnings impact of more than $200 million.","For the second quarter, we expect restrictions on share repurchases to continue in light of the Anadarko acquisition. Post-closing, we expect to buy back shares at a rate of $1.25 billion per quarter. In the second quarter, we expect a pension contribution around $400 million. And our full year guidance for the other segment is unchanged at $2.4 billion.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Devin McDermott ","Great, good morning.","Mike Wirth","Good morning, Devin. ","Devin McDermott ","So I wanted to start, so I'm sure it'll be asked if I don't, just on the Anadarko deal and the process there, appreciate the additional color in the prepared remarks. First, can you just walk through and remind is what the timeline is and key milestones and process from here, and any comments you can make on the competing off from RCU [ph] would be helpful as well. I'll leave to you, is that how you like?","Mike Wirth","Sure. So the timeline is, probably a little different today than I would have told you a couple of weeks ago because we now have Anadarko\u2019s Board back considering a unsolicited proposal. We made -- our anti-trust filing. I mentioned that, that went in yesterday. We don't see any material, anti-trust or anti-competitive issues that arise from the combination, and so we would expect that to be handled within a pretty reasonable period of time, say 60 days. Depends if they come back for a second review with any questions. And then we have an Anadarko shareholder vote, that will be scheduled and could result in a third quarter close. ","So I think we've always said second half of this year. And so that would be the -- that would be the timeline. I think we're going to wait and see what -- Anadarko Board has said they're reviewing this unsolicited offer. And so we\u2019ll that obviously will have some bearing on the overall timeline.","Devin McDermott ","Understood. Makes sense.","Mike Wirth","Thanks, Devin. Do you have a follow-up.","Devin McDermott ","Yeah, one follow up. I just wanted to shift over to TCO and the co-lending. You mentioned the guidance there is unchanged, but any color you can give us on the shaping and how we should think about that playing out throughout the year.","Pierre R. Breber","Yeah, Devon, this is Pierre, I mean, you should view it as you know, roughly ratable and but again, it'll vary depending on prices and project spending and affiliate dividends. But if you think of it being roughly ratable during the course of the year that's appropriate at this point in time.","Devin McDermott ","Thank you very much. ","Mike Wirth","Thanks, Devin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Phil Gresh","Hey, good morning. First question, in light of the competing bid that's put out there and the details behind that, I think one thing that surprised investors would be perhaps the degree of synergies that Occi talked about in their proposed transaction, even if you back out the capital reduction component. And so I think, you've been asked about the degree of conservatism already to some degree about your synergy forecast. But now that's out there, I was just wondering if maybe you'd have a comment about your numbers and where upside could come from.","Mike Wirth","Sure, Phil, so look, I'm not going to comment on the details of another offer. I'll tell you our synergies are real and we're confident, our ability to achieve the $2 billion in run rate synergies in the first year post close, and delivering significant value from the deal. ","As I mentioned earlier, we've already begun joint integration meetings with Anadarko. We had full teams from both companies meeting for multiple days this week already. We're committed to delivering the synergies. We've got a strong history of successfully integrating two companies and meeting and often exceeding our synergy targets, this can go back to Gulf [ph], it can go to Texaco, it can go to Unical [ph]. ","And so this is something we've done before and we're very good at it, we're very confident that we can, that we can deliver the $2 billion. And as we know what we know, at this point, and as we get more detail, we certainly will know more. ","The other thing that I'll just mention is we have great confidence that we can accelerate value realization in the Permian, which is not really reflected in the cost synergies. We've indicated that we can see increased capital spending and increased activity in the Permian. We've got a strong contiguous position that results from this transaction. We've get a royalty position that that we can accelerate value from. And we will absolutely be able to deliver strong performance out of there. ","We benchmark very aggressively in the Permian on a virtually continuous basis. We benchmark well performance, well design, completion, design, execution performance, cycle time, service facilities, efficiency, OpEx unit costs, realization, all the financial metrics and do that on a regular basis. And we have a strong performing Permian business that will bring realizations and value forward that is not in that $2 billion. ","And so I think you can -- you can feel very confident that we will deliver and as we see more value there, we will be talking to you about it.","Phil Gresh","Okay, fair enough. Just a follow-up question would be, obviously there's more to an acquisition than just the price offered, and I was hoping maybe you could help us think through why your lower priced offer should win from your perspective, and if Anadarko's Board is forced to go back and quantitatively decide that this is -- your offer's not good enough, is there a point at which -- that if you look at this and -- not consider raising a bid, because its return's destructive [ph] to you to do so.","Mike Wirth","Sure. Well I won't speak for the Anadarko Board, but even with the information that was made public this week our offer was viewed by Anadarko as superior. And we have a signed merger agreements approved unanimously by the Boards of both companies. We strongly believe the combination of our two companies create superior long term value for shareholders of the combined company. The industrial logic of our transaction is very compelling.","Anadarko's assets further strengthen already leading positions that we have in large and attractive shale, deep water and natural gas basins. It enables a further portfolio high grade and cost reductions and focused investments and an even stronger company. Our financial position and balance sheet strength enables us to take on the leverage and issue the additional equity and still continue to increase shareholder distributions. ","Our companies simply have the best strategic fit. We can operate in the Gulf of Mexico in ways that others cannot. We're a world class operator of LNG, we've got leading performance in many different dimensions in the Permian. And that strong balance sheet mitigates risk. We won't be over levered coming out of the deal, we will be financially strong, with accretive cash flow and earnings and full and certain value. ","There's no shareholder vote required to approve the transaction and there is strong upside, in what is already a very strong currency in Chevron stock. So I think there are a whole host of reasons why we have a very compelling transaction.","Thanks Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please. ","Paul Sankey","Hi, everyone. Good afternoon from London. Mike, when we think about the potential for you to bid higher, we look at your balance sheet, and obviously there's a tremendous amount of firepower there, but we suspect it's not how you would be looking at potentially adding to your bid. Can you talk about the metrics that you're looking at in terms of Anadarko value to Chevron? Thank you.","Pierre R. Breber","Yeah, and I want to close off. Phil actually asked a question that I failed to get to at the end of that last answer, which kind of ties to this? And Phil, yes, there is a -- we've been very disciplined as we've approached this, as we've looked at valuation. And I think you said, is there a point at which you're done? And of course the answer to that is yes, there is. And this isn't the time to address that specifically, but we've said we will do things that are value creating for our shareholders and we don't need to do anything. We got a very strong story without doing a transaction. ","So Paul, to your question, we look at a whole host of metrics. And some of the primary ones are the accretion metrics. Does this give us accretive free cash flow after capital spending, does it give us creative earnings, do we get a strong return on this investment, and does it give us the investment queue, the investment set and opportunities over time to continue to improve return on capital, which the entire industry is working to improve, and this does. It gives us over 10 billion barrels of resource at less than $3 a barrel, which is an attractive resource acquisition cost. And so there are a whole host of metrics like that, that are the ones that we look at. ","Mike Wirth","Yeah, and, Paul, I don't know if your question was getting to the mix of the equity and cash. I mean, we've talked about the 75, 25 was mutually agreed to. Anadarko shareholders wanted exposure to our stock. We have a very good stock. But clearly we have the capacity to have alternative structures. We could put more -- we could have put more cash in if that's what Anadarko wanted to do, but we agreed to where we ended up.","Paul Sankey","Yeah, I realize Mike, that you've talked about free cash flow, sort of point, [indiscernible] accretion I should say, from your point this needs to be the single metric that we should look at. We\u2019re just wondering how to think about that.","Mike Wirth","So Paul, sorry, Was there another follow-up question in there?","Paul Sankey","No, I think the other aspect was that you said if you can't [indiscernible] up, which is obviously a tough thing to measure. But it does seem that you have a great fit. Could you talk a little bit about Mozambique and how you see that? I think that's one of the differentiators between potentially between you and Occi. Thanks.","Mike Wirth","Sure, as I discussed on the call a couple of weeks ago, we view Mozambique as a world class gas resource. We are pleased with the progress the product has made. It's a very cost competitive LNG project. And that matters. We do not intend to slow the project timeline down. We think that there's a good team of people working on this and that they've done a good job. ","I plan to visit Mozambique soon to see the site and visit with both government leaders and people working on the project there. And we think that this fits well into our portfolio and with our strengths. And so we like the project. We think we can bring some value. We've got the balance sheet to support the project. We've got experience in things like shipping that, this will have a large shipping component. So I think there are ways we can improve and enhance execution and value and mitigate risk in execution of the project. ","Thanks, Paul. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. ","Jason Gammel","Thanks very much. I guess my first question is related to your ability to operate in the Permian. And the reason I say that is, the competing bidder has talked about their ability to create the most return enhancement and their superiority as an operator. So Mike can you address where you think you benchmark relative to competition in terms of Permian development right now?","Mike Wirth","Yeah, I mentioned earlier that we benchmark a wide range of metrics and you really need to look at performance in it's -- in all the dimensions. And there are ways that we've seen in the past Permian operators that will optimize certain metrics particular things like early production. We don't -- we are very careful about choke management to deliver the best ultimate recovery. But there are other operators that run with their chokes wide open and can show very strong early production numbers you look at it year out and there's quite a different picture that you see. ","So I think number one, I would say you have to be very careful about which metrics you look at and we're focused on value creation and returns. Short-term production is not the goal and we're really looking at driving ultimately long-term recoveries, capital efficient model that generates leading EURs, a low cost per barrel and high returns and you take that you put it together with an advantage royalty position and we can deliver value that is difficult for anyone else to match. ","And over time a company like ours has a technology capacity that few others have and we can add even more value as we drive costs down further as we improve recoveries and we see technology do what it always does, which is unlock greater degrees of performance. And so I will simply say that we look at our metrics and performance through a value lens and not a production lens. ","Jason Gammel","Appreciate that Mike. My follow-up question is at the time you announced the transaction you did raise the target on annual buybacks to 5 billion from what it had been before. I appreciate the run rates right now are affected by the transaction being in the public domain. But was the 5 billion -- was it increased to 5 billion contingent upon the deal completing or is that a run rate you would expect to have regardless.","Mike Wirth","It was an announcement we made to indicate our strong confidence in the cash flow accretive and value creation that this transaction enables and so it is tied to the transaction, and as I said we got a strong case pre-existing the transaction with increase from a run rate of 3 billion last year to run rate of 4 billion this year and so the step up to five was a signal that this deal makes us even stronger. ","Pierre R. Breber","Yeah, if I can just clarify on again the first quarter buybacks were lower as Jason as you said we had to stop buying back shares, we thought there was prudent when we believe we could be we could find yourself in possession material nonpublic information related to transaction. So we expect these restrictions to continue in the second quarter circumstances could change and we could be able to buybacks shares in time to time but right expect low to no buybacks in the second quarter. And then post-closing, we intent to increase the rate to the $5 billion annual or $1.25 billion per quarter.","Jason Gammel","Understood. Thanks guys.","Mike Wirth","Thanks Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please. ","Biraj Borkhataria","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just have one, on your expiration strategy and this also relates to Anadarko. But we look a long by the Permian in terms of synergies but it seems that is also quite little bit upside to exploration in the that if you combine the two portfolio and follow a infrastructure lead expiration strategy. ","Could you just talk a little bit about that and how you thinking about that on the basis that this transaction just closed? And then the second question is there was a couple of articles in the year around you transferring your Permian royalty interest into a new subsidiary I was wondering if there is anything to that or that just a non-news. Thank you. ","Mike Wirth","Okay, so the first one expiration in the Gulf of Mexico. We talked earlier about that we would see expiration synergies as we bring the two companies together and our expiration portfolios. And we talked about the fact that we would have a very powerful infrastructure position in the Deepwater. When you combine that with extended reach tiebacks which we're in the final phases of technical qualifications to significantly expand the tiebacks that we can do. ","We can cover a lot of the Gulf of Mexico without necessarily needing new surface infrastructure and this allows us to begin to explore for accumulations that might not be economic on a standalone basis to For accumulations that might not be economic on a standalone basis to support a new Greenfield project, but that could be developed through drilling and tie back into existing infrastructures, platforms as, as All Ridge opens up. ","And so it really enables a very different approach to exploration and I think a much higher return, shorter cycle, lower risk way to look at the next phase of development in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Not to say we might not have some Greenfield projects, because certainly there could be circumstances where that becomes the right economic outcome. ","I\u2019d also point out that we -- we're an equity holder in a discovery that was just announced this week, the Blacktip Discovery, which Shell is the operator on encountered over 400 feet of net pay, it's about 30 miles away from Perdido and whale. ","So we continue to see discoveries and we've got great strength in an area that has tremendous resource opportunity. And the challenge is to find ways to deliver it and generate better returns out of that. ","Your question on the Permian royalty, what we've done is consolidated all of our royalties into an entity which allows us to manage that royalty with focus and efficiency and insure that as activity in the Permian continues to grow, and we have a strong royalty position that royalty is properly accounted for collected and managed. It certainly opens up options to do things that you've seen others do. I don't want to indicate that we would or would not do that. But it certainly positions us with an entity that could enable those kinds of alternatives if at some point we saw that as one that was desirable.","Biraj Borkhataria","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. ","Neil Mehta","Good morning team and Congrats, Pierre again on the new role. So the first question I had was actually on the oil macro. Two months away from the OPEC meeting. Prices have clearly been very firm here off bottom in 2019. Mike just wanted your perspective on some of the moving pieces as it relates to the oil macro. Has your view that we're an age of abundance fundamentally changed as you've had a more conservative worldview? ","Or do you think price has been artificially lifted by OPEC cuts and how do you think about OPEC behavior from here, not asking you to forecast the price but your unique position to comment given the fact that you play across the value chain and you operate in some of these countries?","Mike Wirth","Yeah, so\u2026","Pierre R. Breber","Let me give you my best shot on that one today, Neil. You know, global demand continues to be strong. We're seeing demand go up by, over a million barrels per day again this year, we had a very strong GDP number for the first quarter in the U.S., I think, surprisingly strong that has come out. Today. and, you know, we've consistently said that we don't see evidence of weakening around the world. We're across the value chain in many different products and many different geographies. ","So, our economic growth looks solid and oil demand growth continues to march upward. You know, at the end of last year, as we saw some weakness, there were concerns about trade in China and economic activity and those have somewhat receded. ","On the supply side, you've got the usual set of dynamics underway, right. We've got geopolitical issues with the Iran waivers not being extended, which creates the prospect of some tightness Venezuela continues to be very difficult, Libya is in and out of the news. And so you have some of the same things that create concerns and real tightness, in some cases on the supply side, and then you have OPEC plus the non-OPEC countries, which for the last couple of years, maybe three years or so have demonstrated the resolve to manage their supply in a way that's consistent with more stable markets.","You throw on top of that commentary from the President, which again today, I guess he's out with comments about OPEC. And I think you still have OPEC in a place where they do play a role in creating a forward expectation on the supply side. And so in some ways the dynamics while the specifics of which countries might have supply issues and how the global demand picture rich countries might have supply issues and how the global demand picture shapes up. It's a story of forward expectations on supply and demand and then the geopolitical overlay that can change that. ","Fundamentally, we still believe that the world needs more of all types of energy and so we're in favor of renewable energy, we're in favor of conventional energy and economics markets and technology sorting out what the best mix is each country around the world. There is no shortage of resource to be developed. And so a cost matter and we continue to drive to be very competitive from a cost and supply standpoint. So I'm not I gave anything really brand new there, but that\u2019s how I see it. ","Neil Mehta ","That's helpful. The follow up from our side is if we were to take the Anadarko transaction out of the equation, one of the concerns, some investors have expressed over the course of the year has been the Chevron have the portfolio that will drive in 2023 to 2028. And you kind of gave us some flavor of what that looks like at the Analyst Day post the Permian Ramp and post thingies what's the next wage of growth and sort of it begs the question was the Anadarko eventual transaction and all sense this transaction where a these types of transaction. So I just want to give you an opportunity to respond to that, because I think your view here is that you do have a standalone opportunities at independent transaction but certainly something that's been brought up by investors. ","Mike Wirth","Yeah, absolutely, I said it in March, and I will say it. so again we do not have resource anxiety, we've been replacing reserves. We've got nearly 70 billion barrels of resource. We've given transparency on the production outcome for five years because people have wanted to see a longer view on that. And so you see this 3% to 4% growth now steadily being delivered over five years which is been difficult for companies to do consistently over an extended period of time at the scale that our company operates. ","We're very confident that we can do that. and we stopped at five years just as a matter of convention not because we think there is a problem after that. And so unconventionals don't flatten out after that. ","Our Permian position has got decades of resource not a few years. We tried to highlight our other shale and type resource position which are in the very early stages of development and continue to have very strong performance metrics and economics that our converging on Permian level economics which is really the goal that we've put in front of them. I've already talked on a call a little bit about deepwater where we've got Anchored Baltimore, Whale, Blacktip now. ","We've got the ability to bring tie backs into a larger system or into the existing system, your question is ex the Anadarko transaction. We've got acreage in Brazil in Mexico in West Africa. So there are positions around the world and we've got, we're still operating in Venezuela where there is an enormous amount of resource and one day that will begin to be developed again. We got production offline and the partition zone. ","I'll stop there but I'll simply say that the opportunities for us to invest in and develop resource that we hold today extends well beyond 2023 and it's a function of which projects competes the best for capital investments. A lot of short cycle stuff in there that is a pretty low risk and then there are some longer cycle things that are large and I think you'll see a blend of those deliver strong economic outcomes which is what drives our decision not production targets, but I think the cupboard is full not empty. ","Neil Mehta ","Thanks guys. ","Mike Wirth","Thanks Neil. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons Energy. Your question please?","Blake Fernandez ","Thanks guys good morning. Pierre I'm sorry to flag the buyback, but I just want to make sure I'm 100% clear on this. Is it fair to say 2Q buyback should essentially be zero and assuming that is the case, even when you ramp up to 1.25 per quarter, obviously than on a full year basis, we're going to come in below that $4 billion number due to Anadarko deal. Is that the correct way to look at it. ","Pierre R. Breber","Yeah, essentially and let me just restate it. So yeah, the $4 billion guidance was -- did not anticipate the transaction or an acquisition at the time. There are two sort of restrictions that we're operating under. One is when we're in possession of material non-public information we're not allowed to buy back shares. Even if and when that clears itself there are other restrictions on buybacks when there is a business combination happening and equities being issued. ","So you can't buybacks during the proxy solicitation are other limitations on buybacks versus historical rates. So we're just operating under a different regime here during the transaction. Post-closing absolutely we have talked about the gross debt ratio being below 20%. Lots of capacity to increase it. So there could be some buybacks but again the guidance is low or no buybacks in the second quarter and then when we get post-closing, we will be a able to achieve the guidance and won't be encumbered by restrictions tied to the acquisition. ","Blake Fernandez","Very clear, thank you. The second question is really on the Permian and the more on the gas side. I know you've worked a lot to get firm take away capacity on the crude side, Wahoo pricing is been really weak. Can you talk about, I guess what alleviation avenues you have on that side as far as take away or improving your price realizations as you continue to grow there?","Mike Wirth","Yeah, I will take that Blake and then Pierre might have some perspective as well. We have got take away capacity for all our production and so whether it's oil, NGLs or gas we are moving it and taking it to market. We are not engaged in routine flaring and would not intends to flare gas to enable production. And we had little bit of dry gas. ","So if you don't have liquids right now, sometimes it's better just keep that gas in the ground for a better market. Our current production in the Permian is 75% liquids and 25% gas. We're focusing on liquid rich ventures, and as we described and you alluded to we been looking at take away capacity several quarters ahead of our production the entire time here. ","I think what you've seen in the market is something that you should expect to see for a number of years in the future, which is you got a lot of people out there that are developing resource, you got a lot of people, investing in the midstream infrastructure and there are going to be times when those all sync up and you see pretty normal transportation type differentials and you'll see other periods of time where the market may anticipate some tightness and you will see the differentials widen out. ","I know Wahoo has been pretty ugly here lately. Kinder Morgan's got some pipes that come online this year and next year, which would probably start to change that equation, you know, the Mexico market has been a little slow to come than people expected. And we got some Wahoo exposure in our portfolio, but it's not anything that is material in the scope of our company and I think we're, like I said we are well positioned on the take away capacity across all the commodities quarter production in the future. ","Blake Fernandez","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby from UBS. Your question please.","Jonathon Rigby","Thanks for taking my question. It's around the CapEx side and the capital side of the transaction actually. The first is something I don\u2019t think has got enough attention is the high grading process that will that you intend to indulge in after the deal closes. I just wanted to explore that because as we think about -- as we start to look at the future combination, we need to think about what it is you might be doing around that. ","So I just wanted to confirm whether you see that as part of the value proposition, there's actually value to be delivered through that disposal process of the portfolio management that you can do. ","Second is whether that processes is already underway? And thirdly, whether you can maybe lift the curtain a little and give us some idea about not necessarily assets but the kind of thought that you have around the type of portfolio you'd like to merge with, the things that you will be, the criteria which will be using. ","And then the second question if I would just add somewhat lengthy. The billion dollars of CapEx efficiencies that you identified as part of the transaction, can you confirm that those are about doing the same thing for less, rather than just ramping down activities so we just can't compare like-for-like. Thanks.","Mike Wirth","Okay, well, there is a lot in there, Jon. That was well done. So let me start with the portfolio and try to frame that up for you. And then I'll come to the capital. ","You asked about the process, we've got an ongoing process where we look at and high grading our portfolio. You know, we've had $2 billion to $3 billion in assets sales kind of on average, over a long period of time. We're continuing, always looking to high grade that portfolio from a strategic alignment standpoint, the ability to compete for capital, what the assets are, that will allow us to compete and deliver strong returns into the future. And oftentimes those may not be the same ones that satisfied that criteria in the past.","As I thought last week, I mentioned to people if you go back about 15 years, when you think about our upstream portfolio, Tengiz was our real flagship asset. It was in the process of an expansion with SGI SGP that took 100% production from 350 to 650 or 7,000 barrels a day, our share of that was half. So we were on the way to the asset that we have today. And the Permian was kind of out of sight out of mind for most people. ","Our Australia LNG projects had not been sanctioned, none of our LNG products have been sanctioned. And we were just beginning to move on off the shelf into the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. If you think about it today, in Australia, we're producing 400,000 barrels of equivalent at nice cash margins. Tengiz is on its way to a million barrels a day on 100% basis, our share half of that, so 500,000 a day. ","The Permian we outlined is on its way to 900,000 barrels a day, our share and it doesn't stop when we get to that number. The Deepwater is with the combination the two companies is pushing close to 400,000 a day. So we now have four positions that have scale, that have resource depth and length, that have strong economics, that have lots of running room. And we have the ability to drive costs down and returns up through the way we manage and invest in those resources over time. ","So it's a very different portfolio than when we would have had. Just one smaller asset and a lot of other ones that we\u2019re required to have the scale to compete. So we need to take a look at the rest of our portfolio and determine those assets that really can\u2019t still compete for capital and offer the low cost, high return characteristics, the resource length, and will compete for capital over time.","I hope you're still with us, Jon, it sounds like you might be back\u2026 ","Jonathon Rigby","Yes, sorry. It's the classic timing of the annual -- the weekly test, apologies for that.","Mike Wirth","All right, I'll be quick so you can comply. So we got a different portfolio and we will look to make some decisions on those assets that really will compete for capital that offer the resource potential and the value for our shareholders over time, what those are we will disclose as we get into transactions. ","The capital that we've indicated -- you should think of it as both reductions in spend between the two companies and efficiency in that spent. So we'll look at contracts and the ability to execute and drive capital efficiency into the system and also drive overall spend down, while at the same time investing more in the Permian, which is what we indicated our intention is to do. So we will squeeze capital out of the combined system, we will squeeze efficiency into the combined system. And we will find ways to accelerate activity in the Permian which will bring value forward. ","Pierre R. Breber","And just to add, and we maintained a 3% to 4% guidance on production through 2023 as a combined company. ","Jonathon Rigby","Right, cool. Thank you and I'm perfectly safe. Thank you. ","Mike Wirth","Okay. I'm glad to hear that, Jon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","Roger Read","Yeah. Good morning. Hopefully, you can hear me and I don't believe there are any problems in the background right now. I guess, Mike kind of an unusual situation here in terms of the bidding and typically you put your teams together, you expect them to be very focused going forward. I was wondering in an environment like this, do you end up having to divert people's attention to dealing with what may be an ongoing process here in terms of the Anadarko bid. And then how do you think about managing your way through that, kind of keeping everybody doing the things they need to do, plus the team that's focused here on the merger and integration and all that stuff?","Mike Wirth","Look, I mentioned that we've put together joint integration teams already and that they met this week. And this isn't just a small group of people. This was a sizable group of people that spent multiple days together. And we've got a playbook for doing this. We did Unical a decade ago, Texaco a few years before that. We have some of the same people involved that lead those integrations. And and so, people have their eye on the ball and are focused on moving forward with things. ","So just to remind everybody, we've got a signed deal that's been approved by both boards. And we're moving forward with integration planning so we can deliver value.","Roger Read","Okay, well, good luck on that. Maybe to flip back and actually think about the operations here. In the quarter. We saw a little lighter on the gas side globally, stronger on the crude side. Just curious how much of that is we had some unplanned downtime I believe in Australia with the LNG. As you look going for this kind of global mix between oil and gas and taking into account maybe some dry gas remain shut into the Permian for a while.","Mike Wirth","Yeah, I mean, I do think what you saw was primarily some downtime at one of the trends in Australia Gorgon. And because that's a bigger part of our portfolio now and we've got a train down for some work we will see that. The dry gas isn't a big number and so I wouldn't worry about that too much. There's also some weather in Australia that they create an impact. There's a cyclone that came through and we had to take some slowdowns at both Wheatstone and Gorgon, as we rode through that. So but those are really the things that are hitting the gas production.","Roger Read","Just real quick, if I could follow up on that, is there any plan downtime between Gorgon and Wheatstone we should consider as we look at the rest of the year?","Mike Wirth","Yeah, we're moving into normal turnaround mode now for both of those. The plan at Gorgon would be to only have one train down in any given year. And so our plan right now would be to execute train one on Gorgon later this year. The upstream in aggregate from a turnaround standpoint, the turnaround season begins really in the second quarter. You can think about the third quarter as probably the heaviest quarter because we'll have one of the KTL lines at TCO in turnaround there. And then as we go third into fourth quarter, you'll see one train at Gorgon down for a turnaround. But it's we're into the normal operations and turnaround cycle with LNG plants. ","Pierre R. Breber","And Roger, this is Pierre. I mean, we generally will provide guidance if there's heavy upstream turnaround activity in the earnings call.","Roger Read","Appreciate that. Thank you guys. ","Pierre R. Breber","Thanks, Roger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.","Doug Leggate","Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting on the call. Mike. As you know, we are big fans of what you guys have done here, but I want to ask a little bit of a sensitive question, if I may. There's been some speculation, I guess, some fact checking in the press that given the Anadarko already had a bid in hands from Occi, as per their letter, they then went ahead and increased their change of control for their senior management. I wonder if you could speak to your opinion on that. And how what perspective you would offer in terms of perhaps the history of your, your discussions that may be led to that point. Obviously it's a little bit sensitive, but it's something that some shareholders are raising some concern about.","Mike Wirth","Yeah, Doug, there are numerous aspects of our negotiation in the deal that will be explained in the S4 filing, it is premature and inappropriate for me to comment on any of the aspects of how this all came together. I'd encourage you just to read the S4 when it's filed.","Doug Leggate","Okay, I knew it was going to be a tough one to answer. So I appreciate you trying. My more specific question to Gorgon [ph]. Obviously post deal, those are going to be a very significant tailwind from synergies and all the things that you've laid out. One assumes that if you did match the higher bid, does that change anything by way of your buy plans, that would then go through that to any of those kind of issues. And what I'm really getting at is that if for some reason you did hit a high bar or you did not decide to move forward and not event I realize it's unlikely, but the bulk of your future growth due to '2023 is largely it looks like a lot of it is coming from Permian gas. ","So I'm just curious how absent this deal, would you be able to sustain the buybacks and commit to a strong growth trajectory for dividends? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Mike Wirth","Yeah, I'm not going to speculate on what Anadarko\u2019s Board may do and how that plays out. I'll just tell you in our base case, we produce 75% liquids in the Permian. So it's not primarily gas. We've indicated that we expect to see our industry leading cash margins sustained as the production grows.","And that we've initiated a buyback program that we intend to stick with through any reasonable commodity price environment. And so there are not risks to the cash that would support shareholder distributions here in the vein of what you're talking about. So we're very confident in the plan we've laid out and our ability to deliver.","Thanks, Doug. ","Mike Wirth","Good luck. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question please.","Mike Wirth","Sam. Might be muted.","Sam Margolin","Can you hear me now. ","Mike Wirth","Yes, we can. ","Sam Margolin","Just muted. Sorry about that. I just have a quick question. We've been through a lot on the Anadarko topic already. I've got a question for Pierre, a follow up to the TCO topic earlier. You know, if TCO keeps taking up the co-lending program, theoretically, it's to preserve dividends. But if that's happening at the same time that commodity prices are broadly higher than what was planned for, does that flow into the Chevron Capital program as sort of like a net cash surprise or is the authorization part of your sort of free cash flow outlook and it's not dynamic what TCO decides to do? ","And then just as a follow-up, like if it's the former, does Chevron then have headroom to rotate cash at the Chevron level into other things like Permian, incremental Permian, for example.","Pierre Breber","Yeah, thanks. No, the financing doesn't impact capital, how we characterize capital. So the capital is going to be what is invested in the project. Again, that's affiliate capital. So non cash capital. What can vary is where I thought you were going is if prices are higher than there's clearly more cash generation within TCO and therefore their ability to balance making investments and paying dividends is easier. And you might pull less on the loan. So again, we're giving guidance on the financing but it is subject to prices -- level of investments that are happening and the level of dividends. All of those are in interplay. ","But if prices stay higher, longer than that gives them more flexibility to either decrease the lending or the borrowings or increase the dividends. In either case, that's more cash to the company, it shows up in different parts of the cash flow statement. But in either case, does not affect CapEx.","Sam Margolin","Okay, yeah, that's why I was asking because it sounded like there was a potential outcome where TCO is self-funding and inclusive of the dividend, but they still uptake the co-lending, in which case, you've got like surplus cash, but I guess it's not, it wouldn't affect anything else. So okay. All right, thank you very much. ","Mike Wirth","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Your question, please. ","Jason Gabelman","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I'm not going to ask about the Anadarko, deal, because it seems like it's been covered on the call. I want to actually ask about what's going on in California right now, just given you guys are -- have a pretty big footprint in the state Congress is in the process of reviewing a bill to kind of institute a change in how oil production goes on there, kind of the setback rule similar to what Colorado tried to put forth. I'm wondering, what do you see as potential risks, if any, to your portfolio in the state, both on the refining side, and the production side, relative to that regulation? Thanks.","Mike Wirth","Okay. Jason. Yeah. So California has pretty aggressive ideas on regulating our industry and what you referred to is AB 345 which is in the assembly right now, wouldn\u2019t impact downstream at all. It's really -- you think of it is analogous to what has been going on in Colorado and the primary concern is setbacks for activity. Our portfolio in California is primarily in the San Joaquin Valley and it tends to be an area where it's not populated the same way the LA basin is, which is where historically there was a lot of the roots of our company and a lot of the industry trace their way back into the LA basin. ","And so there you got a much more densely populated urban and suburban land-use metrics and concerns about the proximity of drilling activities to residential schools commercial et cetera is really what's behind this. ","So we're working closely with state government to ensure they understand the impacts, others in industry and trade associations are as well. And so it's prospective legislation that is being considered here. It really impact permitting for new wells doesn't impact things that are already in production and we get a big producing business that's online today and then I think our portfolio is in part of the state that would likely be less impacted than if our production were more heavily concentrated into the LA basin. ","Mike Wirth","Okay, thank you very much. Jason I think we are right about the top of the hour here and I know everybody's busy on a Friday. So want to thank everyone for your time today. Appreciate your interest in Chevron and your participation on the call today. ","Jonathan back over to you.

My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","All right. Good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations.","We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown here on slide two.","I'll begin with a discussion of our second quarter 2017 financial results and Jay will then provide an update on our Upstream business prior to my concluding remarks.","Turning now to slide three, an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $1.5 billion or $0.77 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $430 million as well as asset sale gains of $160 million. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange gains of $3 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $1.7 billion or $0.91 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations for the quarter was $5 billion, reflecting high margin production growth and strong Downstream performance. Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations was $5.3 billion.","At quarter-end, debt balances stood at approximately $43 billion, more than $3 billion lower than where we began the year. Our debt ratio is currently 22.7%. During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week we announced a dividend of $1.08 per share payable to stockholders of record as of August 2017. We currently yield 4.1%.","Turning to slide four. Year-to-date, net cash generation after dividends was $1 billion including $200 million generated in the second quarter. This result is a solid down payment on our full year objective of being cash balanced at $50 Brent including asset sales. Cash flow from operations was $5 billion in the quarter, up $2.5 billion from the second quarter of 2016. Year-to-date, cash from operations has totaled $8.9 billion despite working capital consumption and adverse deferred tax impacts, each sized at approximately $1.2 billion, as well as affiliate earnings exceeding dividends by $1.4 billion. Cash capital spend for the quarter was $3.2 billion, approximately $1.3 billion less than the second quarter of 2016.","We continued to reduce our spend by finishing our major capital projects under construction and driving capital efficiency gains throughout our investment queue. Second quarter asset sale proceeds were approximately $430 million primarily from the sale of proxies in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado and some on the Gulf of Mexico shelf.","Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect our cash outcomes to favorably reflect growing production and additional proceeds from asset sales. Despite some anticipated unevenness between third quarter and fourth quarter, for example related to the precise timing of sales transactions, pension contributions and affiliate dividends, we do fully expect to end the year in a cash balance position at current prices.","Slide five compares current-quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2017 results were $2.9 billion higher than second quarter 2016. Special items, primarily the absence of $2.4 billion in second quarter's 2016 net charges, partially offset by current period net charges of $270 million improved earnings by $2.1 billion between periods. An unfavorable movement in foreign exchange negatively impacted the earnings comparison by $276 million between periods.","Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased nearly $950 million between periods. Increased volumes and higher realization as well as lower operating expenses were partially offset by increased DD&A associated with increased production.","Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased nearly $380 million primarily driven by higher margins and a swing in timing effects. The variance in the Other segment was primarily due to unfavorable corporate tax items. As we've indicated previously, quarterly results in the Other segment are likely to be non-ratable and we continued to guide to $1.6 billion in annual net charges for this segment.","I'll now pass it over to Jay.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Thank you, Pat. Slide six compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter 2017 production was 2.78 million barrels a day, an increase of 252,000 barrels a day or 10% over the second quarter of 2016. Major capital projects increased production by 265,000 barrels per day as we started and ramped up multiple projects including Gorgon, Angola LNG, Jack\/St. Malo, Alder, Moho Nord, Mafumeira Sul and Bangka. Shale and tight production increased by 41,000 barrels a day primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian. The increases were partially offset by normal field declines and PFE effects. The other bar includes the loss of 38,000 barrels a day due to 2016 asset sales.","Turning to slide seven. Year-to-date 2017 production is 2.73 million barrels a day. Up 5% from 2016 and within our guidance range of 4% to 9% growth excluding asset sales. Our expectation is that full year production will be well within our original guidance range. The ramp-up of production in the second quarter was strong, with June's monthly production at 2.85 million barrels per day. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect to see reliable production from the assets that are currently onstream, further growth in the Permian and Wheatstone coming online. Some of these increases will be offset in the third quarter due to normal turnaround activity.","Year-to-date there's been no impact on production from 2017 asset sales since the first transactions involving producing assets closed on June 30. Assets sold year-to-date and assets expected to be sold later this year have a combined daily production of around 175,000 barrels per day. The impact on full year 2017 production from asset sales is expected to be 25,000 to 75,000 barrels a day given the late in year timing for the sales.","Turning to slide eight. We're seeing strong performance at Gorgon. All three trains have achieved or exceeded nameplate capacity and are operating smoothly. On a 100% basis, second quarter Gorgon production was 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is currently averaging around 430,000 barrels a day. We are currently producing around 3 billion cubic feet of gas a day from 14 wells. In the second quarter, domestic gas sales were approximately 125 million cubic feet per day and condensate production was around 14,000 barrels a day. We shipped 88 LNG cargoes so far this year.","Looking forward, we're focused on achieving sustained operations and are analyzing plant performance to find opportunities to increase reliability and production. Additional fine tuning of the plant will maximize efficiency and we expect further debottlenecking opportunities to increase plant capacity.","Turning to slide nine. We're on track at Wheatstone. The Wheatstone platform and pipeline are operational and supplying natural gas to the inlet of the onshore LNG plant. Early well performance is encouraging. We're in the process of starting up the plant and expect to commence cool-down shortly. LNG production is expected to follow next month. Train 2 construction is progressing well and we're on track to start up six to eight months after Train 1.","Turning to slide 10. The future growth project, or FGP, is progressing well, and I'll highlight some milestones. Module fabrication is in progress in Korea and Kazakhstan, as is the fabrication of gas turbine generators in Italy. Dredging is essentially complete, and other activities required for the initiation of port operations are on track. Infrastructure work and site construction are progressing, and we're 75% complete with our piloting program. We have two drilling rigs in operation on multi-well pads, with a third rig expected in August. We're on track for first production in 2022.","In addition to FGP, we're also making progress on a number of other major capital projects. At Hebron, offshore Canada, the platform's been installed on location and we expect first oil before year-end 2017. Projects expected to come online in 2018 include Clair Ridge in the North Sea, where offshore hookup and commissioning is well underway; the Stampede platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which was recently installed on location; the Big Foot platform, which is preparing for sail away around the end of this year; and Tahiti, where we're progressing the Vertical Expansion project. These projects are expected to add approximately 20,000 net barrels of new production in 2018 and 65,000 net barrels in 2019.","Let's turn to slide 11. This is an updated map of the Permian Basin including Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our two million acres, 1.5 million of which are Midland and Delaware Basins, are depicted in blue. Outlined on the map are our Chevron-operated and non-operated development areas. Additionally, on the right side of the chart, we've included an updated version of our assessment of acreage valuation. Currently, we estimate that approximately 650,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 an acre, and an additional 450,000 acres have a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is a mix. Some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation. Some lacks nearby infrastructure, and other requires further appraisal. As a reminder, these estimates are a snapshot that assumes simultaneous development at a $50 WTI price, burdened with all the development and production costs as we see them today.","Let's turn to slide 12. This slide illustrates our returns-focused Permian development strategy. We're investing for value. We're applying technology and learning from others to drive capital efficiency. Let me provide a few examples of how we're using technology as a competitive advantage. We're using seismic data to detect variations in the properties of reservoirs to identify the optimal areas. We're then applying petrophysical modeling to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of rocks and their contained fluids, and we integrate geophysical information with production data to identify the most productive intervals, and to select well locations that offer the highest returns.","We perform focused data analytic studies to optimize horizontal well placement and well spacing decisions. To do this, we have a comprehensive database of industry wells with production, completion, reservoir, and operational data. We also use this data to optimize our completions for proppant loading, cluster spacing, and liquid loading. During drilling operations, we use well and model data to make precise wellbore placement decisions to keep the well path within the most productive depth, often within a 10-foot interval.","Our Integrated Operations Center provides support to our field personnel, who have access to real-time, operational data on mobile devices. As an example, real-time equipment information, such as excessive compressive vibration, can provide an early indication of a potential problem, allowing us to react before downtime occurs. But the real key in all this is effectively applying the technology to deliver better outcomes. We also learn by watching others. The graphs on the right side are one example of how we successfully combine our application of technology with our learning from others.","The initial six months' recoveries per lateral foot are highlighted on the charts for wells in two different benches. In red are the actual results of Competitor A, who's a strong growth player in the basin, employing a strategy of speed to the development of the second Bone Spring and Avalon horizons in the Delaware Basin. They got there first, they drilled aggressively in each horizon, and they demonstrated production growth. However, their strategy of trial and error required them to spend significant capital. We've learned from their experience. The blue on the chart shows our actual results in the same horizons. For a similar number of wells, we're recovering more production per foot, and our cost per foot is lower than our competitor. Our strategy is working. We believe real value is created through capital efficiency and discipline, as well as strong, consistent execution.","Let's go to slide 13. This chart illustrates three elements of financial performance. Our current financial metrics, the competitiveness of our current spend, and the attractiveness of returns for future investments. First, our unconventional Permian business, fully loaded with overhead cost, has positive after-tax earnings for the first half of 2017. We forecast earnings growth, even at flat prices in future periods, as a result of lower unit operating costs and depreciation rates. Our depreciation rates are expected to further decline as we cycle through prior invested capital and replace it with today's more efficient development costs. At actual 2017 oil, gas, and NGL prices, our year-to-date operating cash flow per barrel is approximately $20 and is accretive to Chevron's overall portfolio.","Second, our unit development and operating costs are competitive and declining. The chart on the right compares our company operated with our non-operated JV costs. As you can see, cost reduction progress has been encouraging, and we are increasingly competitive. And third, the Permian is an attractive place to make future investments. We estimate, as noted in the box at the bottom, that our 2017 investments in the Permian, fully loaded with overhead, will generate greater than 30% returns at a $50 a barrel WTI price.","Turning to slide 14. We're actively managing our Permian portfolio through acreage swaps, joint ventures, farm-outs and sales. This chart shows our historical and forecasted transaction activity in the Midland and Delaware Basins. We've identified between 150,000 and 200,000 acres in the Midland and Delaware Basins that we plan to transact to generate more immediate value. A recent transaction effectively more than tripled the value of our acreage simply by enabling longer laterals. Generally, the highest value transactions are swaps to core up acreage and enhance value through long laterals and other infrastructure efficiencies. In 2017, we've already closed seven deals and have grouped the remaining acreage into a number of packages that are actively being marketed.","Slide 15. Production continues to track ahead of expectations as we continue to see efficiency gains and improved well performance. The chart on the left shows our second quarter, 2017 production of approximately 178,000 barrels a day, up about 44,000 barrels a day from the second quarter of 2016. In March, we gave you our forecasted Permian compounded annual growth rate of 20% to 35%. And we're currently near the top of that range. Today, we're operating 13 rigs and our plan is to continue to add rigs approximately every eight to ten weeks achieving 20 operated rigs by the end of 2018. In addition to our operated fleet, we expect to see our share of production from non-operated rigs.","Our objective in the Permian is to generate value through capital and execution efficiency. We intend to be fully competitive on our unit development and production costs and realizations and use our superior royalty position to generate leading financial performance.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Pat.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","All right. Turning now to slide 16. We continue to see lower capital spending as well as lower operating expense outlays despite significant production increases. C&E outlays have averaged $4.5 billion per quarter this year. That's over $1 billion lower than the average quarter in 2016 and over 50% lower than the average quarter in 2014. 2017 year-to-date total C&E is $8.9 billion. We are trending below our full year guidance and conservatively would expect full year C&E to come in around $19 billion.","A positive pattern is also evidenced with operating expenses. The average quarter this year is $5.6 billion, $650 million lower than the average quarter in 2016 and 25% lower than the average quarter back in 2014. We expect to close out 2017 with operating expenses $1.5 billion to $2 billion lower than 2016. Second half costs will reflect growing production, the impact of asset sales and continued cost containment efforts throughout the enterprise.","Now on slide 17, we're on target with our asset sales program. In fact, we're already in the $5 billion to $10 billion proceeds range that we established for the 2016 and 2017 years. With six of the eight quarters behind us, cumulative asset sale proceeds now total $5.3 billion; $2.5 billion so far this year and $2.8 billion last year. During the remainder of 2017, we have a number of transactions that are listed on the slide, where sales and purchase agreements are signed. We currently anticipate having at least $1 billion closing in the third quarter. Many of the remaining transactions are international in nature. These are often complex and subject to multiple regulatory agency oversight making timing uncertain. When all is said and done, we expect 2016 to 2017 sales proceeds to be solidly within the established guidance range.","Now turning to slide 18. I'd like to close out my comments this morning on cash flow. We have an improvement trend underway with the first half of the year net cash positive after dividends by $1 billion. Production is up, in particular, high cash margin production is up and capital spend is down. We're getting more efficient and our cost structure is coming down. We're executing well on our asset sales and we're realizing good value in those transactions. We're also focused on improving returns. We expect this to happen as projects are completed and revenue is realized from growing production volumes. It'll happen as we pivot to shorter cycle time, high return investments. We showed you the opportunity we have in the Permian for high return investments. And returns will be aided by ongoing reductions in operating expenses and improvements in how we manage our capital projects.","We're competitively positioned with a very strong portfolio. We're confident we're taking all the steps within our control to enhance our competitiveness longer term.","So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue and so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary, and we'll certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered.","So Jonathan, please open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, Pat and Jay.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","(24:09)","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question \u2013 morning. First question is Pat, you made some commentary in the very beginning here about the transitory factors adding up to about $3.8 billion of headwinds in the first half of the year. And if you go back to the Analyst Day, I think the number you gave for the full year at that time was $4 billion of headwinds that you were expecting. So it seems pretty front half, 1H loaded in terms of how that's played out. But just wondering if that's still a good number to be thinking about for the full year.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yeah, so good question. And I would say within our ability to forecast these things I think that is still very reasonable guidance that we gave you back in the SAM, certainly within that range.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And the second question is just around the capital spending reduction. You noted $19 billion but conservatively so. As I think about that number, and what's imbedded in there for Gorgon and Wheatstone and CPChem, et cetera, it seems like it's $2 billion if not $3 billion of spend for some projects that'll be rolling off. So as I look ahead to 2018 and beyond, you had that $17 billion to $22 billion range that you had given. And so if we take the roll-off against the conservative $19 billion, it would seem like you're tracking pretty well in a $50 Brent world to be at or even maybe below that range longer term. But I'm sure there's some offset. So maybe you could just talk about how you see the puts and takes around that, and especially in light of your peer today saying they're seeing some upward inflationary pressure.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Right. I think the guidance that we've given so far, we stand by. I did say $19 billion conservatively. We do anticipate additional activity in the Permian in the second half of the year. We mentioned about having the rig rates running up and so additional activity there. We do anticipate seeing more spending out of TCO as that FGP project ramps up and we also have additional spending in the Agbami infill drilling program. So there are some elements that we can see adding to outlays in the second half of the year.","You're absolutely right. There will be offsets with Gorgon and Wheatstone trailing off certainly. And as I look forward to 2018, I do think that we have \u2013 we did say $17 billion to $22 billion, but we would be at the low end of that range if prices are hovering around $50. And I think that is still the best guidance that we can offer at this point. We as we normally do, we're in the middle of putting our business plans together and as we move through the second half of the year here, we will get much greater confirmation of that capital program really looks like.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your question, please.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Hey, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jay, I'm going to take advantage of you being on the call. Clearly the Permian is running well ahead of your guidance. I wonder if you could speak to \u2013 I guess there's a number of facets to this. What's driving the beat? How did it impact your guidance? And from a broader portfolio standpoint, you've clearly got an enormous footprint that could really stand on itself in terms of sustaining your or offsetting your decline rate. So how does the (27:33) even think about capital allocation? Think about getting pregnant with a six-year, large scale development versus the flexibility this gives you in the broader portfolio. So strategically what role does this play going forward and what happens to the guidance?","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","So you're correct. We're seeing very good performance out of the Permian. Our drive on capital efficiency and good execution is really paying off for us. We also have seen good performance from our new basis of design. It's early yet but the results are encouraging. As we look at our overall portfolio and as we finish the period of heavy capital spend that we've been on, we have a pretty youthful portfolio that allows us a lot of opportunity to continue to build now on the infrastructure that's been installed and to capitalize on the Permian as a very large resource base for us. Our current plan that we've given you has the rigs running up to 20 company operated rigs by the end of next year.","One thing I really like about the Permian is we're monitoring financial performance and financial returns virtually on a real-time basis. And as we continue to see performance out of Permian, we have the option to continue to expand that rig fleet or to hold the rig fleet depending on the performance that we're seeing. So we have seen a continued set of surprises to the upward over the years as we've shown you what the Permian can do for us and I would expect to see continued performance as we move forward. What's first and foremost, out of all this is that the Permian is one of our primary assets and it will attract the capital that's necessary. We are not holding back capital to the Permian and I don't think we'll need to. As these big capital programs roll off, the amount of discretionary capital allocation that we have has been increasing pretty significantly and that's going to continue over the next several years. So I'm very encouraged.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the answer, Jay. My follow-up is for Pat. And, Pat, obviously the slide on Permian asset sales, just to be clear, I'm not entirely sure if you were indicating that those would be outright disposals or swaps because even at the low end of your valuation, the $20,000 an acre, that could be a $3.5 billion type number. Maybe you could just clarify that, and just a broad update on, is the $10 billion still a good number? And maybe just as a quick add-on, CapEx, combined, if we put the two together, it looks like free cash flow could be hitting a fairly substantial inflection point. Is your CapEx going to end coming in light as well? I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Right. So just a point of clarification, on the Permian slide where we talked about opportunities for transaction, that is a combination of swaps, leasing and sale. And as another point of clarification, that activity was not anticipated in our $5 billion to $10 billion asset sale proceeds guidance range that we had given. So that would be on top of that. And we haven't really made a distinction. We haven't clarified publicly what the proportionality of swaps versus leases, versus sales is. As we said, the priority really is on the swaps because that's where really you can capture the greatest value by being able to extend the laterals. And we also said there's a number of sales packages that are also out in the marketplace.","I do think we are \u2013 this is a \u2013 2017 is a transition year. And I think we are very much at a point of inflection as we get through this year in terms of higher cash generation from the assets that are online, higher margin-accretive production, lower operating expenses as well as lower C&E outlays and greater flexibility around the capital program altogether. So I think it is very much a transition year and an inflection year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. So just to be clear, Pat. Does the CapEx ramp up in the second half or are you trending well \u2013 you're obviously trending well under your guidance.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Right. We're just saying we didn't think it was appropriate for people to take the first half of the year and double it and think that that's where we were going to close out the year because we do have certain elements where we see some outlays increasing.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody and great results.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Hey.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","A few questions for Jay if I can. There's a significant high-grading in the Permian inventory in one quarter where you've added additional 50,000 acres at the $50 value \u2013 $50 per acre \u2013 $50,000 per acre and 100,000 at the $20,000 to $50,000 range. Can you discuss what drove the change? Was that one factor or multiple? And is that inventory review process a quarterly ongoing process? Just trying to understand or get an understanding of the progression or potential future rate of change here.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Thank you, Evan. The actual update isn't a quarterly update. I think the last time we gave you that data was third quarter of last year. So it's over a period of time. But there are a number of factors that drive that increased valuation. Probably first and foremost is just the increasing efficiency we're continuing to see, both in terms of our recoveries and our cost development and operating cost per foot. So those are driving, to a large extent, the increased valuations that we're seeing, because they're based on our well performance.","So, we would expect to see \u2013 we'll continue to update these periodically. We won't do it probably quarterly, because it's just too much effort focused on keeping track of all the acreage, but the general message is, our acreage position, we continue to work it hard. We continue to look for the next best development areas. We're using technology and the experience of others, and we are seeing continued improvement in those valuations. And then we're delivering those results.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And my second question is on \u2013 you had great progressions on both DD&A and LOE in the newer slide indicate DD&A dropping 30% by 2020. I mean is that for incremental wells in 2020, or the entire Permian unconventional business by 2020? And on the LOE side, any color there on what's driving the difference? Whether that's be efficient infrastructure buildout or a shift to multi-well pad development?","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","It's a combination of things. On the capital side, the DD&A is really a mix of what we've already got in the portfolio, plus the new wells being added on a continuing basis. But because of the profile of production on these wells, we have a pretty rapid turnover of the capital employed through the depreciation schedule. And so, as we move forward in time, the wells that we're drilling today are more efficient than the wells we drilled last year and the year before, and we're just seeing this progression and decrease of DD&A consistent with the decrease in our unit development costs.","From a lease-operating standpoint, we have looked at our actual organization structures. We looked at how we're organized. We look at the efficiency of our factory model. We're using the Integrated Operation Center to keep our production reliability as high as possible. And, as we build scale, we don't have to increase the organization in direct proportion to the scale, so we start getting more and more economies of scale in our operations. So all those together, with the advances in the technology that we're really applying on a very real-time basis, we see this drive to continue to become more efficient.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe just a follow-up to that, on the multi-well pad development, just where are you today versus where you'll be in 2020, maybe in terms of percentage of activity? Is there a big change or improvement there?","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Virtually all of our development activity now, all 13 rigs, are running in multi-well pad mode and factory mode. The only wells you'll see in the future in the Permian that won't be that basis might be some expiration wells that we do to stay ahead of our development drilling. But that would be a very small percentage of the wells.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. Impressive.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question, please.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Morning.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Morning.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jay, just, this may be a little bit theoretical, but let's assume that by year 2020, you are running at 20 rigs and that by then, that you probably already reach at the 450,000 barrel per day or so. At that point, what kind of oil price and gas price you need in order for that to be as a self-sustained cash flow breakeven? Any kind of rough number?","And also then, as you're looking at Permian, clearly the resource is impressive, but I got to believe that still have a sweet spot in terms of the resource and the peak production ratio. Any kind of help you can give us, that \u2013 I know that your result will ultimately be multiple over time of the $9.3 billion (37:22) that you are citing. But if we're looking at a result at a certain level, what will be a reasonable RP ratio to achieve the optimum capital efficiency from you guys' standpoint in the Permian?","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Okay, so from the Permian in terms of breakeven position, we gave you guidance in the SAM meeting back in March that if we \u2013 we're growing our rig fleet to 20 rigs, is our intention by the end of 2018, and then we have options at that point. But if we should decide to hold at 20 rigs and just continue to run those 20 rigs, under the current conditions with the current performance, we would expect to be cash-flow positive overall. But what's really important here is, we're looking at the returns each and every well and development area give us as we're drilling those areas and as we make the decision on the next area, and those are all very positive. How much we choose to invest into the Permian on an ongoing basis, or on an expansion basis, is really part of our portfolio allocation of, where do we get the best returns.","So we're not really worried about whether the Permian in and of itself is returning positive net cash flow, as long as the underlying wells in development are all strongly positive on their financial performance. So, our view is that we're going to get to 20 rigs. We're going to understand our performance and the conditions in the Permian, and we have the option to continue to increase rigs beyond that point should we choose, and should that be an optimal place for us to continue to invest.","Terms of the sweet spot, it's really \u2013 we're working on the best spots today. But what's important is, as we continue to drive more efficiencies into the business, as we continue to advance the technologies that I talked about and the application of those, what we're finding is that we're continuing to drive down our unit development cost such that we can move into areas that might not have been so attractive before are becoming more and more attractive today. And also, as the infrastructure buildout continues, we are able then to bring in some of these lower value areas now become more and more attractive, because they don't have to underpin infrastructure. We can just use what's already been built out in the past. So overall, we see a very good resource picture. We'll use exploration to stay ahead of the game, and that's really our focus.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So you guys not really looking at, say, an RP pressure ratio, say, 30 or 40 or 25 will be the optimum. So that's not a consideration. Or that's at least not the way how you look at \u2013 how much is the overall typical program that you may end up to be.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","No. We're really looking at the financial performance of the developments that are in front of us and the results that we're achieving out of the investments we've made and comparing that with the opportunities that we have across our portfolio.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes. Thanks very much and hi, everyone. Wanted to ask couple of questions about Gorgon if I could please. First of all, you're currently running essentially at or above nameplate capacity, but you did mention specific items like building reliability and fine tuning the process on the slide. Just wondering if this running at nameplate capacity is something that we can look forward to for the rest of the year or if you will still have some shake-out maintenance as we look towards year-end.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Thank you. Gorgon's running really well. And particularly as we saw Train 2 and then Train 3 start up, Train 3 start-up was a beautiful thing. We're really pleased with it; it looked great. And so now all three trains are stable at or above nameplate. And that was our goal. When we look at the reliability, it's how many trips or how many times does the plant go offline, and obviously we want to eliminate those so that the plants run reliably day in and day out.","And then on top of that, we start getting the plant performance data so we can look at what are the bottlenecks that we can correct that'll allow us to then increase the ultimate capacity of the plant. There may be some short pit stops that we'll take from time to time that are going to be economically driven and planned, if we find that some of those opportunities require us to take the plan offline to make that adjustment. There are other things that we'll continue to make adjustments while they're online and running. So on balance, I expect to see us running at these levels throughout the year. There may be times we'll take short pit stops but those would be planned in advance and they'll be driven by economics.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Great. And then if I could just do a follow-up on Wheatstone actually. Sounds like start-up is pretty imminent so I assume there's really nothing on a critical path for Train 1 and that you're just in commissioning process. Just wondering if there's anything still on the critical path for Train 2 to achieve that six- to eight-month start-up or if it's very similar to Train 1 where you just really are now into more of a commissioning phase.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","So on Wheatstone Train 1, you're correct, we are in the final stages of commissioning, and in fact, we are now into the true start-up phase. So we expect to see cool-down occurring here shortly. There's really no construction going on at all in Train 1 and commissioning is largely complete. In Train 2, we still are in bulk construction mode. But we expect to see that winding down in the fourth quarter and at this point in time, really don't see any particular on obstacles or challenges in our path to getting Train 2 complete and getting into the commissioning and start-up. There's always the issues of moving from bulk construction into the sequence of commissioning but we've got teams all over that. And just as we saw at Gorgon as we move from Trains 1, 2 and 3, we expect to see continuing efficiency both in the final construction and in that transition to commissioning building on the experience of the first train.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks Jason.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, team.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Hi, Neil.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Morning.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","First question I had was just around base decline rates. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your portfolio on a base decline rate basis and then also any thoughts in terms of how you see that evolving going forward?","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Sure. Base declines have actually been quite good. The shift in strategy as we've moved from the heavy new greenfield investments into a focus on leveraging maximum value from our installed infrastructure base on install base business has been paying big dividends. So the infield drilling programs, the focus on reliability, the workover programs have been really sustaining our production, I think better than we would have expected given the amount of capital and costs that we've pulled out of the system. We have the advantage of a portfolio that has a lot of young assets.","So as we start installing things like \u2013 or start taking advantage of things like Jack\/St. Malo and the other projects that I mentioned that are coming online this year and next year as well as Gorgon and Wheatstone, we are seeing a very young portfolio. Lots of continued opportunities for infield drilling and, really, brownfield expansions. And there's a lot of value in that, even at today's prices.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate the comments, Jay. And the follow-up is just on some of the areas of disrupted production or areas where there's been a lot of focus on geopolitical issues. And just wanted your comments on three areas in particular, recognizing there could be some limitations in terms of the comments here. One would be Partitioned Zone, two would be Venezuela, and three would be Nigeria. Any updates from Chevron's perspective would be helpful.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Sure. In the Partitioned Zone, the stopping of production continues. There's been no restart activity. There are continuing negotiations and dialogue between the two governments. We continue to advocate for a return to the status quo, get the field back in production while the longer-term issues are addressed. But at this point in time, there has not been any movement towards a restart. Somewhat perplexing to us, but we'll continue to play the role of facilitator and see if we can't get the fields restarted. I think it's in everyone's best interest.","In terms of Venezuela, we have continued to be operational. We do not have major impacts on our operations at this point in time, and it's just a situation we continue to monitor. Our priority is on just maintaining safe operations, and protecting our people and assets. And in Nigeria, we continue to see good performance coming out of Nigeria. There are disruptions from time to time, but it has not had, I would consider, a material adverse effect.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Jay. Congrats on the good quarter.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","(46:54).","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil. Your question, please.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Folks, good morning. I had two questions. One for Pat and one for Jay, please. Pat, on the CapEx, obviously, it looks like you're lowering the guidance from 19.8 billion down to $19 billion. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how you see that impacting the cash flow breakeven that you've articulated around $50 a barrel. Presumably, there's some downward pressure there, but any color on that?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Well, I mean, I think that would be a normal outcome, an intuitive sort of outcome. Obviously, if we have a little bit less spending, that's where you would fall out. I mean, I think the larger flywheel for us here may be exactly the timing of asset sales during the second half of the year. As I mentioned, many of those are international transactions and getting a bead on exactly when they will close, whether they will close in fourth quarter or perhaps move into first quarter, there's still some uncertainty around those.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Second question on the Permian, Jay. Based on the feedback we're hearing from some of the refiners, it sounds like we're getting relatively close to exhausting the light sweet processing capacity along the Gulf Coast, and we're starting to see some batching, which kind of indicates we're preparing for some oil exports. I didn't know how that would impact your growth rates and is there an opportunity? Are you planning to participate in exports? Or is that really something you're just going let the midstream players kind of handle on their own? Thanks.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Well, look, when we've talked before about how we look at the Permian, we look at the whole value chain. So everything from our development, operating cost on the front end to the realizations we get on the back end. And we've done a lot of good work to open up multiple pathways to get our products to market so that we can take advantage of the different variations in the markets. So we have been working to stay ahead of our build out curve. At this point, we don't see any constrictions on our ability to grow, as we've discussed, in the Permian. And this is an area that we'll continue to stay focused on and seek the best realizations as we move forward. Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Blake.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question, please?","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, everybody.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Hi.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Hello.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Jay, I had just a clarification question for you. A few minutes ago you talked about 30% returns in the Permian. And when you say 30% returns, are you talking about fully-burdened returns? Or conventional return on capital type definition? Or drilling decision returns? Or what are we talking about there?","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","No, when we're talking about 30% returns, we're basing that on a $50 WTI price, $2.50 (49:45) gas, $25 NGLs. And what we are doing is looking at our all-in costs, so we're not cherry picking just development costs or anything like that. But this is what we really expect to see, full returns, fully burdened.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. So, Jay, it includes facilities and land costs and all the other things that some people leave out. Is that correct?","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Yes.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Just wanted to be sure. And then also had a question for Pat. Pat, the performance in your Downstream business has improved significantly. Your returns are not only above the cost of capital, but they're as close to that of some of your peers as they've been in a decade or so from what I can tell. I mean, they've gotten to be really good. So when you consider this increase in absolute and relative value of that business, I wanted to see if we could get your updated perspective how you think about that business, meaning besides my point about rising relative and absolute value, what are some of the other factors that you consider when you think about whether or not the R&M and chemicals business should be a core part of the portfolio, longer term?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Well, we do completely believe the R&M should be a core part of our portfolio long-term. We like our integrated model, not only for the hedge that it makes in terms offsetting commodity price impacts on the Upstream side, but we use it, importantly, in terms of kind of knowledge transfer between Downstream and Upstream for the efficient operations of plants and facilities. So it's a core part of our business. I think we have been very successful over the last decade really.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Yeah.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","In improving the returns on Downstream, through some of the transactions and the fine tuning of the portfolio, optimizing of the portfolio that we've done. Plus significant effort around cost management and cost containment. It's a growth opportunity for us if you're including the chemical sector in here as well. So I think it's a key part of our portfolio going forward and we would look to expand and evaluate its investment opportunities for future growth projects. Just along the way we would look at other opportunities. It would compete for capital for future investments as well, in the chemical sector in particular.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. No it's been real successful.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Just real success story for you guys. Thanks a lot.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Absolutely.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Yep.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question please?","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Hi. First question was going back to your Permian position. So you talked about the \u2013 gave a bit more detail about the asset of swaps and sales going forward. But I think one the big stores of value that you have that you could potentially bring forward is the value of your royalty position. If you look at where some of the pure play lifted royalty names are trading in North America. So I'm just wondering, have you thought about maybe selling or monetizing some of your royalty positions in the current, very low interest rate environment?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yeah, Anish, so obviously, this is a topical area there. We're certainly very much aware of the opportunity, and we have evaluated it. But I think the best I can say at this point is, we don't have any plans for anything like this at this point in time.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Okay. Thank you. And then I had a follow-up. We used to (53:26) get a little bit of an update on your North American activity onshore outside of the Permian. And just thinking about your updated plans in terms of the Duvernay in California, what's the outlook there? And also the Marcellus and, combined with that, is there any thoughts of maybe hedging in the gas price to lock in returns, to be able to put rigs back to work?","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","So as we look at the different assets that we have across North America, one of the things that we are very active on is sharing the information and best practices that are being developed in each area with the other unconventional areas. So we've seen cost, development cost, come down in the Duvernay. We've been largely involved in an appraisal program and a land tenure strategy. But now, with the results that we're seeing, we have a good-sized resource there and we are evaluating, as Pat mentioned earlier, our business plan at the current time on just what we want to do there, but it's very encouraging. We'll give you more details on each of those in the SAM meeting next year.","In terms of the Marcellus, we've also seen our cost structure come down significantly, as well as our drilling efficiency improve. So that also has some promise, especially with the recovery in gas price, as to whether or not we hedge. That's something that we'll evaluate as part of putting together our strategy going forward.","Another key area for us is the San Joaquin Valley, where we continue to run a very efficient operation in that area. The strategy there has been a drill-to-fill strategy, so we're really utilizing the existing installed infrastructure base, and we see very good returns coming out of our San Joaquin area. Builds on our heavy oil expertise, and provides a very good return us to. So North America overall looks very strong in the onshore areas. Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Anish.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please?","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everybody. Maybe a quick follow-up on the Delaware Basin. One of your competitors today talked about drilling laterals up to 15,000 to 20,000 feet in the Delaware. Can you talk about your general thoughts on lateral length, where you're trending right now in terms of where you've been pushing lateral length? And what you think about the ultimate extent of those efforts going forward?","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Yeah. Thanks very much. It's a good question. And there are a lot of different things being tried in the Permian on a real-time basis. And, as I mentioned earlier, our strategy, we've been criticized for it maybe a little bit in the past, but it's proving to be a very good strategy, is to let some of the others do some of the experimentation and then we watch and see what performs well, and then build that into our basis of design.","Right now, our focus is on 7500 to 10,000-foot laterals. We'll wait and see if those really turn out. But as you get longer and longer laterals, it gets very difficult to get good returns throughout the length of the well bore. So, our focus is on getting the ultimate return for the capital invested. And that's really what's going to drive us more than any other single parameter.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. That's helpful. And then, maybe a follow-up on some of the earlier comments and questions on free cash flow. It does look like there's \u2013 we're already seeing some amount of free cash flow, probably a greater inflection as we look into 2018. You've paid down a decent amount of debt this year. How should we think about your prioritizations for use of free cash as we go forward in terms of incremental capital, debt paydown, resumption of a share buyback, et cetera?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yeah. I mean, Ryan, I'm going to go back and just reiterate our priorities that we've had. Dividend increase would be the first one, as soon as we can see our way clear to having a sustainable increase, meaning supported by cash flow and earnings. After that, it becomes the capital program, and where do we have incremental opportunity for investments there. You've heard about how strong an opportunity queue we've got sitting there in the Permian. We do want to keep a strong balance sheet. I think that's important, and it's particularly important being in the commodity cycle. And we've learned in the past that, when oil prices are high, it's good to shore up a little bit, and when oil prices are low, you use your balance sheet. And so we want to make sure that we're prepared through the thick and thin of the cycle. I do see share repurchases as the last use of cash, and I think those, at this point in time, with the view we have of commodity prices, et cetera, it's fairly remote for us.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Ryan.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please?","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks, good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Morning, Roger.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Follow-up on the Permian. 20 rigs by the end of 2018 from 13 today, it seems, whether it's the Permian or other shales, comments from developers have been that you keep learning more the breakeven number of rigs to keep production flat, or to grow it at a higher rate, keeps declining, as well as breakeven prices. I was wondering, as you think about the 20 rigs, is that based on static knowledge today, or is that incorporating the idea of improving efficiencies, and that's part of how we should think about the range of 20% to 35% on the CAGR?","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Yeah. So the 20 is really based on \u2013 we want to be bringing rigs in a steady, orderly fashion so that we can continue to increase the organizational capability around those rigs and make sure we're continuing to use each incremental rig very efficiently. So if you think about all the work that has to go on from establishing the land position, coring up, getting ready for the design of the development area, all through the procurement and then into the offtake afterwards, we want to make sure that we're keeping the organization and the factory healthy around each incremental rig.","What we are finding is that, in addition to increasing the rigs, the amount of production each rig is generating is higher, and growing as the efficiencies improve. So part of it is increasing the rigs, but part of it is also getting more out of each and every rig that we apply. And the fleet is becoming more productive. So we're balancing all that. And as I say, because we get data on virtually a real-time basis, we're able to make decisions now and look forward and decide, do we want to continue that pathway higher or do we want to go ahead and hold at any number of particular rigs that we feel would deliver the efficiency? Capital's not the issue. It's really making sure that we're delivering the financial performance that we're looking for.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate it.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Hey. I think the...","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Could I ask you just one thing, Pat, real quick on the dividend? It's been modest growth the last couple years. And the earlier question about free cash flow allocation, just at what point do you think you'll have the confidence in say a flat $50 oil world to maybe move the dividend a little more aggressively?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","It's a Board call here and I think it's not just what current prices are but it's the outlook for future prices as well because it gets into a sustainable support level for the dividend that's important. So it's a combination of what's the commodity price outlook that we have, how are we seeing our capital program, how are we seeing cost structure, and as I said, we made tremendous strides over the last couple of years to get into a much more cash balanced position. And we're cognizant of our 29-year history and would love to be able to take it to a 30-year history but we're only going to do that when we have full confidence that it's a sustainable increase.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I'll bet on 30 though.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay. Okay. All right. I think we've got time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please?","Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.","Yeah. Thanks. I'll keep this short considering it's the last one. Just two-part question. I guess relating to Tengiz, you gave a bit of an update. Can you talk about the capital commitment to Tengiz? Obviously, it seems money buys a whole lot more today than it did 12 months ago and you're carrying quite a high contingency on that project. Can you just flag where that we should be seeing the CapEx coming for Tengiz? And then I've got a follow-up question, please.","James William Johnson - Chevron Corp.","Look, it's early days in terms of Tengiz. We carry good contingency and we make sure that when we run our economics, we really take into account what we think it could cost, not just what we want it to cost. We're taking all the steps we talked about in previous calls in terms of making sure the design assurance, our contracting strategies, our execution and our quality management are all in place. It's got our full and complete attention. So we're really working hard to manage this project. We're off to a good start. Projects of this nature are so large, there are always going be challenges and our goal is to address those challenges and minimize the use of contingency. But it's too early to give any other guidance than what we've given so far.","Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.","Okay. My follow-up to Pat, and I guess it's in regards to the abilities of the Permian to deliver. That $17 billion to $22 billion and more focusing on the $17 billion, that soft floor, and I guess in around $50 a barrel Brent. I mean, how should we think about that $17 billion? Where could it potentially be considering what you're getting out of your short cycle investments now?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yeah, I think the best I can do is just say we're in the midst of our business planning cycle here and we'll come out with our C&E plan for the 2018 year around December. Typically, that's when we would do it after we've had a chance to go through the full business planning cycle. I don't have any different guidance other than to say what we've said. I mean, we are getting, for every dollar spent, Jay just went through it, for every dollar that we're spending we're getting much better response out of the Permian.","So the capital efficiency per dollar is really increasing and that will all be taken into account as we're doing our revised planning. It is important for us to be cash balanced, this year with asset sales and next year without asset sales. And so those are primary objectives that we will be trying to balance as we put this next year's plan together.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay. Thanks very much. I'd like to thank everybody for the time on the call today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron, and we appreciate everybody's questions on the call and participation. Thank you. Jonathan, back to you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

My name is Kevin, and I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the Chevron Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Great. Good morning, and thank you, Kevin. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Upstream and Gas; and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager, Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. Financially, it was a strong quarter. The company's second-quarter earnings were $7.2 billion or $3.66 per diluted share. Comparing the second quarter 2012 to the same quarter a year earlier, our earnings declined 7%. Upstream was down on lower crude prices and volumes, while Downstream benefited from improved margins and gains on asset sales. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 20%. Our debt ratio at the end of June was 7.3%. In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the third quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount.","Relative to our peers as of June 30, we hold the #1 ranking in total shareholder return for the 3-year, 5-year and 10-year periods and actually, for every period in between. We believe this clearly demonstrates the long-term value we are creating for our shareholders.","Turning to Slide 4, cash generated from operations was almost $10 billion during the second quarter. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled over $21 billion. This puts us in a net cash position of $11 billion.","Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparison. Jeanette?","Jeanette Ourada","Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 5. I'll compare results of the second quarter 2012 with the first quarter 2012. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2012 with the same quarter a year ago.","Second-quarter earnings were $7.2 billion, over $700 million higher than the first-quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $551 million on lower crude oil realizations, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. Downstream results improved $1.1 billion between quarters, driven by better margins and favorable inventory effects. The variance in the Other bar reflects lower corporate charges and a favorable swing in corporate tax items.","On Slide 6, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $211 million lower than the first quarter's results. Combined liquids and natural gas realizations reduced earnings by $145 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realizations decreased 4% between consecutive quarters, substantially less than the roughly 9% drop in average WTI spot and posted Midway Sunset prices. Gulf of Mexico realizations actually increased between quarters due to the monthly lag on pricing of HLS, Mars and LLS. Natural gas realizations also dropped, decreasing 13% between quarters. Higher production volumes, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and California, increased earnings by $40 million between periods. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including incremental abandonment costs due to 2005 and 2008 hurricanes and higher exploration expense.","Turning to Slide 7. International upstream earnings were $340 million lower than the first quarter. Lower realizations reduced earnings by $525 million. Liquids realizations decreased 10%, in line with the decrease in average Brent spot prices. Partially offsetting were higher natural gas realizations, which increased earnings by $25 million. Lower liftings, mainly in Brazil and Australia, decreased earnings by $130 million. Higher operating expenses reduced earnings by $40 million, reflecting higher costs across multiple categories.","Moving to the next bar. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects increased earnings by about $425 million. The second quarter had a gain of $219 million, compared to a loss of $208 million in the first quarter. The total year-to-date impact is a favorable $11 million. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including higher exploration expense.","Slide 8 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 7,000 barrels per day between quarters. Lower prices increased volumes as the production sharing and variable-royalty contracts during the second quarter, increasing production about 7,000 barrels per day. Average Brent spot prices decreased about $10 per barrel between quarters, which resulted in about a 700 barrel per day volume increase for each dollar decrease in Brent.","Moving to the next bar, our Frade field in Brazil remained shut in for the quarter, reducing production by 25,000 barrels per day. Recall in mid-March, the Frade field shut down as a precautionary measure. It remained shut down throughout the second quarter.","Base business production decreased 30,000 barrels per day, largely driven by lower Tengiz volumes due to a planned KTL turnaround, a shortfall in rail cars resulting from railroad repairs at the Russian border and lower processing efficiency. Incremental production for major capital projects benefited second-quarter production by 41,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by ramp-ups at Usan in Nigeria and Caesar\/Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico.","Next, let's move to downstream. Turning to slide 9, U.S. downstream earnings increased $343 million in the second quarter. Improved margins increased earnings by $275 million, driven by significantly better marketing margins in the West Coast and higher refining margins on both the Gulf and West Coasts. Industry refinery maintenance in both regions and continued strong product export demand on the Gulf Coast, combined with a rapid drop in crude prices, generated higher margins.","Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $35 million, resulting from higher costs across multiple categories. Timing effects represented a $130 million positive earnings variance between quarters, primarily driven by favorable mark-to-market effects on derivative tied to underlying physical positions. The Other bar consists of several unrelated items.","On Slide 10, international downstream earnings were $734 million higher this quarter. Refining and marketing margins rose, increasing earnings by $305 million. This resulted from the absence of first-quarter planned turnaround activities in South Korea and from declining crude price impacts across the system.","Inventory effects increased earnings by $325 million, primarily due to falling prices in the second quarter, following rising first-quarter prices. Recall in the first quarter, I called out a $225 million negative earnings variance due to unfavorable inventory impacts. The net impact for the year is a $29 million positive impact to earnings.","Gains from asset sales were slightly lower, decreasing earnings by $15 million. Approximately $200 million of gains on assets in the second quarter nearly matched first quarter's gains on asset sales in Spain and Canada. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated item including higher volumes, improved trading results and lower turnaround costs.","Slide 11 covers all Other. Second-quarter net charges were $291 million, compared to a net $504 million charge in the first quarter, a decrease of $213 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $77 million benefit to earnings. Corporate charges were $136 million lower in the second quarter. Year-to-date, corporate charges were $795 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $300 million to $400 million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward.","George is now going to provide an update on our upstream operations. George?","George L. Kirkland","Thank you, Jeanette. It's good to be back to discuss upstream performance and to provide an update on our operations. I'll begin by looking at our second quarter competitive position on earnings margins. So far this year, upstream margins were approximately $26 per barrel. Although not all our peers have announced second quarter results, we expect to continue to lead our competitors in this key metric. Based on the peers that have reported through the first half, we are almost $7 per barrel ahead of our nearest competitor. We have now held this top position for 12 consecutive quarters, reinforcing the quality of our investment decisions, the strength of our portfolio and the consistency of our performance.","Next, let's look at returns. Our investments continue to deliver superior financial performance. For the second quarter, our return on capital employed was 25%. This, too, is expected to rank at the top of our peer group.","Now I'll turn to 2012 production. Please turn to Slide 14. Our first half production averaged 2.63 million barrels a day at an average year-to-date Brent price of $114 per barrel. Based on the results to date, we are lagging the full year production guidance we gave you in January of 2.68 million barrels per day. There are 4 key drivers that will impact our full year production results.","First, the Frade field has been shut in since mid-March. We are conducting an extensive technical evaluation of the area. Once all the technical evaluations are complete, partner support is in place and we obtain regulatory approvals, production is expected to restart and ramp up over time. Timing of the restart remains somewhat uncertain.","Second, we have our first major turnaround at Tengiz SGI\/SGP, and this is scheduled to start early in August and last for 6 weeks. The turnaround involves more than 6,000 workers. It includes normal inspections and repairs of equipment to maintain mechanical reliability and integrity. We will also take the opportunity to make improvements that are expected to slightly increase production capacity over the next few years.","Next, we had commissioning delays at Angola LNG. We originally planned to start up in the second quarter. Commissioning activities are underway, and we've completed LNG berthing trials and LNG tankers are available for third-quarter cargoes. We are currently expecting the first cargo in September.","Also influencing our production this year, and I mean in a positive way, are several MCPs that started up early relative to our plan. We have been pleased with their performance. Currently, we're performing at 98% of our initial guidance. And based on the items we just discussed, enough uncertainties remain so that I expect we will end the year slightly under our target. More importantly, our long-term guidance remains intact. Looking to 2017, we continue to expect production to grow to 3.3 million barrels per day at a Brent price of $79 per barrel.","Now let's turn to Slide 15. We have an active year of exploration, and we plan to invest nearly $3 billion. The Gulf of Mexico is a key focus area for us where we continue to build our portfolio of prospects. During the recently sale, we were apparent high bidder on 15 deepwater blocks and 15 shelf blocks. We are currently drilling the Coronado well in the deepwater and the Lineham Creek well and ultra-deep Wilcox gas play on the Gulf of Mexico shelf.","In another key focus area, Australia, we recently announced the Pontus-1 Carnavon Basin discovery, the fourth successful discovery out of the last 15 wells. We have several more exploratory wells to be drilled in Australia this year. We are also actively pursuing new test areas. One is South America, West Africa cretaceous play. We have an active drilling program in Liberia where we are on our second exploration well. And we recently acquired additional acreage in Suriname. We made a new entry in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. This acreage is in the appraisal and exploration phases, which is consistent with our strategy of seeking early opportunities.","We are also progressing our unconventional portfolio. We have drilling activities in the U.S., both in the Permian Basin and the Marcellus, the Canadian Duvernay, Poland, Argentina and China. In the Ukraine, we were awarded a tender that gives us the right to negotiate a production-sharing contract for 1.6 million acres. This acreage is on trend with our Poland and Romania acreage.","Next, we'll talk about our progress on major capital projects. Please turn to Slide 16. We continue to see good performance from our first quarter start-ups, Usan, Tahiti 2 and Caesar\/Tonga. In the second quarter, we achieved start-up of Agbami 2. We have brought online 1 new producer and 1 water injection well. Our plan includes 10 wells in total, 6 of which are producers. We reached a Final Investment Decision to expand our Bibiyana natural gas field in Bangladesh, where we have a 98% interest. This new project will include expansion of the gas plant to process increased gas volumes from the Bibiyana field, additional development wells and an enhanced condensate recovery unit. The project is expected to boost Chevron's total natural gas production capacity in Bangladesh by more than 300 million cubic feet per day to 1.4 billion cubic feet per day. Our start-up is expected in 2014.","We entered front engineering and design for the Rosebank Project in the U.K. This is our first operated development in the west of Shetlands basin. This field holds significant potential with estimated total potential recoverable oil equivalent resources of 240 million barrels.","Turning to Slide 17, I'd like to give you an update on our Australia LNG projects. Let's start with Wheatstone. We made a Final Investment Decision on Wheatstone last September. We have achieved our key milestones for the year. We have completed the pioneer camp with 100 beds and continue work on phase one of the fly camp, which will add an additional 500 beds. We currently have about 300 workers on site. Just this month, we cut first deal on the platform top sides in the DSME fabrication yard in South Korea. We now have long-term contracts in place for over 80% of our equity LNG volumes. The remaining activities for 2012 focus on detailed design and preparing for plant site works to commence in the fourth quarter of this year. To date, approximately $15 billion in contracts have been awarded including more than $7 billion in local Australian contracts. The contracts are a mix of lump sum, reimbursable time and material and unit rate.","During the quarter, we signed a non-binding Heads of Agreement with Tohoku for LNG offtake. We also executed an equity Sales and Purchase Agreement with TEPCO, bringing Chevron's interest in the offshore platform and facilities downstream of the platform to 64% and our interest in the upstream permits to 80%. We do not intend to farm down any further. With this sale, Chevron's net capital investment is expected to be about $20 billion. We're in the process of obtaining final government approvals of this sale.","Now let's turn to Gorgon. Please turn to Slide 18. Gorgon achieved FID in September 2009 and is now over 45% complete. We're making good progress on our 2012 milestones. In June, the first 4 pipe rack modules arrived on Barrow Island. In July, construction began on the domestic pipeline. Next month, the first plant equipment module is expected to arrive. And later in the year, we expect to start installation of the Train 1 compressors.","I'd like to update you also on a few areas -- additional areas of progress. Through design optimizations, we have upgraded the nameplate capacity of the individual trains to 5.2 million tons per annum for a total of 15.6 million tons. This is a 4% increase in capacity. Fabrication and delivery of modules are on track. We have completed 2 of the 3 main berths at the material offloading facility, allowing efficient simultaneous offloading of modules and other construction materials. Two LNG tanks are under construction, and we've completed all 14 ring sections of the first tank. The roof is now structurally complete and is ready to be floated into its final position. This strong progress on the tanks has taken them off the critical path, which is unusual for an LNG project.","We have drilled 8 of the 18 development wells, 7 in Gorgon and 1 in Jansz, and we're pleased with the sub-surface results we're seeing. Progress on the upstream facilities and subsea pipelines are on plan. We posted several photos of our progress at Gorgon on the web page, chevron.com. You will see links on the home page and Investor page called Gorgon progress photos. I encourage you to check in occasionally, as we will periodically update Gorgon project pictures.","Moving to Slide 19. We've received many questions about Gorgon cost. We want to be responsive as we can and provide the insights we can with the information we have to date. As you are aware, the project was sanctioned in 2009 at USD 37 billion and at the current exchange rate at the time of USD 0.86 to the Australian dollar. The stacked bars chart shows the budgeted cost at FID and how they were broken down, 30% upstream and 70% downstream.","We have now awarded more than $28 billion in contracts with more than half to local contractors. The contracts include a mix of lump sum, unit rate and reimbursable time and material. The contract mix will change over time as contracts are completed and\/or converted. Procurement and fabrication, along with the upstream component, are mostly non-Australian-dollar-based. These are the top 2 seconds on the stacked bar. The other component shown on the bar chart are primarily Australian-dollar-based. Overall, about half of the total costs are in Australian dollars. Procurement and fabrication and the upstream components are on plan in terms of both cost and schedule.","Regarding logistics, the 5% component, we have 3 primary supply bases. Activities at the Dampier and Perth supply bases are meeting or exceeding plan. However, the Australian Marine Complex at Henderson, which handles transshipment of larger cargo, has not been as productive. To mitigate, we are streamlining our logistics processes and have added additional resources. We have a strong focus on insuring critical materials arrive in sequence and on time to support construction activities.","Looking at the construction and labor segment, we have experienced some delays due to weather. We are still in the early stages of our on-island activity, and we'll need several months on Barrow Island to assess labor productivity. Remember that by design, the project is modularized to limit on-island activities.","We've also seen Australian labor costs trending higher. This could impact both construction and management services. Because there are a number of variables in play, we currently have a detailed cost review underway. We're evaluating our performance to date and incorporating new information to update our expectations for the remainder of the project. Over the next few months, our assessments will help us gauge movements in costs, which we expect to provide towards the end of the year.","I would like to emphasize that our view of the Gorgon project has only been enhanced since FID. I remain very confident in the economics and the value created by this project. While we are seeing cost pressures, in large part associated with a 20% strengthening of the Australian dollar, it's important to note that oil prices, which determine the project's revenue stream, are about 60% higher than at the time of project sanction. Further, the development well results to date are encouraging, which has greatly reduced the reservoir uncertainty. We've increased the capacity of the foundation project by 4%, and we continue having success with our exploration program, providing us with confidence that we will have additional gas volumes to support further expansions at Gorgon.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Pat.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. Thank you, George. I'm turning now to Slide 20. George has provided an update of recent progress on upstream and exploration activity, so I won't comment further on the left-hand side of the chart. In the downstream, CPChem initiated front-end engineering and design on our Gulf Coast petrochemical project. Initial contracts for design of the derivative unit and the ethane cracker have been awarded. We continued our downstream portfolio rationalization efforts, completing the sale of our fuels marketing and aviation business in the Caribbean, along with the power operations of our GS Caltex affiliate in South Korea.","And earlier this week, our 50% affiliate, Caltex Australia Limited, announced plans to restructure its supply chain, which will include the conversion of the Kurnell refinery in Sydney to an import terminal. Caltex will continue to operate the Lytton refinery in Brisbane. In support of this restructuring plan, we have entered into a long-term agreement with Caltex to supply transportation fuels at market-based prices. Given the timing of this announcement, the financial impact of this decision will be recorded in the third quarter. We don't expect the impact to be material to our results.","Turning to Slide 21. I'd like to close with a few important points. First, 2012 is all about execution for us. We know that and, we're executing well. We continue to progress our major capital projects, both upstream and downstream.","Second, our Australian projects remain squarely on track. George gave you more insight on the progress we're making at Gorgon and Wheatstone. I encourage you to view the Gorgon photos on our website. We did not talk specifically this morning about our 2 major deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico that are under construction, Jack\/St. Malo and Big Foot, but both of these projects remain on schedule and on budget. And it is these 4 projects that form the cornerstone of our production growth mid-decade and beyond.","Third, we delivered a strong financial performance in the second quarter. Earnings and cash generation for the quarter were amongst our strongest ever. And if you look at the first 6 months of 2012 as a whole, where foreign exchange and downstream timing effects each largely net out, you will note the quality of our earnings. Both upstream and downstream segments are delivering leading earnings per barrel and ROCE, compared to the peers who have reported so far this earnings season. At the 6-month mark, Chevron's upstream is #1 on both of these measures, and Chevron's downstream is #1 on both of these measures.","An investment in Chevron offers many advantages: a very compelling growth story beginning mid-decade; hugely competitive cash and earnings margin; margins we believe will be supported in the future by the quality of investments we're making today; and the sustained growth pattern on dividends, which are yielding 3.3%. We believe we are well positioned for strong cash generation in the years to come, and with that cash generation, our capacity to increase dividends and maintain peer-leading total shareholder returns is enhanced.","Now, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll welcome your questions. [Operator Instructions] We will ensure everyone gets a chance to ask a question even if we need to run over a few minutes. Kevin, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have somewhat of a strategic question and specifically one with regard to portfolio management where you guys have had extensive activity during the past decade in the refining and marketing business, and your returns have clearly increased. But at E&P, while, I realize that your returns are already about the highest in peer group, as Pat and George pointed out, it seems like that might be an area of opportunity for the company over the next couple of years. So I just want to see if we could get an update on your thinking or strategy in this area? And whether or not you even consider the opportunity to be meaningful for Chevron given your return level?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Doug, are you asking us about expectations for E&P asset restructuring and portfolio divestment?","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Along those lines. I mean there's always areas of underperformance or declining strategic importance. And it seems like you've rationalized a lot more in the downstream than the upstream, and is this an opportunity for you over the next couple of years until the big wave of growth is present?","George L. Kirkland","Doug, let me take that. First off, I would take you to our earnings per barrel and where they stand relative to everyone else and what that means for our portfolio. The average of our portfolio has got a significant shift, if you will, to the right versus what's out there. We always are upgrading our portfolio on a continued basis, looking at the tail end of the portfolio, looking at those pieces that are not performing that well. An example, of course, is Alaska. We sold over 20,000 barrels a day in Alaska that went off our books in December of last year. So that was an opportunity that we took. What we also looked at -- is there anything when we do that, that we can do with that money that gives us better assets? And I would tell you one other thing we look very carefully at, we try to make sure that anything we sell doesn't have future opportunities related to different stratigraphic levels on that acreage. And very importantly, that we -- it doesn't have a technology opportunity to unlock more barrels. We find if you sell out of a place, then you lose that opportunity. It's really tough coming back and buying the same acreage back because you exited too soon. So I would tell you we're cautious, but we do cut off that poor part of our portfolio, and we usually get good prices for it.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, you're clearly in a high-quality position.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Thanks very much for all the details on Gorgon. We're going to be watching that website closely. Just -- you spoke about talking about releasing costs at the end of the year, and we can do some maths given the details you've given. But you've also spoken about weather impacts and logistics learnings. Maybe if you could sort of assess for us the risk of start-up delay at Gorgon as you see it today?","George L. Kirkland","There's, Ed, always risk with every project. I mean, every big project like this is a constant mitigation of things in the project materials, equipment, contracts that could impact the critical path. And I think we do really a good job of trying to mitigate those issues and keeping any problem off of the critical path. We still believe we're going to make the 2014 start-up. We look at it very carefully every month all the way through the chain. I mean, me and John look -- we spend a good amount of time every month on these projects with our team. So we got great focus on it. We got good people -- very good people in Australia on our project teams focused on delivering, and they're very good at dealing with the mitigations to try to move us and hold us to that schedule. At this point, we still think we're on the 2014 -- the late 2014 schedule.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just a follow-on in terms of Wheatstone. So, say you get to the end of 2012 and you can sort of make an update on costs for Gorgon, would we presume, given the amount of effort that you have to put in, that you might be able to be able to narrow down costs and start up timing for Wheatstone end of 2013? And then you'll have substantially derisked the CapEx and start-up for investors?","George L. Kirkland","First, let me -- where we are on Wheatstone is much earlier in cycle. Remember, Wheatstone's 2 years behind. So in 2013, we are not going to be as far along. We will be telling you every time -- every quarter and every update where we stand on percent complete and how we're doing. We're going to provide similar kind of informational Wheatstone progress and milestones as we are on the case for Gorgon. We will be more knowledgeable at that point in time, but we won't have the same knowledge level since Gorgon is once again 2 years out in front. I will tell you one other item on -- specifically on Wheatstone. Wheatstone, when we authorized that project for the Final Investment Decisions, we had used a different exchange rate. We used parity between the U.S. dollar and the Australian dollar at authorization. So we don't see at this point in time the Australian dollar or the foreign exchange impact hitting us on Wheatstone. Well once again, we have to make the same commitment on Wheatstone we have on Gorgon. We are going to give you very detailed updates at every opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","George, 2 questions, if I may. The first one is, you've kept again your $79 oil price assumption when you talk you about your production target on 2017. I'm just curious that if oil prices had to be substantially higher, let's say $100 or something like that, I mean, you could pick a number. I realize that the strategy that you laid out, that it doesn't necessarily impact the PSC production type of an issue. But what I'm particularly curious about is what it means in terms of production cliffs as you work through costs recovery because clearly oil prices already have been substantially higher. I guess my question is, because you've accelerated or realized a lot of revenue much earlier than you would have done at $79, can you give us a road map as to whether there are any major production cliffs on your major PSCs? And I've got a quick follow-up please.","George L. Kirkland","I think we've been consistently saying we, one, would be telling you if we saw cliffs. We have not seen any of those in the near term. We don't see any of those. We have, in our estimate that we give once every quarter of price impacts, we tell you what it is, and any movements in our PSCs are included in that. Most of the cliffs that I think we have seen in the past, we are past and we will give warnings if we see future ones. I hope that answers your question.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, if I may, George, what I'm really getting at is that if you're assuming $79 for the next 6 years, and it turns out to be $100, it's the future cliffs I'm really talking about with that $20 difference, is there any meaningful changes vis-a-vis $100 versus, let's say, your $79 assumption?","George L. Kirkland","No, we don't see any meaningful ones at this point in time. And if we do in the future see any, we will give you warning or information on that.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. My second one is really hopefully fairly quick. Unit margins, obviously, continue to be very strong. We monitor, I guess, we kind of call it a capture rate, we monitor your weighted revenues and your unit earnings. And it looked like that actually dropped a fair bit this quarter relative to the recent trend. Is there anything unusual that you can point to? Have you seen the same thing, or any commentary you could offer there? And I'll leave it at that.","George L. Kirkland","Our correlations, it still looks pretty good and consistent with the past history for us. There are always going to be some ups and downs when you look at quarters on -- one quarter may have a well write-off or it may have G&G effects in it that may move it around a little bit. But the early stuff that I've looked at, I don't see anything.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","George, thank you as well for the detailed budget breakdown for Gorgon. My question related to that is, can you talk about what type of contingency was reflected in that original budget? Did you have a 15% to 20% contingency for potential cost overruns? Obviously, the FX movement is pretty straightforward. But I'm wondering if there is some wiggle room either within contingency or some of the other buckets?","George L. Kirkland","Yes, we did have contingency, but we do not ever disclose what that contingency is or was. We'll be able to give you a lot more information about where we think this project is going, I think, towards the end of the year, after we finish our reviews of cost and schedule.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And maybe a related follow-up is if you've awarded $28 billion of contracts, presumably that's primarily on the facilities and the -- what you call here procurement and fabrication, can we think about that portion therefore basically as being derisked? And then we are kind of just down to the labor productivity and the FX and weather you've mentioned here? Can we think about the facilities and procurement as being derisked now?","George L. Kirkland","Yes, in my statement, I tried to cover particularly a portion of that and particularly looked at even full upstream portion and the equipment and the fabrication area. We have good confidence in that. We think those -- we know a lot about those costs. We feel extremely good about our upstream costs on the well side, the drilling side. And matter of fact, all the upstream costs look to be very much in line with our expectations. What we don't know is we don't know labor productivity. We're getting some indications now because we've got the 2 tanks going up quite nicely. But then, we've got foundation work and a lot of underground. So we've got an awful lot of work before we even get to mechanical piping and instrumentation and electrical tie in. So that piece, we just don't know, and we'll have a better feel for it as we get to the end of the year. But we just don't have enough run time to know that. And a lot of our costs, a lot of our costs are -- as we've mentioned, 50% of our costs are in Australian dollars, and a significant portion of that, once again, is related to on-island work. Now remember, we tried to minimize that as much as we could by bringing in modules. That's what we got big pipe rack modules coming in and big process modules coming in with a lot of work to minimize that on-island work.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","George, I wanted to ask a couple of questions about activity in the U.S., maybe start with deepwater Gulf of Mexico. You did mention that Coronado is drilling and that Jack\/St. Malo are essentially on schedule. Do you feel like you're essentially now fully back to work there? And can you maybe talk about the production levels in the Gulf of Mexico? And whether you may be seeing an inflection point and would hope to grow from the levels that you're at right now?","George L. Kirkland","Okay. Jason. We have 5 rigs -- deepwater rigs running in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This is the most rigs we've ever run in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This is more than before the Macondo incident. Four of our 5 rigs at this point in time are supporting major capital projects. The Discoverer Clear Leader is on the Jack -- on a Jack-producing well. The Discoverer Deep Seas is on the Tahiti -- on a Tahiti development well, the Tahiti 2 development well. The Deep Seas is, like I just mentioned, let me go back in and say, we've got Clear Leader on Jack. We've got Deep Seas on Tahiti. We got the Inspiration, which is another Discoverer -- is another Transocean rig is completing the St. Malo production well. Then we have a rig on the Discoverer India. That's on the Big Foot. So 4 development projects, 4 of our rigs. We have 1 rig, the Pacific Santa Ana drilling on the Coronado exploration well. And this is the second time we've been at Coronado. We had some difficulty with the first well there. So we're at Coronado on exploration. Jason, actually, we have more activity we'd like to do on the exploration side. We're limiting ourselves to 5 rigs. It does take an awful lot of technical people to really push all these permits through the system. So we're -- I think we're close to what we can do on that. With regards to production, down the road, we're going to see production growth because we've got so many of these large projects coming on. Remember, 2014 is our target start-up for Jack\/St. Malo and also for Big Foot. And we are -- the work we're doing right now at Tahiti 2 is to get access to more resources and reserves there to hold production and limit decline rates there. So my expectation is growth. Just a reminder, Big Foot is a 60,000 to 70,000 barrel a day type opportunity where we hold 60%. Jack\/St. Malo is 120,000 to 150,000 kind of barrel facility, and we hold 50% of Jack and 51% of St. Malo. So all of these projects are very significant. Like Pat said, these are very significant projects and they're 2014. And once again, they look to be on schedule and on cost.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Appreciate all that, George. I realize it was a multipart, but maybe if I could just sneak in one more. You mentioned the Lineham Creek well. Can you to talk about the potential you see in the lower Wilcox ultra-deep from a resource standpoint, and how you're dealing with the technical challenges there?","George L. Kirkland","I think at this point in time, it's a belief for us, like you normally have in exploration, we have existing leases and have acquired in recent lease sales additional leases where we believe that trend on the shelf could be productive. I'm going to hold on how big it could be until we have some results. We are encouraged by what we've seen in the industry, some of the industry wells in that -- for that trend. But once again, we've got to drill the wells to see. And we'll speak more of it -- I'd rather speak more of it after I have some results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions on the numbers for Gorgon. How much have you spent to date on the project?","George L. Kirkland","We don't share that.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can I ask for some color then around -- you mentioned the tanks and progress on the tanks taking the team off path, I think you said? Did you mean they were getting faster or slower or what was unusual about that in your sense?","George L. Kirkland","Most LNG projects, the tank readiness for production is one of the critical path items and controls schedule. We've seen that on several projects before that we've been involved with, and the tank work to date has gone well. It's taken all the tank construction off the critical path schedule for the project. So it's a big positive to -- it's -- projects are always about eliminating problems with the critical path item. And we're very pleased where we are on the tanks.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. Can I ask, on the 45% complete, if you don't think of that in terms of costs, or is that a cost completion, or is that a time completion? How do you think about that particular percentage disclosure?","George L. Kirkland","It's an activity level completion, which we value certain activities. So I would put it more in the sense of really a schedule, but it really reflects the amount of effort and work that has to be done, activity by activity, and it's weighted that way.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the last component from these -- all right.","Patricia E. Yarrington","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions. One real short. George, have you guys hedged your FX exposure in Gorgon? And also Wheatstone at the time of [indiscernible] how much,  if you can share? And the second question...","George L. Kirkland","If it's okay, I'll just answer that. The answer is no, we did not hedge, okay?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Any plan to change it in the future, or that this will be continue to be the company policy?","George L. Kirkland","I'm going to let Pat answer that one.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Right. No, I mean, we really look at this as -- particularly when you're dealing with a resource country like Australia when the movement in the Australian dollar is really driven by what's happening in the resource sector, we look at the tide and the correlation between that, and what happens to oil prices typically and have found a very strong correlation. So we have made the decision to not hedge. We are -- we really have a hedge in the overall portfolio.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. The second question, George, from an organizational -- I mean, you guys are working on a lot of different projects and no doubt have a full plate. So from an organizational capability and limit standpoint in terms of your human resources, your supply chain availability, can you really -- can you increase your current pace, or that this is as fast as you can run? And if you don't really have any more slack and I know that periodically, people are asking that whether you're going to acquire something that's in mix sense, that when you don't have excess or high-dosed spare organizational capability, therefore, you do acquire anything outside what you already have?","George L. Kirkland","Well, that's a -- Paul, it\u2019s a multipart. Let me see if I can take a quick stab at that. First, when you look at the major capital projects we are having around the world and the organization -- the people it requires to do one of those, we could not add another large project in the execution stage at this point. Now we can -- we're always preparing ourselves for the next set of projects. So we have to stage out people in earlier phases to move the next set of opportunities through the pipeline. So we try to do that. But we could not just plunk down another big project in the execution stage. Now we have to plan for people coming off of these big projects, and that's happening, too. So we try to manage that, I think, in a very holistic sense. Otherwise, on our organization, could we do more smaller projects or a little more drilling? Yes, we have some capability to do that. It's not a huge impact on our capital budgets. It would be relatively small monies compared to what we're presently doing. We don't want to get over-extended on that either. So we try to make good choices on that part. But very importantly, we try to time, once again, next set of projects, get the work, the preparatory work for them ready by the time some of these other projects are rolling off. And I guess maybe one final point, the reason for all that is we want to have good execution. And of course, on the front end, we want to make very good decisions on doing the right projects.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Reid with Jefferies.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","George, can I ask a couple of questions about Tengiz? I noticed the future growth FEED hasn't started that. Are there still issues there with the government? And do you still believe that there's going to be volumes from that in your 2017 numbers?","George L. Kirkland","Good question, Iain. Let me give you a little bit of background, where we are on -- at TCO. TCO has received partial funding for partners for future growth FEED. That allows us to move the FEED forward, and we have commenced engineering on that -- on the FEED engineering for future growth. Down the road, we've of course got to finish that. And then another big hurdle on -- for future growth is also funding for partners, in particular funding for our Kazakh partner, KMG. So that is yet to come. When I look at the timing for the expansion of TCO, it is in the 2017 period. That's where it's planned. It's not a full year's worth of production, but we are very focused on trying to move that project to meet that schedule. So I'm convinced we're either going to have it in '17 or it's going to be in '18. And I've got it in my plan that way, and we look at it every quarter to try to make sure that we have it in the schedule at the right time. And I'm also always looking on my 2017, 3.3 million, about other opportunities that I have in queue that I could offset any barrels that would slip out of 2017. So got a great -- we have a great focus on that. I'll bring you back -- we're going to move that project at the right speed to execute it well, to get everything in place to have an excellent project. And for a reminder for everyone that's on the phone, this project is another big project. It's a 250,000 to 300,000 barrel a day expansion. This project is made possible by the CPC expansion, Caspian pipeline expansion, which is moving forward well. We see the first part of additional barrel capacity coming on the CPC actually in 2013, which is good news for us.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That was great. And second bit is the turnaround you're taking over the next several weeks, how many barrels is that going to impact? Is it the whole plant or just a portion of it?","George L. Kirkland","It's the SGI\/SGPs, which is round numbers is approaching 300,000 barrels a day. So it's about half of our production at Tengiz. This is the first real big full turnaround for the plant and the compression equipment in total. Like I mentioned, 6,000 workers, a lot of people there. We are also trying to do a little bit of additional work that we think will be improving future capacity, but the real focus at this point is changing out catalysts and increasing reliability and efficiency of the plant.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And that's all built into your full-year production forecast?","George L. Kirkland","That is correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","George, you mentioned that the development wells at Gorgon were going -- you were pleased with them. Does this mean that we could see some resource uplift, or greater recoverable reserve potential for Gorgon?","George L. Kirkland","That's possible. Let me make sure I can characterize that. What we've seen to date is -- we look at every well as we're moving forward. And we have a distribution of outcomes between a, if you will, a probabilistic distribution, and we're seeing outcomes that are greater than our mid-value. These are all static results. These are based on logs. Once we really wouldn't move very much off of that until we got performance, so we got the dynamic results when we actually start up. Now we will take some looks at this, net pay counts and looking at actually reservoir quality. But at this point, we feel very good that we feel we are -- we did a good job estimating, and it's come in just a little better than our midpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First one is for Pat. Your referenced, of course, the very large cash balance. What would it take for you to consider upsizing the quarterly share buyback?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Well, Pavel, I think I would just point you to the fact that we had, from a Brent standpoint, a $28 decline in realizations over the course of the second quarter and just point to the volatility there and say -- as I've said in the past, that we keep the cash balance where it is right now while we're in the midst of heavy construction period, particularly on these LNG projects. And that is -- our priority is to be able to fund those projects through the thick and thin of commodity cycles and to be able to weather any sort of downside excursion, which we have just seen. So fundamentally, I think it would take a hugely different and more robust commodity price environment and a sustained environment for us to think at this point in time of moving it beyond the 1.25 billion per quarter.","George L. Kirkland","We are returning a lot of cash.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Yes, we are.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A quick one for George as well. Lots of conflicting comments from your peer companies in relation to shale gas in Europe. What are your latest thoughts on the commercialization prospects, and maybe any sense of timing on when we might see some volumes out of there?","George L. Kirkland","I think we've been pretty consistent on what we thought on timing for shale gas coming out, or gas for shale coming out of Central Europe or elsewhere on the European continent. We've always looked at this as a exploration play. So it's very early days. You have to drill a lot of exploratory wells. You got to understand the resource. You got to understand the performance. We are once again in a very early start of that. My expectations on a success basis, that you're really talking next decade before you get significant volumes. Europe is in a much different situation, and I think actually almost all the rest of the world, on the shale opportunities than the United States. The knowledge level in the U.S. about a shale, I mean, we've -- is high compared to any place else in the world because there is so many wells being drilled in the United States in every region. So your knowledge level going in is high. You're able to more quickly assess the opportunity here, and then very importantly, remember the infrastructure. The North American infrastructure to move the gas is in place. Most cases, you had short tie-ins. You got all these big interstate pipelines. It's a much different situation. And you don't have that in Europe. So there's a lot -- lot of things must happen from the point of discovery, assessment and then moving gas to market. And my expectation hasn't changed. It's really predominantly a next decade, and maybe early in the next decade. But it's the next decade.","Operator","Yes, our last question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","If I could just try a couple on Iraq. As far as the acreage add there, what is your perspective on the long-term potential there? What's your long-term outlook that you may see that Reliance didn't particularly see there that makes the entry there attractive? And then secondly, were there -- are there any sort of near-term plans for exploration or any other sort of development, or is there a situation we just got to sort of wait out the political situation there until you get some more clarity?","George L. Kirkland","Well, let me start off. We have been engaged in Iraq and trying to find opportunities at Iraq for quite a period. We want to participate in their expansion. We believe what we have in front of us fits with what we'd like to do. It's early exploration. Our preference always is to explore, find, appraise and develop an opportunity. This fits with that. We're there to try to do once again that exploratory work to prove it. We've got wells to drill. We will be drilling a couple of wells in the near term. That was part of the commitment that was made for those blocks. We will be meeting that commitment. So we're encouraged from what we see of the geology. But once again, it's exploration. I don't know what's going to happen until we drill the wells. We feel good about the ability to actually get in there and do the work. We do see the terms -- the economic terms there would be attractive. It would fit in the portfolio with geologic success. So we feel good about it as an exploration play.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is this -- do you feel like it's enough of a position for now, or are you continuing to look and potentially add acreage in the future?","George L. Kirkland","Once again, we always are looking for an opportunity to expand, particularly where we have a belief that we have a good technical prospect. So I'd just leave it at that broad point.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. I think that wraps things up for this morning. In closing, let me say that we appreciate everyone's participation in the call today and your interest in Chevron. I especially want to thank each of the analysts on behalf of the participants for their questions during the session. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

My name is Sean, and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Pat Yarrington","Hey thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Upstream and Gas, and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager for Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on slide 2.","Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $5.4 billion, or $2.77 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. Our debt ratio at the end of June was approximately 12%. In the second quarter we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares and in the third quarter we expect to repurchase the same amount.","Turning to slide 4, cash generated from operations was $8.5 billion during the second quarter and $14.2 billion year to date. On last quarter\u2019s call, I noted adverse working capital effects which reduced first quarter cash generation. In the second quarter, we saw some but not complete reversal of these effects. We expect further working capital release as remainder of the year unfolds. ","In June, the company executed a $6 billion bond offering taking advantage of historically low borrowing costs. Capital and exploratory expenditures were $8.6 billion during the second quarter and $16.8 billion year to date. The year to date amount includes incremental resource acquisition outlays associated with Kitimat in Canada, Cooper Basin in Australia and Kurdistan. George will speak to the value drivers behind these additions a little later. ","At quarter end, our cash balances exceeded $22 billion giving us a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. As we indicated to you in March and as you saw in the first quarter, the company is moving toward a more traditional net debt structure. ","Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparison.","Jeff Gustavson","Thanks Pat. Turning to slide five, I'll compare results of the second quarter 2013 with the first quarter 2013. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter earnings were $5.4 billion, about $800 million lower than first quarter results.","Upstream earnings were down $967 million, reflecting lower liquids realizations and higher operating expenses associated with increase maintenance activities, partly offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects.","Downstream results increased $65 million between quarters. The increase was driven by higher downstream volumes following heavy maintenance during the prior quarter, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses in lower chemical earnings. The variance in the other bar largely reflects favorable corporate tax items during the quarter.","On slide six, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the second quarter were $49 million lower than first quarter's results. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $25 million, driven by decline in crude oil prices, partially offset by an increase in natural gas prices.","Higher production volumes, primarily from our San Joaquin Valley, California and Delaware Basin, New Mexico operations increased earnings by $40million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including higher operating expenses related to maintenance and other production related activities, as well as slightly higher exploration expenses.","Turning to slide seven, International Upstream earnings were $918 million lower than the first quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $550 million, average liquids unit realizations declined by 8% in line with the decrease in average current spot prices between quarters.","The timing of lifting in Kazakhstan and across multiple other countries decrease earnings by $60 million, higher operating expenses due to increase maintenance activities in the startup of the LNG plant in Angola, decrease earnings by $195 million between periods.","A favorable swing in foreign currency effects improved earnings by about $105 million. The second quarter had a gain of about $275 million, compared to a gain of about $170 million in the first quarter. The other bar includes the absence of favorable tax effects during the first quarter and higher exploration expenses.","Slide eight; summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decrease 63,000 barrels per day between quarters. Lower prices increase volumes under production sharing in variable royalty contracts during the second quarter by about 5,000 barrels per day.","Plan turnaround activities in Kazakhstan and Australia have the largest impact reducing production by 45,000 barrels per day. The base business in other bar includes normal fuel declines in lower natural gas demand primarily in Thailand.","Turning to slide nine, U.S. Downstream earnings were essentially flat between periods. Higher volumes increased earnings by $245 million at several refineries came back on line during the second quarter, following a particularly heavy maintenance period during the first quarter.","Stronger margins increased earnings by $50 million due to lower crude prices, as well as tighter product inventories, operating expenses increased by $180 million largely due to higher fuel consumption, transportation and environmental related expenses.","Lower chemicals results reduced earnings by $110 million, primarily due to lower ethylene margins and reduced volumes on planned and unplanned downtime at two separate plans.","On slide 10, International Downstream earnings improved by $63 million between quarters. Higher volume increased earnings by $80 million primarily on the absence of maintenance activities at the Cap Town, South Africa and Burnaby, Canada refineries. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $50 million reflecting higher fuel usage and employee cost.","The other bar includes a number of unrelated items including an unfavorable swing in foreign exchange impacts and weaker refining margins, partially offset by positive inventory evaluation effects driven by following prices during the second quarter.","Slide 11, covers all other. Second quarter net charges were $350 million, compared to $439 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $89 million between periods. Favorable corporate tax items resulted in $145 million benefit to earnings, while corporate charges were $56 million higher this quarter.","In part, higher corporate charges reflected an asset impairment as noted in our interim update. Year-to-date net charges in the All Other segment were 789 million at the end of the second quarter. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $400 million to $500 million for the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. ","George is now going to provide an update on our upstream operations. George?","George Kirkland ","","Thank you Jeff and good morning. To begin, I\u2019d like to note the progress of our Jack\/St. Malo and Big Foot projects for the Gulf of Mexico. This photo shows the hulls of both platforms at the yard in Ingleside, Texas. The topside modules and hulls of the projects are currently being integrated. Since this photo was taken, additional modules were set on top of the Big Foot, which is pictured on the left. The Jack\/St. Malo towed to its location is scheduled for year end. Jack\/St. Malo and Big Foot remain on schedule for 2014 startup and these are important contributors to our 2017 production target, supporting our profitable growth.","Now let\u2019s take a look at our financial performance on slide 13. Our 2013 year-to-date upstream earnings margin was $23.88 per barrel. Based on first half results for the peer group, we continue to lead the competition by a considerable margin. We are almost $6.50 per barrel ahead of our nearest competitor. We have now held this top position for 14 consecutive quarters. This result flows from the quality of our investment decisions, the strength of our portfolio and the strong execution performance of our base business and projects. ","I\u2019m also very pleased with our upstream return on capital employed which is almost 20%. I expect this to rank at the top of our peer group. ","Now I\u2019ll cover our 2013 production on slide 14. Production in the first half of the year averaged 2.61 million barrels a day, at an average year-to-date Brent price of $107.50 per barrel. The first half results are near our forecast, giving our planned turnaround and maintenance activity. We anticipate an increase in production in the second half of the year. Our 2013 production guidance remains unchanged at 2.65 million barrels a day at an average Brent price of $112 per barrel. ","I\u2019m pleased that Angola LNG has achieved startup and has now loaded two cargoes to date with another preparing to load. This significant milestone is the result of the hard work of many individuals in Angola and around the world. For the second half of the year, we anticipate Angola LNG will be ramping up and will be a large contributor to our production. We plan to load at least 13 cargoes by year end. Remember, at peak rates, ALNG should contribute about 60,000 barrels per day to our production. We will have additional production rampups from our other major capital projects including Usan and Tahiti 2. We restarted Frade in Brazil at the end of April and currently have 3 production wells online. As seen in the graph production growth in the second half also comes from our base operations. This includes additional cost recovery from production sharing contracts, additional production out of the Marcellus and an increased drilling activity in the Permian. These increases are partially offset by the planned turnarounds. ","Overall in 2013, we expect to have a similar level of turnaround activity as we had in 2012 and relatively heavy for both these years. We continue to have confidence in meeting our 2017 growth target as we bring on new projects and other key developments. ","I would like now to update you on the status of a few key projects. Turn to slide 15. Gorgon is now almost 67% complete. Barrow Island construction has achieved major milestones including the installation of the second gas turbine generation for Train 1.","The third of five generators for the site will arrive later this year. Seven major process modules are on their foundations and now 11 of the 51 modules are on Barrow Island. The remaining 10 Train 1 modules are schedule for delivery by year end.","We also recently completed the installation of the 20-inch domestic gas pipeline. The Gorgon team has resolved the logistic challenges they faced earlier, additional lay down areas on Barrow Island were established and material handling has significantly improved.","Increase transportation capacity has allowed the project to exceed material delivery targets. Construction productivity has improved in some key areas and our team is focused on increasing productivity across the Broad for Barrow Island construction.","Gorgon module fabrication is progressing and we are managing it closely. We also continue to carefully monitor labor costs and weather impacts.","In the Upstream, the first five sea -- subsea wellheads were set. We have finished the lower completion of all the Gorgon wells and 50% of the [Jens Iago] wells. As one of our key legacy assets, with over 200,000 barrels a day of production net Chevron share, Gorgon will be a major contributor to our future financial performance.","We have posted several updated photos of progress made at both Gorgon and Wheatstone on our Investor website located at chevron.com, and I\u2019ll encourage you to go there and look them.","Next, I will review progress on some of our other key developments. Wheatstone made significant progress in 2013, with the team focused onsite infrastructure and upstream fabrication. We now have over 2,200 people onsite at Onslow.","The offshore platform fabrication began in South Korea with erection of the seller deck. Offshore dragging began for the pipeline. The first phase of the construction village has been completed and the new runway at Onslow airport is nearing completion. The remaining activities for 2013 focused on site work to prepare for module deliveries in 2014. Wheatstone remains on target for a late 2016 startup.","Kitimat marked an important milestone on July 1st, with the transfer of operatorship for LNG plant in the Pacific Trail Pipeline development to Chevron. Front-end engineering is progressing on plan. Early earthworks continue at the LNG plant site were a total of 6.5 million cubic yards of earth and rock have to move.","LNG marketing activities and engagement with potential foundation customers are underway. We are focusing on Asian markets and aimed to have 60% to 70% of the LNG volumes under long-term commitment prior to a final investment decision.","In mid-July, we entered into an arrangement with YPF to facilitate the development of a section of the Vaca Muerta Shale Basin, which has a significant potential for both liquids and gas production.","This initial program includes 100 wells in a Pacific portion of 96,000 acre development area. This development provides a new opportunity that we believe will be competitive with other projects in our portfolio.","Above ground risk, have largely been mitigated through government decrease and the financial structure, all in all we are pleased with the deal and the opportunity to participate in the development of this world-class resource. The projects that I\u2019ve just been reviewed provide legacy growth and production, and cash flow.","Now I\u2019ll provide an update on our exploration activities. Please turn to slide 17. We have another active year of exploration, where we all plan to invest over $3 billion. We're making great progress in our key focus areas of the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, Australia and North America unconventionals.","Outside of those areas, we have a mixture of conventional and unconventional exploration enhanced by key acreage additions. We have drilled or currently drilling 10 of our 14 plant impact wells for 2013, including the second well in the Kurdistan region of Iraq which spud on Wednesday. ","Now I will highlight a few areas of new activity for 2013. We are maintaining our emphasis on the Permian portfolio and we are increasing drilling activity in exploration, appraisal and development. We\u2019ve enhanced our position in the liquid rich Delaware basin and are now the largely leaseholder with significant potential in undeveloped acreage.","We drilled our first two wells in the Utica in Ohio and are encouraged by the preliminary results, and we will provide more details on this later this year. We\u2019ve added another block in Kurdistan -- in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and our plan is to complete and begin testing two wells this year. Our Australian portfolio has increased with the addition of acreage in the Cooper Basin tight gas [point]. Exploration and appraisal wells are in progress. ","We\u2019ve also acquired new acreage in China, Brazil, the US Gulf of Mexico and Morocco. Finally we just announced an agreement for the acquisition of additional acreage in the liquids rich region of the Kaybob, Duvernay basin. This complements our existing acreage position where we had drilled 10 of our 13 well program. Results for these stage fracs are positive with significant condensate yields. These portfolio additions demonstrate how we continue to selectively capture future growth opportunities remaining focused on value, adding assets that can sustain our strong financial performance. ","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Pat.","Pat Yarrington","Turning to slide 18, George just provided an update on recent upstream activity, three milestones were met in the quarter in our downstream business. First, the Richmond refinery successfully restarted. By quarter end, the refinery was fully operational and running at planned utilization rate. Second, GS Caltex\u2019s Yeosu refinery began commercial operation of the heavy oil upgrading unit which now makes Yeosu one of the largest heavy oil upgraders in South Korea. This unit came online three months ahead of schedule.","Third, our chemical joint venture Chevron Phillips Company announced plans to expand its ethylene production at its Sweeny Complex in Texas. ","I will close by highlighting our continued strong performance on total shareholder return as shown on this slide. We continue to lead the peer group by a significant margin which shows we are executing well against the right strategies. I would also like to point out the balanced manner in which our returns were achieved. We know the importance of not only providing returns via a competitive and growing dividend but also from disciplined reinvestments in our business to generate future value. We are fully committed to delivering disciplined growth and shareholder value and our objective is to continue to lead the peer group on total shareholder returns for a long time to come.","We appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. And now I would like to open the microphones for questions. We do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up if necessary. We will do our best to see that we get all your questions answered.","Sean, please open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.","","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","On the recent acquisition commitments in Argentina, it was at a time when your CapEx is very elevated, and additionally I think there has been some legal issues around, can you just underline for us why you are making a move like that at a time, as I said, when your CapEx is still elevated and (inaudible) the legal complexity that you probably really don\u2019t need?","George Kirkland","Well, Paul, it always starts back at what\u2019s the opportunity set out there and how does it compete in the future, we\u2019d like the opportunity from a technical point of view. When you look at it technically, this opportunity, much of the shale is in 1000 foot range of thickness. So it\u2019s very attractive that way. We\u2019ve been in Argentina a long period of time. So we understand, I think, Argentina quite well. So we feel comfortable that way. And we always have within our portfolio some ability to spend our money in different ways.","We have the ability because of our base business programs that we can move some moneys around. I go back, the other point would be that opportunities are there when they are available and this one is available.","On the legal side, I would start off and say, first-off, we really don\u2019t believe there is any legitimate legal claim against us. So that\u2019s -- we're pretty confident about that. We think we\u2019re in a good position there.","Back home, the development itself we see this very much as a stage development over a long period of time. The initial work is 100 wells and depending upon that success, we will move forward from there.","We also see Argentina as a country that\u2019s got a large resource potential. We really believe that over the long period of time, they can move from an importer potentially, an exporter accrued. And once again, the time for the opportunity was now.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So it\u2019s\u2026.","Pat Yarrington","Go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","So I was just going to follow-on with -- on reference, your sales reference, this is a high-intensity period of CapEx with the two Australian LNG projects above all, simultaneously in your Q. Can you talk about your longer term CapEx and the potential to bring that down with a view to generating more free cash flow or are you intending to push through to try and grow the company beyond the existing 3.3 million barrel equivalent target that you have for 2017? Thanks.","George Kirkland","First, Paul, we\u2019ve got to disconnect those two. They are not necessarily they are totally connected. At our March meeting when we met in New York, we told people that we see our growth beyond 3.3. We did not disclose what their growth would be. It\u2019s a little premature to go there but we do see growth beyond that.","One of the points that we talked about it that time was the growth that we saw that would be coming from a future growth project and the low pressure management project in Tengiz.","When we originally committed to our 3.3, about 80,000 barrels a day of our growth to 2017 was related to the Tengiz expansion. And that project is not going to be on line in 2017. So it contributes to significant growth. And remember the Tengiz project in total will add -- the expansion will add about 130,000 to 140,000 barrels a day of net production for Chevron.","So we do see growth beyond 2017. But likewise, we always see some projects that tend to move a little bit to the right, move a little bit later. So we take that money and invest it in other opportunities because we have a very strong portfolio. I would tell you as we get Gorgon and Wheatstone completed those investments, we do not have anything as large in our portfolio on a capital expenditure basis as large as those.","So from that perspective, we will see some decline in our capital program in a relative sense. But remember, we\u2019re also going to be a lot bigger in the barrel side. We will have a lot more barrels to our cash flows. Our cash flows will be high. We got very strong margins.","So we\u2019ve got that combination to go forward. So it\u2019s a combination of things that move around but remember portfolio, lot of barrels, lot of barrel growth, 25% growth. We\u2019re looking at holding our margins, our margins which are industry leading we think we will hold them. So we\u2019re going to have cash flow growth and a flattening and I would call it more a flattening of a capital program going forward. ","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank","","Thanks George and thanks all of you, thanks also for taking the time to come on the call.","Pat Yarrington","","Thanks Paul. Okay, next one?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Good morning everybody and George, thanks for the update on the upstream projects and clear on the free cash flow. My first question is on the Permian. Now there has clearly been a lot of exciting industry results, you entered the Cimarex joint venture. I know you\u2019re building a technology center there. I mean can you quantify at all for us the activity ramp or potential organic growth there in the basin and how Chevron is building or expanding its Permian capabilities to run a bigger organization? And I have a follow up.","George Kirkland ","Maybe I\u2019ll start back with what we said in March of this year. We expect to drill over 300 wells in the Permian Basin, in the Midland Basin itself we see growth in the Delaware Basin. Remember we added the Chesapeake acreage in New Mexico to acreage we\u2019d already had there. This recent Cimarex deal in the Permian is really is bringing together a checkerboard of acreage of ours and Cimarex. Why do we do that? Well we do that to increase efficiency and effectiveness of the dollars we spend. We reduce geographic acreage loss if you will. We can drill longer laterals, so it\u2019s just a much more efficient way to develop that acreage. As we said in March, we are going to see our rig count grow considerably over this period. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done anything post-March that doesn\u2019t fit with the plans that we showed at the March meeting. Our plans are pretty consistent in that growth profile both in acreage and in barrels. We do expect that our net production to grow towards in the Permian Basin into that 200,000 barrels. ","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","But I mean just any color\u2026","George Kirkland ","So -- go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, I didn\u2019t know, there was any color on the technology center that you\u2019re building or people addition or just what investments you are making to build an infrastructure that would support more significant organic growth there. ","George Kirkland ","We will. We have committed to a tech center there. We have -- we are starting a building, a significant building project there, [harness] project. We\u2019ve purchased land and moving forward we are building that. And I would also tell you, remember, we\u2019ve got a big support function for that unit also out of Houston. So we\u2019re -- I think we\u2019re in good shape on what we have in Midland and we have a strong commitment, we have lots of acreage and Midland and the Permian Basin and the Delaware Basin are long-term assets for us. But I don\u2019t really have anything that\u2019s new beyond what we presented in March.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s fair. And if I could a second on just quickly on Gorgon. Can you provide any update on cost trends or color since your guidance earlier in the year or when or what key milestones will trigger any cost update there?","George Kirkland ","Well I would tell you we\u2019re always looking at the cost and watching the cost. We review the project once every month from my level and John Watson, we both take a -- have a project review once a month. We look at progress, we look at costs, we look at issues, we look at mitigations that our project team are putting in place. And as you know, a big project like this there is always issues that people are solving problems. And our people are very good at that.","I mentioned today that we really think we have solved the issue around the logistics; that was important for us. We are not going to know a lot more on costs till we get really much further in. we don\u2019t see any major disconnects at this point.","We see, as an example, the first half of the year exchange rates are really pretty close to what we assumed in our plan. It\u2019s -- the first part of the year, the rates were higher than parity, the second quarter they were down but for the year they are pretty close. And now we\u2019re seeing a shift in exchange rates that are -- in our -- positive for us with exchange rates coming down and we are in a period where we got major expenditures in Australia.","We\u2019ve got a lot of moving parts there, so we can always tell where we've been a lot better than where everything is going and any issues once again we try to mitigate those as they go. But I don\u2019t see anything major on the costs side. It\u2019s still back to productivity and I\u2019ll emphasize it\u2019s critical to get productivity on Barrow Island and it\u2019s important for us to have good weather.","Weather is an extremely important part of our success there and we\u2019re in the good part of the year right now, between now and December we are outside of major weather impacts. So we\u2019re in a period that we get to December. We will know and offer lot more. We are 67% now and every time you get little bit closer towards 100% you can do a lot better forecasting.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great. Always helpful, George. Thanks.","George Kirkland","Thank you.","Pat Yarrington","Thanks Evan. Next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. My thanks for the E&P update as well. Just a follow-up question on Kitimat, where you have now had sometime to look at the project? And I know the two pieces our progressing the feed and then I think you mentioned you want to get 60%, 70% of the deal sold to long-term customers?","On that later point, you now have Exxon with the big project in the area. I think Shell\u2019s get one. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to give a bunch of specifics, though we\u2019d certainly welcome them? But can you at all talk about, how it\u2019s going in terms of marketing this. I know there is a question us to whether they\u2019re might be some linkage to Henry Hub? How are you feeling about Kitimat and it position and your ability to get that gas sold? Thank you.","George Kirkland","Well, first off, I\u2019d say, I think, we have a considerable time lead versus any of the other developments in the BC region. This project has permits and plays for export. It has approval and permits in place for the site. We\u2019ve got most of the agreements for the pipeline route with the First Nations. Matter of fact, I think 15 or 16 of the groups of First Nation have already agreed.","So I think we are in quite lead on the early part of a project. We\u2019ve also done a feed, one Train and we are now moved into a two Train feed to build two Trains there, we\u2019ve been involved in that. So we do have more work on feed but we are moving quite well on the feed work.","So, we\u2019ll go back, once again, we are in a great competitive spot on schedule. That should help us a lot in dealing with those that want to buy gas that puts our project in many ways ahead of others, so for the buyers that need gas sooner in a very positive position.","We do not plan to have Henry Hub linkage. We expect the Henry Hub equivalent value will come through some equity sell-down. We do plan to have a partner as buyers, we are going to offer volumes, some volumes and interest in the plant as a combination. We think that\u2019s a big advantage. We frankly think that\u2019s better than Henry Hub pricing.","Henry Hub like any index has variability, variability means it goes up or it can go down and we believe that we can get the same or a better situation for a buyer through their participation, equity participation in the Kitimat project.","We can do that because the two partners in us and Apache each hold 50%. We hold very strong working interest in the plant and in the resources. So we have that ability to move that way.","So our goal is, of course, to maintain advantage, first mover advantage in that. But at the same time, move the project at the right speed, having done all the appropriate technical work. And once again having all the commercial work done to gets us to 60% to 70% position with regard to sales. We\u2019ve had some initial discussions with Asian buyers. We will not disclose the ones that we\u2019re talking with at this time. But we are moving that forward. ","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s just very darn helpful. Just a very quick follow up in terms of the appropriate speed, we\u2019ve always thought that this is more likely to be a 2014 FID versus \u201813 which I think at one point had been talked about -- I don\u2019t know if you can comment on that.","George Kirkland","I wouldn\u2019t disagree that it's more likely to be a 2014 FID. Once again we\u2019ve got to have all the right work done and what's critical for us and we\u2019re not progressing the project through FID until we have these agreements at least at a HOA level for 60% to 70% that will take us into 2014, to get those completed. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. ","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks very much for all of the information this morning. Just coming to the offshore, I mean it feels as if with a loss position in the Permian and some of the LNG projects that you have, the write on offshore regrets and subsea costs might mean a shift in the portfolio. So I guess two questions, one is how are you mitigating the rise, what are you views on those offshore costs? And how much flexibility do you have to sort of shift capital around to avoid that inflation?","George Kirkland","Well, everything depends upon the economics of the projects and our portfolio which is nice and large, we can move monies around. I will you each one of these investments look a little bit different. If you look at a deepwater development we end up with large wells on production sands, high production rates and because of that huge upfront cash flows, these projects come in, they have relatively high DD&A rate, would you look at their operating expense, they are extremely low and they have very strong margins. And it\u2019s back to economics. ","So now I will tell that the cost structure in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico post Macondo is higher. We have seen a 20% to 25% rise in the cost of wells. I will tell you we\u2019re trying to offset that in many other ways. Technology is one way. If you remember at our presentation in March this year and more recent press release of just around -- I think also in the March period where we talked about the performance of our multi-zone, the single -- our multi-frac single trip frac pack, we had great success with that. It saved us anywhere from 20 to 50 days in the completion operations of our deepwater Lower Tertiary wells. This multi-zone frac pack is a huge benefit for us in the cost side and our original -- in our initial test of the well after that we had very high rates. So I want to take you back this back to what do we think we can get on value proposition, we\u2019ve got the people to do the work in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We had the oil capability also onshore. And we will make choices on that but it comes heavily back to the technical quality of the asset. ","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","I mean now that some people have deferred projects but at the moment the rig rates in subsea are they expensive enough given technology for you to do the same, is that what I am hearing?","George Kirkland","Our view of Jack\/St. Malo today on economic basis is stronger than when we went to FID. Our project view has improved, as we learn more and more particularly about the Lower Tertiary and our ability to change the recovery rates in the Lower Tertiary, we see this as a better and better opportunity. Remember Jack\/St. Malo we talked only of about a $500 million barrel tight recovery for those two fields and that was on 8% to 10% recovery rate. We\u2019re focusing on those technologies that can change that recovery rate and potentially raise it up to over 20%. And when you have the infrastructure in place already that additional production and additional recovery is frankly very economic.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thank you very much.","George Kirkland","But each one of them is a decision into itself. We have to have to confidence in how much we are going to produce and we have to also have confidence -- when we reach up there, we do have confidence in how much we will spend to get that return.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Very clear. Thanks George.","George Kirkland","Okay and thank you.","Pat Yarrington","Next caller?","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning everybody. Good morning George.","George Kirkland","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Question for you George. I want to ask you about portfolio capital intensity and I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand is when you set the original target for 2017, the CapEx numbers have been creeping higher but there is lot of stuff coming into the portfolio and the margin anyway that wasn\u2019t in the original plan, for example, the Permian Basin.","So I\u2019m trying to understand, our things -- good thing for the right as you mentioned in your prepared remarks and the spending basically making up the difference and maybe just in order of magnitude, you\u2019re spending about 20% more than I guess your largest peer on a per barrel basis, I\u2019m just curious if you can just give us some flavors as to that whether or not you think that as a sustainable level of spend?","George Kirkland","Well, let me go back and say there are things that we had talked about and I gave the example of the future growth, the expansion in Tengiz as moving to the right. When I move to the right, when I moved later, it did move capital that way also. We look at these portfolio additions on the strength of them. And we don\u2019t only think about our investment ratios in per barrel basis. We are influenced heavily by the cash flow that these barrels give us.","That\u2019s back to -- I don\u2019t believe we would be investing for this much growth if we did not have the strength of portfolio to generate the cash. Our earnings per barrel and our cash flow per barrel that we are generating, allows us on a cash flow basis to actually be investing much lower than many of our competitors.","So we are investing on a cash basis less than most. It\u2019s heavily influenced of course by the quality and the amount of cash that we\u2019re generating from these barrels. I do believe that you\u2019re going to see our capital investment rate flatten with time. And it\u2019s really a function of the LNG projects that we\u2019re in today.","We\u2019ve got Gorgon and Wheatstone which are very large. They build huge infrastructure and capacity for the future. They have very flat long lives. So we\u2019re building for them with them. I always tell people remember when Gorgon and Wheatstone together are on, that\u2019s over 400,000 barrels net per day for Chevron. Those are company side assets.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe I could ask my follow up with Pat is a related question. Pat, you obviously hold a lot of caps in balance sheet that\u2019s not generating earnings .What is your expectations for that trend as a proportion of capital rise or fall over the next several years non-producing capital, I mean, when you get there. Thank you.","Pat Yarrington","Right. I think consistent with where George was going, I mean you are absolutely right. We are sustaining a relatively high proportion of pre-productive capital we call it at the present time. You would expect that rate to be sustained high until you get projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone coming on line. Both of those two projects combined, represent about $45 billion Chevron share of spending over this seven-year period of time if you look at the construction period for both projects. So that\u2019s obviously a significant component and until you get those projects online, we\u2019re going to have relatively high preproductive capital. Once those projects become online, then of course we anticipate that that proportionality will decline. ","George Kirkland ","Ed, I\u2019d just like to make one additional addition to that. I\u2019d take you back to the ROCE we have in our upstream segment. Yes, we do have a large capital employed that is not yet returning revenues and earnings. But even with that, you look at the return on the capital employed in total, we are leading in our segment. So that tells you where we\u2019ve invested and the performance of that portfolio is very strong. So it\u2019s back to our ability to invest is driven heavily by the quality of the existing portfolio to generate cash flow where we can invest in these large growth projects which are going to give us a 25% volume growth between now and 2017.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for your answers folks.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your question.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","","Hey guys, good morning. ","George Kirkland ","Good morning.","Pat Yarrington","","Good morning Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","George, maybe a little bit of this, from a strategic standpoint that we are looking at Kitimat in order for this to become a really great project, you probably look beyond just Train 1 or 2, I don\u2019t know whether that you really have sufficient gas resource up there yourself. So logistically then how share volume you look at here, so you will be just essentially saying okay, I have gas resource for the first two train and get it going and then subsequently I would be just be the owner of the train and not necessarily to be the owner of the natural gas and just process other people\u2019s gas or that you actually think that is important for you guys to be fully integrated?","George Kirkland ","Well the second point first, I think it is very important to be fully integrated and to have the resource. Our view is being tempered at this point in time because we haven\u2019t been in the project as long as Apache has. But I take you back to the view that Apache is on the press with and what they view Liard and Horn River, their view of Liard alone is approximately 50 Tcf of gas. So if you take 50 Tcf of gas and you take Horn River and Liard, you\u2019ve got something greater than that. That is much more gas than is needed for a two train plant. A two train plant is more likely to be in the 15T of gas required. Bottom line, we are not short of gas at all in the Kitimat development. Our issue is to get foundation customers and the foundation project in place and then find a way to -- the next step is to look at the expansions. I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time on the expansions yet until we get -- we really get past having the first 2 trains once again sold from a market point of view and then get them post FID.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Right. But I think I guess my question is that in the event if that those huge numbers that talked by Apache did not materialize and end up to be smaller, you still won\u2019t willing that you have to integrate model that including the ownership in the resource?","George Kirkland ","Yeah I think we need that -- to have surety of the supply to feed the plant. So we\u2019re quite confident at this point for the first two trains. We\u2019ve done enough work that are confidence is high that there is a large volume of gas there. We have lots of appraisal work that will be done in Liard to confirm those volumes as we go forward. But I will tell you, all my engagement with our partner is quite confident in the quality of this resource.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Second one, George, can you give somewhat idea that the base on your drilling result and how is the [metric] whether its Brent oil, condensate or NGL, what\u2019s our split we are talking about in the Permian Basin that you\u2019re drilling right now as well as Utica?","George Kirkland","I can give you a lot more on what we\u2019re seeing in the Permian Basin. We\u2019re focusing on the portion of the basin that we see greater than 50% liquids and I say 50% liquids looking at really the oil and condensate side, LNGs, pardon me -- LPG is not what I\u2019m speaking of.","So it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s over 50% OEG in liquid with oil and condensate side. That\u2019s why we like it so much that that really carries a lot of value. In the Utica, I\u2019m not really prepared to give you those numbers, I would just simply take you back to what I said in my prepared comments for today that we are pleased with what we see.","We\u2019ve had about 30 days of production test, production run actually on the first two wells. It\u2019s a little early to speak on that and we should be prepared in a little bit later in the third quarter to give a little bit more information on the Utica.","But flexes just a little bit early, I would also tell you probably same time we would be prepared to speak a little bit more about the Duvernay in Canada because it is once again also a liquid play. And we\u2019ve just closed this -- closed on this additional 67,000 acres up in the Duvernay.","I would tell you also maybe as the general comment, what we try to do every quarter is to have a big anchor position, like in the Permian Basin and then build additional acreage around it before we disclose all our results. It only make sense for us not to get our disclosures out in front of where we\u2019re trying to move from a commercial point of view.","So we feel very good what we are in the Permian Basin. And my expectation is that we have other opportunities like Cimarex, we will make those happen to. But we like very much to get a nice position, build that position and it\u2019s particularly nice to build that position after you, truly understand the subsurface. So you understand how the rocks are and really how much of the volume is going to be oil or gas.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","George, is Permian is a primary frac oil or just primary condensate for you?","George Kirkland","The Permian is primarily oil.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Frac oil for you.","Pat Yarrington","Thank you.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Pat Yarrington","Thank you, Paul.","George Kirkland","Light oil.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie","Yeah. Thank you. I just want to follow up on LNG marketing which has been raised by few others. When you think about putting Kitimat into the marketplace, how do you contrast that with the potential for brownfield expansions at your Australian projects. How do you prioritize getting one into the market versus the other? And then just related to that, what\u2019s you sense of urgency in getting volumes into the market right now, given that there are projects moving forward pretty quickly in both East Africa and on the U.S. Golf Coast?","George Kirkland","Lot of question there Jason I\u2019ll try to hit those. I\u2019ll start of with contrasting maybe our Gorgon trains for versus what we have at Kitimat. First difference is scale and to the buyer we have a bigger offering of volume. We have 11 million tons with two trains, and we are doing the joint marketing. So we have 11 million tons there on offer that we will be available and once again we want to have 60% to 70% and we would be willing very much to move up to the 80% at the time of start up.","In the case of Gorgon train for its 5.2 million ton per annum additional train, the difference there is also the gas coming out of Gorgon is marketed by each of the partners. We -- we're remarketing about 47% of the gas in Exxon Mobil and Shell, each have about 25%. So it\u2019s a much smaller volume to move for us, the plus for Gorgon is you\u2019re brown -- you\u2019re brownfield.","So you\u2019ve got an advantage on the plant side, depending upon on where we are going in Asia, there is no difference in transportation from in distance and cost from going to Kitimat or coming from Australia. It actually depending on where you\u2019re going in if it\u2019s in North Asia, there may be a slight advantage for Kitimat. So it could be positive for us there but volumetrically it\u2019s positive.","We do think from a development cost that -- the development cost at Kitimat on the upstream may end up being less than in the case of Gorgon. Gorgon has the benefit of the brownfield on the plant side. We have we think more control on the Kitimat project because of the partnership.","We have 50% there and I think a very aligned partner and we are jointly selling the gas that I mentioned. In the case of Gorgon Train 4, three companies are selling the gas. So there is a different alignment there. We\u2019re happy to see both of them move. They are a little bit of a horserace between them at this point in our own shop.","East Africa I didn\u2019t mention and I think people here reminded me, I actually see East Africa behind both of these projects. I don\u2019t believe East Africa from my perspective yet has an operator that\u2019s in place or a unit that\u2019s been created to move that project forward. So I think we do have a timing advantage on both of those projects to first gas. Gorgon we know we\u2019ve got all the gas, Kitimat we\u2019re confident of we\u2019ve got all the gas for two trains. So I think we have a little bit of an advantage there. And we do know our fiscal regime and regulatory regime in both the locations in which we operate very clearly. ","Pat Yarrington","Okay, thank you Jason. Next question? I think we have time for a couple more questions.","Operator","","Okay. Our next question is all set from Iain Reid with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Iain Reid - Jefferies","","Yeah hi there. Pat, could I ask you a question actually about the share buyback. You said earlier you\u2019re moving into more of a kind of net debt position going forward. You\u2019re obviously spending both on CapEx and dividend significantly more than you\u2019re generating cash flow at the moment and the buyback is kind of accelerating that process into net debt. What sort of point do you think the buyback has done its job in terms of that process? Have you got a kind of target level of gearing which you are aiming for? And when can we think about you perhaps scaling this back over the next several quarters? Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","It\u2019s a good question. I think I\u2019ve explained before how we look at share buybacks and it really is we try to take a medium-term point of view, we take a look at what\u2019s happening to commodity prices, we look at what our opportunity for reinvestment in the business in, we look at obviously a growing dividend profile that we want to make sure comes right off the top. We want to maintain flexibility in our financial structure and after we\u2019ve done that, sort of equation, if there are funds left over, that\u2019s when we fall into the share repurchase category. We do want to take -- we have tried to take a more medium term point of view here and not be in and out of the market just depending upon instantaneous circumstances in a given quarter. ","We do not have a targeted leverage ratio for the corporation. We look at the leverage ratio really as being an outcome of these other decisions that we have made. And we have tremendous additional leverage capacity as you well know. We\u2019re sitting here today with a 12% debt ratio; we have a long way to go before being overlevered becomes one of our problems. So I think you can consider when you look out and forecast your own commodity prices and take a look at the development stream that we\u2019ve got available to us and you look at our past practice on dividend streams, you can put together a cash flow model. We have a long way to go before net debt becomes a challenge for us.","Iain Reid - Jefferies","Okay, thanks for that. And can I just ask one very quick question for George? On Brazil, George, you talked about Frade coming gradually back on stream. But in that kind of growth profile you\u2019re showing for the second half of the year, is Papa Terra in that and also I wonder if you could also comment on Chevron\u2019s view of the pre-sold round coming up from Brazil?","George Kirkland","Frade, as you said is part of that addition in second half. We had no production in Frade in the first quarter -- second quarter, an average about 5,000 barrels a day. Our share at the month of June, we were closer to 10,000 barrels a day, our share. So there is some expectation there that we will go grow in the second half or we will have more volume in the second half in our project, not too far off from our original plan, the field is performing at this point pretty well. So that\u2019s a plus.","On the case of Papa Terra, Papa Terra may come on production this year but it\u2019s not going to be a significant mover on production. Petrobras is still talking about bringing it own this year but it\u2019s late in the year. So we do not believe that it will -- it will be significant mover on our production for the year.","With regards to the deepwater round, all our exploration opportunities, we review the opportunities set and we never disclosed upfront what we think of it, we always talk about what we did afterward and give more color at that point in time.","Iain Reid - Jefferies","Okay, George. Thanks very much.","George Kirkland","Thank you.","Pat Yarrington","Okay. Thank you. I think we\u2019ve got one more -- time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Our final question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Thanks. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. Just on the key exploration around acreage traditions, it seems like you guys definitely had a good amount of acreage during the year and a few bolt-on acquisitions. Can you give us an idea of what the -- how much of that is your capital budget that made up and what\u2019s your appetite going forward. And I have a follow-up on downstream side.","George Kirkland","Faisel Khan, I\u2019d like to do a little bit of work because I think about 25% of 30% of our moneys are outside of our focus areas on the drilling side. So it\u2019s in that range. We like to keep -- in the past, we tried to push usually as much as 80%. So we\u2019re more in the 70% this year in our focus areas. And that\u2019s -- once again, I have kept the numbers exactly where we are for the year but the plan was we were going to be a little bit lighter in our focus areas this year.","Our appetite is driven by a couple of things. It\u2019s of course the amount of money we have to spend and also the scale in the quality of the opportunity. It starts very much with quality of the rock that rock doesn\u2019t work we don\u2019t view the risk and the scale of the opportunity to be attractive. We don\u2019t go there. So it\u2019s not about acreage, it\u2019s about quality.","Preferentially, if possible, we like to be in a low-cost option situation. We like to get a nice piece of acreage with a seismic obligation and minimal or low numbers of wells to drill. And that\u2019s particularly the case in these test areas, these areas outside of our focus areas. We don\u2019t want to get saddled with a really large program and then draw high risk well and find out it\u2019s not very attractive.","So we tend to try to do that everywhere around the world and a lot of these opportunities that we moved into recently are very much structured that way, not a large amount of calls on upfront entry. And they have seismic obligations and small drilling obligations to answer really the geological question.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Got it. On the downstream earnings -- focus on the U.S., the U.S. downstream results, if I extract out the chemical earnings, which I guess we can get that to Phillips 66, it seems like U.S. downstream earnings are basically breakeven, even first quarter and second quarter and given the refining position and marketing position you guys have, I would have thought that there would be a lot more profitability out of these assets. So can you give us an idea of how these assets are going to deliver that level of profitability? I know you\u2019ve talked about Richmond being down, I know some of the environmental expenses associated with that. But can you talk about how this -- taking out chemicals, how does U.S. sort of downstream perform in a way it probably should?","Pat Yarrington","Right. Faisel I think the key item is one that you already mentioned for our performance in the first half and it does have to do with unit downtime. If I look at the first six months of this year and look at what our utilization rates were for our -- this will be worldwide but it\u2019s obviously heavily influenced by the assets that we have in the U.S. If I look at our operated utilization rate for the first half, it\u2019s running a good 10 points or so below what would have -- you would have seen on average for the 2011 or 2012 time period. And that is a big penalty to absorb from an earnings standpoint. As we go forward and we look at the second half the year, I did mention that Richmond is up and fully operational. But as we look at the second half of the year, the vast majority of our downtime is already in the rearview window at this point. So I think going forward, if we can run reliably, then you\u2019ll have a much better outcome.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","","Okay great. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.","Pat Yarrington","Okay. Well I think that concludes the call for the day and I appreciate everybody\u2019s interest in listening today and I particularly appreciate the questions that came in from the analysts. Shawn I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.","Operator","","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.","Wayne Borduin","Thank you Jonathan, and welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement and important information for investors and stockholders on slide 2.","Turning to slide 3. And Pierre? ","Pierre Breber","Thanks, Wayne. We had another solid quarter. The company delivered record production, led by continued strength in the Permian Basin and at Wheatstone in Australia. Jay will provide more detail shortly.","First, an overview of our financial results. Earnings were $4.3 billion or $2.27 per share. This is the highest reported quarterly result since the third quarter 2014 when Brent was over $100 a barrel. The quarter's results include special lighting gains, totaling $920 million from the Anadarko termination fee and a tax rate change in Alberta. Foreign exchange gains for the quarter were $15 million. Excluding special items and FX gains earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.77 per share.","A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations was almost $8 billion excluding working capital changes. We also maintained a strong balance sheet with a low debt ratio.","Importantly our continued strong cash flow allowed us to deliver on our commitment to return significant cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we paid over $2 billion in dividends. And after terminating our agreement with Anadarko, we resumed buybacks and repurchased $1 billion of shares during the quarter. Going forward we expect share buybacks at the $5 billion annual run rate or $1.25 billion per quarter, in line with our updated guidance stated in May.","We also continued to maintain capital discipline with a focus on increasing returns. Year-to-date organic CapEx was $9.6 billion, a little less than half of our $20 billion budget. Total CapEx, which includes acquisition costs that are unbudgeted such as the purchase of the Pasadena refinery, totaled $10 billion.","Turning to slide 4. Cash flow was strong and the trend is in line with full year guidance. Cash flow from operations excluding working capital increased this quarter due to growing production volumes and higher liquids realizations as well as the termination fee received from Anadarko.","Free cash flow, excluding working capital increased to $4.3 billion and supported the dividend, debt reduction and share buybacks. The company's cash flow breakeven remains in the low 50s on a Brent basis year-to-date.","Asset sale proceeds added to our cash flow and further lowered the breakeven while high-grading our portfolio. Since the beginning of 2018, asset sale proceeds have totaled $2.9 billion and we remain on track to divest $5 billion to $10 billion of assets by 2020.","Turning to Slide 5, second quarter 2019 earnings of $4.3 billion increased about $900 million versus the prior year. Excluding special items and FX, upstream earnings were relatively flat as higher production was offset by lower realizations. Downstream earnings also were relatively flat as timing effects were offset by lower margins. The variance in the other segment was primarily the result of lower corporate charges.","Turning to Slide 6, compared to the first quarter, second quarter earnings increased by about $1.7 billion. Excluding special items and FX, upstream results were roughly flat as higher liftings in crude realizations were offset by lower gas realizations, higher DD&A, and other expenses.","Australia gas realizations were lower primarily due to lower LNG spot prices and a higher ratio of spot LNG sales, while U.S. gas realizations reflected weaker Henry Hub and Waha pricing. Downstream earnings excluding FX improved by about $520 million due to stronger U.S. West Coast refining and marketing margins and timing effects, partly offset by the impact of planned downtime. The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges.","I'll now pass it to Jay.","Jay Johnson","Thanks Pierre. On Slide 7, second quarter oil equivalent production increased 9% compared to a year ago with shale and tight production increasing in the Delaware and Midland Basin and production from major capital projects increasing with ramp-ups at Wheatstone, Hebron, and Big Foot. Our base business production increased as Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater brownfield developments more than offset natural declines across the portfolio.","Turning to Slide 8, second quarter production was strong at more than 3 million barrels a day for the third straight quarter. Year-to-date production excluding asset sales is about 5% higher than 2018 consistent with our guidance of 4% to 7% growth as shown by the middle bar.","Second quarter production was impacted by planned turnarounds and asset sales which together had an impact of almost 70,000 barrels a day. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect production growth to be primarily driven by our shale and tight assets as well as the continued ramp-up of Big Foot and Hebron. This growth will be partially offset by higher turnaround activity in the third quarter. Our full year outlook is expected to be in line with this guidance even before adjusting for the entitlement impacts of higher prices.","Let's turn to the Permian. In the next three slides, I'll provide some additional information regarding the attractive performance and the potential of this asset. Permian shale and tight production continues to track the guidance we provided at our 2019 Security Analyst Meeting. In the second quarter, production was 421,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day, an increase of over 150,000 barrels a day, or about 55% relative to the same quarter last year. The strong performance demonstrates our track record of consistent execution and we expect to deliver 900,000 barrels per day in 2023 with a relatively steady rig count.","Moving to the mix of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas about three-quarters of our Permian production is liquids and half of our production is crude oil. We expect these proportions to continue throughout the forecasted period. As discussed in the past, we have an advantaged royalty position across the Permian, and it's comprised of two distinct components. First, we have a royalty benefit shown on the dotted blue wedge as our actual royalty rate is lower than the standard royalty rate.","The second component comes from the royalty barrels shown by the hashed blue wedge, which are the barrels we received from the acreage that we've leased to other producers. Of course, these barrels require no Chevron capital. In total, these royalty contributions make up about 20% of our production throughout the five-year period and contribute to delivering our expected production profile.","Let's turn to slide 10. Our work to reduce unit cost and increase productivity continues. We're optimizing our Permian factory and maintaining our focus on delivering industry-leading returns. This slide shows the progress, we've made since 2016. As shown on the left, we continue to drive higher EURs by optimizing well spacing, landing zones, and completions. The average lateral length of our wells continues to increase and is expected to approach 10,000 feet next year as we execute our core-up strategy for our development areas.","As illustrated in the upper right, these efforts translate into a sustained reduction in unit development and production costs. The chart on the lower right shows that the royalty benefit alone leads to returns that are about 10 percentage points higher than a comparable well subject to the standard royalty burden. As we said before, our strategy in the Permian is to be highly competitive in our execution, leverage our midstream capability and use our advantaged royalty position to make us the clear leader in financial returns.","Slide 11 shows that we're well on our way. As stated in March, we expect to be free cash flow positive next year, and we expect to grow free cash flow each year thereafter. Earnings are expected to strengthen exceeding $4 billion in 2023. All of this assumes the same reference prices communicated at our 2019 Security Analyst Meeting.","As the Permian production increases, we expect to see operational cash flow nearly twice the level of C&E by 2023 and a return on capital employed of about 30% all delivered by an optimized ratable factory with relatively low execution risk.","To more than double production, while being free cash flow positive, every year starting next year, and generate returns on capital in excess of 20% along the way, shows why this is an attractive investment opportunity for our company and its shareholders. We're focused on value not volume and our true measure of success is building sustainable business with strong free cash flow and growing returns.","Let's turn to slide 12. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have a robust portfolio that's performing well, generates good value and has attractive investment opportunities at each stage of development. We have a strong queue of exploration prospects that we're actively evaluating and maturing.","Earlier this year, we participated in the Blacktip exploration well, which resulted in the discovery near Perdido and Whale. The well encountered more than 400 feet of net pay and is within tieback distance. Whale and Ballymore are progressing through the appraisal phase to further assess the size of the resource. As mentioned in March, we're targeting unit development cost of $16 to $20 a barrel for new development in the Gulf of Mexico.","Anchor continues to progress towards FID, which is expected by early next year. The technology we're developing to exploit these higher-pressure reservoirs will allow us to target other resource opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico. At Mad Dog 2, drilling and fabrication is progressing as planned and the project is expected to deliver first oil in 2021.","And we expect Big Foot and Stampede to increase production as we bring on additional wells. We're also pursuing highly economic brownfield developments at existing assets such as Jack\/St. Malo and Perdido. With our leading technology, experienced workforce and broad portfolio, we're continuing to add value in the Gulf of Mexico.","Turning to slide 13. I had the opportunity to visit Kazakhstan again in June and we continue to make good progress with the Future Growth Wellhead Pressure Management project at Tengiz. The project's now 65% complete and remains on track for first oil in 2022. As we discussed at the March analyst meeting, this is another critical year for the project, as we're fully engaged with module fabrication, transportation and installation and that's our first full year of mechanical, electrical and implementation work at site.","Detailed engineering and procurement are almost complete, reducing the risk of further impact on fabrication and construction activities. We're on schedule to close out work at three of the four fabrication yards this year. The logistics system is working well and modules are being delivered, restacked and set on foundations.","As reported in the media on June 29, one of our contractors at the 3GP site experienced an interpersonal conflict that resulted in the suspension of construction activity at the site for several days. Production operations and other FGP sites were not affected by the incident. And overall, the event is expected to have a relatively minor impact on project progress. With respect to construction, we're just under 40% complete. Looking ahead, our focus continues to shift to productivity at site where we're seeing good performance from our workforce and steady improvement in productivity.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Pierre.","Pierre Breber","Thanks, Jay. Slide 14 highlights some recent commercial developments. First, through our joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, we announced two new petrochemical investments, one in the U.S. Gulf Coast and one in Qatar. Each is in the joint venture with Qatar Petroleum. The long-term fundamentals of chemicals are strong. We believe these projects offer attractive returns underpinned by advantaged feedstocks, world-class scale and leading technology.","Also in the quarter, we closed the sale of our interest in Denmark and executed an agreement to sell our U.K. Central, North Sea fields which we expect to close later this year. Additionally, we completed our acquisition of the Pasadena refinery which will enable us to supply more of our retail market in the region and process more domestic light oil.","In the renewable space, we recently agreed to purchase wind power to supply our Permian operations. This is a cost-effective renewable energy alternative to our current electricity supply in the Permian.","Also Chevron executed an agreement to be an equity partner in CalBioGas, a joint venture to produce end market, dairy biomethane as a vehicle fuel in California. The project will capture methane that otherwise would be vented into the atmosphere and process it into renewable natural gas.","Turning to slide 15. Our performance this quarter reinforces four key messages you've heard from us in the past. First, we have an advantaged portfolio that is delivering today and is positioned to do so over the long-term as Jay highlighted in the Permian Gulf of Mexico and at Tengiz.","Second, with continued positive free cash flow this year we have the strongest balance sheet in the industry, a low cash breakeven and resilience if prices fall. Third, we are disciplined with capital spending on-track with our budget and committed to increasing returns.","And fourth, we had a total cash yield of about 6% with the resumption of our share buybacks. Bottom line we are positioned to deliver superior financial performance to our shareholders consistently for many years to come. Now looking ahead, we continue to expect\u2026.","[Technical Difficulty].","Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. The conference call will resume momentarily. Once again, please remain on the line. The conference call will resume momentarily.","Checking to see if I can hear our speakers? Hello?","Wayne Borduin","We\u2019re here. Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. Would you like to take questions at this time?","Wayne Borduin","I believe we were cut off prematurely, so actually we'll begin with slide 16. ","Operator","All right. You may resume.","Pierre Breber","Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. This is Pierre and we understand that we cut off at slide 16, so I'm going to resume there and we're going to look ahead. In Upstream, we continue to expect 2019 production growth to be 4% to 7%, excluding 2019 asset sales. Planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and Nigeria and the North West Shelf and Australia as well as the early July hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to impact production in the third quarter.","Our full year guidance for TCO co-lending is unchanged at $2 billion depending upon price, investment profile, and its dividends. In downstream, we expect high level of refinery turnaround activity in the third quarter which guides to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of more than $200 million. For the third quarter, we expect a repurchase -- we expect to repurchase shares at a rate of $1.2 billion per quarter.","With that I'll hand the call back over to Wayne.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Phil Gresh","Yes, hi good morning. Can you hear me all right?","Wayne Borduin","Good morning Phil.","Phil Gresh","Yes. So, I guess first question just looking at this Permian additional disclosure and your cash flow expectations, it seems like what you're implying here is that you can grow earnings and cash flow and the ratio of cash flow to CapEx keeps going up. So, it seems to imply pretty flattish CapEx profile, which I think is fairly consistent with the rig count trajectory you talked about at Analyst Day. So, I was wondering if you could maybe just kind of walk through that detail.","And then secondarily with -- related to that I know you recently had an announcement that you made with enterprise talking about takeaway out of the Permian. I was just wondering how that all feeds into this ability to ensure you get the best realizations for your production. Thanks.","Jay Johnson","Okay. I'll take it and Pierre may want to add some at the end. From a CapEx standpoint, Phil, we are looking to maintain a relatively flat profile in capital and that's because essentially we're looking to have a very steady rig fleet as we go forward. We have 20 company-operated rigs. Those are basically on a 100% basis because we operate our own licenses.","And then we look for about 30 roughly gross non-operated rigs which equates to about seven to 10 net non-operated rigs. So, as we move that forward, we expect to see capital relatively constant. We're building out infrastructure of course and we always have some exploration activity out in front of us and we also do pilot work to ensure that we are continuing to drive to increase the recovery and efficiency of our developments.","In terms of the takeaway capacity, I'll break it into three different streams. I'll start with the crude oil and basically for 2019, we're well covered on our takeaway capacity for crude oil. In 2020, we are also covered for the year. There may be periods of tightness in length as we move through the year, but we recently executed an agreement with enterprise not only for takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin, but also for export capacity that will lengthen our ability to supply crude not only in the domestic U.S., but internationally.","When we look at natural gas liquids, we have full takeaway capacity for this year and next year. And as we turn to gas, we really think of gas in two ways. The first is just basic flow assurance. We need to be able to move the gas without having to flare or have any threat of mitigating production in our avoidance of flaring. So we have 100% flow assurance set up for the balance of this year and next year.","In terms of takeaway of gas from the basin outward for export, what we look at is this year we're at about 20% of our gas can be exported from the basin. And by the end of this year, we expect to be about 25%. By the end of next year we should be more like 60% of our gas being exported from the basin gives us more exposure to other price structures rather than just the Waha.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks, Phil.","Phil Gresh","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Just my follow-up question then for Pierre would just be some of your balance sheet commentary. Your net debt-to-cap, I believe is a low sicne it\u2019s been since mid-2015. I know you increased the buyback a bit. There's the situation where you had an M&A considerations there that you walked away from, but I guess how do you think about that level of financial leverage? And where you want to keep that balance sheet for opportunities that might present themselves? Thanks.","Pierre Breber","Yeah. Well, thanks Phil. Look our cash generation has been strong and we've been returning cash to shareholders and we increased our dividend 6% early this year. As you mentioned we raised our guidance on the share buyback rate in May to $5 billion per year. We're being very disciplined with capital, managing to our $20 billion organic budget in 2019. So the way the math works, no doubt in the short-term, our strong balance sheet gets even stronger. That's okay. Over time this strong cash generation will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and a sustained share buyback program.","That's the way I would think about it. I won't comment on M&A. We, obviously, have -- we're in a very financially strong position, same time we got a great value proposition for our shareholders that we've communicated at our March Analyst Day and then Jay provided more insight into some key elements today and that's what we're focused on delivering.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks, Phil.","Phil Gresh","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Neil Mehta","Good morning team. I guess, the first question I have Jay, you just came back from Kazakhstan sounds like. There's \u2013 there was some questions around labor productivity as it relates to Tengiz. Can you just confirm everything is on track and then just in terms of the capital budget as well your confidence level in achieving the targets that you set out?","Jay Johnson","Yes. We just did come back in June and we talked about this at the Security Analyst Meeting and in previous calls. A big focus at site now is on labor productivity. We've got a lot of work to do as the modules come in or set on foundations. Last year we're primarily focused on civils and undergrounds. This year we're making the transition to mechanical, electrical and instrumentation.","As we look forward we have to get through commissioning and then all the start-up activities. So we've put in place specific tools that can really help us, not only drive the productivity but understand what the drivers are, where we have gaps, from where expectations are and what we need to do to close those.","Those tools are now widespread across the site and are proving to be very effective, so we've seen steadily improving productivity across the workforce and are actually feeling pretty good about where the execution is headed at this point. But it's early days. We're 40%, roughly complete on construction and we've got a lot of man-hours to go over the next couple of years.","In terms of the overall capital program, you've seen we continue to be right in the middle, right on our guidance. We're about 50% expanded on our Chevron C&E through mid-year and we still expect to maintain our guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion for next year, so that should give you a pretty good idea of where things sit.","Neil Mehta","Appreciate this. And just a follow-up question, this might be for you Pierre. You've gotten a lot of credit from investors for stepping away from the Anadarko potential transaction and showing the capital discipline. Since the deal closed, the stock has materially outperformed other constituents of the XLE or XOP and others, independent E&Ps and that multiple arbitrage or share price ratio arbitrage seems to be opening up again. Just want to get your thoughts on M&A. Again, it felt opportunistic, but is another opportunity potentially opening up here?","Pierre Breber","Yeah. No. Thanks Neil. Look, I honestly can't speculate on M&A. What I can restate is we have a very strong value proposition for our shareholders. And if I can just -- some of the key elements that we communicated in March is 3% to 4% production growth guidance through 2023, a very disciplined capital program.","Jay provided the 2020 guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion and longer-term guidance of $19 billion to $22 billion from 2021 to 2023. We have leading upstream cash flow margins, leading earnings margins and we're improving cash return on capital employed by more than 3%. So, we clearly do not need to do a deal.","That said, as you said, we have been opportunistic in the past if we see a good strategic fit at a good price, at a good value. And two recent examples would be the Pasadena refinery and Anadarko. But we've moved on and we're focused on delivering growing earnings and cash flows for our shareholder.","Neil Mehta","Thanks Pierre.","Pierre Breber","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question, please.","Alastair Syme","Good afternoon. I just had a couple of questions. One, can you talk a little bit about Anchor, which you're hoping to do FID next year? What do you think has to happen to move that forward? Because my understanding is, there are still some quite significant technological challenges. And the follow-up, if you can just talk a little bit, it's just sort of a question, just on the asset sales, that you announced the U.K. asset sales in the quarter. Can you talk about what happens on the decommissioning of liabilities associated with those assets, please? ","Jay Johnson","Yeah. So with Anchor, we are in the FEED process, so this is doing all the preliminary engineering work prior to the detailed engineering. I would say there are two primary technologies to be developed to support Anchor. And in developing for Anchor, we'll also have these available for other opportunities that we foresee.","The first is just the high-pressured technology, getting to that 20,000-psi. That's well along and we really -- it really comes down to just thicker seal. We're in the qualification stages and we really don't see that as a major technology shift. It's just a matter of working through the process. And the second is the higher hook loads for deeper wells and this will also support potential developments like Ballymore.","So neither of those do we regard as a particularly challenging technological advance, but an important one to get finished. So we do expect to be on path with Anchor for FID early in the next year.","In terms of the North Sea deal, we really don't get into the details of any of our commercial transactions. I can't really comment too much on that, other than to say, as an overall package we're very comfortable with the transaction as its been constructed and are working with the buyer to move it forward to close. ","Pierre Breber","Yes. And I think I can add to Jay's comments that, we're fully in-tune with the importance of embedded obligations and that's carefully considered in terms of the financial strength of the partners or the parties that we transact with. And again we won't be specific as it's commercially sensitive, but its -- as you can imagine the point of negotiation and something that we don't intend to be exposed to over time. ","Alastair Syme","Thanks very much.","Pierre Breber","Thanks Alastair.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Biraj Borkhataria","Hi, thanks for taking my question. And apologies, if I miss this on the call but, I have a question on LNG. You mentioned a higher ratio of spot LNG sales in the quarter. Could you just talk through what was driving that? One of your payers has talked about buyers for their contracts not taking their full nominations. I was wondering if that was the issue or there's something else there. Thank you.","James Johnson","Yes, thanks Biraj. I'll talk first in general because there's an element of -- as we gain in our performance, the facilities are performing very well, reliability is coming up, we have extra production over and above what we had planned and so all that production is going to be exposed to spot prices. And so that's going to be an ongoing thing.","In the second quarter specifically, we certainly had excellent performance at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. And so we had extra production coming from that. But at the same time we also deferred a turnaround, so we had a turnaround scheduled in the second quarter that's been moved to the fourth. So we had extra cargoes there that were exposed to spot.","We do have some downward flex that was exercised by our purchasers in the shoulder months and that occurred in the second quarter. And then finally, there's also an element even in our fixed-term contracts where we had about a 3 to 6 month delay in the oil pricing that they're linked to and so we saw some downward movement in that element.","So together those all really drive the realizations in the second quarter for our LNG. But as I say going forward, we do expect to see increased production as our reliabilities been higher and our overall goal would be to term that up and get closer to what our expected production is as we gain continued confidence in the reliability of the facilities. ","Biraj Borkhataria","That's great color. And just a quick follow-up. At Gorgon in particular I think in the past you talked about debottlenecking the project to increased capacity buy maybe 10% or 15%. Could you just update us on where we are now and relative to the original nameplate? ","James Johnson","Yes I don't recall us giving out specific guidance on percentages of increase. Our focus right now is doing a couple of things. First is just getting the reliability increasingly high and we've seen very good reliability. We're still learning these facilities as we continue to operate and we built learnings from some of the shutdowns and turnarounds that we've already accomplished in the future ones.","As we look forward, what we are looking at is we're collecting the data literally daily as we move through an annual cycle of the ambient conditions as well as the performance of the plan. We look for where the restructuring to keep us from going to the next level of production.","At this point in time, I'd say we're probably 2% above where we expect it to be on Gorgon production, around 6% above on Wheatstone. But it's an ongoing effort as we move forward to get more out of our existing investments and infrastructure.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks, Biraj.","Biraj Borkhataria","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby from UBS. Your question please.","Jon Rigby","Okay, thank you. Yeah. The first is the Anadarko transaction during that process, I felt that you indicated that you had capacity and the willingness to deepen your deepwater participation globally and you spoke quite enthusiastically about adding extra LNG to your portfolio, creating a global position et cetera. So as you move forward with new opportunities and when they arise, is -- thematically outside of the U. S. is that where we should expect you to be appearing or looking?","And then the second, just very specifically, with the new refinery asset, what are the plans for that now you've got ownership of it? Thanks.","Pierre Breber","Yeah. Thanks Jon. This is Pierre and I'll start. I said earlier we moved on, but look we\u2019ll go back to Anadarko a little bit here. Look there are several elements of it, the transaction there was the FID in the Permian, there was the FID in the Gulf of Mexico and there was the LNG. And there was the ability to get synergies out of the transaction and do it at an attractive price that we thought was good for their shareholders and good for our shareholders.","So that -- if you want to get into our thinking we\u2019re -- adding LNG is something that absolutely we are interested in doing. We've got a great position in Australia that Jay just talked about that's generating a lot of cash where we have opportunities to debottleneck and potentially add to that over time. And you'd expect that we are -- we're always working the portfolio and LNG is one of the asset classes that we're interested in and we'll pursue opportunities in that space. That makes sense for the company and our shareholders.","In terms of Pasadena, we've had three very clear strategic objectives on it. One was to provide some equity product into our retail network in Texas. The second was to coordinate and optimize feedstocks and other flows between Texas and our refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi. And the third was to process more domestic light oil and increasingly try to position and retool the refinery a little bit to take more and more Permian oil.","So really, I mean there -- it's very early days, but I'd say everything is on track and aligned with the strategic rationale. So there's been no surprise in terms of those three objectives. We feel we can meet them with the acquisition. We've had some early wins. In fact over the next few months we expect to run up to 30,000 barrels a day of Permian crude oil. That's a little more than we actually had thought at this point in time. Also we know there's work to do as expected on maintenance and reliability of the facility. So everything is on track and we feel good about it but it's early days. Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.","Jason Gammel","Thanks very much. Hello guys. I had a couple on the Permian, slide number 10. I guess the first one would be, obviously, some fairly impressive absolute performance in increasing EUR and decreasing development production cost on an absolute basis. I know you do a lot of benchmarking. How would you say stack up against industry in those areas now? ","James Johnson","Yes it's a good question, Jason. I think the -- we do, do a lot of benchmarking and this continues to be an evolving story. So I would say, we're competitive on these areas. We have a very good understanding particularly in terms of the type curves across the entire basin.","We have the capability and actually run decline curves across not only our own, but competitors as well so that we understand how our wells are performing and we're actually very comfortable with the overall performance not only in terms of the recoveries, but the economics that we're generating from the execution work.","And then when that's coupled up with our ability to use our midstream capability and our royalty position, it's really giving us, I would say leading financial performance overall. So if you went back and look at our Security Analyst Meeting slides, we showed you some of the competitor data.","We also showed you, how our actual type curves are performing relative to our expectations and they're very tightly coupled. So I think we have a good understanding, but we're seeing that continued improvement as we move forward.","Pierre Breber","Yes. The only thing I would add to Jay's comments, this is Pierre. You can cherry pick a lot of data out there to position how you look. We've been pretty consistent with what we've shown.","And also we've done a lot, not just general benchmarking, but comparisons to our non-op partners or the operators on our behalf, where we know we have very good apples-to-apples data. So it is an area of focus and we feel we compete very well. ","Jason Gammel","That's great. And maybe just \u2013 yeah, just a quick follow-up. I noticed the average lateral length that's planned for 2020 is starting to approach 10,000 feet. In the past you've had fairly frequently slides about swapping another positioning to kind of block up your acreage.","And if you're moving towards 10,000 feet, I'm suspecting you're getting a long ways towards doing that, but can you just kind of talk about whether there's further opportunity there?","James Johnson","Well as we continue -- in the existing development areas we're getting higher and higher on our average lateral length and approaching that 10,000 foot mark. In the areas that we've transacted, we had about 60,000 acres that we transacted in 2017 and 95,000 acres in 2018. Those enabled -- about 1,900 longer laterals. So it's really helped us in our core-up development areas.","As we continue though to open up new development areas, we're going to continue to have this land activity as we optimize our land positions. So about half of our acreage overall, we consider to be a very highly productive areas and what we want to do is continue to use swap out or swaps and farm-out, sales, acquisitions to continue to core up our development areas.","We try and do that in a timely manner. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we do want to make sure that we're drilling efficiently as we start each area. As we said many times, our focus is on delivering returns not just chasing production or chasing a certain activity level.","Jason Gammel","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes in the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Doug Leggate","Thanks, good morning everyone. I was wondering if Jay, I could take advantage, you been on the call just a little bit in terms of the assumptions you made in the Permian on the cash margins, things have obviously deteriorated at no fall of your, you do in terms of NGLs and gas. So if -- how do you see the prognosis there? What assumptions were you making when you were talking about CapEx versus cash flow?","And I guess kind of the last piece of that question is 900,000 barrels a day at a 3.3, 3.4 in 2023 suggests that your cash margin across the portfolio could move away from this sort of sector within level you've had in the past. I'm just curious if you can offer any thoughts on that. I've got a follow-up please. ","Jay Johnson","Well, the cash -- the assumptions that we provided that are all given in our Security Analyst Meeting deck, so you can go back and reference those. And what we\u2019re trying to do is, continue to make sure we have the flow assurance as I mentioned earlier on the call, to move gas out to other markets and not have it captured in the immediate basin. Crude oil, we're already well ahead of that. We move our crude outside the basin and we can access and optimize the markets that we're reaching.","In terms of the cash margin overall, again we've given you that information. We see that is very strong. There's always going to be fluctuations in the markets as there's tightness and length in different locations. But overall, we feel pretty strong about where we\u2019re heading with this as a production base but also the other production we have around the world.","Doug Leggate","Okay. I understand, it's -- there's a lot of moving parts in that. My follow-up is kind of related and it's historically when oil prices got a lot weaker, you guys talked routinely about what your sustaining capital was in the portfolio. And obviously, that has been reset favorably by the very large LNG projects and those kind of dominate the base -- the base decline and like thereof.","As you move towards, again, this level of funding a significantly larger proportion of your production and a high decline underlying unconventional asset base, what does that do to the sustaining capital versus, I think, you used to talk about like a $13 billion number, how does that evolve as we move towards the five-year plan.","Pierre Breber","Doug, yeah. This is Pierre and I'll start and ask Jay to add some comments. We've never really talked about sustaining capital. We've given -- we have a $20 billion capital budget this year that we talked about $18 billion to $20 billion dollars guidance next year. And then $19 billion to $22 billion, 2021 to 2023.","So the guidance is pretty clear, it's pretty tight. That results in enterprise that's growing 3% to 4% of production growth through 2023 with leading cash margin. So the prior eight times, we've talked about the base decline, we are investing in the unconventional, as you saw, in the Permian that it's -- the production is more than doubling, while it's being free cash flow every year, starting next year, at returns that are going from 20% to 30%.","So we feel really good about our position. We're not focused on keeping a base flat capital. We're focused on increasing returns. It's resulting in an outcome of higher production. That's translating to higher earnings and cash flow. But the high decline that you referred to is, it's a nature of the business.","But when we're investing in it, you can see that, we're more than offsetting that decline and we're doing it in a very economic manner. And as we continue to fill out facilities and keep facilities filled over time, the reinvestment is a very attractive use of capital for the shareholders.","Jay Johnson","I might just build on what Pierre said, because he's absolute right. As we have a larger percentage of our overall production constrained by facilities, that means we have the ability to be very stable on our production. And the same in some respects actually applies in the Permian, while any individual well may have a relatively high decline rate, it does approach an asymptotic curve.","But the facilities we install for each of the development areas, our goal is to keep those full. And one of the advantages of the Permian is that, in the initial drilling we fill the facilities up, but then we can go back through infill drilling programs and by going after the subsequent benches in a given development area, and just continue to keep those facilities full, and the amount of rig activity it takes is much less for those subsequent drilling campaigns to maintain that production in a given development area. So I actually feel pretty good about where the whole portfolio has moved and really I'm not too worried about what some people see as a problem with these individual Permian wells.","Doug Leggate","It\u2019s a great answer guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks, Doug\u2026","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Roger Read","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.","Wayne Borduin","Morning Roger.","Roger Read","Let me just dive in here. Kind of following-up on some of the Permian questions, with your royalty position and others developments and with some of the problems we're seeing from some of those E&Ps, any risk to your outlook from those who might have overstepped their bounds in terms of the way they were developing the Permian?","Pierre Breber","Well, Roger this is Pierre. I mean, you're right. I mean we don't control the royalty barrels because that's being operated by others who own the working interests we're landowner and as Jay said, we receive those barrels with no capital, no operating costs. But the flipside is that if we don't control the development, so we're doing it based on an outlook and an expectation, it certainly we know what the actual had been. But you're right that there is some risk of that. It could go either way. It could go bigger or lower than what we're showing dependent on what those operator's activity levels are.","Roger Read","Okay, great. And then from a guidance standpoint on the downstream, the hiring refinery turnaround activity, and for the third quarter I was under the impression you'd had fairly high turnaround activity earlier in the first half of this year. So I was just curious was that the right interpretation, and maybe if there's any geographic specific exposure on the high TARs at this quarter.","Pierre Breber","Yeah Roger, so we have now adopted a practice of giving a pretty clear guidance on planned turnaround activity in the downstream and we characterize it as either a low, medium or high.","So you're right. Second quarter was high. And that's related to $200 million of after tax, earnings impacts both from higher cost and from lost profit opportunity if the volume is not produced. First quarter was actually low, which is up to $100 million of effects. So in the third quarter with another high quarter that's not unusual, it just depends on how the planned turnarounds are set up. We won't provide specifics on the locations. It's commercially sensitive. And so it's just something that we won't do ahead of time, we're happy to talk about it.","Looking backs on the second quarter, we had some planned turnaround activity in Pascagoula and in Asia. So we can explain afterwards, but we think we're giving pretty clear guidance. So you're right that you should view the earnings -- after tax earnings impact of planned turnarounds in 3Q to be the same or similar to 2Q.","Roger Read","Pierre, I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks Roger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Howard Weil. Your question please.","Paul Cheng","Hi good morning. Jay, since you are here and I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the incident in Tengiz with your contractor at least in the media, it seems to me that there's never been more serious talking about -- a between the foreign contractor and the local people and may even be different agenda. Can you give us little bit more update on that and what -- does any initiative had been taken trying to resolve the problem there?","Jay Johnson","Yes, Paul, I can give you a little bit more. We -- this is really centered around one particular contractor that was at the 3GP site and there was obviously some disagreements between some of their workers and the management of that company. When the issue happened, we shut down the entire site -- the 3GP site, not the other site that didn't have any impact on production operation, but we wanted to make sure that the problem was mitigated and contained and we understood what was at the root of it.","We worked with that contractor. They're putting in place corrective actions to make sure that they deal with some of the concerns that were there. That is the only contractor that's had an extended ramp-up, so they're working back to their normal strength and we expect to see them that normal strength by the end of August.","So, at this point in time, we don't see it as having a material impact on the overall progress of the work. That contractor was about one month ahead of where we expected them to be on their workflow. So, unfortunately we've used up some of that float that have built up, but we believe we're going to be able to mitigate the impact to us.","The worker and the workforce relations are always important to us and this is one that we continue to stay focused on. It's very important as now our focus continues to shift to site and I assure you we'll stay focused with our workforce to make sure that we're trying to anticipate and deal with any other concerns.","Paul Cheng","And the second question Jay. I think in Angola Block 14, I think that the expiration is 2023. And in Nigeria the Agbami I think is 2024. When you guys will start the process for renegotiation on those?","Jay Johnson","Well, that's not something we normally are going to talk much about publicly, Paul. That's between us and our partners and the government. So, I can tell you that those discussions and the planning for that is well in hand, but I really won't be able to go into much detail on those at this time.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Understand. Thank you.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question please.","Sam Margolin","Good morning. Hi.","Wayne Borduin","Hey Sam.","Sam Margolin","So, in the Permian one of the things that you talked about contributing to your rig count staying relatively flat is that you're building up a nice stack of vintage wells and you've got some legacy production that's supporting the performance of new wells. Just really quickly Jay can you shed some light on the performance of those older wells? It sounds like you're leading edge wells are meeting your expectations, but how are the vintage wells doing as far as how are they holding up and as they get a little long in the tooth?","Jay Johnson","Actually they're doing quite well. Our focus from day one has been to maximize the returns that we can get from our investments in the Permian. So, there has been a lot of questions why don't we increase our rig fleet, why don't we be more aggressive? But the reality is to continue to learn as everyone in the industry as we move forward and I think a lot of the moves we've made to stay focused on returns now are paying off.","Many people talk about how high their initial production rates are in the first six months rates, but what we're really looking at that can actually damage wells and cause aggregated decline curves. So, we're looking at the total expected recovery. We're looking at the economics of the well over its life. We're very careful in our drawdown rates in those early months to make sure that we don't cause damage in the wellbore or in the formation. When we put all that together, we're seeing our base production. That is the production that's already online continuing to perform such that, when we drill these new wells, we can add that on top.","And as you saw from the chart, I believe it was on probably page nine, we've been able to continue to deliver right on our production profile and we feel very good about how our wells are performing.","Sam Margolin","Thank you so much. And then - this one should be relatively quick and just in reference to the strategic partnership between CPChem and Qatar, Qatar's got a portfolio of other things that Chevron is probably a good candidate to participate in. Do you see that relationship deepening as you kind of advance on the chemical side throughout the Chevron organization? Or do you see that siloed into Chems?","James Johnson","No. No. Look, we have a good relationship with Qatar Petroleum for sure and so do CPChem. And when the Qataris look at CPChem they look at it as three companies, right; Chevron Phillips, Phillips 66 and ourselves. And so, we have a good relationship with them.","I will say that the trend \u2013 the deals stand on their own, I mean, the project in Qatar was bid out at U.S. Gulf Coast again there's other alternatives that are considered. So each transaction stands on its own. But we're very proud that we have this platform within and whether that leads to other opportunities or not I won\u2019t speculate, but we certainly have a good base to work-off of.","Sam Margolin","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. You alluded to the gas takeaway issues in the Permian and that you're trying to avoid flaring as much as possible. But of course your realized gas price was $0.60 in Q2. So I'm curious if it might get to a point where you have no practical choice, but to either flare gas or shut in wells. And if that happens which would you choose?","James Johnson","We don't flare. We are not flaring and we haven't flared. Our policy is that, we find flow assurance as I said is our first priority so that we can move the gas and we've been doing that. And we've got that flow assurance covered. So I don't see us being forced into the choices that you just presented.","I do -- as I said earlier, we're going to be increasing the amount of export capacity out of the basins to try and achieve better realizations and that's part of our overall strategy to maximize the returns that we can get from our investments in the Permian. ","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. And then based on what I just asked, but taking on a much broader perspective. You're talking about reducing carbon emissions. Just about every other U.S. oil and gas producers talking about the same, when we listen to what's being said on stage at the debates, I'm sure you saw this week that point seems to be lost on the policy community.","And I'm curious what you think the industry has not communicated that is -- or what the dynamic is that has led to this disconnect between what you're saying and what the policymakers seem to be believing?","Pierre Breber","Well Sam that's a big last question on the call here. Look I mean, it depends which policymaker is right. We're in the midst of a energy revolution, renaissance here in the United States. For sure, wind and solar is a big part of that, but what's going on in the Permian Basin, what's happened in the Marcellus and Utica and growing natural gas production, growing crude oil production, exports to world markets and all the geopolitical implications and benefits of that, you can see our President talk a lot about that. At the same time, if we shared the concerns on climate change. We referred on the earnings call to a couple of investments that lower the carbon intensity of our operations. It was wind PPA in the Permian, so we -- our consumer electricity are using renewable electricity there, lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the renewable natural gas, which is in California, which takes Methane that otherwise would be vented to the atmosphere processes it, puts it in the grid. I guess we have off-take agreements with trucking company. It generates low carbon fuel standards under the California Regulatory Regime. It's modest capital. It earns an attractive return, so it's something that we believe is good for the environment and good for our shareholders. So we look to do more of that. We'll be very balanced, but \u2013 it's a big question, and we'll be part of the conversation.","Jay Johnson","Thanks Pavel.","Pavel Molchanov","All right. Appreciate it.","Wayne Borduin","Well, I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Jonathan, back to you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5121":["Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call July 27, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Pat Yarrington - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jay Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Wayne Borduin - General Manager of Investor Relations","Analysts","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Phil Gresh - JP Morgan","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Operator","Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Pat Yarrington","Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are, Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream and Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's Web site. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Turning to Slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s second quarter earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.78 per diluted share. This is nearly $2 billion or roughly a $1 per share higher than the same period a year ago. The quarter included the impact of a non-recurring receivable write-down, which was offset by foreign exchange gains. A reconciliation of special items, foreign exchange and other non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $6.9 billion. Excluding working capital effect, cash flow from operations was $7 billion. The working capital penalty in the current quarter was understated by the $270 million receivable write-down as just mentioned as this was a non-cash item. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations has totaled $11.9 billion, about $3 billion more than a year ago. At quarter end, debt balances stood at approximately $39 billion, giving us a headline debt ratio of 20% and a net debt ratio of 17%. During the second quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends and we currently yield 3.6%.","Turning to Slide 4. In addition to the non-cash receivable write-down impact, our second quarter cash from operations position also requested a discretionary U.S. pension contribution of $300 million. When these two elements are taken into account to allow for an apples-to-apples comparison underlying cash generation improved between the first and second quarter by about $500 million. This improvement reflected higher Brent prices of about $7.50 per barrel and higher WTI prices of about $5 per barrel. Our upstream realizations did not fully capture the quarterly increase in global oil prices, largely due to portfolio mix effects surrounding the Brent WTI differential. We also saw lower Asia LNG spot prices during the quarter.","Year-to-date, affiliate dividends were $1.8 billion less than earnings. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 billion and $6.2 billion year-to-date, in line with our 2018 budget. We had 50% year-on-year improvement in operating cash flow from 2016 to 2017. We expect a similar improvement trajectory from 2017 to 2018. We anticipate second half cash generation will reflect higher production, strong upstream cash margins, additional proceeds from asset sales and some reversals of working capital requirements. These positives are expected be offset only modestly by another discretionary U.S. pension contribution.","Turning to Slide 5. This favorable outlook on cash flow, combined with our ongoing commitment to capital discipline, enables us to initiate share repurchases, targeted at $3 billion per year. Our financial priorities are unchanged. We are generating cash surplus to what we need to meet the first three of these. We increased our annual dividend by 4% earlier in the year. We continue to be very selective and disciplined in our investments. And we have an advantaged portfolio and a large captured resource base.","We plan to ratably develop these resources within the $18 billion to $20 billion capital range we previously indicated through 2020. Our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. We will take advantage of higher price period like we\u2019re seeing now to modestly reduce our debt level overtime. We\u2019ll start repurchases in the third quarter. Going forward, we will provide an update at the end of every quarter on our progress. We believe annual share repurchases of $3 billion can be sustained over most reasonable price scenarios.","Turning to Slide 6. Just a quick update on our portfolio optimization efforts. We have previously indicated our intent to generate between $5 billion and $10 billion in targeted asset sale proceeds over the three year period 2018 to 2020. We remain confident in this range. On a year-to-date basis, we have had sales proceeds of approximately $700 million, primarily from the sale of our upstream non-operated joint venture interest in the Elk Hills Field in California and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Later this year, we expect to close the Southern African downstream transaction. When that happens, 2018 will be right on pace with our three year target. A few weeks ago, we announced our decision to market our UK Central North Sea assets. As with any transaction, we will only execute if we believe it is aligned with our strategic objective and we receive good value.","Turning to Slide 7. Second quarter 2018 after tax earnings were $2 billion higher than second quarter 2017. Special item impacts were comparable in the two periods and hence do not show up as a variance bar in the aggregate for the enterprise. Favorable movements in foreign exchange positively impacted earnings between the periods by $262 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by approximately $2.3 billion between periods, mainly on improved realizations and higher lifting.","Downstream earnings, excluding foreign exchange, decreased by about $400 million mostly due to an unfavorable swing and timing effect, higher operating expenses largely due to planned turnaround activity, lower Asia margins and the absence of our Canadian refining and marketing business. The variance in the other segment, excluding special items, was primarily the result of higher interest expense since less interest is being capitalized currently compared to the prior year.","Turning to Slide 8. This compares results for second quarter 2018 with first quarter 2018. Second quarter results were approximately $230 million lower than the first quarter. For special items, the second quarter included the $270 million non-recurring receivables write-down, while the first quarter included $120 million asset impairment. Foreign exchange impacts were a positive variance of $136 million between periods.","Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were essentially flat between the quarters. Higher realizations were offset by higher operating expense and DD&A. Downstream earnings, excluding foreign exchange, improved by about $80 million, reflecting higher volume and stronger U.S. West Coast refining and marketing margins. The variance in the other segment largely reflected higher corporate charges and lower capitalized interest. As I indicated last quarter, our guidance for the other segment is $2.4 billion in annual net charges and the quarterly results are not ratable with year-to-date charges of nearly $1.2 billion, we are trending in line with our earlier guidance.","I'll now pass it on to Jay.","Jay Johnson","Thanks, Pat. On Slide 9, second quarter 2018 production was an increase of 46,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 2017. Major capital projects increased production by 180,000 barrels a day as we continue to ramp-up multiple projects, most significantly Wheatstone and Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased 91,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian. Base declines, net of production from new wells such in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, were 51,000 barrels a day.","The impact for 2017 and 2018 asset sales reduced production by 77,000 barrels a day between the periods. Entitlement effects reduced production by 54,000 barrels a day as both rising prices and lower spend reduced cost recovery barrels. Planned and unplanned downtime, along with the impacts from external events, reduced production by 43,000 barrels a day during the quarter. Overall, the first half of 2018 production is up 4% relative to the first half of 2017.","Turning to Slide 10. Second quarter production was 2.83 million barrels per day, taking our year-to-date production to 2.84 million barrels per day. Excluding the impact of 2018 asset sales, which is the middle bar, our year-to-date production growth was 4.5% higher than the daily average production for full year 2017. This is in line with our guidance. As Pat mentioned last quarter, planned turnaround activity across multiple locations began in earnest in the second quarter. The production impact from turnarounds in the second quarter was 67,000 barrels a day.","We expect heavier planned turnaround activity in the third quarter. The production impact from 2018 asset sales was 15,000 barrels a day in the second quarter with a year-to-date impact of 8,000 barrels a day. With the successful startup for Wheatstone Train 2, continued growth in the Permian and ramp-ups at Hebron, Stamped and Tahiti vertical expansion project, we expect production to further increase in the second half of this year. Our outlook for the full year is expected to be in the top half of our guidance range even without normalizing for the impact of price at current levels.","Turning to Slide 11, Chevron is now Australia's largest producer of LNG and the proud operator of five LNG trains with a total installed liquefaction capacity of 24.5 million tons per year. Our facilities, along with available capacity and other facilities in northwest Australia will enable us to monetize our world-class natural gas resource base for decades to come. Wheatstone Train 2 achieved first production in mid-June. The ramp-up has exceeded expectations as Train 2 reach nameplate capacity within weeks of startup. We've already exported the equivalent of six cargoes of Train 2 production, and we\u2019re planning to take a pit stop in the third quarter to remove the start up strainers.","Its companion plan, Wheatstone Train 1, has also been running well. The train has demonstrated nameplate capacity and has now run 195 consecutive days without a day of downtime. We also successfully completed the planned pit stop on Gorgon Train 2. The Gordon pit stops have been successful and we\u2019re seeing improvements in performance and reliability. As a casing point, Gorgon Train 1, since its pit stop, has run more than 285 days without a day of downtime. Combined net production from our operated LNG trains was 282,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. With Wheatstone Train 2 ramping up and Gorgon Train 2 back online, we\u2019re already seeing net production approaching 400,000 barrels per day.","Let's turn to Slide 12. I recently returned from a trip to Kazakhstan. Our base business at TCO is running well and FGP WPMP project is progressing as guided towards first production in 2022. The project is estimated to be 40% complete with preassembled pipe racks, process modules and a gas turbine generator all in transit from yards in Kazakhstan, Korea, and Italy. Six pipe rack modules have been successfully delivered to sites, demonstrating the operability of the delivery system and the receiving facilities. Site work continues to focus on foundation, undergrounds and infrastructure in preparation for module installation. Major mechanical, electrical and instrumentation contracts have been awarded.","We also have three drilling rigs operating on multi-well pads, and drilling is ahead of schedule. If you recall back in March that I said 2018 is a critical year for execution. This is the first year of module fabrication and site construction, as well as initiation of the module transportation system. With engineering approaching 85% complete and fabrication of 40% complete, we are seeing cost pressure on the project. Site productivity remains a key driver of success for the project and is a major focus for our team.","Turning to the Permian, on Slide 13. Permian shale and tight production in the second quarter was 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing an increase of about 92,000 barrels a day, up 50% relative to the same quarter last year. Our development strategy continues to center around disciplined execution and capital efficiency. We\u2019re currently running 19 rigs and our development program is progressing as planned. While activity levels are high in the Permian, Chevron has not experienced supply shortages in the second quarter. And we\u2019re securing the dedicated crews and materials needed to execute the plan we\u2019ve previously described.","We continue to focus on well performance and the optimization of our well factory. This requires coordination and planning, starting with our land position, running through the drilling and completion strategy, as well as the design and construction of facilities. And it ends with the midstream arrangements to ensure that we bring produced oil, gas and NGLs to market at competitive realizations.","Turn to Slide 14. We\u2019re currently operating eight development areas and participating in approximately 30 joint venture developments operated by others. We continue to proactively manage and strengthen our land position. Year-to-date, we've transacted 31,000 acres through swaps, joint ventures, farm-outs and sales. We've previously mentioned that some of the highest value transactions are swaps that allow us the core of acreage and enable long length laterals. As the land transaction example on the right depicts, coring-up acreage provides an opportunity to double the lateral length of each well and optimize facilities, which in turn, lowers our unit development cost. In this case, the acreage swap increase the number of long-length lateral wells we can drill by approximately 600, and improve the forecasted internal rate of return for each well by more than 30%. Since 2016, we've increased our average lateral length per well in the Permian by approximately 35%. We\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to core-up acreage and improve the capital efficiency of our Permian program.","Let's turn to Slide 15. Last quarter, Mark discuss the value of being an integrated company, and our strategy for maximizing returns in the Permian. Chevron has secured from transport capacity at competitive rates to move the equivalent of nearly all of our forecasted 2018 and 2019 operated and NOJV taking kind oil production to multiple markets, including the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result of these contractual arrangement and long-term planning, this equivalent production is not materially exposed to the Midland basis differential. Our share of NOJV oil production not taken in kind is approximately 20% of our Permian crude volumes.","We previously mentioned that the pipeline takeaway capacity and production don't always move in perfect lockstep, they'll be periods of tightness and length. As an example, in June, we had more than 50,000 barrels a day of excess takeaway capacity out of the Midland basin, which we monetize through purchases of third-party volumes. We expect that excess capacity to attenuate through the rest of the year as our production continues to grow. Agreements are in place to access additional pipeline capacity in early 2019 in line with our production growth forecast. In July, we utilized firm dock capacity in the Houston ship channel to gain access to world markets for Permian source crews. We have firm contractual arrangements in place to further increase that dock capacity in 2019.","Overall, we've exported more than 8 million barrels of liquids from the Gulf Coast in 2018, further demonstrating our midstream's ability to batch, blend, trade and export to secure the highest value for our products. We\u2019re developing processing arrangements for NGLs and we have flow assurance for natural gas to ensure the production will not be impacted. We are moving forward with our development plans in the Permian, and we do not intend the slowdown activity or divert capital. Pat, back to you.","Pat Yarrington","Okay, just a couple of closing comments about the first half and expectations for the remainder of the year. Cash from operations, excluding working capital is materializing as expected, given the market conditions, production levels and asset reliability that we have achieved. The picture for total cash flow in the second half looks promising as well. We expect second half upstream cash margins to improve and our 2018 projected volume increases are backend loaded, giving us confidence that our full year product outlook is trending towards the upper half of the guidance range. In addition, we should we see some relief in working capital and additional asset sales proceeds.","Capital spending is on budget for the first six months. And so in total, we have a very attractive offering for investors; a growing dividend, assets that are strong cash generators, a healthy balance sheet and finally, sufficient free cash flow to enable a share repurchase program. In short, we are delivering on all of our commitments. So that concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019re now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we have a lot of folks on the queue and so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up, if necessary, and we will certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered.","Jonathan, go ahead and open the line please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Neil Mehta","Thank you very much, and congratulations on the buyback. It's great to see you\u2019re making this step. I want to start there and see how you guys were framing the $3 billion number. How did you arrive at that being the right level? And to your point about this being an every year number, how should we think about this? Should we think of this as a base load fixed cost, if you will, on a go-forward basis in any foreseeable price environment? Or is this more of a flywheel dynamic?","Pat Yarrington","You hit upon in a way you asked the question some of the keywords for us, which really are, we do want this to be a sustainable element here. So we obviously took a look at multiple price scenarios and we felt that this level of sustainability -- we could handle this almost through any reasonable price environment there. We pay attention to what expectations are in the market. And you can see, if you look at the futures market, there is a bit of peak this year next year and then maybe some downward trend. So obviously, that\u2019s a scenario that we took into account. And with that we felt that the $3 billion level was sustainable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Phil Gresh","Yes, good morning. I echo Neil's sentiment. Congratulations on the buyback. I guess it's somewhat of a follow-up question. You gave helpful color around cash from operations. It sounds like it supposed to be up 50% year over year, I think is what you said. And so that would be about $30 billion of CFO. If I look at that on a post-dividend, post-CapEx basis, you'd have about $9 billion of post-dividend free cash flow. And so it sounded like you said in your prepared remarks there is also maybe some desire to pay debt down a little bit. But just wondering how you think about that? Obviously, a third of this incremental is going back to the shareholder. But are you trying to save money for a rainy day? Or how do you think about that considering you also have asset sale proceeds coming up?","Pat Yarrington","I think it\u2019s a great question and you are trying relating on the numbers quite accurately there. All I would like to say just from the start, we\u2019d like to hit the cash in the door and see it before we over commit on it. So there might be a bit of conservatism here in how we started. But if you step back and think about the price environment that we\u2019re in and the price environment that may be expected as that market is telling us over the next couple of years that maybe coming, which would be a lower price environment. We think it's prudent at this point in time to strengthen the balance a bit sheet when commodity prices are high. And so we do anticipate a little bit of debt pay down over the next period of time.","We\u2019re certainly in a comfortable position from a leverage standpoint. But paying it down a little bit and showing up the balance sheet little bit, we think would be an improvement -- or we'd have willingness to go there to a small degree. Obviously, if you're building up cash little bit and paying down debt little bit, it gives you a bit of an insurance policy, when times get tougher to meet the commitments that you've already laid out there. And by that I mean the commitments that you put out there in terms of dividends and also now the commitment we have around share repurchases and the sustainability we hope to have around share repurchases. I don't -- they don't have the same level of commitments, share repurchases are the fourth in our priorities, dividends come first. But obviously, we\u2019d like to have as much readability and predictability around share repurchases as we can.","Phil Gresh","If I could ask a quick follow-up, just on the production guidance, you\u2019re comfortable with the high end of the range. Despite, I think Jay said, despite the entitlement effects, which I think in the second quarter, is 2% year-over-year impact. So maybe you can just provide some color around what you think is going better than your expectations? Is it all Permian or are there other things as well?","Jay Johnson","So I think the primary thing that gives us some confidence is that we started out Wheatstone Train 2 very late in the second quarter. It has come up very cleanly and is running well. We continue to see growth in the Permian and we have ramp-ups going on, as I said, on a number of capital projects. We have some turnaround activity in the third quarter, which will be bit of a drag on production. But as we move through that, and as we move into the fourth quarter, overall, with these new projects coming online and our relatively low base decline, we really feel pretty comfortable about where we are in our production profile through the rest of the year, barring unforeseen events.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Cheng","Jay, did I hear you correctly. You were saying that turnkey, you are seeing some cost pressure or sign of cost pressure. Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of how big -- is that really going to be a big problem or what [material] we\u2019re talking about and where is the source of the cost pressure?","Jay Johnson","So we are seeing some cost pressure. We are now, as I said, approaching 85% complete on the engineering. We\u2019re about 40% complete on fabrication. We\u2019re having a full-year of construction in the field. Where we are seeing some cost pressures at this point in time, our engineering program has cost more than we would have been anticipated. We had some design quality issues but also our productivity overall has been lower on engineering than expected. We've also seen some of our major contracts come in for field construction a little higher than what we expected.","When we put all that together, we are using more of the contingency at this point in time than we would have expected or anticipated, and so that signals that we\u2019re seeing cost pressure on the project. We've talked about getting through this season. We really need to see how the performance goes. There is a lot of important milestones. The good things that are happening, the fabrication is really working well.","We are seeing high quality come out of the modules and sales as they are being completed and shipped to Tengiz. We successfully tested the logistics system and we have delivered modules all the way to sites. So those things are all working quite well. But what we need to do is we are 40% complete on this project. It's large, it's complex and we've used more of the contingency at this point than we would've expected. So that tells us we have cost pressure on this project. We will continue to access it and we will update you accordingly as we need to.","Paul Cheng","And at what point that you will be more certain whether you have to raise your overall budget? Is it six months from now? Where is the maybe the critical path that you need to pass in order for you to know whether that you will be able to stay within the budget or it's going to be higher?","Jay Johnson","We continue to assess our performance Paul, as we move through the project. This is a 5, 6 year project overall duration. So, we are still relatively early in the project. The site productivity is really going to be important. And as we go through this year and can really assess where we are and look at that site productivity, it is a full-court press in the field to really make sure we are making the progress, but in making that progress using the number of man-hours and the resources that we expected.","So, we are very focused on the timely delivery of engineering and engineer design and bulk materials. We want to make sure that we've got our crews ready that the workforce planning is in place and that we have sufficient support of our workforce, so that we get the most out of that crew. So, it's hard to put a definite time on it. We will continue to monitor our performance. We build these into our business plan. At this point, I do not see it impacting our guidance of 18 billion to 20 billion. And we will keep you updated as we gain more information.","Paul Cheng","My second question. Jay, when you guys do economic analysis, do you primarily use the real price? Or are you using the nominal price as the base case?","Jay Johnson","The real price of oil do you mean?","Paul Cheng","Yes.","Jay Johnson","We have a corporate price forecast which we use as our basis for our economic assumptions, but more importantly, we also test our business plan against both higher and lower price scenarios to make sure that we have a robust plan that takes into account. The one thing we do know with certainty is that we cannot predict the oil price. So, we want to plan that really is able to respond and adjust accordingly with options for whatever the price turns out to be.","Paul Cheng","I'm sorry that I probably didn't make myself clear. When I say real price, means that the price adjusted for inflation. Do you build in an inflation factor, whatever is the price deck that you use? Or you just use a nominal flat price in your assumptions? So when you guys previously saying that Tengiz would be a $60 or low $60 Brent price would be generating a 10% return or 15% return, is that the price is based on inflation adjusted or nominal?","Pat Yarrington","It's based on inflation adjusted. I mean we look at what we expect price is to be because the costs out estimates that we are putting together have those kind of components built in. But when we are taking the project to evaluation when we are doing the final investment decision, we look at a whole host of price scenarios and we look at both nominal and real outcomes. What would you have to believe to have a 10% rate of return in a nominal sense? What would you have to have it in a real sense? So, we look at the economics and judge the value of the project based on multiple price scenarios. But when we are actually putting out an FID kind of number, it is our best estimate of what that cost at that point in time will be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Doug Leggate ","I've got two questions, if I may. I guess the first one is an upstream question. When you laid out the Analyst Day back in March, obviously you kept your guidance through 2020. And if we take, Pat, what you said about the buyback being sustainable, it seems at least on our numbers in the current oil price environment you have got a lot more headroom in terms of surplus cash. But I'm curious, what are your intentions post 2020? Should we expect the current level of spending to be sustained? Or is that headroom to allow for, let's say, another step-up in project visibility as we go beyond, for example, Tengiz as we go beyond 2020? I've got a quick follow-up, please.","Pat Yarrington","Dough, I think I'll just start and say, we feel good about the $18 billion to $20 billion range out through 2020. Because we can see our way forward that far with the quality of the resource base we have, the production profile that we've got laid out for the Permian, and other unconventional. Our ability to take what is relatively a less mature asset base like LNG and debottlenecking and see continued value growth there, we have a whole series of investments that we can see lined out that our current portfolio gives us opportunity to develop economically and that's why we feel comfortable about the $18 billion to $20 billion range.","When you get beyond 2020, we really will have to have a review of other incremental projects that we would like to bring online. At some point, we believe that there will be the opportunity to add deepwater investment. For example, those are competing now or they're working to get their cost structure down, so that they can compete better in the portfolio that time will come. We've said in the past that we want to be ratable in terms of how many we bring on bring those on at what time frame and what sort of pacing we do. So, that's all stuff that we will put together as we are looking at our 2019 to 2021 plan, and as all information that we will try to come out and provide a little bit more guidance for when we get to our Security Analyst Meeting in March 2019. ","But for now, I think the key message is $18 billion to $20 million that's the capital program that's the capital discipline that were living within. ","Doug Leggate","Jay maybe I can follow-up with you specifically than on another potential source of cash because you guys have obviously got tremendous flexibility with the Permian, but it is also very early and your 5 billion to $10 billion disposal plan and since you laid that out the oil prices obviously recovered quite a bit so, so I guess what I'm asking Jay is it that upside to your disposal target, how is the change in oil price changed your view of what's covered in the portfolio and I'll leave it there.","Jay Johnson","I would say that as we look at assets that are going to be part of our portfolio work, we tend to look at assets that are approaching end of life or either very early in life. So early in life would be resource opportunities that we have that just don't compete for capital in the portfolio. They maybe economic, quite of economics, but they don't compete for capital and or trying to be very disciplined about what projects we invest and only invest in the top part of our queue. The projects that are very late in life tend to have limited resource potential left for us and those are the ones we are putting out there that higher prices certainly help.","But I wouldn\u2019t change our guidance at this point in time. This is going to be a pretty ratable program. It's a pretty normal part of our operation to continue to look at properties as they move through their lifecycle and decide when do they need to exit the portfolio. Our overall focus on all of this, we are not driving your production target we are driving to improve our returns and lead the industry and our returns on the upstream assets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.","Jason Gammel","Jay, it's very positive comments on the operations in Australia essentially reaching nameplate capacity already. And obviously, very long duration runs on several of the trains. I guess my question is given this performance, how should we think about utilization rates in 2019 on the LNG facilities, recognizing that obviously some maintenance still needs to be done? But that there are probably some debottlenecking opportunities in the near term that you might be able to take advantage of? ","Jay Johnson","Yes, we have not issued any formal guidance around this yet. We are going through the business plan now when we really develop that. But I would say that we took all the knowledge from the Gordon Train 1 and apply that to 2 and 3. We have gone through the pit stops now. So, we are really pretty comfortable with where these trains are and we just need to get some run time and do the analysis to see where the opportunities are for further expansion.","One of the best ways to extend the capacity of these trains of course is just keeping them fully online and fully utilize and so that's our primary focus at the moment. Wheatstone is a very similar story. Train 1 started up we had a pretty clean startup but taking all those lessons learned train 2 was started up very cleanly and at this point in time, we do not have any anticipation of taking those down.","So we may have from time to time as we said before, you know some of the small pit stops if we see economically driven opportunities to enhance performance as we have done, but overall I think a lot of the other than routine maintenance a lot of the unknown shutdowns at this point in time are behind us.","We will get into a regular rotation of shutdowns as all major trains do and that's on our three or four-year cycle as we get these and we want to have them staggered out. But that's all being sorted out in our business plan and for now we would expect to see some pretty good sustained runs on these trains.","Jason Gammel","That's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Jay, could you comment on timing on first production at Big Foot and whether you are actively engaged in restarting production in the PZ? ","Jay Johnson","Yes, so at Big Foot, we still expect to see production started later this year. We have made good progress. We got the platform successfully installed in storm safe, as you know early in the first quarter of this year. The drilling program is underway. We are completing the first 12 and we are moving through and just about bring buyback gas into the facility to start the final commissioning. So later in this year, we will expect to see production at Big Foot. We've already run, in fact, some of the second riser just to make sure loop currents aren\u2019t a factor for us in that program.","As we look at the PZ, of course it's an ongoing issue that the two governments are working to resolve. Our focus is on making sure that we are keeping the facilities and are ready to restart mode. We are very focused on asset integrity and preservation types of activities. We have also done a lot of engineering and use this time of downtime to model, not only a more comprehensive reservoir set of models, but also the surface facilities and really identified all of the opportunities of low hanging fruit to optimize the flow once we get the facilities back online.","So, I think there is a lot of good opportunities for us when it restarts. We remain ready to go and off course we will support the governments as they work towards resolution. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. ","Roger Read","If we could, Jay, maybe come back to the Midland Delaware Basin, the takeaway. And then you've been over the last several quarters exceeding the guidance range that was laid out at the Analyst Day. So I was just curious, as you think about the capacity to take away, both on the oil and gas side, the fact you are running ahead of the guidance range. Does that create any risk? And then the second part of my question is as you move non-operated or non-produced barrels that 50,000 barrels a day, and replace them with your own. How does that flow through in terms of performance? I would assume better cash capture, cash margin capture, on your own barrels than third party, but I was just curious how that works out.","Jay Johnson","So I'll take the first question or first part of the question. The higher production that we're seeing from our operations is taking into account. Our midstream group and our business unit, they are in daily conversation about where we are, what our updated forecast look like, so that we don't catch anyone by surprise. The midstream group has done an outstanding job of working with various suppliers and services in areas for our takeaway capacity.","We have adopted the strategies and our focus is on maximizing returns from the Permian, and that's what drives all of our efforts. So where we have had opportunities to not invest our capital, but rather contract for service like pipelines and takeaway capacity, our gas plants and things where we can tariff through someone else capital at a better rate, we've chosen to do so. But that means we have to be very coordinated with all these various suppliers to ensure the capacities in place, and accommodating our growth plans.","So at this point in time we look very good through 2018 and 2019. We just will continue to monitor this there is periods of tightness, periods of excess capacity and we look to take opportunity to acquire other crudes and move them through those lines when the opportunities present themselves in the form of the differential exceeding the tariff. I do think in terms of the -- when we think about the NOJV, we almost have to think of the upstream producers into the Midland basin -- into the Midland area.","And then our midstream takes crude from the Midland area and moves it to markets and that are crude and others crude. So it's really a big machine but it's hard to say one specific barrel moves through the system. It's, more of a commercial arrangement and equipment volumes. Our goal is to make sure that we are getting the maximum returns for the barrels that we produce, whether they're non-operated or operated barrel, as we move those to the various markets.","The other thing that our midstream has done it's been really helpful is not just get pipeline capacity out of the basin into the various markets, but then they have also made arrangements, so that we can move this as we said across the doc into ships and access world markets as well. And so, it really lets us take a forward look at those markets and adjust our off-take as we need to maximize our realizations.","Pat Yarrington","And I wanted to add one of the benefits of being an integrated company and it's also one of the benefits of being a company that focuses on a longer-term plan. We have been under this plan of the 20 rig rate in the Permian for a quite some time. And all of these precursors have been lined out. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP Paribas. Your question please.","Theepan Jothilingam","A couple of questions, actually. Firstly, I think you gave guidance at the Analyst Day on the headwinds in the cash flow of somewhere between $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. So I just wanted to know whether that guidance is still valid and how much of those headwinds have been consumed in the first half. And then the second question. I think we've been given an update in terms of the uncon business, particularly for the Permian. But I was just wondering how the rest of the unconventional business, the Duvernay Argentina is looking as one reviews the last six months.","Pat Yarrington","I\u2019ll take them in order I think. So, yes, good question about the headwinds. So year-to-date, through this first six months we are sitting at combined headwinds of about 3.6 billion. The guidance that I had given back in March was between 2.5 and 3.5. Actually, I think that is still good guidance may in fact come in a little bit lower, I mean a little bit towards the low end of the range.","What we are seeing here with higher prices is that the differed tax headwind that we thought would materialize at lower prices is really almost turning into, essentially turning into a tailwind here at higher prices, and that\u2019s exactly what you would expect. So bottom line somewhere between 2.5 to 3.5 but probably closer to the bottom end of that range.","Jay Johnson","And as far as our other unconventional activities, we have continued to see very good progress in all three of the assets. I\u2019ll just walk through them one at a time. The three rigs we've increased from two to three rigs down in Argentina worked very well with our operator YPF. We are seeing continued improvement in our performance down there. The economic returns are looking very strong.","I think what's really important in Argentina is they continue to deal with some of their situation. Maintaining an open market will be an important watch point for us as we continue to move forward with our operations in the Vaca Muerta. We also have a field called El Trapial, which was a conventional field that\u2019s in the northern part of that area. And we are planning to do in an eight well pilot for the unconventional potential under El Trapial, and there is a lot of expectation that that may also improve to be a good area for us from an unconventional sense.","We have restarted our drilling campaign in the Marcellus. We took a couple of year holiday just to reduce our capital during the last couple years. So, we are now moving back in the operation there, and the initial results coming out of the Marcellus as we picked up right where we left off and continued our march to lower our unit development and operating cost. So I'm pretty pleased with what we are seeing in the Marcellus and Utica areas.","And then finally, up at Kaybob DuVernay in Canada we are also seeing good performance from our crews up there. We have moved from largely a land tenure and assessment of appraisal drilling mode into our first factory mode and have our first development area, that\u2019s about 55,000 acres that we started on in November 2017. So, as we shift from moving rigs around and appraisal drilling to actually development drilling, we expect to see that continued improvement in performance there.","One of the things that has been really successful for us over the last two or three years has been bringing these various teams together they need on a regular basis best practices are shared between the different areas. So while they all have different characteristics, there is far more in common than there is different.","And the techniques, the best practices, the use of data analytics, just a lot of the experience that we gain on a daily basis instead of just being in one area now were deploying that across all four and it doesn\u2019t just flow from the Permian outward. Things like zipper fracking actually came from the Marcellus into the Permian and so, we see that leveraging of knowledge and experience is quite powerful and very valuable force us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. As you are working to expand Gorgon, I know that the Australian government is prioritizing more domestic gas supply, particularly for the eastern states in the country. And how do you kind of balance out your higher export demand with the fact that there is a brewing shortage domestically in the market?","Jay Johnson","We would love to sell them LNG to start with, but what's really important for Australia as with country is energy security. You always want to make sure your country has efficient supply of clean, affordable, reliable energy source. And so in the West Australia, there is no pipeline, there is no way to transport gas from the west to the east. Other than through LNG, we continue to produce LNG.","We have extensive gas resources in the west 50 trillion cubic feet of gas as Chevron equity gas. Our focus is on making sure we have domestic gas plants at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. We have plenty of capacity to supply the west Australia, but we also are really focused on making sure that we move and monetize that gas resource to the various markets that are demanding in. So, at this point, I don't see the East Coast problems having any impact on either the expansion or the delivery from west Australia.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. A quick follow-up on your monetization plans. You mentioned some of the upstream assets. Given the very hot demand these days for Permian midstream capacity, is that something that you would consider including in your divestment planning?","Jay Johnson","We don't really have midstream assets per say in the Permian area. We have been focusing on the upstream that's where we see highest value and highest returns and are takeaway capacity in the midstream processing like gas plants NGLs is provided by third parties.","Pat Yarrington","Okay, thank you very much. I think that concludes the queue here. So, I guess, we're already to end the call. I'd like to thank everybody for your time today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and we appreciate the questions that came in. Thank you very much.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.","John S. Watson","Thank you, Jonathan and welcome to everyone to Chevron\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Chief Financial Officer and Jeff Gustavson, who is our General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the detailed cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Turning to Slide 3, I want to begin by highlighting some of our strategic accomplishments for the year. We had our lowest ever days away from work rate continuing our improvement over several years now. We\u2019ve been the industry leader on this metric since 2010.","Our financial performance in 2013 was solid. Once competition results are fully analyzed we expect to once again post the highest upstream cash and earnings margins per barrel compared to a broad set of peer competitors. Our strong cash flows and balance sheet allowed us to fund our capital program and capture new resource opportunities while maintaining competitive shareholder distributions.","In our downstream business we started commercial operations of a 53,000 barrel per day vacuum gas oil FCC unit at the 50% owned Yeosu Refinery in South Korea. We made significant progress on the construction of a 25,000 barrel per day premium base oil plant at the Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery here in the U.S. We expect to reach mechanical completions toward the end of the first quarter and we will then ramp-up to full capacity during the second quarter. In addition, we\u2019ve also advanced our Oronite expansion project in Singapore.","Our CPChem affiliate, our 50% owned chemicals joint venture announced final investment decision on a $6 billion US Gulf Coast Petrochemical project. In our upstream business we achieved startup and first shipment from Angola LNG, production began at the Papa-Terra project in Brazil; we also start up North Rankin-2 in Australia, which maintains production capacity at the North West Shelf LNG project.","We made substantial progress on our major capital projects at the end of January. Gorgon is currently about 76% complete while Wheatstone is about 27% complete. Similar to prior quarters we have posted a number of photos highlighting our construction projects on these two important facilities on our Chevron Investor webpage located at chevron.com.","We also continued construction activities for our projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Jack\/St. Malo is now moored at its offshore location and is on schedule for startup later this year. Big Foot is expected to be towed to location in the third quarter with expected startup next year. We reached final investment decision for the Alder developments in the U.K. North Sea as well as for Moho Nord in the Republic of the Congo.","We had a very busy year from a resource capture standpoint, successfully acquiring an interest in a discovered resource opportunity in Argentina to develop and explore the Vaca Muerta Shale and we also closed our entry into the Kitimat LNG project in Western Canada where the resources will come from new positions in the Horn River and Liard basins.","We acquired additional shale and tight resource acreage in the Cooper Basin in Australia and the Duvernay Basin in Canada, the Permian Basin in the U.S. as well as in the Ukraine. We also grew our exploration portfolio by acquiring positions in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Australia, Brazil, Morocco, and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.","Our one year reserve replacement was 85%, bringing our three year replacement ratio to 123%. We are proud of our performance this past year. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Pat, who will take you through the financial results, Pat?","","Patricia E. Yarrington","","Hi, thank you John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were $4.9 billion or $2.57 per diluted share. For the year earnings were $21.4 billion, this equates to $11.09 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the year was 13.5% and our debt ratio at year end was 12%. 2013 marks our 26th consecutive annual dividend increase with 11% growth in the quarterly rate. This demonstrates our confidence in our future performance and is consistent with our priority of rewarding shareholders with sustained and strong dividend growth.","In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares, bringing the full year share repurchase total to $5 billion. In the first quarter of 2014, we expect to repurchase the same amount. Finally, Chevron\u2019s 2013 total shareholder return was 19.2%. We continue to lead our peer group on total shareholder returns for the three year, five year and ten year period.","Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $10.5 billion during the fourth quarter; this was the strongest cash generation quarter of the year. For the full year, cash from operations totaled $35 billion reflecting the continued cash generating strength of our portfolio. Cash capital expenditures were $11.6 billion during the quarter and $38 billion for the full year.","We had a very successful year on our resource acquisition efforts as John just mentioned. At year-end our cash balances totaled $16.5 billion giving us a net debt position of $4 billion. The Company continues to move towards a more traditional capital structure.","Turning to Slide 6, I\u2019ll compare results for the fourth quarter 2013 with the third quarter 2013, as a reminder our earnings release compares fourth quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year-ago.","Fourth quarter earnings were $4.9 billion, $20 million lower than the third quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $240 million, reflecting lower liquids realizations and higher exploration and operating expenses. Partially offsetting were favorable foreign exchange movements of $490 million.","Downstream results edged up $10 million between quarters, higher margins and favorable inventory effects were mostly offset by the absence of gains on asset transactions and higher operating expenses. The variance in the other bar largely reflects the favorable swing in corporate tax items during the quarter.","On Slide 7, our U.S. upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were $223 million lower than third quarter\u2019s results. Lower realization decreased earnings by $165 million consistent with the decline in U.S. crude oil price indicators.","Lower production volumes reduced earnings by $35 million mainly due to planned maintenance activity in the Gulf of Mexico and cold weather disruptions in the Mid-Continent region. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including higher operating expenses and unfavorable tax impact partially offset by lower exploration and DD&A expenses.","Turning to Slide 8, international upstream results were just $17 million lower than last quarter\u2019s results. Realizations decreased earnings by $60 million consistent with the decline in Brent prices between quarters. Higher exploration expenses mainly driven by the write-off of an exploration well offshore Canada and higher geological and geophysical expenses across multiple areas decreased earnings by $190 million. A combination of higher operating expenses and DD&A lowered earnings $150 million between periods.","The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including the absence of asset sale gains and favorable tax effects from the prior quarter. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects increased earnings by $490 million. The fourth quarter had a gain of about $300 million compared to a loss of about $190 million in the third quarter.","Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production declined 9,000 barrels a day between quarters. Our shale and tight assets contributed 7,000 barrels a day, mainly from new production in the Marcellus region in the U.S. and Vaca Muerta in Argentina.","External constraints lowered fourth quarter production by 12,000 barrels a day, reflecting lower demand in Thailand and in Bangladesh, as well as weather-related disruptions in the U.S. The base business and other bar include the impact of normal field declines, which are partially offset by higher production from Agbami in Nigeria.","Slide 10 compares full year 2013 net oil-equivalent production to that of 2012. Production declined by 13,000 barrels per day in 2013. Production averaged 2.6 million barrels per day for the year, 98% of our original guidance. This is driven primarily by the slower ramp up at Angola LNG, more expensive turnaround activities and lower gas demand than anticipated in several countries.","Base business declines and asset sales reduced production by 49,000 barrels per day between years. Our base business operation delivered strong performance for 2013. Our base decline rate was lower than our target of 4% providing significant barrels and value. Growing volumes from our shale and tight resources in the Permian and in the Marcellus regions in the U.S. contributed 25,000 barrels per day. Our shale and tight production grew more than 15% in 2013.","Incremental production from our major capital projects contributed 11,000 barrels per day driven by the Angola LNG startup, First Oil from Papa-Terra in Brazil and the ramp up of production at the Usan field in Nigeria.","Turning now to Slide 11, U.S. downstream results were up $16 million between periods. Stronger margins increased earnings by $95 million, mainly due to lower crude costs. West Coast refining margins also benefited from the completion of plant maintenance activity in the third quarter at our El Segundo, California refinery. Gains on asset sales contributed about $90 million less in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items of smaller impact.","On Slide 12, international downstream earnings were nearly flat between quarters. Margins improved earnings by $20 million. Higher refining margins in Canada on lower crude cost and improved marketing margins in Australia were partially offset by lower refining margins in Asia, where we\u2019ve seen weaker demand and ample supply. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $60 million principally for maintenance, repairs and transportation.","The other bar includes a number of unrelated items including favorable year-end LIFO impact partially offset by lower trading results and an unfavorable swing in foreign exchange impact.","Slide 13, covers all other, fourth quarter net charges were $312 million, compared to $522 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $210 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $162 million benefit to earnings while corporate costs were $48 million lower this quarter.","For the full year, this segment had net charges of $1.6 billion, putting us in the lower end of our $400 million to $500 million guidance range per quarter. We believe this quarterly guidance range for the all other segment is still appropriate going forward.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to John for a few comments on 2014. John?","John S. Watson","","Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 14, in December you recall we announced a $39.8 billion capital program for 2014, $2 billion lower than 2013. We expect 2013 to be a relative peak spending year, and 2014 to represent the peak year for LNG spend as our two Australian LNG projects move closer to production. This program also supports our large deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments as well as ongoing development and ramp up activities in the Permian Basin in the U.S.","We\u2019re also investing in longer term projects in Kazakhstan, Canada and West Africa which will drive profitable growth for many years. Importantly, planned spending is directed towards our profitable base business assets throughout the world and well, this includes significant activity across several producing regions in North America as well as in Thailand and Indonesia, amongst others.","Our downstream investments for 2014 are geared toward enhancing reliability and energy efficiency, feedstock flexibility and the production of cleaner transportation fuels. We\u2019re also funding major capital projects related to our chemicals business. Our Oronite expansion project in Singapore is planned to startup in 2014 and we\u2019ll begin ramping up construction activities on the U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project which recently reached FID and is planned to startup in 2017.","We have an attractive portfolio of investment opportunities, which will continue to fund in a disciplined fashion to grow enterprise value and fund shareholder distributions.","On Slide 15, our net production outlook for 2014 is 2.61 million barrels oil equivalent per day based on average Brent price of $109 per barrel, which was the same average price as 2013. This outlook does not assume OPEC curtailments, material and security or other market impacts.","Our full year estimate for 2014 includes modest production ramp-ups at Angola LNG, Papa-Terra and in the Permian Basin. These are expected to be partially offset by declines from our base producing assets, where we continue to assume an average decline rate of approximately 4%. Our focus is on managing the decline rate related to our base business, which is performing very well and on executing with excellence those developments which are expected to add material production volumes in the years ahead.","Our long-term production growth outlook is compelling, profitable and will add value. It is driven by five large projects; Angola LNG, Jack\/St. Malo, Big Foot, Gorgon and Wheatstone, which in total will add over 500,000 barrels per day of net new production to Chevron at full capacity. In 2015, we\u2019ll see the start-up of Gorgon and Big Foot and additional ram up of Jack\/St. Malo. We look forward to providing more details on our key projects and production outlook at our upcoming Security Analyst Meeting.","Thank you. That concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. We\u2019re ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue. So please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. I will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from ISI Group. Your question please.","Doug Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Good morning, everybody.","John S. Watson","Hey, Doug.","Patricia E. Yarrington","","Good morning.","","Doug Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","My question is about capital discipline and specifically the decline in returns on capital to around 14%, which I think places that result at its lowest level in many years. And on this point, John, you talked about the importance of value creation, and you always do actually, but also making hard choices in capital allocation when you were in New York recently. And so while I recognize that you have to complete investment in these megaprojects, I want to see what the Company is doing to address this issue from a corporate planning perspective, or whatever you deem relevant to ensure that this value creation process is optimized.","John S. Watson","Sure. Good question, Doug.","","Doug Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Thanks.","John S. Watson","We did enough capital program as I said of $39.8 billion. It\u2019s a significant program and it largely reflects the good queue that we have. When I reflect on our company and our capital discipline you know we have a wide lead in profit per barrels, some $5 a barrel, not just over the majors, but over independents and others. So we have had discipline over the years and the projects that we have in the queue, we think will also add to earnings going forward.","Now it\u2019s true that the cycle time for some of the projects that I mentioned those big five that I mentioned is long and so there is capital that is not yet on production in the queue. Notwithstanding that, we actually expect our upstream business to have the second highest return on capital employed this year despite that high level of pre-productive capital. So I think we\u2019ve got good discipline on these projects. We got a good record of doing it.","Now inside the company we\u2019re cognizant that there has been a significant increase in the cost of goods and services across the industry. Since the middle of last decade costs have more than doubled and there is some hotspots around the world. So we\u2019re looking very closely at the projects that are in our portfolio. Naturally we\u2019re going to continue with the projects that are under construction, but you\u2019ve seen a couple of areas where we have made some choices. The Rosebank project in the North Sea, we think that\u2019s a good project, a good resource, but cost came in just higher than what we felt were appropriate. So we\u2019re taking a hard look at that project, reviewing it, seeing if we can make the economics more attractive.","The Vietnam gas project, we worked \u2013 we and frankly Unocal before us worked for more than a decade to try to make that project a success, haven\u2019t been able to do that just yet. So I think that we\u2019re really doing what we can. I\u2019d tell you also in the U.S. we\u2019ve scaled back our spending on gas as you might expect. So the volume that you\u2019ll see from gas in the U.S. will be less than we might have planned a few years ago. The only area where we\u2019re spending on gas in any appreciable amount is in the Marcellus where we have a carry that enables us to continue to spend. So all of those things plus outreach that our employees are making with vendors and contractors and frankly just belt-tightening in general, which is a big focus for us right now and will be a message that I\u2019ll be sending in my worldwide conference call with employees in a couple of weeks, are the kinds of things that we\u2019re working on.","Doug Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Okay, those are all great points. And so let me just ask one more. So have you guys quantified what your level of pre-productive capital is, however you guys define it, and how that compares to normal today, John?","John S. Watson","","We do and I\u2019ll make you a promise that Pat Yarrington will show you a fair amount of information on that when we come back in March. But, Doug, it\u2019s at a high level right now.","Doug Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Sure. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","John S. Watson","Okay.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks. Good morning, guys. If I could take one and my follow-up please.","John S. Watson","","I can\u2019t hear you, Doug.","Patricia E. Yarrington","","Doug, you've cut out.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Can you hear me now?","John S. Watson","","If you speak up.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Yes, I will try and speak up, sorry. So John, your production trajectory for 2014 I think has taken some folks by surprise in terms of the \u2013 [the price is] [ph] basically flat year-over-year. Has something slipped or changed there or are Street expectations just wrong or can you basically give us an idea when you expect the inflection point in production? And I've got a follow-up, please.","John S. Watson","","Sure. As I indicated, our production guidance for 2014 is 2.61 and really there\u2019s couple of things to talk about. One, our base business has been performing very well. So we\u2019re continuing to invest in the base and frankly we\u2019ve seen some declines that are less than we\u2019d expect, but we do use our standard 4% decline estimate for the base business, the underlying business for 2014.","Beyond that it\u2019s a function of ramp-ups that we have on major capital projects and there are really a couple that fall into that category. One is Angola LNG and the other is Papa-Terra in Brazil that Petrobras operates. We\u2019ve got a couple of wells on in Papa-Terra, but the ramp-up takes place. It\u2019s really a two-part project that will take place over the course of this year and we take operator guidance in setting that estimate. Angola LNG ramp-up is less than we would have expected a couple of years ago and this might be a good time for me to talk about that project.","Our share of production from Angola LNG is 60,000 barrels a day net at full capacity. We\u2019ve had about five cargoes last year. I think we've had a couple that we've lifted this year, but we\u2019ve been working on some technical issues on the front-end of the plant with the dehydration unit. Remember this is an associated gas project, meaning there is variable feed coming from different facilities. We\u2019ve had some technical issues on the front-end of that plant. And so our expectation is it will not ramp up to full capacity this year. It will likely be more like 30,000 barrels a day if we run it about half capacity this year with the full fix in the first part of 2015 and then ramp up to full capacity after that. So that is probably one of the factors that might be influencing the estimates that are out there.","Beyond that we\u2019ve got Jack\/St. Malo which we\u2019re very pleased with, which we\u2019ll be starting up late in the year. Obviously you only get a partial year\u2019s production from a later in the year start up, but that will start up nicely. So I think it\u2019s more likely that the inflection point will come next year than this year. I don't think that\u2019s inconsistent with the guidance that we gave. If you go back to 2010, in the sense that we said that we would grow roughly 1% between 2010 and 2014 and then 4% to 5% a year thereafter ramping up to our larger target. But understanding the performance of LNG has impacted 2014 to be sure.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks for the answer, John. My follow-up very quickly to Pat is, a move to a normal balance sheet structure, Pat, it looks to us that your cash burn is about $10 billion a year. Is it realistic that you add $30 billion by the \u2013 to your balance sheet by the time you hit your targets in 2017? And I will leave it there. Thanks.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Doug, that will all be a function really of what realizations are, what\u2019s happening from the crude market standpoint fundamentally. But I mean, if you assume no significant change from where we are today from a realization standpoint and acknowledge what the production growth will look like and what cash from operations could look like, we would expect to add additional borrowings to our balance sheet of reasonable size over the next couple of years. So we are starting with a very low leverage rate, 12% right now and there\u2019s a lot of capacity that we can utilize to not only fund the business activity, reinvest in the business, but also continue on with strong shareholder distributions.","John S. Watson","","Let me offer a couple other comments, if I could on that one. Our cash C&E this last year in 2013 was about $39 billion. That included some acquisitions. We expect fewer this year and the cash spend is about $35 billion this year. In addition, asset sales were relatively low last year. We expect modestly higher asset sales going forward. We\u2019re doing some rationalizing in the midstream business, part of the ordinary course of business and we have a few things we\u2019re looking at in the upstream portfolio. Remember most of the cash drain you\u2019re referring to is planned orderly to restore balance sheet back to a more leveraged structure and is largely a function of share repurchases that we're putting in place.","Our intention as we start ramping up production of course is to get to a point where we not only cover C&E, but also cover the dividend. Our policy on dividend has been to grow that dividend commensurate with the ongoing pattern of earnings and cash flow over the long-term. So we\u2019re in this period where we have relatively high spend. We\u2019re generating good cash, but we expect cash generation to increase and as we go forward we expect the cash consumption to attenuate as we roll into higher levels of production.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks. I appreciate the answers.","","John S. Watson","","Yes.","","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Yes. Good morning and thanks for your time. Just coming more I guess back to the U.S. I mean your CapEx in the upstream and your outlook is sort of relatively flat. I mean I appreciate there are some really big projects in the Gulf of Mexico. But you have this emerging shale position not just in the U.S., also obviously up in Canada. Maybe talk about why you are not getting after that more aggressively? I actually saw some really good well results from you guys down in the Permian this morning?","John S. Watson","Well, you want us to spend more Ed?","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","In that area potentially, but what stops you or\u2026?","John S. Watson","Well, a couple of facts. I don't know what, we\u2019ve got a couple of different shale plays going on in Canada. One is in Duvernay, which is liquids oriented and we\u2019ve drilled it. I think we\u2019re on our 13th well up there and have had some good success and we are looking to develop that at a good pace. Our approach to the shale is to make sure we understand what we got and to plan in orderly fashion so that we can keep cost in line commensurate with the production that we can generate. So I do agree with you. We had some good results from those wells.","The second of course is the Horn River and Liard Basin, which is gas to support the Kitimat project, which \u2013 well, there will be additional drilling in the Liard this year to delineate those holdings and of course that production would be associated over time with an LNG project at Kitimat.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And I was also referring to the Permian obviously where you have got a huge acreage position. It just feels that if that was in the hands of an independent they\u2019d be gung ho after it, whereas it feels that perhaps due to corporate CapEx constraints you guys or maybe delineation are going a little bit slower.","John S. Watson","","Well, I know that\u2019s what the independents tell you. What I would tell you is we work very hard to put together a really sustainable and capital-efficient plan over time. Having said that, we drilled some 460 gross wells in 2013, which is more than we had planned. We got 26 rigs working in the basins there. About half of those actually are non-op rigs as well as our own rigs. And I think you\u2019ll see that we are ramping up activity pretty nicely. In March George will show you some charts that will give you a better feel for that, but I think you\u2019ll see a nice ramp up both in the number of rigs and in production that will come from that area.","Remember, one thing, we do try to be efficient with our capital. We are focused on making good returns and so we do want to be sure that we can do it in a low-cost fashion and do it in a way that will generate the kind of financial results overall that will keep us leading. I mentioned earlier that we lead in earnings per barrel relative to the majors, but we also have a big lead in return on capital and return per barrel relative to a lot of the independents as well. So we may not go as fast as some of the independents, but I think it\u2019s the right way for us to move forward.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Thanks, John.","John S. Watson","","Yes.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Thanks. Good morning.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Good morning.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","John and Pat, maybe I have two questions, both of them is somewhat higher level. One is from a capital allocation standpoint. Obviously the last several years, the Company has been going after a lot of the legacy long-term megaprojects, which is great once that they compete. But from a portfolio management standpoint is there a point that you want to say maybe balance the portfolio a little bit between whether from a production standpoint or capital standpoint between the megaprojects, which obviously have a higher risk in terms of the underlying execution and also somewhat binary in nature comparing to a more steady maybe shorter-term projects? That\u2019s the first question.","John S. Watson","Okay. Well, certainly we do quite a bit of work, Paul, on portfolio management to do just as you described. In fact, we tried to balance the portfolio in many ways, but certainly one is the balance between the investments in long-term projects and short-term money. We consciously took on some projects that we felt were opportunistic and ready to go with Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack\/St. Malo and Big Foot.","And so, we knew that we had a heavy period of spend for those projects, but at the same time we\u2019ve really maintained a very strong base business spend program. About 30% of our spend goes into smaller capital projects and you make a good point because I just, for example, just happen to review our performance on small capital projects within the last couple of weeks and the returns are quite good. These are typically incremental projects, incremental drilling projects to existing assets.","And so, we do maintain that spend. In fact the discretionary spend that we have is in that area and we have announced the strong capital program for 2014, and my alternative was largely to cut those base business spend and we decided not to do that. So we tried to balance both those factors so that we get strong returns on capital over time and get good growth and we\u2019ve been able to do that. Despite all the capital that\u2019s in the queue we still, from the numbers that we have, we think we\u2019ll maintain our second position on return on capital employed.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","","John, on [indiscernible] is there a ratio over the next five or 10 years that you want to have 50% of the capital on the legacy megaproject and 50% on the smaller and the base business? Or there is not even a ratio that you guys consider or look at?","John S. Watson","","Well, we will have a higher \u2013 I think we\u2019ve advertised before that we are moving toward a higher percentage of legacy, what we call, legacy or very low declining project, so that as we get toward the end of the decade we\u2019ll be at about 60%. So things like Gorgon, Wheatstone, Tengiz, Angola LNG and the like, even some of our low decline assets such as California heavy oil activity is very low decline and we\u2019re moving to a higher level.","The plus side of that is as you get those on line the amount of spend that it takes to maintain them tends to be fairly low. So we are moving to a higher level of what you\u2019d call legacy spend projects and I think they will deliver a lot of cash and stability for years to come once we get them all on line.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. The second question is that over the last couple years that you have been borrowing \u2013 or actually now since you have been borrowing money to fund a buyback, and as the balance sheet return to more normal, at what point, what would you say, fixed financial ways such as net debt to capital or interest cap [ph] ratio the company will start to reconsider the buyback whether or that you would continue to borrow money to fund it?","John S. Watson","I\u2019ll let Pat talk a little bit about our philosophy on debt and the rating agencies and how much capacity we\u2019ve got.","Patricia E. Yarrington","","Right. And Paul, we said for a long time now that obviously from a cash distribution standpoint the priority is on dividend. Secondly, we invest in the business and cover up the strength of our balance sheet from a pension funding standpoint and that kind of thing, so the third priority. And then finally, it\u2019s share repurchases that become kind of the surplus use of cash and we have also said several times here now that we were in an unusual net cash position for several years now. We will be moving into a net debt position. We have now done that.","As I look forward we still have a tremendous amount of borrowing capacity available to us. We believe that we\u2019re very confident in the future cash generation from these projects once they come on line. And so we can see our steady state here from a share distribution standpoint on share repurchases for a while. We also see intensions to continue to grow the dividend. We have a lot of flexibility in our balance sheet and I don\u2019t think that there is a consideration at least in terms of steady macro condition that would suggest that we would be turning our share repurchases at this time.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Hey. Good morning, guys.","John S. Watson","Hey, Evan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","John, on the CapEx, I know that the organic cash CapEx exceeded your guidance by about $2 billion. As you assess that 2014 CapEx budget what gives you confidence that you won\u2019t experience similar inflation? I mean, is there anything different, any protections, conservatisms versus what happened as you \u2013 versus how you asses 2014? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","John S. Watson","","Our number \u2013 taking out the money for acquisitions that we had last year, the amount that went over the budget I think was lower than that. So I don\u2019t know that we disclosed the exact dollars of those acquisitions, but it\u2019s somewhat lower than that. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be having the conversation about capital had we not had those one-time acquisitions. But candidly, if we have a supplement to a project we\u2019re going to fund it in that year. In general we manage our budget pretty tightly and I have no reason to believe at this point that we\u2019ll exceed the $39.8 billion that we put out there. We\u2019re sensitive to it, you\u2019re sensitive to it. So we will be watching it very closely.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Similar and maybe this is something for the Analyst Day. As obviously organic CapEx, cash CapEx trend here is flat and you mentioned a peak LNG spend in 2014. There are a lot of your peers that are forecasting a peak CapEx. So do you see a similar overall trend based upon your current slate of projects? And then maybe secondly, this is the other side of the question. It\u2019s unclear what the world looks like in two, three, five years let alone the opportunities in the asset market, M&A market, resource market, et cetera. I mean do you see any real ability to forecast a longer-term CapEx figure? And I will leave it at that.","John S. Watson","","Well, it\u2019s a good question. One of the reasons \u2013 and I\u2019ve told you and others before, one of the reasons we haven\u2019t put out long-term capital forecast is because it\u2019s very hard to predict oil prices, foreign exchange, local content requirements, cost of goods and services. What we have been fairly good at understanding is the competitive nature of our project. So when we put out long-term production forecast we\u2019ve had a view that \u2013 we know the world is going to need energy, we know that we got projects that will compete because of the resource and general nature of the project. And so, we\u2019ve been \u2013 frankly we stepped out quite a bit in putting out a seven-year production forecast and I feel pretty good about that. It was harder to predict what the exact spend would be. And that\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019ve been reticent to give a lot of guidance going out beyond two or three years.","I know directionally the level of our activity and we do balance that, but I don't know what the macro environment will bring fully. And once we get projects that are under construction we\u2019re obviously going to continue them. So I have a pretty good feel obviously for what spending will be this year and I have a pretty good feel for what spend is going to be in 2015 and 2016 and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve given you this flattening comment where $40 billion this year will be in that same range give or take for the next couple of years. Beyond that the macro conditions could dictate something different.","We do try to be opportunistic when it comes to bringing resources into the portfolio. Last year, I think we brought in some terrific resources into our portfolio at a good price. As you know, we supplemented our acreage in New Mexico in the Permian area. We brought in some good high-quality assets that we referenced earlier in the Duvernay. We think the Kitimat resource is a terrific one for the long-term. Argentina, as far as we know, it\u2019s the best shale outside of North America. So we took the opportunity to bring those into the portfolio and we don\u2019t see as many opportunities in that space this year, for example. That\u2019s why I made the comment I did earlier about spend, but over time we are in depleting resource business and you do need to add to the portfolio. We\u2019re careful how we do that. That\u2019s how we got to our leading position in earnings per barrel and we\u2019ll continue to be careful in how we do that going forward.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe I could slip in just one last one on the asset disposal side. I know you mentioned in a response or your comments the midstream sale process monetization. I mean any update or any change in your thoughts there given you\u2019re growing unconventional base and a likely associated midstream CapEx over time? Any change or whether that would be an outright sale or potentially forming an MLP? And I will leave it at that.","John S. Watson","Yes. In fact I will say there is a little bit of a shift. Let me be clear. We\u2019re not in shrink to grow mode, we\u2019re not resetting the base, we\u2019re not doing anything like that. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing. But just as we\u2019ve done in the downstream, where we pruned the portfolio, I think Mike and his team has sold some $8 billion in assets over the last six, seven years and those have been done in a very nice pace way to get good value.","We\u2019re in the process right now of making some sales in our midstream business for example. You referenced MLPs, our approach \u2013 we\u2019re not fond of the MLP structure as a way for us to hold assets, but we can sell into MLPs and get that value. And so we have been selling pipelines and we\u2019ll continue to do so for pipelines where they\u2019re not critical to our upstream or downstream business, n other words more merchant type lines. We are selling lines. You\u2019ve probably seen some commentary in the press to do that. We think we can get good value there.","Similarly, we do have a lifecycle for asset sales in the upstream and so there are some sales that are possible there. Our approach is not to talk a lot about the specific assets for commercial reasons, but I would say you\u2019ll see more asset sale activity over the next two or three years in the upstream than you\u2019ve seen over the last few years. Certainly there\u2019s been a lot of chatter about some leases that we\u2019re selling in Nigeria. Those we think will bring to a closure later this year and get good value for those. And I would say overall in the context of some of the big headline numbers others have said, our sales will be modest. But we will have a little bit more in the area of asset sales going forward.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Appreciate. Thanks, guys.","John S. Watson","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.","Pavel S. Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Thanks very much for taking the question. You mentioned the ongoing reduction in domestic gas drilling and yet ironically that\u2019s the one part of your domestic production that\u2019s actually been up for the last, I guess three, four quarters. Why do you think there is this disparity where domestic gas is rising, but oil and liquids have been in decline?","John S. Watson","Well, the only \u2013 the area where we\u2019ve been investing in the U.S. has been in the Marcellus and it\u2019s a function of the carry. So the volume increases that you are seeing, you recall we acquired Atlas Energy and some other tuck-on and we came in with $1.3 billion carry where one as we go forward we\u2019re funding a disproportionately low percentage of the cost for the revenue that we\u2019re getting. That carry is now down to $500 million. And our strategy has been to really build up a factory model, get our full costs in line so that as we end that carry three or four years from now that we\u2019ll be in a good competitive position on a cost per MCF basis once we get through that carry.","In the meantime, we can afford to do the drilling. We obviously \u2013 wells that are drilled when you are funding 25% of the cost and getting 60% of revenue, I think that the ratio is pretty good.","Pavel S. Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Sure. And then a follow up on Kitimat, I think you\u2019ve said in the past year your aim is to reach FID this year. Is that still the case and what are the key question marks that would impede that from happening?","John S. Watson","","Well, we're doing site clearance now. One of the things we\u2019ve learned on big land-based projects is get your infrastructure in order and housing and things of that sort. So that's what we are doing. We are pacing this project very carefully as you would expect and what we have said is that FID will be entirely a function of gas contracts and that allow us to develop the opportunity and provide energy to Asian markets at a fair price. And it's no secret that there is a lot in the media on that subject right now. We are actively working with gas customers today.","My view hasn't changed since the view Joe Geagea described to you last year, which is LNG projects are expensive whether in West Canada, West Africa or East Africa or the Gulf Coast of the U.S. or Australia. And we're going to need robust pricing in order to make those project go, and so there are some projects that may be built on existing facilities in the Gulf Coast of the U.S. that have gone to FID and we\u2019ll add some capacity that may be slightly lower cost. But once you get to Brownfield, whether it\u2019s Gulf Coast or elsewhere, I think we're going to need either oil link pricing or pricing that very clearly will give us the kind of return we need. So I guess what I am saying is FID will be a function of gas contracts.","Pavel S. Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","All right. I appreciate it.","John S. Watson","","Sure.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allen Good from Morningstar. Your question, please.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Good morning, everyone.","John S. Watson","Good morning.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research","John, you mentioned a little bit on the Downstream sales and restructuring. Just a question on that. Is that business currently sized right for Chevron and do you see any other opportunity there to potentially reduce capital employed on the downtown side?","John S. Watson","","Well, our downstream business if you look at the direction we\u2019ve gone, we actually have done quite a bit of pruning over the last two years. We\u2019ve basically gotten out of the disconnected marketing or marketing is disconnected from our refining system and then we did get out of our refinery in Europe that we think was very well timed. And so what\u2019s that left us with is a strong U.S. business with good positions along the Gulf Coast and through the West Coast of the U.S, and then a strong business in Asia.","We think \u2013 we always take a look at the portfolio, but in general, I think our Downstream portfolio is in pretty good shape. I might have told you a few years ago that inland refineries, small refineries would be tough, but frankly those have been some of the most profitable with the one in Salt Lake and Burnaby, British Columbia.","So I feel pretty good about the portfolio overall in the Downstream. The capital that we are putting in the Downstream business is really geared towards the chemicals business now. We\u2019ve got a base oil plant that\u2019s coming up in Pascagoula that will make us the largest top tier base oil producer in the world. We\u2019ve got our share of the petrochemical complex that we're building with Phillips 66 through Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, that\u2019s a $6 billion project. Our share is $3 billion. We think that is going to be a terrific project. As far as we know we are ahead of other projects in the area. We have got the permits and have gone to FID. Overall, we think we can generate mid-teens kinds of returns in this business and so we think it is a good one.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Yes, I guess on the chemicals, I mean you mentioned a product upcoming and certainly that is a very good portfolio there. But I guess relative to the size of Chevron total it's still relatively a small piece. Do you think the market is accurately crediting you for that business? And if not, do you think there is way potentially to monetize that through \u2013 I don\u2019t know as with Phillips 66 or spinning that off separately or is your plan really just to hold out for the long-term and then continue to build that up?","John S. Watson","","Our plan is to hold that. It\u2019s about 15% of our capital. We disclosed the segment information. I think you guys have sharp enough pencils to be able to figure out what it brings to us. But more importantly the math there is some linkages in the business that I think are very important. I don't think splitting up the business makes you an independent.","We have some very significant linkages to the downstream business, and I\u2019ll give you just a couple just as for instance. Southern California, our El Segundo Refinery, we\u2019ve got heavy crude going out of San Joaquin Valley. We\u2019ve just augmented some facilities at the El Segundo Refinery specifically so it can take more San Joaquin Valley crude. We think that's a good synergistic type of investment. Over the years we've had high mercury crude in Asia and we\u2019ve put in specific facilities to be able to capture value benefit associated with that.","I think when you look in the middle of the country today I think it makes all the sense in the world to be an integrated company. You\u2019ve had tremendous volatility in crude pricing and you\u2019re either capturing the refinery or you\u2019re capturing on the upstream side, just depending upon how infrastructure moves and we\u2019re capturing that in Salt Lake. So I frankly think that the integration story for us is pretty straightforward.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Okay. Great. Thanks for the comments.","John S. Watson","Sure.","","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning.","John S. Watson","Good morning.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","I guess a lot of this stuff has been hit. I just wanted to kind of follow-up on, I guess, Q4 in the upstream in the U.S. and if that had any implications for how we should look forward, I understand on the production side as we modeled it. The realization for prices looked okay. I know as I went through the \u2013 or as you went through the presentation it showed realizations down. I was wondering is that a cost issue realization, sort of a net realization as opposed to just a price realization and if so, what kind of occurred in the fourth quarter, is that one-time issue or recurring issue? Any help you can provide there.","Jeff Gustavson","","So Roger, I can help with that. This is Jeff. It's not a net realization. It's a price realization and it was consistent with the markers that you see in the market for the fourth quarter.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So I mean more or less what occurred in the fourth quarter we should look at as being an issue going forward, I mean as crude prices move around that will change, but just the market conditions.","Jeff Gustavson","That's exactly right.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then as we look forward into 2014, especially at the end of the year, say, Jack\/St. Malo starts up, you got continued growth probably in California. Should we look at that as helping out the realization story in the U.S., North America?","Jeff Gustavson","Again I guess it depends on your view of prices. So we are out of our U.S. production, we're about a third weighted to California prices, which is obviously separate from what\u2019s going on in the mid-continent. We\u2019re about a quarter weighted to Mid-continent or WTI prices and about a third weighted to the Gulf of Mexico. So I mean as Jack\/St. Malo comes on, as Big Foot comes on, the weighting in the Gulf of Mexico may increase somewhat. There's not a lot of growth in the California business and at the same time we have the ramp-up in the Permian. So it really goes back to what your view of the different markers are in those three separate regions.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Sure. Okay. That's helpful. And then, any additional update you can provide as you look at the Vaca Muerta kind of the drilling plans 2014 and 2015, when would we potentially see anything on the production side. I know you made the comment it\u2019s a great shale. Just wondering when would we maybe see something tangible that we can start to fix on?","","John S. Watson","Well, I think you\u2019ll start to see it going forward from here. We\u2019re producing 16,000 barrels a day gross. That\u2019s 100% number. And so, one of the reasons I made the comment about it being a good investment is there\u2019s lots of oil infrastructure there now. So it\u2019s right in the middle of an oil producing area. YPF is doing a nice job. We\u2019re sending in some technical and other people to support them, but we got 15 rigs running. We think over time that it will get up to 19 and so we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll see continued growth. I\u2019ll just say we just recently closed the transaction. So it\u2019s very early days at this point, but it\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s probably more to come, but you should start to see benefits in production here before too long.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Okay. Thank you.","John S. Watson","All right. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Hutton from RBC Capital Markets.","Peter Hutton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Good morning. Good afternoon from London. Actually my first question is a follow-up from the last one, which is about these liquid realizations in the U.S. and you mentioned that these are in line with the benchmarks. Well, from what I can see when I follow the trend, that is right, when you\u2019re looking against the third quarter, but the third quarter have the highest discount between your average realization and WTI since the 2008 peak. So is it two quarters when we've had discounts of the order of something like $10 shortfall. And so I guess I'm asking the same question in a different way. Is that something we should also expect to see during the course of 2014 until you start to get more production out of the Gulf of Mexico from Jack\/St. Malo? And then I had a follow-up which is actually my original question.","John S. Watson","I don\u2019t know we got anything fundamental for you. Maybe right for Jeff to follow-up with you offline to see if there is something in the markers that we\u2019re not covering here, but there are some lags in pricing that take place in the U.S. But if you wouldn\u2019t mind, Peter, maybe we\u2019ll follow-up offline and see if we can get to those specifics.","Peter Hutton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Be glad to. In that case can I just \u2013 the question I was going to ask originally, which is on the reserve replacement rate and exploration. I think you mentioned 85% this year, which is down on the full year and one year is not a trend. But were there any areas where you have been focusing and didn't come in the way that you had expected? And realistically sort of where the focus is for this year and can you give a figure of the budget for exploration spent in 2014? Please.","John S. Watson","Yes, actually the irony, this is a very good year for reserve replacement relative to what we had in our plan because we have sort of base business type activity, infill drilling and the like, developments and additions, revisions off the existing field and we had a very good year in that area. What we didn\u2019t have was a significant number of major capital projects that went to FID and that\u2019s why this number tends to be lumpy in any given year. So, well, on an ongoing basis it was less than replacing 100% of production. That\u2019s why we quote the three year and five year numbers, which are 100% or higher. So I think that\u2019s really my thought for you on reserves.","Exploration this year is about $3 billion to $3.2 billion type of number this year. I\u2019ll tell you one of the challenges we\u2019ve had last couple of years is getting all our high impact wells drilled. We\u2019ve got a great queue, but we frankly in the Gulf of Mexico we\u2019ve been drilling so many development wells that we got to queue that\u2019s built up there and so we\u2019re looking forward to, I think we\u2019ve got 14 or so high impact wells which we define as 100 million barrel or more prospects and we look forward to getting them drilled here over the next few years. But little over 3 billion is the target for the year. Thank you very much.","Patricia E. Yarrington","","I think we have time for one more question?","John S. Watson","One more question Robert.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your question please.","Robert Arthur Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Hi, thanks for fitting me in and I look forward to the Analyst Day where I am sure we will go through more detail. But in the meantime I wanted to ask you for kind of an update on your Australia LNG cost and exposure to exchange rate. We still see volatility there. I know you are of course further through the spend on Gorgon at 76%, which would imply less exposure to the exchange rate on the surface. But I imagine more of the spend now is local labor, which I am assuming is priced in Australian dollars. So just the latest sort of leverage to that exchange rate if you don't mind and then any rethinking of your plans not to I guess hedge foreign exchange going forward?","John S. Watson","Yes, interesting question. Maybe the comment I will make, we have had a rollercoaster on foreign exchange in Australia, as you point out. When we went to Final Investment Decision back in 2009, the exchange rate was roughly $0.86 and it ramped up as high I think 105 or so. And that was part of the reason that we supplemented the project. Our view at that time was not to hedge foreign exchange because we felt there have been a pretty strong correlation between oil prices and their currency and so we felt that our overall portfolio was pretty well hedged. And I think that proved to be a pretty wise decision.","When we went to FID on Wheatstone, we did so and have assumed a parity exchange rate. So that\u2019s a $29 billion project when we assume parity. This year our spend on the two projects is roughly $10 billion and we estimate that 70%, 75% of that spend is in Australian dollar. So with the Australian dollar tracking under $0.90 now that\u2019s a positive for us going forward. We\u2019re out a little something on this, so we\u2019re benefiting from it right now and we don\u2019t do any hedging and I don\u2019t anticipate that we will going forward.","Robert Arthur Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Great. Nice to see it swing the other way and thanks for the update.","John S. Watson","You bet, thank you. Okay, thank you all. In closing, let me say we appreciate everyone\u2019s participation today on the call. I would like to thank the analyst for asking the good questions in this morning session. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing you in March and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have lot more questions and we\u2019ll enjoy the material we\u2019ll be presenting then.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Okay. Thank you very much, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations.","We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two.","I'll begin with a recap of our second quarter 2016 financial results, and then Jay will provide an update on our Upstream business prior to my concluding remarks.","Turning to slide three, slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter loss was $1.5 billion or negative $0.78 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $2.8 billion. These are primarily associated with certain assets, where through a combination of reservoir performance and price, revenue from oil and gas production is not expected to recover costs. Excluding these items as well as the impact of asset sale gains of $420 million and foreign exchange effects of $279 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $661 million or $0.35 per share.","A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation.","Cash from operations for the quarter was $2.5 billion. And our debt ratio at quarter end was approximately 23%. Our net debt ratio was a bit under 20%.","During the second quarter we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2016. We currently yield 4.2%.","Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $2.5 billion during the second quarter and $3.7 billion year to date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than the first quarter, commensurate with rising crude prices.","Working capital effects of $2 billion and $2 billion in deferred tax items \u2013 for example, those associated with tax loss positions \u2013 reduced year to date operating cash. These are generally transitory effects, which reverse in future periods. We expect a portion of the working capital drain to reverse later this year.","Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, mainly from the sale of our New Zealand marketing assets, Canadian natural gas storage assets, and pipeline assets in North America.","Cash capital expenditures were $4.5 billion, a decrease of over $3 billion from second quarter 2015 and down more than $1 billion from the first quarter of 2016.","At quarter end our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $9 billion. And our net debt position was $36 billion.","Turning to slide five, slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2016 results were $2 billion lower than second quarter 2015 results.","Special items, primarily the absence of the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Caltex Australia Limited, partially offset by the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of New Zealand marketing, reduced earnings by $1.4 billion between periods. In both quarters depreciation expense was impacted by impairments and other charges.","The swing in foreign exchange impacts improved earnings by $530 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash.","Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $528 million between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by lower exploration and operating expenses as well as other unrelated positive variances.","Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by $535 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses.","Turning now to slide six, I'll now compare results for the second quarter of 2016 with the first quarter of 2016. Second quarter results were $745 million lower than the first quarter.","Net special items for impairments, project suspensions, and other related charges decreased earnings by $2.2 billion between periods. Foreign exchange created a positive earnings variance of nearly $600 million between periods.","Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased approximately $1.2 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations in line with our price sensitivity as well as lower exploration and depreciation charges.","Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $79 million, as lower operating expenses were more than offset by inventory revaluation effects.","The variance in the Other segment largely reflects unfavorable corporate tax items.","Jay will now review our worldwide quarterly production and provide an update on our Upstream operations. Jay?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Thanks, Pat. I'll start with second quarter 2016 production and then provide an update on a few of our key Upstream projects.","Slide seven compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 68,000 barrels a day between these quarters, yielding first half 2016 production of 2.6 million barrels a day.","Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian with the Marcellus, Vaca Muerta, Duvernay, and Liard Basins also reflecting year-on-year growth.","Major capital projects increased production by 37,000 barrels a day, as ramp-ups continue at Jack\/St. Malo, Chuandongbei, and Angola LNG. And we saw initial production from Gorgon.","Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 63,000 barrels per day, which included the Partitioned Zone, security issues in Nigeria, and fires in Canada. The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 44,000 barrels a day. The decrease of 48,000 barrels a day in the base business and other bar reflects normal field declines and higher turnaround activity, partially offset by new base business production from brownfield investments.","The chart shown on slide eight was presented in January and outlined our production guidance and uncertainties for 2016. The cumulative impact of the uncertainties has been unfavorable. And we expect to be near the bottom of the annualized guidance we provided.","For example, we anticipated that oil production in the Partitioned Zone would be restarted by mid-year, which hasn't happened. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2015 this field produced over 75,000 barrels a day, Chevron's share. We've also worked through various start-up issues at Gorgon that impacted our first half production.","We've been successful with our Upstream divestment program, which is impacting our production. Transactions closed this year represent a daily production rate of just over 40,000 barrels a day. And we expect to see an additional 15,000 to 30,000 daily barrels leaving the portfolio before the end of this year.","In addition to these uncertainties, production in the third quarter will be adversely impacted by a large number of turnarounds, including the second generation plant at Tengiz.","At the same time our long anticipated queue of projects is now coming online. In the second half of this year we expect to see sustained production from Angola LNG, Gorgon Trains 1 and 2, and all three trains at Chuandongbei. We are also expecting continued growth from the Permian, which I'll talk further in a few minutes.","The overall result is that we expect to exit the year with the December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day.","Turning to slide nine, funding the completion of projects under construction is our first capital allocation priority. At Gorgon, we're currently producing at 70% of Train 1's capacity, or approximately 90,000 barrels per day. In early July we took a short shutdown to address a number of issues and repair a minor leak. Production resumed mid-July, and the plant has been running smoothly since that time.","We're incorporating all the experience gained from Train 1's construction, completion, and initial operations into Train 2 and Train 3. Construction on Train 2 and Train 3 is progressing very well. We expect first LNG from Train 2 early in the fourth quarter and from Train 3 in the second quarter of 2017.","At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. The cleanup and testing of all nine development wells has been completed and the rig has been released. Initial results are in line with expectations.","At the plant site, piping, electrical, and instrumentation work is currently progressing very well. We're working to maintain this progress, as we begin the transition to completion, commissioning, and startup activities. Train 2 construction work is also progressing per plan, with startup expected six to eight months after Train 1.","Slide 10 shows our other 2016 startups. At Angola LNG, modifications were completed at the plant, and production restarted on May 20. Since restarting the plant, we've loaded four LNG and seven LPG cargoes. The plant was tested at 75% capacity and ran smoothly prior to the planned shutdown for strainer and other maintenance activities. The modifications to the gas conditioning section operated as designed, and all other repairs are complete. We expect to achieve sustained production during the third quarter.","At Chuandongbei, Train 3 started up in late May, and all three trains have delivered at full capacity and are now operational. There have been no changes since our previous updates on Alder, Mafumeira Sul, or Bangka.","Turning to slide 11, our next capital priority is to fund high-return short-cycle base and shale and tight investments. First among these opportunities is the Permian, where we have a large royalty advantaged acreage position. We're making excellent progress in the Permian towards the growth we discussed at our analyst meeting in March.","Production this quarter was 21% or 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day higher than the second quarter of last year. Efficiency gains and a shift to more Chevron-operated rigs have more than offset the reduction in total rig count. We're delivering our plan with fewer rigs and less cost.","Turn to slide 12. As we've said before, one of our primary benchmarking metrics for our Permian assets is development cost per barrel. Since the second quarter of last year, we've reduced our unit development costs by approximately 30%. We've been able to accelerate our performance improvements by incorporating industry best practices and applying lessons learned from our joint ventures and contractors. As shown by the data, our development cost is competitive with our joint venture partners.","The table shows improvement in our drilling and completion cost performance from recent pad drilling programs. For 7,500-foot laterals in the Midland Basin, we're averaging $5.6 million per well, which is a 25% reduction from what we showed you at our analyst meeting in March.","Our recovery per well is also improving, as we continue to implement learnings and optimize our lateral lengths, well completions, and drawdown strategies. Earlier this year, we exceeded 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in a 24-hour well test on a 7,500-foot lateral well in the Greater Bryant G area. We also put our 100th company-operated horizontal well in production and continue to gain confidence in our acreage characterization and performance.","We're taking a disciplined, measured approach to development, and we're optimizing and prioritizing the large number of available well locations. We're delivering on our objective to be a competitive operator whose royalty position provides an incremental competitive advantage, and we're consistently improving our financial performance.","Slide 13, in addition to the Permian and other large-scale short-cycle businesses such as San Joaquin and Gulf of Thailand, we have a number of attractive major capital projects that leverage previous investments. The projects listed on this slide all take advantage of existing infrastructure, reducing development costs and cycle time. As they build upon existing developments, they also tend to carry less subsurface and execution risk. The average development cost for these projects is around $15 a barrel.","At Jack and St. Malo, we continue to ramp up production. In June the combined production for both fields reached 110,000 barrels a day. This was accomplished through continued high facility reliability and the startup of the eighth well. The first Stage 2 well is expected to come online next month.","Turning to Slide 14, a major brownfield opportunity that we've talked about many times is the future growth and wellhead pressure management project in Tengiz. As we announced earlier this month, the TCO partnership sanctioned the project. WPMP provides additional wells and pressure boosting facilities to maintain production levels in the existing plants as reservoir pressures decline. FGP builds on the sour gas injection technology already proven in existing operations at Tengiz. It adds additional production and gas injection capacity to increase total oil production by around 260,000 barrels a day. The project is designed to capture execution and infrastructure efficiencies and will take advantage of current market conditions. Incremental recovery is expected to be 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.","Turning to slide 15, FGP\/WPMP is estimated to cost $36.8 billion, which includes $27 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells, and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation. The development cost for the project is $18 a barrel. Operating and transportation costs are expected to be consistent with our existing operations. TCO has secured financing to ensure uninterrupted project funding, utilizing a combination of bank loans, co-lending, and bonds. Demand for the first tranche of the bond offering was strong, and the bonds were placed at an attractive interest rate.","Go to slide 16. As I've discussed, we're committed to improving our project execution performance across the enterprise. I've used this slide previously to describe the actions we're taking on the projects in order to deliver strong execution performance and mitigate the amount of contingency consumed. We're confident these actions will improve our ability to deliver this project predictably and reliably. And I'll update you on a few examples.","Engineering is currently greater than 50% complete, well ahead of industry practice of 25% or less at FID. Having a more advanced engineering design provides a better understanding of the quantity and quality of materials, equipment, and labor required to execute the project, and reduces the likelihood of out-of-sequence work and construction delays due to engineering issues.","The project team and principal contractor have been integrated into one team with fewer layers of management, lower cost, and more effective leadership.","Turning to slide 17, we're pleased to see this project enter execution and are excited about the value the project brings to Kazakhstan, TCO, and our shareholders. Tengiz is a world-class reservoir. And FGP\/WPMP provides the foundation for the continued economic development of the field. The project utilizes technology already proven at Tengiz. It addresses declining reservoir pressure and enhances recovery from the reservoir.","This counter cyclical investment takes advantage of the current market in terms of cost savings, fabrication capacity, and contractor capabilities. Project economics are attractive within the current concession life and include 20% contingency. The project provides additional upside opportunities, including future in-field drilling, facility debottlenecking, increased oil production from existing plants, as well as additional enhanced recovery projects. A concession extension or utilizing less contingency would also provide additional benefits.","Tengiz has been an excellent asset for Chevron. And this investment will allow Tengiz to continue to generate value into the future.","I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss our progress on spend reduction.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Okay. Now turning to slide 18, we are delivering on our committed spend reductions. You'll note the steep reduction in quarterly C&E average over the past three years. Year to date, capital expenditures are down 31% when compared with 2015. We're on a trend line for 2016 C&E of $25 billion or less.","For 2017 \u2013 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures between $17 billion and $22 billion. If the current price environment persists, we will revisit the bottom end of the range, as our primarily goal is to be cash balanced.","Year-to-date operating expense is also down, down 8% when compared to 2015. And we expect a downward quarterly trend to continue in the second half of this year, as we realize the full-year run rate of organizational actions and supply chain initiatives.","Turning to slide 19, just a quick update on our asset sales program. Over the last 10 years, on average we have received proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion per year. With the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia, 2015 was the highest dollar transaction year. Year to date, we have received proceeds of $1.4 billion, covering several transactions, New Zealand marketing, Canadian gas storage assets, pipeline assets in California, and Upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico.","We have a number of potential transactions presently being worked. The larger publicly known transactions are noted on the slide. There are a few attributes that these transactions have in common. The assets are not essential to delivering on our strategy. Their valuations are not particularly oil price sensitive. And there are multiple interested buyers.","We believe our sales program is executable, and that we can secure good value. We have confidence in achieving our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next. And as I said last quarter, we have line of sight on around $2 billion for 2016.","I'd like to close the presentation here on slide 20 by reiterating a few key points. We remain committed to becoming cash balanced in 2017. Our projects are coming online. And we're making huge strides in lowering our cost structure and getting our capital outflows down. We're on track with our asset sales program. We see those as back-end loaded with more occurring in 2017 than this year. They're eminently doable. We believe they are a realistic part of our cash balancing program.","Looking out the next 12 months to 24 months, our profile is just as we have long said it would be; strong volume growth and cash flow margin accretion at the same time. That's a powerful combination, offering tremendous value growth for our shareholders.","Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're committed to growing the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. We recognize the value our shareholders place on dividend, and the value they place on our long history of annual dividend payment increases.","So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Please do keep in mind that we have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and perhaps one follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get everyone's questions answered. Jonathan, can you please open the line?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Hey, Phil.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Good morning.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for all the color in the slide deck today. My two quick questions are going back to the Analyst Day and then tying it to what you said today.","The first one would just be on the production growth outlook, looking out to 2017 in the fuzzy bar chart. At the time, at the Analyst Day you had mentioned that the 2.9 million to 3.0 million [barrels per day] target generally still held at that point in time. Obviously there has been a lot of transitory items this year and then there are some asset sales. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of an update as we look ahead to 2017, either on the number itself or some of the moving pieces we should think about with respect to that number.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","So I think as we look forward at the production, the thing that's coming through are the major capital projects. And as they start up and we're seeing good performance out of those, I think that part of our performance is very strong. As is the growth coming from assets like the Permian and our other base business. And actually our decline rates have been very good. We will see potentially some decline. We're expecting to go maybe from the 2% into the 2% to 4% range (sic) [zero to 4% range] because of the cutbacks in capital. But we still see pretty good performance from all of our base assets.","The asset sales program, we'll give some further updates when we get to the SAM meeting on where we stand there. Some of those were already baked into that forecast. And of course as we move forward and build a business plan this year, a lot of it's going to be responsive to the environment that we find ourselves as we move forward.","I think a key thing is that these new barrels coming online from Permian and from these major capital projects are accretive to our existing portfolio. And so we expect to see strong cash generation as we move forward.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my follow up is just on the Permian. At the Analyst Day you had talked about a potential doubling of the capital budget to meet this strong growth profile through 2020. It sounds like the costs are coming in very well.","So maybe just talk about how you think about growth versus capital preservation? If you can do more with less, would you focus on reducing the capital? Or would you try and actually increase this production target over time?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","We'll give further updates on our production targets I think at the SAM meeting. But what I would say in the meantime is we continue to want to grow our Permian business. So we are adding an additional rig in August. We expect to have a total of four additional rigs. So that's going from six currently to 10 rigs by the end of this year in the Permian. And would expect to see good performance coming from those rigs.","One of the things we've tried to do is take a measured pace, so that we preserve the productivity and the capital efficiency that we've been able to capture so far. We want to make sure we do that as we ramp up. And we feel quite confident we can do so.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","I think I've got the longest term question I've ever asked here, which is the Kazakh concession expires in 2032. Is that correct?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Yes, 2033.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","2033. Is that included in your economic assumptions as a sort of end point for the \u2013 I mean I know it's kind of crazy. But obviously if you're investing for stuff in 2022, 10 years, 11 years is not that much later in terms of the scale of the project. Are the economics that you've run assuming that the concession goes away?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Yeah. We base all of our economics and decision-making on the actual end of life of the concession. But obviously there's considerable upside I think both for the country and for the companies if we continue to progress the concession with an extension.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Thank you, Jay. Nearer term, were there any special items that we should consider in the cash flow? I asked a similar question to Exxon. That makes this an unrepresentative quarter, because obviously the cash balances right now are not even covering the dividend.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Right.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Is there anything special?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yes, I'd mention two things. I mentioned them in the official comments. One is working capital and the other is deferred tax. And on a year-to-date basis both of them are worth about $2 billion each.","From a working capital standpoint, I indicated that we expect a portion of that will reverse this year. The deferred tax impacts will also reverse. And you need to think about these as tax loss carrybacks or tax loss carryforwards. Across the world it depends on specific circumstances and specific jurisdictions what the specifics of that are. But in either case we can either take these back against prior income. Or we can carry them forward against future income.","So in our case I know for example, we will be filing for amended tax returns in 2017. So the point is that those negatives, both on working capital and deferred tax, are negatives right now, but they become positives in the future.","And so when you think about this impact, and it's pretty significant on a year-to-date basis. Again, $4 billion across the two of those.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","When you take that into account and you think about Gorgon and Wheatstone coming online and the $2 a barrel margin accretion that we gave you over the whole portfolio, our outlook on cash flow generation going forward is quite positive.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Could I just ask a quick follow-up? Sorry. The working capital effect, isn't that from prices going up during the quarter? So wouldn't it \u2013 why would it reverse if prices went further up from here?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","So I mean a part of it is inventory, part of it in this particular time just happened to be cargo timing on receivables versus payables. So we've analyzed it to quite an extent. And we're pretty comfortable saying, somewhere in the neighborhood of at least half of it will go down between now and the end of the year.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","We obviously are being impacted by lower activity and then just changes in prices and cost structures.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, Pat.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Hey, Paul.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Hey, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jay, two question in here. First, Gorgon Train 2 and 3, previously I think the expectation is that maybe a little bit sooner. Train 2 will be maybe the third quarter and Train 3 will be the first quarter 2017. And also I think that the historical data that you guys are suggesting 3 months to 6 months of the startup period or the ramp-up period. Now talking about 6 months to 8 months.","Is that being just conservative on your part? Or that there's something fundamentally when you're looking at the LNG business lead you to believe that the ramp-up period and everything, that may just take a bit longer than historically has been?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Paul, couple things. We've always said that our expectation is that Train 2 and Train 3 would start up at roughly six-month intervals. And we're pretty much still on that plan. We started up the first train in March, so we're projecting early in the fourth quarter for Train 2, and then Train 3 will follow along behind. So there's latitude in those quarters.","We are seeing very good construction progress on Train 2 and Train 3. And importantly, all the lessons, as I said, that we've learned, not only during the construction time, but in the design and all the modifications we've had to make, as we've started up Train 1, all that's been built into Train 2 as well as the actual hours to complete these projects. So we feel very encouraged by the results we're seeing. We're happy with the construction progress. We're well into commissioning of Train 2. So there it's pretty much as we expected.","As far as the ramp-up, our view has been six to eight months. We base that looking at LNG projects around the world. That's a normal ramp-up period. As I've said before, it's not so much that you're on this smooth curve from startup to full capacity. But as you start up one of these plants, there are issues that have to be dealt with. And so you have periods of downtime, as you go down to make modifications or fix some of the equipment that you have difficulty with on startup, tuning, loops, things like that. So it's really a function of the downtime. And the overall effect is a curve as you approach 100% capacity.","So we still expect that six to eight-month ramp-up period. But again with Train 2 and Train 3 and the benefit of the experiences we're gaining on Train 1 \u2013 they're identical designs \u2013 it gives us a little bit of a head start in terms of that ramp-up for the second two trains","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Second question on Tengiz future growth project. Maybe I'm wrong, but my current assumption is that if I have, say, $10 on the transportation cost, and 5% is on the price realization to Brent price, and assume a 20 \u2013 there's 18% royalty and 30% income tax, it looks like even at $80 Brent, I only get maybe less than 10% internal rate of return for the full project. I just wanted to see whether you can comment on that, whether that internally that you guys looking for a much better return. And if it's $80, why will you, say, sanction the projects?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","So I think our economics are a little bit different than yours, Paul. I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract. But we do see a better rate than what you're seeing. The transportation costs are quite good with CPC. Of course with FGP, some portion of the throughput would have to go by rail. But it's going to be within the envelope of what we've already moved by rail prior to the expansion of CPC. So we're quite comfortable with that.","When we look at Gorgon overall \u2013 or sorry, FGP overall, I think there are a couple things in terms of the economics. We have a very good understanding of this reservoir. It's largely been derisked. We've been operating it for 23 years. We have a very strong operating organization and maintenance organization there that's given us very high reliability. So between the good reservoir models and our understanding of that reservoir as well as the operation and reliability we get from the facilities, this is a very good project for us in terms of the scale and the amount of capacity it adds.","We also see that the market conditions right now are favorable and the project is ready for execution. As we've talked about, the engineering is well advanced, over 50%. The procurement is 67%. We have a very good understanding of what it's going to take to execute this project. And we've got a lot of the infrastructure already in place because effectively this builds on the infrastructure that's already in Tengiz. So we see it as a relatively low-risk project from all those factors.","In terms of the opportunities though, we see a lot of upside opportunity. We've done a great job in the past at Tengiz, and we've really got a proven track record of extracting incremental value out of the infrastructure once it's installed. If you look at SGP, for example, the second generation plant, that started up in 2008, this really tested the new technology that's being used at FGP. And since startup, we've been able to increase the capacity of that facility by 22% over nameplate, which gives us a lot of incremental capacity. FGP is actually simpler in terms of the processing facilities than SGP, and we would expect to see similar types of upside opportunity.","There's also upside when you look at the infill drilling that FGP puts in place. And FGP carries incrementally large gas handling capacity, more than what's required right now. So as the reservoir pressures continue to decline, not only does it help stabilize the platform, but we take that additional gas handling capacity and use it on existing facilities today and help handle that increase in gas\/oil ratio into the future. So there's a lot of upside benefits that are yet to come. Of course when we talked about the opportunity for contract extensions, we feel this is good for the company as well as ourselves.","Now there are other assessments out there like Wood Mac [Wood Mackenzie]. Many of you may have seen it. There's a number of areas where we see some differences in our view and their view. As I said, we have a very well-matched accurate reservoir model, history match model. We have a faster ramp-up on the project after completion. We also have a faster decline on the reservoir if we weren't doing the project than what Wood Mac is counting on. Both of those would drive value into the project. And finally, Wood Mac has almost twice as many wells in their forecast than we carry in our development plan. So those are some key differences I would point out as well as some of the upside potential we see with this project.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I wonder if I could have one for \u2013 thanks. I wonder if I could \u2013 one for Pat and one for Jay. Pat, I'm not quite sure how to ask this one, but it's a follow-up to Paul's question about deferred tax. One of your competitors, ConocoPhillips, gave some sensitivities about what the impact of deferred tax is. It's quite meaningful. They say on earnings, every $10 is like $1.5 billion on cash flow. However, up to a certain level, like $60 oil, it's about $2.5 billion for every $10. I'm guessing it's the same kind of thing you're getting at. I'm wondering if you could give some sensitivities around just exactly that issue. Because obviously the deferred tax credit back could be quite material.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Doug, it's a great question. I'm not prepared here to give you a sensitivity around it. It is one of the primary areas of exploration, I would say, as we go through our business planning cycle here over the next couple of months. It's a critical element for us to understand jurisdiction by jurisdiction what the price sensitivity is over a variety of price levels. And so it's something I don't have today, but it's something we are investigating ourselves. And in the future we'd be in a better place, off of this current business plan that we're putting together, to be able to address that question.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My guess \u2013 this is an observation. But my guess is, including myself, a lot of folks are scrambling to understand that. Because I think it could be a big delta on folks' expectations of your future cash flow.","My follow up is really for Jay. And I don't know to what extent you can answer this, Jay. But my understanding is John [Watson] was recently in New York over the last several months and was talking about the longer-term spending restrictions if you like, or the level at which he expects to see, beyond your current five-year planning horizon. And more importantly had indicated that the unconventional portfolio could really become a very large part, like 25% of the company by the middle of the next decade. I'm just wondering if you can frame that in terms of implications for additional long cycle projects, and whether my understanding of that is accurate.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","I think John's comments about unconventional becoming a larger and larger part of our company are valid. We gave you a capital range of $17 billion to $22 billion for next year. We have both TCO and expansion of our unconventional built into that number already. We're actually getting very granular in our planning of capital allocation across all the assets in the company. And making sure that that capital is flowing to where we expect to get the highest return.","Unconventional, with the de-risking that we've been able to do in \u2013 particularly in the Permian. And then the way we're using best practice in one field to spread to all the others we have \u2013 the Marcellus, the Permian, the Duvernay, Vaca Muerta \u2013 is really showing benefits right across our unconventional portfolio. And we're quite excited about the role this is going to play going forward.","As to large major capital projects, we will still have some. That's an important part of our portfolio. But we're going to take a measured approach to these. We're only going to be approving the ones that represent the best value for us. And it's going to be in balance with the other opportunities we have, as we maintain a very disciplined capital program going forward.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","To be clear, Jay, just a point of clarification. That 25% number is broadly right. But it's a global number, not a U.S. number?","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Yes.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yes.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Yes.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Folks, good morning.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Good morning, Blake.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Jay, I realize you went through the execution readiness on Tengiz. I guess my question is really around the potential for that $6.2 billion of contingency to maybe not even come in at that level. I mean I realize you're pretty well along on several fronts. But is there an opportunity to lock in costs at this point? And I guess I'm just trying to understand, is there a potential to mitigate the risk of that $6.2 billion coming to fruition?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Absolutely there's a chance to mitigate the risk. I mean what we've really tried to do is both be reasonable and as practical \u2013 realistic I should say \u2013 in our view of what contingency is required on these very large projects. And this is based on our past, but also the industry experience in executing these projects.","But then what we've tried to do is take our experience on other very large projects like Gorgon and Wheatstone, as well as projects we've done in Tengiz, and build those in. We've looked ahead and said, these are the areas that cause us difficulty on these projects. And we've tried to mitigate each one of those. And I won't go through them in detail again. They're in the slides. I've talked about them before.","But engineering represents one of the biggest challenges. And our work to advance the engineering before FID, but also advance the engineering before we start the execution. Before we cut the first steel for any of the fabrication, our models will be complete and at the 90% point, and design assurance verified before we start any of the actual fabrication work on facilities.","And we've done a tremendous amount of work on the design assurance reviews. And we're working to make sure the procurement is advanced, so that when we start the execution in the field, we know that we'll be able to move through that execution smoothly and in sequence.","We think all these brought together along with our experience in Kazakhstan is going to help us really stay focused on mitigating any use of that contingency. Contingency is expected to be used. What we're trying to do is reduce the risk and uncertainty, so that we can minimize how much of it we do have to use.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Good morning. I guess first question just around CapEx and OpEx. You've been making some good progress. And you've got these downward arrows suggesting that in the second half of the year we'll still see further progress. I'm just wondering, maybe just give us an update as perhaps where OpEx and SG&A, where the new bottom of that cost structure could get to?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","I think on the capital side, we've given you everything that we anticipate at this point in time. Right now we're sitting at the midway part of the year, trending on, yeah, $25 billion sort of range. We think that's where we could end, possibly a little bit lower than that. We're actually trending on $24 billion at the 6-month mark, but we're thinking $25 billion might be \u2013 sorry. $24 billion may be where we end the year. So somewhere between $24 billion and $25 billion I think is the appropriate level for you to think about.","And then in terms of 2017 and 2018, we've given you the range there of the $17 billion to $22 billion. But obviously we need to be market responsive. And so right now we're thinking it's towards the lower end of that range. And if in fact the market doesn't move prices anywhere off of where they are today, we'll probably be lower than that. Or certainly at the very low end of that range.","So that's as much guidance as I can give you on capital at the moment. We're rolling up the business plans. And we'll have more to say as we get towards the end of the year.","On operating expense our target really \u2013 we came down on operating expense $2 billion between 2014 and 2015. And our target is to come down another $2 billion between 2015 and 2016.","We have a number of organizational impacts that have occurred through the first half of this year, but there will be more that will come in the second half of this year. And we also continue to work through the supply chain. We've got another set of targets internally for continued effort to reduce costs through the supply chain.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then a question for Jay. One of the criticisms I guess with the majors, which you addressed in slide 12 on the Permian, is the relative costs and the EURs. I mean you have \u2013 I think last year at the Analyst Day, what did I see? It was $7.1 million. And now you're talking about some of the average wells in some of the plays being $5.6 million.","And your EURs I think at the Analyst Day were I guess 960 million [BOE] in the Delaware and 850 million [BOE] in the Midland. But obviously the purer plays who've been able to I guess get out on the front foot in terms of press releases are doing a lot of work with completion technology to boost EUR.","So maybe just give us some color as to how you see your competitive positioning relative to I guess a lot of the people who are just the other side of the gate? And even in some of the same wells as you?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","I think we're now fully competitive with these other players. And we may not be flashy, but we're steady.","We have taken all these learnings in. We've been very methodical in our approach and very systematic. Our goal as I said before is to be fully competitive on an operating basis, so that when you add in the advantaged royalty position, it gives us a clear incremental value proposition over competitors.","We'll continue to stay focused on this. And as I said we're ramping up the number of company operated rigs. But we're going to do so in a manner that allows us to maintain those efficiencies.","The one other thing I'd say is that our current view is that we're building infrastructure into some of these initial development projects. And as that infrastructure comes into play, it provides a solid foundation for us to continue to incrementally improve economics as we move forward.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question please.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, everybody.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Good morning.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Pat, a few of your competitors recently committed to new capital management plans and performance metrics, by which they plan to be held accountable in the future. And on this point you guys have had a pathway to improve returns in your materials for a few quarters now. And you've clearly made progress on the cost side based on today's results in I think it was Slide 18 or so.","So my question is, if oil prices and financial performance recover in 2016 and 2017, can you envision a scenario whereby your financial priorities might shift for an intermediate term period? Let's say a return of capital to shareholders having greater priority than spending for instance. Or do you feel that between the cyclical timing and the low costs that we have today and the quality of your portfolio, that higher spending would almost surely be in the best interest of shareholders? So the question is about how you weigh these different financial options in the recovery scenario?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Doug, we've had the same financial priorities for a long period of time. Dividend return to shareholders being first, and then reinvestment in the business second, and then having a prudent financial structure being third. And I don't see those priorities changing going forward.","We're going to obviously work to balance those priorities under the circumstances that are presented to us.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Sure.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","I do think \u2013 I don't see that there's significant \u2013 see any increases coming for us. I think we're going to increase our dividend when cash flow permits it. We're going to make the investment profile that we've talked about, where we're moving to shorter cycle, higher return projects. And not as many of the long duration lower return projects. FGP\/WPMP is the only significant project that we have taken FID.","We do see additional major capital projects in our future. But they're not going to come with the same pace that we have had most recently here. We want to be much more ratable and predictable in our capital program. And we are going to have to take some of the cash that we're generating in the future and use it to restore our balance sheet","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Sure. So thanks for the clarity and the update.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Doug.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Okay. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to get an update on two areas of disrupted production. First is the Neutral Zone, and the second is Nigeria, recognizing the latter could have some sensitivities. What update can you provide on the return to production?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","So in the Partitioned Zone, this is really an issue between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. They continue to engage to work this forward.","Our view is that we would like to see a return to production. That's what we advocate. But in the meantime what we've done are two things. We've tried to bring all the preservation work and maintain the field in a state of readiness, so it can be restarted. We've also done quite a bit of work to understand and use the opportunity with our technical people to model the entire field and look for efficiencies that we can build into this field when it restarts. And we've been quite successful in some of the planning that we'd have for the restart. We've also been bringing our cost structures down. And there will be more of that to come as this continues forward.","In terms of Nigeria, this is an area where we've operated for a long time. There are some issues there. The government is working these issues. Our priority is on protecting people and making sure that we protect our operations. But I really won't say too much more about it, other than this is an issue that continues to be addressed by the government","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And if I can ask a quick follow-up here. Pat, on your comments on return of capital. For the last two decades to three decades you've raised the dividend every year. Are you still on track to do that in 2016? And just if you can comment on the broader strategy around dividend growth?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Right. What I can say is that we're fully aware of the 28-year annual dividend payment increase. We're also fully aware that an increase needs to occur in 2016 if we are to keep that pattern alive. The board fully understands the value of the dividend increase and they understand the value of growing the dividend over time. So the board will be looking at cash generation and our ability from a sustainable sense to support a higher dividend going forward.","I guess I would just reiterate. We do see our cash flow circumstance improving over time here. We've got the confidence in our future growth, in production. We've got confidence in our future cash generation. I'll take you back to the $2 per barrel margin increase that we showed at the security Analyst Day on the portfolio. Assuming flat commodity prices, that's the margin accretion that we get out of these LNG projects predominantly. It raises the cash margin on the entire portfolio. And we also believe that we can compete very successfully and sustainably over time here with a much lower capital program because we've got assets, for example, like the Permian and other unconventionals. So we feel very comfortable about what our future holds.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks very much, Neil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. I guess good afternoon, everybody.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Hi, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Jay, maybe a follow up on Paul's prior question on Tengiz. It really gets to this concern that it's a lower return project, given future lease expiry or otherwise. I'm not really asking for confidential terms. But can you share any expected project return at sanction? Or how it compared to other projects, while gating in the portfolio even maybe by tier?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","I can't really get into divulging our economics and our view of it other than to say we have been very disciplined in our capital. We're putting that capital where we believe it's going to give us a good return.","We look at a lot of things when we consider the performance of a project. And part of it is the risk we're taking on as well as the potential for additional upside to be gained, and I talked about those earlier. Ultimately, the economic value of this project will be a function of the prices realized over the period of time between now and the end of the concession. But we're taking a lot of steps to make sure that we're building as much value into this as we can. We see it as an attractive project.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, maybe just a brief follow-up if I could. What is the percentage of total project financing targeted here, just to help better understand what the future cash flow, at least out the door, look like?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","The financing is really in place as an assist. The entire project is not being funded by the financing. We have a combination of co-lending, we have a bank facility, and we have the bond issuance. So that combination coupled with the cash generation of TCO, which is actually quite strong, should provide sufficient funding for the project as well as ongoing value to the shareholders.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. I appreciate it, guys.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks, maybe one follow-up on the Permian. You have a chart there on the slides, which I think is again relative to the Analyst Day presentation, showing the multiyear outlook for growth in the Permian. If you think about the assumptions that are in that chart, both in terms of activity levels and well performance, how would you say that things are trending in the basin right now relative to your assumptions there? Are the wells performing better than assumed in the base case there, activity levels similar? And where would the bias be? Is there an upwards or downward bias do you think for that multiyear outlook?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","So you can see the red line shows where we actually are relative to that view, and we're on plan with the initial growth there. And as we said, we saw over 20% growth in the Permian relative to last year. Now that's done even with less rigs. We're running about the same number of rigs we expected on the company side. Our non-operated rigs are actually less. But we're actually accomplishing our objectives with fewer rigs. We're going to be going from six rigs to 10 rigs by the end of this year. So we're staffing up and ramping up our activity level. I would say the bias on this is upward going forward.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then maybe if I could switch gears to the Gulf of Mexico, you've had a number of different projects in various stages of appraisal or development there. Any thoughts on how those resources are shaking up where the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 how you see those types of projects stacking up potentially within your portfolio going forward?","And maybe one specific one, one of your partners that was in the joint development project I think for Tiber-Guadalupe-Gibson and those recently impaired leases in those fields, is that project still on plan going forward, or is that one that you guys may be walking away from?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","So I think of the projects in two categories. We've got an existing set of deepwater projects that are already in operation in the Gulf of Mexico, and they are very profitable. And more than that, they provide a good platform for additional investment, as we talked about earlier in the presentation.","Going forward, the key really is getting our development cost down, and we're very focused on doing that in a couple of ways. Our deepwater drilling has improved fairly substantially. If you look at just in the last year or so, we've seen 30% faster drilling rates in the deepwater. And with the cost of rigs, that has a big impact. As we move forward, we expect to see our rig costs go down as well as the rates of drilling progress go up.","We're also looking at the facilities and getting them right-sized. What I mean by that is rather than chasing for peak production, for example, we may go with smaller facilities that have a longer plateau of production, higher capital efficiency. So as we look at driving the cost per barrel and the development costs down, I think that's what's going to be required for new projects to be competitive with other opportunities in our portfolio.","Once these projects are on, they have relatively low operating costs. We get good margins out of them. It's just the time between the initial exploration program and development wells and ultimately the production that burdens these projects from an overall financial return standpoint.","In terms of the Tiber that you asked about, this project is still under assessment. I really don't really want to comment too much further, but we're evaluating it. There may be some additional appraisal work to do, and then we'll be putting that against some of the other opportunities that we have.","We do think the deepwater represents a good resource base, and it is important for meeting global demand in the future. So we think production from this area will continue. But as I said, our focus is on driving those development costs down so that these projects are competitive with other opportunities in the portfolio.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Ryan.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Good morning.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess just a quick kind of follow-up on the CapEx side. So looked like you're going to underspend this year potentially, at least on track for it. And you think about the guidance for $17 billion to $22 billion over the next couple years. Should we think about the benefits this year are something that are transitory? Or something that are looking a little more permanent? And then maybe either get more for $17 billion to $22 billion? Or you can potentially underspend $17 billion to $22 billion as we think about the next 3 years?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Roger, I think one of the primary drivers in moving from the 2016 circumstance to 2017 and beyond is the trailing off of these projects under construction. I mean just the LNG projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone, for example. I mean that is a significant reason behind the drop-off in the capital spending between the years.","But also going forward, as we've talked about the portfolio shift that we have, where we have a lot more of our future investment coming forward in this shorter cycle Permian based activity, as opposed to the long cycle and large duration major capital projects, that's really what drives the change in the absolute level of spending.","We've made a commitment as well. There's an affordability component here. We've made a commitment as well to get cash balanced in 2017. And because of the opportunity that we've got both in the brownfield extensions as well as in the Permian unconventional like activity, we believe we've got a very competitive capital program at a $17 billion range. So I think of it as being a sustainable sort of capital level under prices that we have today.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right, I understood sustainability. I was more just trying to understand of \u2013 is the fact that you're tracking under the $25 billion due I guess more to the large projects that do come to an end? Or are you seeing an actual improvement in sort of underlying spending, service costs, equipment costs, whatever they are? Trying to think about it, is $17 billion to $22 billion, should it really be maybe $15.5 billion to, say, $20 billion, or something like that?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Building on what Pat said...","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","On an apples-to-apples comparison.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yes.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Yes, building on what Pat said, I think there's a lot of things that drive capital spending. And it can be everything from our current price environment to foreign exchange rates.","But what we've really focused on in this near term have been two things. One is driving down the pricing from our vendors and contractors. That's probably more transitory. But we've also been very focused on building efficiency in how we conduct our operations. And we've talked about that in previous calls and at the SAM meeting. That work continues across the business. And as we drive more and more efficiency into our spend, we own that. We'll be able to retain that going forward.","I think the other big area for us is improving the execution of projects. And it's partly doing things better internally. And I've talked about what those things are. They're on that slide. But it's also taking advantage of market conditions like we're in now, where we can get the best yards working on our projects. We're not competing for yard resources and contractor capabilities. We can get the A team on these projects. And that really helps us execute better. And that's sustainable through this period.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please?","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Hi, Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, everyone.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Hi.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I know we're past the top of the hour, so I'll keep it short. I was just curious on the impairment commentary in the prepared remarks, I think weaker reservoir performance was mentioned. Obviously we're all used to seeing price related impairments at this point. But I was curious if you could put a finer point on what assets that related to? Is it all legacy stuff? Or is it anything from major projects over the past few years?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. I mean there were multiple assets involved. But the largest single contributor here was Papa-Terra in Brazil.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Yeah. So Papa-Terra is one where we've been disappointed in the performance of this asset. We have gone ahead and seconded a number of our Chevron people into the operators' team. We're working with the operator to determine not only what is happening with the reservoir, but also where we go from here. So we'll give you more update at some point in the future. But at this point in time it's largely around Papa-Terra and the performance.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Patricia Yarrington","Okay, thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Bruce Niemeyer, Vice President Mid-Continent Business Unit; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations.","We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","I'll begin with a recap of our third quarter 2016 financial and operational results, and then Bruce will provide an update on our Permian Basin business prior to my concluding remarks.","Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $1.3 billion or $0.68 per diluted share. Third quarter results included $290 million and special items related to a deferred tax benefit from the U.K. tax rate change and the receipt of an Ecuador arbitration award. Excluding these special items, as well as the positive impact from foreign exchange effects of $72 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $921 million or $0.49 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the Appendix to this presentation.","Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.3 billion and our debt ratio at quarter end was 23.7%. Our net debt ratio was approximately 20%. During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.08 per share payable to stockholders of record as of November 18, 2016. Our annual per share payout for 2016 will be $4.29 per share and represents the 29th consecutive year of growth in the annual per share payout. We currently yield 4.3%.","Turning to Slide 4, cash generated from operations was $5.3 billion during the third quarter and $9 billion year-to-date. Year-to-date working capital effects of $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion in deferred tax items; for example, those associated with tax loss positions reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are timing effects. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $800 million in the third quarter including the sale of selected Gulf of Mexico assets. These transactions had a minimal impact on earnings in the quarter. Year-to-date asset sale proceeds are $2.2 billion.","We continue to pursue a number of potential transactions and we remain confident that we can achieve our $5 billion to $10 billion for total proceeds over this year and next. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion from the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date cash investment outlays have totaled approximately $14 billion. During the quarter, we advanced $2 billion to Tengizchevroil or TCO in support of the FGP project. This outflow is reflected in our cash flow statement as a borrowing by equity affiliates. The first co-lending tranche provides sufficient funding as the project commences. Future advances are expected and the timing will be dependent upon oil prices, TCO's internal cash generation, and the project pace of investment. At quarter-end, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.7 billion and our net debt position was $37.9 billion.","Turning now to Slide 5; Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2016 results were $754 million, lower than third quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the deferred tax benefit related to the U.K. tax rate change, the award of an Ecuador arbitration claim, and the absence of third quarter 2015 assets impairments increased earnings by $535 million between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by $322 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange were largely flat between quarters as lower crude realizations were offset by lower operating expenses and favorable tax impacts. Downstream results, excluding special items and FX decreased by $1 billion, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins and lower earnings from CP Chem.","Turning now to Slide 6; here I'll compare results for the third quarter of 2016 with the second quarter of 2016. Third quarter results were approximately $2.8 billion higher than the second quarter. The absence of second quarter 2016 charges associated with special items, and the inclusion of third quarter gains from special items increased earnings by $2.7 billion between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $200 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange were comparable between quarters, in line with relatively flat rent prices. Lower operational expenses offset essentially by lower listings and adverse tax impacts. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange were higher by $255 million, primarily resulting from the absence of unfavorable second quarter inventory valuation effects. Prices were generally rising during the second quarter but relatively flat during the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 7; here we compare the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter of 2016 and third quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 26,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 77,000 barrels a day as ramp ups continued at Gorgon Jack \/ St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG. About half of this bar is Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, with all shale and tight basins reflecting year-on-year growth. More than half of this bar is Permian production. Our base business decline was 66,000 barrels per day. Production from new wells and other Brownfield investments in the base added 39,000 barrels per day and helped hold the overall basic decline rate to less than 2%.","The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 47,000 barrels per day. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 27,000 barrels per day, mainly due to security issues in Nigeria. Our planned turnaround activity was heavier than this time last year resulting in a decrease of 26,000 barrels per day, the most significant of which was the TCO as we completed the turnaround of the second generation plant. Based on nine months of actuals and our forecast for the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year 2016 production will be approximately 2.6 million barrels per day.","Turning now to Slide 8; as we indicated on the second quarter call, we expect to exit the year with December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day or growth in the range of 150,000 barrels per day from the third quarter average. A major contributor as previously discussed is TCO's return to production on September 9 following the largest planned turnaround in its history, ahead of schedule, under budget, and without serious incidents or injuries. Over the course of six weeks, maintenance was conducted on more than 500 pieces of equipment. At its peak, over 8,800 employees and contractors were onsite for the turnaround. The team work proactively with over 30 contract companies on all stages of planning, preparation, and execution. This was a large undertaking that was exceptionally well executed.","The second contributor to volume growth in December is the ramp up of our LNG projects, notably Gorgon. At Gorgon Train 1 production is stable, and Train 2 is now online. At Angola LNG, the plant reached a rate of approximately 5 million tons per year of LNG. Production has been suspended while minor modifications to reach full capacity are completed. Short duration shutdowns are often experienced as facilities ramped up to their full capacity. ALNG expects to restart the plant within the next couple of weeks and will continue to ramp up and fine tune the system. Since the initial restart earlier this year, they have shipped 8 LNG cargos and 16 LPG cargos. In addition to LNG volume increases, we achieved first production from Bangka in August, and expect first production from Alder before year-end. We also expect continued growth in our unconventional and from our base business investments.","Turning now to Slide 9; at Gorgon, total Train 1 LNG production has been stable at an average rate of 110,000 barrels per day which is about 5 million tons per year. We are also producing about 6,700 barrels per day of condensates. As mentioned, Train 2 is running and producing LNG. Production is expected to ramp up over the coming months. We have shipped 17 cargos to-date, and with both Trains now running, we expect to ship an average of two to three cargos per week. Construction on Train 3 is progressing very well, and we expect first LNG in the second quarter of 2017. At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. We are leveraging our experience from Gorgon, and are pleased with our progress. Our modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are now onsite and the installation of piping, electrical, and instrumentation continue as planned. As we have foreshadowed, the delay in module delivery at Wheatstone has impacted project cost relative to the original 2011 estimate. We now forecast the total project cost at completion to be $34 billion.","Chevron share of the cost to complete the project is included in the $17 billion to $22 billion capital guidance range that we have previously communicated for the 2017 to 2018 years.","Bruce will now provide an update on our activities in the Permian. Bruce?","Bruce Niemeyer","Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 10, as we have shared previously, Chevron enjoys a very strong acreage position in the Permian Basin. Our acreage is extensive, covering about 2 million acres. We have major holdings in the best basin locations and enjoy a significant royalty advantage over our competitors. Our strategy in the Permian is centered on building a large-scale asset that delivers strong returns and generates free cash flow. To accomplish this we have implemented a well factory modeled at the most -- modeled after the most efficient short cycle operations in Chevron and in industry.","The goal of this factory is to create repeatable high value outcomes at sufficient scale that our material for Chevron. Decisions around many key design elements are consistently implemented, not only the obvious ones such as horizontal lateral length, well spacing and completion parameters, but also hundreds of other decisions that we face on a routine basis for which we want consistent outcomes. As we have identified and verify improvements, they are quickly implemented into our basis of design. Our pace has been intentionally deliberate to allow us to incorporate the learnings and experience from our own work and that of the industry. The result is a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the outcomes we expect, our results are competitive and continue to improve.","Turning the Slide 11; you can see Chevrons acreage position in more detail. This slide is a map of the Permian Basin, inclusive of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our 2 million acres are depicted in blue, 1.5 million of which are in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Also depicted on the map are active Chevron operated developments in blue and are non-operated development areas in purple. We believe the quality of our acreage position is exceptional with multiple stacked geologic targets. Today we estimate that almost 600,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 per acre. We have an additional $350,000 acres with a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre.","The balance of our acreage is a mix; some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation, some lacks nearby infrastructure and some requires further appraisal. These estimates are snapshot that assumes a simultaneous development, a flat $50 WTI price, and are burdened with all development and production costs as we see them today. We're active in several company operated and non-operated joint venture development areas. We're currently running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage. We're standing up on our ninth rig as we speak, and expect to be at ten by the end of the year. Another ten rigs are currently drilling our non-operated development areas. We prioritize development areas by value which considers expected ultimate recovery, cost of development, oil gas split, availability of surface infrastructure, and our overall certainty of outcome.","Turning to Slide 12; to achieve strong returns we focus on all elements necessary to generate cash flow; capital efficiency, operating expense, and product realizations. The graph in the upper right corner shows development cost per barrel which in our view is the ultimate measure of capital performance as it incorporates all sub metrics. We have achieved a 30% development cost reduction from 2015, fully inclusive of drilling, completions, facilities, and associated G&A. We've accomplished this through a focus on improving expected ultimate recovery, driving execution efficiencies and implementing supply chain savings. This is delivering capital performance that is competitive with the operators of our joint ventures. The trend of improvement is mirrored in our overall unit operating expense; the lower right graph reflects both the downward trend and competitive performance of our direct lease operating expense, and illustrates a significant reduction of 45% from 2015.","Our lease operating expense includes all costs required to operate a well and its associated facilities during its life. We expect these wells to produce for decades. So attention to operating efficiency unlocks value. Additionally, G&A which is not included in the graph on the lower right, is a component of overall operating expense. Our year-to-date G&A is $3.50 a barrel, declining through the year and more than 20% from 2015. The third critical aspect of cash flow is product realizations. We've leveraged the scale of our core positions to systematically secure cost-effective priority access through the entire crude and gas value chain, rather than simply selling production at the well-head. Because of this we have options available to respond to changing market and industry conditions.","Turning to Slide 13; we expect activity and production from the Permian to grow through the end of the decade. As we discussed in our Analyst Day last March, by the end of 2020, Chevron's Permian shale and tight production is expected to reach 250,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. As you can see on the chart, we have initiated this growth. Production continues to track ahead of expectations and is 24% higher than third quarter 2015. We continually monitor our performance and have the option to adjust the pace of our growth as needed, to optimize value from this asset. While growing production is important, we're focused on expanding margins by increasing efficiencies in our operations and on capturing maximum value from the resource base. We believe we're well positioned to make the Permian a legacy asset with strong returns and free cash flow.","Now I'll hand it back to Pat to discuss spend reductions. Pat?","Patricia Yarrington","Okay, thank you, Bruce. Now on Slide 14; we continue to reduce our spend. You can see on the charts the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflows to be down more than $12 billion or more than 20% from 2015. We expect to meet, if not exceed the commitment we made earlier in the year to have 2016 operating expenses come in $2 billion lower than 2015. And our C&E is trending below the guidance range, previously provided for this year. We will likely end the year below $25 billion in capital outlays, in fact potentially coming in closer to $24 billion. This is a tremendous amount of progress in a relatively short 24-month period of time to reset these key financial parameters consistent with a lower for longer price environment.","Turning to Slide 15, I'd like to close with just a couple of points. First, our financial priorities have not changed, sustaining and growing the dividend is our first priority. The increase this quarter demonstrates that commitment which is underpinned by confidence in our future earnings and cash flow growth. Second, we are beginning to see evidence of that cash flow growth, notably now that Gorgon Train 1 is operating well, and Train 2 is successfully online, and with Gorgon's Train 3 and Wheatstone's Trains 1 and 2 planned to come on in fairly rapid succession over the next five quarters. We have approximately 85% of the production from these five trains sold under long-term contracts, and at today's contractual LNG prices, this represents a significant revenue and cash margin boost. Third, we have successfully transitioned to a lower price environment. Of course we are not resting on these recent accomplishments, we will continue to look for opportunities to improve cost and capital efficiency.","We are poised to be a very resilient competitor in a low price world, our Permian assets they speaks directly to this. Here we have an abundance of riches in terms of the physical asset base and we are successfully demonstrating the ability to develop this resource in a highly capital-efficient, returns focused manner. With cost coming down with C&E and capital intensity coming down with our major LNG projects and the Permian production coming online to boost cash margins and production, our overall financial picture is set to improve in a meaningful way as we move into 2017. Our objective is to get cash balance in 2017 assuming $50 Brent prices. All of these improvements I've just noted, as well as targeted asset sales where we can transact for value are key components supporting that objective.","So this concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue and try to limit yourself to one question or perhaps one follow-up if necessary, we'll certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered.","So Jonathan, could you open the lines, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason gamble from Jefferies. Your question please?","Jason Gammel","Thanks very much everyone. And thanks especially for the incremental disclosure on the Permian, I'd like to direct my question there. Bruce, you mentioned that the finding and development cost was probably one of the most important metrics that you have in the basin. Can you talk about how you are benchmarking yourself against some of the E&P companies in the basin and how you think that might improve as you get your infrastructure into place?","Bruce Niemeyer","Thanks for the question, Jason. On Slide 12, we showed finding and development cost per barrel. The lighter bars are the Chevron operated activity, and the darker bars are those of our and NOJV competitors where we also invest. The -- that is our best direct benchmarking comparison because we invest in the wells and we're able to see the full value chain that is created. We are able to address the issues directly at financial performance that aren't often available from a less complete dataset. I suppose there is a narrative that a company of our size can't be competitive but in the case of Chevron, we are. The NOJV partners that are listed on this chart are some of the best in the basin, and you can see on the chart that our performance today is competitive and improving.","Jason Gammel","That's great. If just as a follow-up, can you maybe address the pace of development that you think you could achieve? I recognize that you've got your projection of volumes through 2020 but with such huge acreage position, what type of rig program do you think you could ultimately apply in the basin? And then I suppose the other question there would be, just given the position you have, would you maybe consider monetizing some of the position through acreage sales or through joint ventures?","Bruce Niemeyer","Let me start with pace first. So we are already growing; as I noted, we've initiated the growth, in fact we've added five rigs over essentially the second half of 2016. That's the pace of rig additions of about one rig a month. Productions grown from the third quarter of last year by 24% further supporting the notion that we're growing. And our pace and rate of indications [ph] are intentional. Again, we're focused on returns -- I don't feel capital limited in the Permian Basin, and our additions are targeted to ensure that we're getting the outcomes we intend and that are supportive of high returns and eventually generate -- generating free cash flow. We do expect to grow, as you noted you can see that on the Slide 13. And as we go forward, we have options; we continually monitor our performance and we adjust.","Patricia Yarrington","And Jason, let me just add a thought to that. As you know, we have had a practice when we have had pieces of our portfolio where we felt there wasn't a longer term strategic value or it felt others could -- would offer more value for us and it would obtain in our portfolio, we've been willing to make asset sales and we've had a very routine practice of asset sells over a long number of years here. I think the key to getting to that point in the decision process though is having a really good understanding of the value of the asset. And in the Permian Basin, there has been a great deal of fluidity in that valuation over the last couple of years. There's been a great deal of additional appraisal and evaluation work, and there's been a great deal of greater understanding but there still has been significant movement. In some cases pieces of property have moved up by a factor of 10,000 fold. And that's the kind of thing that you would not want to get on the wrong side of -- if in your haste to make a decision about selling an asset.","So our process will be to try to do a valuation an appraisal work -- get a really good understanding of what this asset valuation is, and to the extent that we don't find it fitting into our longer term development plan, than -- that of course we would look to other monetization options.","Bruce Niemeyer","Thanks, Jason.","Jason Gammel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please?","Paul Sankey","Good morning, everyone. Thanks. A follow-up for Bruce on the Permian. How much do you guys spending there annually? Could you give us an idea of the level of CapEx and the outlook for CapEx?","Bruce Niemeyer","Yes, Paul. We're spending presently in the area of about $1.5 billion annually, across both the company-operated and our non-operative joint venture programs.","Paul Sankey","So the outlook for that is flat is it or is that going to go up?","Bruce Niemeyer","I would expect it to go up. The -- at our current pace we're delivering a growth profile, you can see on Slide 13 what we shared at the Analyst Day last March in terms of production growth and there will be some growing activity that would support that. We are continually getting more efficient and so the -- the capital invested that we expect going forward will be more efficient as kind of reflected by the finding and development cost trend that we showed on Slide 12.","Paul Sankey","Understood. So if I look at the Tengiz expansion, you are spending -- previously in September you had said $18 per BOE of development cost for I think a $36 billion investment. Why would you be spending so much less in the Permian at what I think looks like a $10 F&D cost per barrel? Maybe that one is for Pat.","Patricia Yarrington","Yes, it is. So Paul, just a couple of things; I mean if you go back to Slide 13 here, I think we have said that -- and we said this back in the same and throughout the year here that we could see that top like -- the top end of that light blue portion of the profile there would result in approximately a doubling of our current activity levels. And so we're spending 1.5 here, you can see us potentially doubling that, and that is kind of the current view that we have but again, this is an area that we'll update you when we get to the March Security Analyst Meeting.","In reference to FGP, the Future Growth Project and -- I think you know it's important to know that we are funding both of these projects, both the Permian fully and FGP. We think of these projects -- these areas as being absolutely critical growth areas for us. So we're not starving the Permian because we've taken on FGP. I think what people often miss around FGP is that there would be a tremendous loss of value if we didn't go forward with the well-head pressure management project because the field would go into decline, it would be in serious decline and that would be loss of value in the legacy asset. We're doing FGP and WPMP together because of synergies that's a joint development concept, and there is a lot of upside that has not been kind of built-in to a lot of people's models, I guess I would say about FGP that relate to the debottlenecking, what we've been able to demonstrate in the past -- we hope to be able to do on a go forward basis.","There is additional gas handling facilities built in here that will overtime allow greater oil production, contingencies we've talked through about being kind of fully contingent, even though we're at 50% of engineering when we took FIB. And then of course down the road, obviously we hope that this turns into concession extension. So there is a lot of potential upside to FGP, I think Jay did a great job on our second quarter call in kind of running through all of those parameters.","Paul Sankey","Got it. So what you are saying is the $18 is a very conservative -- $18 per barrel development cost is a very conservative number and it would be competitive with the Permian ultimately when all of these things are considered?","Patricia Yarrington","We think we need both assets in our portfolio, yes.","Paul Sankey","Thank you, Pat.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please?","Paul Cheng","Good morning. Two questions if I could. Bruce on the -- what is the recovery rate that you use to get to that 9 billion barrel? Are you just saying 10%, 12% -- what do you expect and foresee that recovery rate may change over the next, say five years?","Bruce Niemeyer","Yes. So the 9 billion barrels is from a portion of our acreage that is currently highly characterized, it varies by horizon and by area in the basin, be it Midland or Delaware Basin; recoveries are generally single digit and we know that in a basin were to play at the state of maturity there is a lot of upside potential. We have a technology organization that's working hard every day to take the first stage of development and improve upon it, much as we have in other asset classes that we operate in and are more mature.","Paul Cheng","Will you be willing to give in what the forecast -- what that recovery rate may look like in five years?","Bruce Niemeyer","No, not at this point.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Pat, a second question then on Wheatstone, you're talking about the cost increase. Given the lower Australian dollar and supposedly weaker labor market which has translated into better productivities; can you elaborate a little bit more on what's causing the cost increase?","Patricia Yarrington","Sure, Paul. As I said, we're now expecting a $34 billion total project cost. So that's up about $5 billion from the original AR. That original appropriation request was taken in 2011 and as you can all appreciate, the first few years of construction there was in a much more heated market. But we've talked in the past about our late module delivery, and this really was one of the primary drivers behind the cost increase. They were delayed due to poor performance at one of the fabricating yard, it came to be that the contractor was unable to effectively manage the size and the scale of the work scope that we had given that particular contractor. So we recognized that somewhat early on and we did end up redirecting some of the work to other yards, but even so, modules were late.","A second factor that I would comment on is really an underestimation of the quantity of materials that were required. At the time we took FID on Wheatstone, we had -- engineering was at about 15% complete and so the rest was based on rules of thumb and factors. As we matured, the engineering definition -- the definition -- the amount of quantities needed increased substantially, and so that really was a secondary reason behind the cost increase. I would say the second element was something that we had seen on Gorgon as well, and it is one of the primary areas where we are trying to improve our project execution going forward. As you know we had FGP when we took FID on FGP, we were at about nearly a 50% engineering level. So this is one of the primary improvement practices that we're putting in place for future projects.","Paul Cheng","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Your question please?","Phil Gresh","Good morning. Bruce, you had made a comment on one of the earlier questions about free cash flow focus and I'm just kind of wondering if you take together what you've said about capital spending and the production outlook; when would you expect the Permian to become free cash flow positive? And how do you think about some of the assets in the Permian that might need some more material infrastructure spending? Is that something that you guys are really willing to spend a lot of money on in the next few years or are you more focused on kind of more immediate cash flow?","Bruce Niemeyer","Thanks for the question Phil. We'll provide more color and specifics in the Analyst Day next March. We do have internal projections on when the overall program reaches free cash flow, and that obviously depends on a number of factors including the trajectory that we pursue and I'll remind you again, we have many options to adjust based on the results that we see. We do have an integrated approach where we not only connect the upstream activity that we're engaged in drilling and completing wells, but pair that with midstream activity to move our product to the market centers that we choose. We typically engage in that through commercial transactions; it's a very competitive basin, there is a lot of companies that operate in that space. We typically deploy our capital in the areas where we can differentiate our performance and drilling and completions, and then working with high quality third-party suppliers, look to them to move the crude to market, operate the gas processing and NGL fractionation activities.","Phil Gresh","Okay, got it, thanks. And then my follow-up -- I guess maybe this would be best for Pat, kind of following on what Paul was asking about $10 F&D in the Permian, $18 for Tengiz. Where would you say -- as you're assessing the deepwater opportunities in the portfolio, particularly the brownfield side of things; how would that stack up at this stage as costs continue to come down?","Patricia Yarrington","Brownfield would be very good. Greenfield would be a little bit more challenge but brownfield would be very good.","Phil Gresh","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please?","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Pat and Bruce and Frank, I am not sure who wants to take this one -- but I guess that Chevron has always been a company led by large-scale major project developments, explorations, and so on. And I guess what I am really trying to understand here is what are the limiting factors on the Permian given its flexibility, lower execution risk, the absence of the cost issues you've have had and things like Gorgon and Wheatstone. I guess what I'm asking is -- is the Permian big enough to drive a much more meaningful strategic shift and how it allocates -- Chevron allocates capital longer-term? Is that what we're looking at here?","Patricia Yarrington","I think best if I take that one here, Doug. I think when you have such an extraordinary asset base in the Permian, when it has as much kind of depth and breadth to it and I don't mean that in a literal sense but a figurative sense. Such huge economic strength, everything in the portfolio really needs to be judged against those options. And so when I think about -- we don't believe we want to be just a single asset class company; so we have great strategic capabilities and basin positions in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, we have the Tengiz project that we talked about, we have the LNG project. So we have pretty broad-based portfolio over here and we're not looking to take all activity down to the Permian.","But the value of the Permian and its tremendous economic capability and its capital efficiency, its great flexibility, its short-cycle high-return attributes does make other parts of the portfolio have to compete for capital against that. So I think it raises the bar on where that incremental but the dollar is going to go and I think Permian will get the first call but we will manage it as a portfolio, and overtime you should still expect us to have some significant other projects but we can pace those projects quite nicely I think and match against -- always coming back to and matching against the opportunities the Permian provides for us.","Doug Leggate","So is it pretty simply, Pat, the Permian is going to take market share from the rest of your portfolio, is that a good way of thinking about it?","Patricia Yarrington","I think that's reasonable within limits. I think that's reasonable, yes. And we'll go through more of this in the Security Analyst Meeting, we'll go through more of this in March because I think that's really where it's the appropriate time to lay out on portfolio.","Doug Leggate","And I guess a related question my follow-up is; there has been -- we haven't talked much about disposals and I guess in a couple quarters. I am guessing a high grading exercise, if you want to call it that way, the Permian changes the map a little bit in terms of what competes for capital. There has been some speculation around Bangladesh which is sizable obviously, I think you have talked about that publicly. Can you just give us an update as to where you see the changing map on disposals, both in scale and perhaps any identified assets that have changed since the Analyst Day?","Patricia Yarrington","Yes. We really haven't changed our view -- I mean we look at asset sales when we can get good value, that's first and foremost; not strategic or we don't see kind of the compelling relationship within the Chevron portfolio. We've announced certain assets for sale and we've put a list out in the second quarter there; the list essentially is the same, I can't confirm that there are commercial discussions going on in and around Bangladesh. But I'll go back to the primary element here which is, we want to get good value. And so on any of these transactions that we've sort of queued up and are beginning to have people into data rooms, either in an early round or a secondary round -- if in fact we don't get the value proposition that we're seeking, then we'll just move on.","Doug Leggate","Thanks very much.","Bruce Niemeyer","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please?","Ed Westlake","Yes, good morning. So that Slide 12 is great, and shows how you've made improvement. I mean I guess you're still a little bit above the development cost of the non-operated JV partners, maybe is that geographical, is there some different ways that you approach the business? So just maybe some color on that.","Bruce Niemeyer","Sure, Ed. We're providing you on this chart quarterly data and it's an aggregation of everything that was completed in that particular quarter, and you're right to suspect that there is a little portfolio aspect to what goes on in any particular quarter. We have operations in both the Midland and Delaware basin on the company operated side, and on the NOJV side as well. And the mix of activity in any particular quarter is going to cause those bars to be up and down a little bit. If we had the fourth quarter of 2015, you'd see two quarters where the company operated bars are a little lower and the last two quarters whether the NOJV bars are a little lower. But we would look internally in a much finer level of detail. Wolfcamp B wells in the Central Midland Basin, mile and a half laterals and ROE comparable in that activity or not and what do we address about that.","So the overall performance is competitive and I will tell you that there is a competitive group, there is a lead pack in the Permian, and we're a part of that. And I think the data on Slide 12 shows that and some of the quarter-to-quarter variations are simply a function of which particular wells are completing and because our costs include full cycle, there are facility costs in our bars in the quarter in which we start wells in the new area and have central tank batteries or other things that are being executed in that period.","Ed Westlake","And then I mean -- I mean this is just a great portfolio with also tax and royalty advantages. And you will want to get after it; the rest of the industry is getting after it. Maybe just give us some high-level thoughts about inflation. On the one hand there is probably still learnings that can improve that development cost as you progress. On the other hand, things might get a little hot over the next few years. So maybe just some high level thoughts as to how you think about that?","Bruce Niemeyer","We've certainly driven in the last two years to a very positive position. We operate in a dynamic price environment and dynamic activity environment. Over the last few years we really leverage the scale of Chevron where we have an advantage to do so. So tubulars or the pipe that goes in the wells is a key cost component and Chevron buys a lot of pipe around the world; so we're able to leverage our worldwide supply chain effort to bring advantage to pricing to what we do. We also consolidate work with key suppliers -- have consolidated work to give us the right combination of unit price, execution performance access to technology and the ability to grow with us.","And then we've put in place some contractual arrangements with unit based fixed terms, some are index based, some use performance incentives, but they're all intended to keep us on the competitive side of the price curve, irrespective of what commodity prices are doing. Structurally the things that stay with us in any price environment are multi-well pad designs which we've done for a very long time, the acreage position that we have that allow us to drill longer lateral lengths, efficiencies as we engage in on a daily basis in terms of something we call zipper fracing [ph] where you have activities occurring simultaneously. And those will stay us regardless of what price does.","Ed Westlake","Thanks, Bruce.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please?","Neil Mehta","Good morning, everyone. Pat, really good progress here on capital spending. Where do you believe we're tracking relative to guidance here in 2016 for CapEx? And then relative to the $17 billion to $22 billion, any early look of how the deflation you've seen in '16 will carry forward?","Patricia Yarrington","Yes, so I think we had said before that 2016 we thought would come in at 25, around 25. I think last time I said even below 25 and this time I'm really thinking we'll probably be closer to 24. So significant reduction from a year ago time. We're in the process of doing our business plan, right now the range that we've put out for '17 to '18 is in the $17 billion to $22 billion range. I think we will be in that range, we're just going through and doing the prioritization at the moment and we'll come out typically with a C&E press release after our board approves the plan and I don't really want to get ahead of that but obviously all of the efficiencies, the cost efficiencies that we've seen -- Bruce just talked through some of those in his business unit but those are going on around the globe in terms of supplier optimization, supplier rationalization, and getting our supply chain costs down. That will continue and I think we will hold onto that.","The one area where there probably is a little bit of an inflationary element will all will be the Permian because that's where investment is being attracted. But when you look around the rest of the world, that is really not happening in the rest of the world; investment is not going to those locations. So we're not seeing those kind of cost pressures, so we believe the efficiencies through the supply chain organization we've been able to capture will hold there.","Neil Mehta","That is a good follow-up. And maybe this is for Bruce here, as you see activity pick up in the Permian, do you see any bottlenecks, either from an infrastructure perspective, labor perspective, or other parts of that resource that will make it difficult for you to achieve the high-end of the range that we talked about?","Bruce Niemeyer","We certainly recognize Neil that we have to plan ahead and we do so. When you think about takeaway, our efforts in maximizing realization have a secondary component which is flow assurance to make sure that we're able to move to the market centers locations where we ultimately wish to sell without being disrupted. When you get to the supply of drilling and completing wells, the suppliers that we work with, we pick intentionally, in part for their ability to grow; both in terms of the availability of the equipment, the type of equipment we want, and their staffing plans in terms of how they will staff and maintain that staffing going forward. So there will be some changes overall in the basin but we're taking a multi-year view and able to look a little bit into the future and based our planning around that.","Neil Mehta","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please?","Blake Fernandez","Good morning. Pat, going back to some of the -- back to the deflationary pressures you're seeing on CapEx. I think you alluded to a $50 Brent breakeven which is pretty consistent with what you had articulated before. Is it fair to think that that number is trending lower also?","Patricia Yarrington","We are working very hard to get that number lower, absolutely. And it certainly has moved down from when we first put that target out there, yes; meaning our actuals are moving in that direction. So yes, we are trying as best we can through operating efficiencies, capital efficiencies to have our outflows contained relative to the inflows that we anticipate coming out there. So it's what I consider to be a cost structure reset and a capital expenditure reset given the environment that we're in.","Blake Fernandez","Okay, fair enough. And then, Bruce, on the Permian, it looks like you are trending above the top end of guidance or your range. Obviously you're adding rigs, we probably haven't seen the full impact of that yet. Is there any reason to believe that you are not on-track to potentially surpass what the upper-end of this range is here?","Bruce Niemeyer","Well, we're ahead now and our guidance remains the same at this point to 2020, 250,000 to 350,000 barrels a day. Our Analyst Day in March is the typical time where we would unpack more of that for you and everybody else.","Blake Fernandez","Good deal, I appreciate it.","Bruce Niemeyer","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please?","Evan Calio","Good afternoon and good results today. My first question, staying with the Permian; Bruce I know some of your acreage in Southwest Reeves overlaps Apache's recently announced Alpine High Play. Can you share your view on the viability of that play, potential economics and how that would or may compete for capital with this Permian core that you have laid out today?","Bruce Niemeyer","Sure, Evan. Let me start first by saying we're excited by this activity and hope it's fully successful. We have 180,000 acres in our portfolio and you can see it there on the slide. But it's a great example of how our strategy has played out across the Permian allowing the industry to de-risk and create data that can refine our assessment. Alpine High, that area in the southern part of Reeves County is right now on our overall portfolio pie, in that wedge it is -- that is labeled less than $20,000 per acre, subsurface. And the subsurface is structurally more complex, it appears to be a little more gassy and it's far from existing infrastructure. But additional positive data certainly has the potential to move that area to higher value and if it does, we go through a regular resort of priorities and we would adjust our activity as that indicated.","Evan Calio","Great. And then maybe my second is -- it's a follow-up to some prior Permian questions. But just to understand, I mean does the upside to your Permian production range, which is the same as it was in May despite improvements here; does that represent the limit to how much you can grow in a capital efficient manner and maybe that looks achievable on a 30-rig program by the end of 2020? And if so, like what are the limiting factors in your current plan to how much the Permian can take and subsequently grow?","Bruce Niemeyer","Our focus in the near-term and quite frankly throughout is on capital efficiency. And we are focused not on chasing a particular production curve -- growing production is important, growing bond is important but retaining efficiency throughout what we do, and we have many options; going forward to adjust our pace of activity up and down. We have the ability to grow activity but it is returns that we are ultimately focused on and that will drive our decision making going forward.","Evan Calio","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets. Your question please?","Brendan Warn","Good morning or good afternoon, wherever you are sitting in the world. I'm going to ask a question away from the Permian if I can; if I could just get an update on Rosebank in the UK North Sea, just in terms of -- I know you are out sort of rebidding and renegotiating. Just how you're seeing that project stack up in terms of its cost? And if you can give any update I can have a follow-up, please.","Patricia Yarrington","Well, I think all I can say at this point -- I mean we are in essence staying with that project in feed while we're trying to get the development costs down. So I don't have a lot of specific information to provide for you but obviously with what's happened to oil prices, what's happened to the optionality that we have here in the Permian; there is a competing for capital element that Rosebank has to fight for within our portfolio. So when I was continuing to work at it -- we've recognize how important Rosebank is to the region, we recognized how important it is to the U.K. but we have in the past been able to take a look -- a second look at the design and get costs down. In the past we've been able to kind of re-characterize the subsurface and work improvements in there, and we're just still on that same process.","Brendan Warn","And then a follow-up, just how much would the weaker pound assist that project in terms of economics?","Patricia Yarrington","Obviously it would help but I don't have the ability to quantify that for you at the moment.","Brendan Warn","Okay, thank you. Thanks, Pat.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question please?","Anish Kapadia","Hi, my first question was on some of your other potential international project sanctions. I wanted to get a little bit of an update on the Gulf of Mexico projects, where you are at in terms of the appraisals and potential development. So the ones I was thinking of were the Anchor projects, the Tigris project and Sicily.","Patricia Yarrington","So an anchor we're still in the appraisal process; we feel positive about it but we're still in the appraisal process there. On the Tigris there is multiple fields that are involved here; appraisal drilling has been completed and we have filed for a suspension of production here. Officially [ph], we've allowed to leases to","elapse.","Anish Kapadia","Okay, thank you. And then I had a question for Bruce on the Permian. Again, thank you for the useful slides that you've put out. In terms of the -- high graded area that you have talked about, the 600,000 acres; within that I was wondering if you could give some idea of the number of locations that are contained within that in your current thinking. And which benches you're looking at are you currently thinking are going to be developed in that acreage?","Bruce Niemeyer","The areas that are at the top of our Q vary between the Midland and Delaware Basin as do the horizons. The things that we're most interested in are again those that create the right kind of full cycle returns. And so the oil\/gas split between those areas, the cost of execution of those areas are what causes it to be in the Top Tier for us. So in the Midland Basin, Wolfcamp B and lower Sprayberry are two area -- are two horizons that we like a lot. We also like some aspects of the Wolfcamp in the Delaware Basin. We're drilling wells in a few other horizons but there isn't a one-size fits all; you'll move to one part of the basin and that particular horizon that you're interested in is just not as great a value as others.","So what we do in these development areas is -- put together a strategy that paces development based on value. We go to best performing horizon on a return basis first, and then follow it with the others. And that -- there is not a simple answer that's fits the whole basin.","Anish Kapadia","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please?","Ryan Todd","Hi, thanks. Great result, maybe I'll stick up on the trend and ask one Permian question followed by another one. In the Permian, if you look at your acreage, if you look on the map on 11, and you've shown this map a number of different times but I mean you've still got a lot of checkerboard acreage across core portions of the Permian basin. Any further interest at this point in potential JVs or partnerships like you did with Cimarex in the past that would allow for an increasing amount of long laterals and capital efficient developments? Or how do you think about managing that acreage going forward?","Bruce Niemeyer","It's a good question. We are actually very actively engaged in swaps working with individuals that we don't have rights to checkerboard at acreage and we've actually executed quite a number of those, it does allow us to extend laterals, concentrate facilities and infrastructure in certain places. We will also contemplate joint ventures where that leads us to the right kind of return outcomes. If a combination of acreage in some way leads to a more efficient result but I would tell you that what's been more active for us in the last year and a half has been finding acreage consolidations that we can make through swaps and that's bolstered by the fact that our company operated execution is becoming highly efficient, and those are the sorts of activities that are driving returns to the top of our Q.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. And then maybe if I could ask one -- maybe a question for Pat there, kind of a high-level philosophical one. I mean if we -- if we look at what the majors such as yourself have been able to do in terms of capital reduction over the past couple years; I think it's been quite impressive. And as we look forward over the next let's say two to five years, and I realize there is a lot of variable in this. How do you think about what a reasonable level of sustainable CapEx is? I mean if you talk about potentially being sub-$20 billion a year in a 2017, is -- has there been enough structural cost deflation or efficiency gains that that is kind of a reasonable medium-term level to think about longer-term? Or does that still feel like capital starvation mode and there is a need to bounce back into some level in the 20s as more sustainable over the medium-term?","Patricia Yarrington","Yes. So I think the critical variable that you're leaving unsaid there is what's happening to price. You know just a little bit on price, I think our own view here is that in the medium-term here we're potentially going to be range bound; we are constructive on price and we do think overtime, here you will -- there will be price appreciation but we see it being relatively modest. But in the period that we're talking about here, I don't see that change -- changing our view of the $17 billion to $22 billion range being appropriate for us. You are hearing an awful lot about the Permian being one of the best investment opportunities that we have and the great thing about that is -- that it's short cycle, it's high return, it's very flexible and so that gives us -- it lowers our capital intensity, gives us greater flexibility than we have had in several years.","And the only other major project that we've sanctioned at this point in time is TCO and our share of that in terms of an outflow would be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion a year over the next few years. So we consider that to be very manageable and that's within the $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you. So I think that's a reasonable range on C&E to expect for us under a regional -- a reasonable range of prices that might be anticipated.","Okay, I think we have time -- all right, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off but I think we've got time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question then comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please?","Pavel Molchanov","Thank you, guys. Just a quick one about Nigeria. You mentioned losing 28,000 a day in Q3. What kind of recovery have you seen on your Nigerian assets so far this quarter? And what is embedded in the exit rate guidance that you gave for the year?","Patricia Yarrington","Well, I mean I think we have two factors going on; we have had some instances of sabotage as we've talked about, we had a more recent one here in the last couple of days. So that's it -- obviously a detriment that is impacting Nigerian production. But on the opposite side we've got a [indiscernible] expense \u2013 extension, plateau extension investment coming online. So I think that it's not a huge factor in terms of a variance and what we're showing for the December exit range.","Pavel Molchanov","I appreciate it.","Patricia Yarrington","Okay, thanks. All right, so I think that concludes our call for the third quarter here. I'd like to thank everybody for your time on the call. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and we appreciate everybody's participation on the call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Pat Yarrington","Hey. Good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jeff Shellebarger, President, Chevron North America Exploration and Production; and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement show here on slide two.","Turning to slide three, the company\u2019s third quarter earnings were $5.6 billion or $2.95 per diluted share. On a year-to-day basis, earnings were $15.8 million or $8.29 per diluted share.","Included in this quarter's earnings were gains on asset sales of approximately $420 million and foreign exchange gains of $366 million and a non-recurring economic buyout of a long-term contract. Taken together, this equate to a positive $0.34 per share.","On the year-to-day, the impact of foreign exchange movement is minimal, while asset sales gains and other non-recurring charges have provided a net boost to 2014 earnings of $770 million. There is a full reconciliation of these items on our last slide.","Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 12% and our debt ratio at the end of September was 14%. We repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares during the third quarter and in the fourth quarter we expect to repurchase the same amount.","Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $8.7 billion during the third quarter and $25 billion year-to-date. Cash, capital expenditures were $8.3 billion for the quarter and $25.7 billion year-to-date.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion and year-to-date $1.9 billion. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $14.5 billion, giving us a net debt position of $11 billion.","Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2014 earnings were $643 million higher than third quarter 2013 results. Foreign exchange movements positively affected earnings by $366 million during the quarter, representing a swing of over $600 million between periods, mostly occurring in the Upstream segment.","As a reminder, foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effects with minimal cash flow impact. Upstream earnings decreased by $443 million between quarters. Lower realizations and liftings, and higher operating and DD&A expenses were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange movements and lower exploration expenses.","Downstream results increased by about a $1 billion, driven by stronger U.S. refining and marketing results, larger gains on asset sales, favorable foreign exchange movements and timing effects related to revaluation of inventory in a lower price environment. The improvement in the other segment primarily reflects the absence of the 2013 third quarter impairment of a power-related equity affiliate.","Turning to slide six, I\u2019ll now compare results for the third quarter of 2014 with the second quarter of 2014. Third quarter earnings were approximately $70 million lower than second quarter results. Again, the earnings variance between quarters reflected a $600 million favorable movement in foreign exchange effects, most of which impacted the Upstream segment.","Upstream earnings decreased by $615 million, reflecting lower realizations and lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange swing between quarters and lower exploration expenses.","Downstream earnings increased by almost $670 million, driven by stronger R&M results, higher gains on asset sales and a positive swing in foreign exchange between quarters, partially offset by lower chemical earnings. The decrease in the other segment largely reflects corporate tax items and higher environmental expenses.","Jeff Gustavson will now take us to the comparisons by segment.","Jeff Gustavson","Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the quarter were $125 million lower than second quarter results. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $175 million consistent with the decline in U.S. liquids and natural gas price indicators.","Higher production volumes in San Joaquin Valley in the Permian Basin increased earnings by $40 million. Lower exploration expenses, primarily associated with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico increased earnings by $95 million.","The other bar reflects the number of unrelated items. Lower operating expenses were more than offset by the negative impact from the economic buyout of a long-term contractual obligation.","Turning to slide eight. International Upstream earnings were $490 million lower than last quarter's results. Lower crude low realizations decreased earnings by $420 million, consistent with the decline in international crude prices between quarters. Lower liftings primarily related to the sale of our Upstream interest in Chad decreased earnings by $95 million.","Gains on asset sales were $430 million lower, also driven by the sale of our interest in Chad and Cameroon, which occurred during the second quarter. Favorable movements in foreign currency FX increased earnings by $490 million. The third quarter had a gain of about $340 million compared to a loss of about $150 million in the second quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including lower trading results and higher DD&A partially offset by lower exploration expenses.","Slide nine summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter 2014 and the second quarter 2014. Production increased by 23,000 barrels per day between quarters.","Shale and tight resources growth contributed 18,000 barrels per day driven primarily by production increases from the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian where new wells were brought online. The net impact of lower turnaround activity during the quarter increased production by 23,000 barrels per day.","Planned maintenance at TCO\u2019s KTL facility in Kazakhstan, in addition to Australia, was completed in the second quarter while third quarter planned turnarounds including TCO\u2019s SGI, SGP facility in U.K. and Thailand were on balance less extensive than the prior quarter. TCO, SGI, SGP turnaround continued through October.","Asset sales reduced production by 18,000 barrels per day, principally due to the sale of producing assets in Chad. As a reminder, the production impact associated with this sale had already been incorporated in both our updated production guidance for 2014, as well as in our 2017 production target of 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter 2014 and the third quarter 2013. Production was 17,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago. Excluding production entitlement effects and the production impact associated with asset sales, production grew by 31,000 barrels per day between periods.","Unconventional production increased in the Permian, in the Vaca Muerta, in Argentina by 40,000 barrels per day. Lower turnaround activity mainly in Trinidad and Tobago, Kazakhstan and the Gulf of Mexico increased production by 19,000 barrels per day. Production entitlement effects decreased production by 28,000 barrels per day.","The decrease in crude oil prices between periods resulted in a small increase in net production volumes primarily as a function of our production sharing contracts in Indonesia. This increase was more than offset, however, by negative production entitlement effects in Kazakhstan as well as lower cost recovery volumes due to changes in absolute spending levels.","The sale of producing assets mainly in Chad reduced production by about 20,000 barrels per day. The base business in other bar principally reflects normal field declines with a partial offset from the absence of external constraints, which negatively impacted production in the third quarter of 2013. Our base business continues to perform well with a base decline rate of less than 3% per year.","Turning to slide 11. U.S. Downstream results increased $292 million between quarters. Higher volumes increased earnings by $160 million primarily reflecting the completion of planned turnaround activities at the El Segundo, California refinery where four new coke drums were installed. These new coke drums are expected to enhance the future reliability of the refinery.","Despite declining industry refining margins on both the West Coast and Gulf Coast, our realized margins were $30 million higher. Overall, we benefited from more optimal sourcing of intermediates and other feedstocks following the completion of the El Segundo refinery's major turnaround in the prior quarter. In addition, we had improved reliability at both the Pascagoula, Mississippi and Richmond, California refineries.","Pascagoula\u2019s refinery contributed a full quarter of premium base oils production, after the successful startup of its new premium base-oils plant in July. This benefited both volumes and margins.","Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $110 million due to the absence of cost related to the shutdown and maintenance activities in the prior quarter. Higher gains on midstream asset sales, mainly the sale of a terminal in Beaumont, Texas, improved earnings by $115 million between the periods.","Lower chemicals results along with various smaller items decreased earnings by $123 million. Chemicals earnings were affected by various impairments in addition to the Port Arthur, Texas facility being offline since early third quarter.","Turning to slide 12, international Downstream earnings increased $374 million between quarters. Stronger margins increased earnings by $145 million. Falling crude prices contributed to improved refining margins across multiple refineries, in addition to the completion of plan turnarounds at our Thailand and South Korea affiliate refineries.","Asia marketing margins benefited from favorable aviation price lag effects and improved retail margins. Timing effects represented a $70 million positive earnings variance between quarters, largely due to the revaluation of inventory associated with falling crude and product prices during the third quarter.","Foreign exchange gains were $105 million higher compared to the prior quarter. The third quarter had a gain of about $20 million, compared to a loss of about $85 million in the second quarter. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items, mainly higher trading results.","Jeff will now provide an update on our North America Upstream operations.","Jeff Shellebarger","Thank you, Jeff. It\u2019s a pleasure to be on the call with you all today. I'll provide a brief overview of our North America Upstream operations, followed by a more detailed review of two key areas for us -- the Gulf of Mexico deepwater and our unconventional activities, particularly those in the Permian basin.","The photo on slide 13 shows the Jack\/St. Malo facility\u2019s safely mode on-location in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We continue to make steady progress towards first oil later this year.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 14. Let me start by providing a brief overview of Chevron\u2019s North America Exploration and Production Company, where diverse organization made up of six business units were active in the key hydrocarbon basin across the continent.","Production has averaged 731,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Year-to-date 2014, this represents almost 30% of Chevron\u2019s total Upstream volumes. The heart of our portfolio is our legacy based business, which has generated production, value creation for decades.","Asset includes our Gulf of Mexico shelf, Mid-Continent conventional oil and gas operation in the San Joaquin Valley in California, where our industry-leading expertise\u2019s input operations has helped us achieve more than 50% recovery at the Kern River oilfield.","These robust based business assets provide a low decline high-cash generation foundation to underpin and support our current and future growth opportunities. Next, I would like to highlight two of these areas in more detail -- deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our shale and tight assets.","Slide 15, Chevron has a leading position in the Gulf of Mexico. We are the largest leaseholder. We currently produce about 200,000 barrels a day in the Gulf, slightly more than half of which comes from our existing deepwater assets.","In the deepwater, we're making good progress on our major capital projects. Tubular Bells, first oil is eminent in the next few days. The remaining work on Jack\/St. Malo is progressing well and the project remains on track for a late fourth quarter startup.","Overall, hook-up and commissioning is about 90% complete, buyback gas was bought on board the facility last weekend. We recently completed dewatering the oil export pipeline both of these are significant milestones. Construction of the Big Foot tension leg platform is essentially complete and is ready for sail-away and offshore installations.","The Central Gulf of Mexico has currently experienced a significant Loop Current event. These strong currents at the ocean surface are naturally occurring typically last one to three-months. This Loop Current is particularly strong and we are monitoring for the conditions that will allow us to proceed with installation, once the Loop Current subsides. We\u2019ve taken advantage of the extra time in the construction yard to start some pre-commissioning activities normally done offshore.","Finally, investment decision was announced on the Stampede project earlier this week. On the exploration front, we recently announced the significant Lower Tertiary discovery at the Guadalupe prospect in Northern Keathley Canyon. We have also completed appraisal work at the Buckskin and Moccasin prospects and expect to move into front-end engineering and design in 2015. We have got five deepwater drill ships operating in the Gulf, two of which are focused on exploration activities, where we plan to drill four to six Impact prospects over the next 12 to 18 months.","Next let\u2019s talk about shale and tight activities on slide 16. In the Permian Basin, Chevron has been active since the 20s. We continue to be a leading producer in the basin. We have an enviable acreage position. We have good exposure to the key sweet spots in the basin. Our legacy position provides critical access to infrastructure. We are employing a disciplined, value focused development strategy in the Permian. We are not in a drill or drop situation, and our low lease holding costs allow us to focus on the highest return projects in a paced matter while leveraging industry learnings. Our efforts on lowering cost while simultaneously increasing production rates and ultimate recoveries are helping to improve overall well and program economics.","Finally, we've executed joint development agreements, which help optimize well placement and lateral lengths as well ensure the efficient build out of takeaway and other infrastructure. Already high level of activities in the basin continued to increase and the efficiency programs to lower cost increase EUR are working. We are anticipating that our 2014 unconventional production will be more than 10% higher than initially forecast and our long-term unconventional production growth continues to steepen, as shown on the chart on the right. We will provide an updated production forecast at our Analyst Day in March.","Slide 17. Looking into the Midland Basin, production has increased by 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 40% during the first nine months of the year and we are on track to drill 10% more wells than originally planned for the year. As we mentioned during the second quarter call, we are transitioning towards a multi-well pad based horizontal program. The Midland vertical wells have demonstrated that all of the identified benches are potentially productive.","Our Bradford Ranch program on the southwestern edge of the basin is a great example of our transition to horizontals. We have drilled our first two wells. We are now batch drilling the next four. The first well has been completed, it\u2019s flowing back and will be on production next month. At its full potential, we expect up to 150 wells on this development with lateral lengths ranging from 5000 to 7500 feet. We believe that we are well-positioned in what looks like the sweet spot at the Midland Basin horizontal play.","Slide 18. Results from the Delaware Basin have been equally positive. Our two nonoperated joint development areas in Culberson and Eddy counties continued to deliver excellent results. Production has increased by approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 60% during the first nine months of the year and we are planning to drill 180 wells in 2014.","Our company operated Salado Draw horizontal program in Lea County, New Mexico remains on track to spud its first well within the next month. While there are multiple benches in this area, we are targeting the Upper Avalon with its initial 16 well development. With success we envision more than 60 well locations at Salado Draw. Our recent well results give us continued optimism on the growth potential in the Delaware. Wells drilled in the third quarter have 30-day IPs that averaged just over 1000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","I would like to close by providing an update on some of our other key North American shale and tight assets. Let\u2019s turn to the slide 19. Starting with the Duvernay in Canada, we recently announced the sell down of 30% of our Duvernay position to Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company consistent with our risk management practices for early life assets. They are valued partner in our Wheatstone Project and we welcome them to this exciting development. The consideration received reflects the prospectivity and inherent value of our attractive acreage position, 90% of which is in a liquids rich window. Appraisal drilling has commenced on our first two horizontal well pads located in what we call the Central Focus Area.","In the Utica and Marcellus, we have prioritized our near-term efforts into five core development areas across West Virginia and Southwestern Pennsylvania. As we move more aggressively into the development mode, pad drilling, optimization of lateral lengths and completion, and the build out of water infrastructure allow us to further lower cost, increase recoveries, and therefore enhance our overall development economics.","Let me turn it back over to Pat.","Pat Yarrington","Okay. Thank you, Jeff. In addition to the significant amount of activity going on in our North America Upstream business, I would also like to touch on a few other highlights during the quarter.","In Australia, we continue to make good progress on both the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects. For Gorgon, which is now 87% complete, all of the development wells have been successfully drilled and majority are through the completion phase.","LNG Tank #1 is through construction and testing, awaiting product and LNG Tank #2 is on plan to achieve that same status by the end of January. The five turbine generators are all installed and the jetty is essentially complete. 11 of 17 Train 2 modules have been received and installed. The key focus in the months ahead remains in the mechanical, electrical and instrumentation work scope on the island.","The Wheatstone project is now 49% complete. The project team had a major milestone back in August, with the installation of the offshore steel gravity-based structure. The MOF or materials offloading facility is 100% operational. The Upstream drilling campaign, the fabrication of the platform, site preparation and construction of the LNG tanks are all on schedule.","We are making good progress, bringing these projects online, both of which will be important contributors to production, cash flow and earnings for decades to come. I encourage you to review the new pictures that show progress on both projects on our investor page at chevron.com.","In Bangladesh we achieved startup at the Bibiyana Expansion Project, which includes two new processing trains, with an incremental design capacity of 300 million cubic feet of natural gas and 4,000 barrels of condensate per day.","Moving to the Downstream, we have completed investments at several of our U.S. refineries, including El Segundo, Pascagoula and Salt Lake City. We expect these investments will lead to notable reliability and operational improvements going forward, some of which were evident in the third quarters result.","Our Chevron Phillips Chemical\u2019s joint venture also continues to make good progress on its U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, construction of the 1.5 million metric ton ethane cracker and the two 5,000 metric ton polyethylene units is almost 25% complete. It is on schedule and on budget.","Finally, we continue to sell non-strategic assets. We\u2019re on target for achieving $10 million in asset sale proceeds from 2014 through 2016, a goal we outlined at our Analyst Day meeting last March. At nine-month, year-to-date proceeds amount to $2.6 billion and our several other transactions lined up to close in the fourth quarter or early in the New Year.","I\u2019d like to close with a couple of thoughts about Chevron position and outlook, given recent commodity price decline. Our priorities haven\u2019t changed. By necessity, we take a long-term view of prices, because our investments last for decade. We continue to believe global demand for oil and natural gas will grow, while existing sources of supply will inevitably decline.","And as it is always done, although, with some lag, we expect the industry cost structure will align to the revenue stream, such that economic incentives will exist to invest in developing new energy supplies.","Our strategies have remained and will remain constant. They are designed for long-term value creation. Our financial priorities haven't changed. They start with growing an attractive dividend. Next we look to invest in economic projects that create value and allow us to sustain and grow the dividend for years to come. Third, we want to maintain a strong balance sheet, precisely for times like this. And finally, any available cash is distributed to our shareholders through our share repurchase program.","Our program is scalable and could be adjusted in a period of low prices. We\u2019ll continue to make that assessment each quarter and our future actions will obviously be influenced by how low prices stay and for how long.","We remain focused on excellent execution each day and every day. Our businesses are performing well. Based on preliminary information, it appears our Upstream and our Downstream segments were number one in earnings per barrel for the quarter.","Now, of course, we are cognizant of near-term price realities. Major payout -- capital projects under construction and other nondiscretionary spend represents about one-half of our current capital budget. Even at low prices, we plan to continue funding these projects, key among these are Gorgon, Wheatstone and our two operated deepwater projects. Within a year, we expect to see production from three of these four projects online and they\u2019ll turn from being cash consumers into cash generators.","After that we prioritize and rank our remaining investments, that are more discretionary in nature, only funding those that are most competitive in the portfolio or where deferral can be achieved without economic loss. Permian development, for example, remains quite attractive even at lower prices. Now this ranking and prioritization is not a new process for us, it\u2019s a routine process for us.","We are also keenly focused on managing operating cost. This too is not a new area of effort for us since oil prices have been drifting south for the past few years while costs have continued to rise.","As we showed you last March, our costs are already highly competitive with our larger peers as well as a much broader set of E&P companies. Well before the recent price decline, several of our international and domestic business units, as well as our corporate departments already had notable cost reduction efforts underway.","Finally, we plan to continue, but we will be careful about managing our ongoing asset divestment and portfolio rationalization efforts. The valuations for some assets targeted for sale are not likely to be affected by near-term circumstances, but the valuations for other prospective sale assets maybe. In all cases, we will only sale if we can capture good value.","By the end of 2014, we should be well on our way to our $10 billion asset divestment target. We still have confidence in achieving it between now and the end of 2016. We have a great deal of experience and managing through prior price cycles in both our Upstream and Downstream businesses, and we feel confident in our ability to allocate capital appropriately and to sustain a competitive cost structure even in a lower commodity price world.","Now that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning. We are ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if that\u2019s absolutely necessary and we\u2019ll do our very best to get all the questions answered.","So Jonathan, please open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Jason Smith on for Doug. How are you?","Pat Yarrington","Oh, fine, Jason, how are you?","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good. So Pat, I think in your comments around some of the projects you had looked to move forward in the future, one of ones you didn't mention is the Tengiz expansion and there has obviously been some chatter around costs and timing there. Can you maybe just offer some color on your latest thoughts on whether this moves forward?","Pat Yarrington","Yeah. So, I mean, obviously, this is a very attractive asset for us. It\u2019s one of the critical assets that we\u2019ve got in the company, strong earnings, strong cash flow and it has the potential we think to grow even further. There are two perspective elements of that project that I think are important to separate out. One is the Wellhead Pressure Management Project. It's really designed to keep existing capacity -- processing capacity full.","And the second is a project for the growth that really could add 250,000 to 300,000 barrels a day, taking full field growth production up to around 1 million barrels a day. So it's a very exciting project. We are working very aggressively with our partners and with the government -- the Kazakhstan government to progress this project through to final investment decision.","We have not made a final investment decision at this point in time. We don't have a cost estimate. Our teams are working very hard to conclude the final engineering, understand the full suite of the economic impacts here, get complete alignment between our partners and the government and proceed that forward. When we do take FID, we will have a number that we can put forward.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, okay. And then we appreciate all the thoughts on buybacks and dividends going forward, but in the current oil price environment at least at present it looks like cash flow is not covering CapEx dividends and buybacks for the first nine months of the year. So if we do end up in a depressed environment, can you maybe just talk through what changes there?","Pat Yarrington","Yeah. So I think Jason, it\u2019s really going to depend on the outlook that we\u2019ve got on a whole series of parameters, oil prices one, cost structure is another, length of duration of any sort of BIP or price excursion, how quickly we see the cost structure amending to that.","Our capital program, balance sheet health issues, etc era and all of that gets taken into account when we look at our allocation of our cash uses. The priority, as I\u2019ve said before and we\u2019ve been long-standing in saying this is really about being able to grow our dividend. But in order to do that over a long period of time, we need to make -- continue to make very strong investments or investments in strong projects, attractive projects.","We\u2019ve got a tremendous Q and we have the opportunity to do that. So we are going to be driven by the economics of the portfolio that we have at hand. We\u2019re very cognizant of the risk in our business, the commodity price cycle risk and we\u2019ve long-standing kept a pristine balance sheet to weather through positions just like this. We have a lot of borrowing capacity still ahead of us without putting into jeopardy our AA status.","And we are on the cusp of getting to the point where these major capital project kick in with significant volumes and significant cash generation. So we feel very comfortable about the position that we are in and we are not bothered in a temporary sense of having to fund our shareholder distributions off of our balance sheet. We obviously can't do that for a long period of time but that is not the window that we find ourselves in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please?","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","Thanks very much. My question is on the Permian. Jeff, I was hoping that you might be able to at least qualitatively explain why you are seeing such a significant increase in the production levels. And I guess if you'd just break it out between moving to longer laterals, the intensity of proppant in your completions, or even just higher activity levels or maybe just something else I am not thinking about.","","Jeff Shellebarger","Thanks for the question, Jason. It\u2019s really all of the above. Maybe start back with a year ago, a lot of our activity was focused on appraisal and we had some lease tenure work to do up in the Delaware with the Chesapeake acquisition. Most of that work is done. That\u2019s helped us identify the sweet spots that we want to be in. As you know, the industry is innovating every single day on completions and designs. So we are adopting those designs, the pioneers to our business. So lateral lengths are increasing, stages in those lateral lengths are increasing, propane amounts are increasing.","All of that is driving, not only our performance for a while but the entire industry\u2019s performance for a while in an upward direction. And then finally on top of that, our activity in general with more development program has increased year-over-year and that\u2019s driving the production growth.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","Great. And I really did have a true follow-up on this one. I think you said that the 30-day IP in the Delaware Basin was just over 1,000 barrels a day. You may have said it but I missed it, do you have a similar figure for the Midland Basin?","Jeff Shellebarger","No, I don\u2019t. I mean, it\u2019s a much wider distribution over there. So we'll talk a little bit more about that at our Analyst Day meeting.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","Okay. Thanks.","Jeff Shellebarger","Yes","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please? Ryan, you might have your phone on mute. Ryan, we are still not hearing you.","Pat Yarrington","Maybe we\u2019ll try to queue him up again. Let\u2019s move on to the next caller, Jonathan.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please?","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Hi, Pat. Can you hear me?","Pat Yarrington","I can hear you. Thanks Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Very good. Good morning. Pat, you guided at the Analyst meeting to flat CapEx going forward. Today you seem to be saying that you may cut it. I'm not quite sure what the message is. I guess if we were to stay at current prices, we would anticipate lower CapEx in the future and you seem to be saying that would be -- well, I'm not even sure in what areas you would lower CapEx. Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","Yes. So what I was tying to say is and we are just in the middle of doing our business plans at the very moment and you know our process. We go through that at this time of year. We get approval of the Board and then we come out with our capital expenditure outlook for the year and we expect to do that. That typically would happen in December.","So we are right in the midst of pulling all the plans together. And obviously, we are having to have some tough discussions around what do we think the price outlook is going to be? What do we think the cost structure is going to be? How much of our capital program is really in this non-discretionary, must get through the phases since these projects are already under construction versus how much is discretionary?.","And so I tried in the prepared remarks to kind of walk you through that logic. Now in the discretionary category, there are areas like exploration. Exploration would be one of the first areas that you would look to perhaps trim back in the cash flow constrained sort of mode.","There are other areas that we would look to, projects that are not under construction but are in the first few phases of development. I mean, these will be projects where a deferral really doesn\u2019t result in an economic loss or value destruction.","So those are the first couple of areas that we would necessarily look. I\u2019d call to your attention that there have been some projects where we have already done a pushback on the FID for various reasons.","So, for example, Rosebank was one of the areas that we deferred on the final investment decision. We sent -- we basically took a loot at that again and said, let\u2019s reassess the design construct, let\u2019s reassess the economics here, and frankly, that\u2019s turning out quite well from a design concept standpoint, as well as a reserve standpoint and that effort looks to be coming forward, perhaps sometime in 2015.","We have also had -- you are probably aware with, we have also had a delay in the Indonesian deepwater project, because we weren\u2019t able to get government approvals in the timeframe that allowed the bids that we had received and the marketing efforts that have done to be -- to remain effective. So we are going to have to go through that cycle again. So there have been some projects that have moved out of the current year period for their own sort of operating reasons.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Great. And then the follow-up would be, would we assume that your volume target for 2017 is regardless and viable or would you see the potential for that to need to be cut as a result of low prices? Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","Yeah. So, we take, Paul, the other thing I tried to mention is that, we take a long-term view on prices, because we think overtime, that\u2019s the direction, the world is still going to need our product and cost are going to rise to get access to more challenged resources.","We still are on plan for the 3.1 million barrel a day production by 2017. We have a vast majority of that volume is already under construction and we can see our way to those barrels.","You will recall, perhaps, that when we did put out that target back in March, we also indicated that there was about a 50,000 barrel a day cushion that we put in for the unknown and the unknowable, and so that is an opportunity there.","Should some of these things move in or out of the portfolio? So some things are going to move out, some things are moving in. Jeff already talked about the strength in the Permian that we've got. So, all-in, our best view of the world right now is that 3.1 million barrel a day target is a good target for us.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Thank you, Pat.","Pat Yarrington","The other think I would say maybe is that, we do, when we are putting our plans together and when we are actually taking our projects to investment, we obviously, test our investments against a mid-price scenario, but a low price scenario as well as the high-priced scenario. And I would just say that the low price scenario that we use, current prices are within that band.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Great. And just if I could, the credit rating is all important isn't it, that is an important way to think about how much you would borrow?","Pat Yarrington","Yes. It is, credit rating is important, but we are a long way from compromising our AA status and we want to keep the AA status for exactly times like this when prices fall and we are committed on projects.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Thanks. I\u2019ll let you move on. Thank you.","Pat Yarrington","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from J.P. Morgan. Your question please.","Phil Gresh - J.P. Morgan","Hi, Pat. Good morning.","Pat Yarrington","Good morning.","Phil Gresh - J.P. Morgan","Just a follow-up on Paul's question, you talked about some of the areas of flexibility. I appreciate the color there. Specifically for 2015 you talked about the major capital projects, you talked about the Permian still being attractive, et cetera? So, I guess, I was just wondering ballpark, is there a rough amount or a range you could give us in terms of your CapEx flexibility for next year, is it 10%? Just any preliminary thoughts you could give us?","Pat Yarrington","Phil, I don\u2019t really want to go down that pathway, because we are -- again, we are putting our budgets together right now. I mean, the areas that we would look to flex, exploration, it\u2019s currently been three that would probably come off some. These Phases 1 through 3 project developments that will take some declines. If -- again, if we see this price level holding.","Base business and Permian activity those are obviously very economic plays at this particular point, but you could toggle those and you can toggle those without destroying value. It would mean delaying value but you wouldn\u2019t be destroying value. So those are all of the kinds of decision that we\u2019re working through at the very moment and I don't want to get ahead of our formal plan.","Phil Gresh - J.P. Morgan","Understood. I appreciate the additional color. My follow-up would be if we think about the levers available between the CapEx, incremental asset sales, buyback, I mean -- I guess, is it fair to say with your leverage where it is that maybe something on the CapEx and something on the asset sales would be more of a priority at this point or rank order relative to trimming the buybacks?","Pat Yarrington","Yeah. Again, I don\u2019t want to get ahead on that. I think all of those avenues are open to us and it\u2019s really going to be a question of how we settle out on our longer term -- medium-to-longer term view on prices and costs. And it\u2019s also going to be a function of the economic queue that we\u2019ve got. So we will take all those parameters in place. I\u2019ll just reemphasize that we have a fair amount of leverage, a lot of leverage still available to us. So that would be taken into account as well.","Phil Gresh - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your questions, please.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Okay. Good morning guys. Jeff, I have -- if I could two questions, one on Duvernay, can you share with us the rationale behind the farm down? Is it because you think within your portfolio that this is not ranking as well or that it is a financial consideration? You just need the money so that you can accelerate the growth or that the development pace there. And secondly, that can you talk about from the Atlas acquisition that you also get the Utica acreage there. And relative to the Chevron portfolio, how do you rank those nine positions, does it even have any meaningful outlook on that future within your portfolio on those? Thank you.","Jeff Shellebarger","Hey too good questions Paul. On the Duvernay in Canada, we are very excited about that. It\u2019s very attractive. It\u2019s less mature than the Permian but the rocks that we\u2019ve seen out there and the performance that we\u2019ve seen on exploration program are good.","Chevron has been very clear about our position on risk management. We had 100% interest in more than 300,000 acres out there. Typically we look to form that down a bit. It helps us manage risk. It helps us manage across our whole portfolio. So the sell down in that particular venture was really a part of our normal risk management process.","With respect to the Utica, Southwestern Pennsylvania, these are very attractive prospects. Recall four years ago, three years ago when we bought into this thing, it was primarily dry gas and that\u2019s what was driving the business. Obviously that part of our portfolio we have a lower holding cost and we pull back from that with respect to investments on the liquid rich gas side and on the deeper Utica plays. We\u2019re very excited about those. Again we\u2019re seeing the same efficiencies in the drilling and completions up there as we see everywhere else. It\u2019s completing for our capital and it\u2019s important in our portfolio.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Just -- again, I just had a quick follow-up. Do you have any rig drilling in Utica?","Jeff Shellebarger","Yeah. We have got one right out there.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Good morning everybody and welcome Jeff. I will leave CapEx alone, but a modest silver lining on the low oil price is a positive PSC effect. I mean can you provide any sequential impact in 3Q and maybe just talk through what the typical timing or lag effect may be there?","Jeff Gustavson","I can take that one Evan. This is Jeff Gustavson.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Hi Jeff.","Jeff Gustavson","So we didn\u2019t see the full -- we did see a net production increase in the quarter but remember prices dropped kind of late in the quarter. So I think you see more of that in the fourth quarter assuming prices stay at the levels that they are at now. We redo our PSC sensitivity each and every year as part of our planning process. And right now these price levels what we\u2019re showing is about 1,500 barrel a day impact for dollar change in Brent prices. So that\u2019s a sensitivity you should be using going forward. I would note that this quarter and we mentioned this is in the text, we did have a couple of, maybe one-off effects, profit oil split change -- contractor versus government in Kazakhstan, that\u2019s with Karachaganak. So that was a little more of a pronounced impact, plus there was some variable royalty effects with our TCO affiliate. But going forward, 1.5 thousand barrels a day per dollar change is the sensitivity you should be using.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great. Appreciate that. Maybe a question for the other, Jeff. On the Permian, you mentioned in your comments that it ranks highly. So, I presume it would be more insulated from any potential CapEx reduction and so that's correct. And then you clearly have a very large position in both basins. I didn't know if you could quantify, how much you net acreage was prospective Wolfcamp, Bone Springs or even lower Spraberry in Midland, if you had you could share that with us?","Jeff Shellebarger","Yeah. Well, just to confirm really what Pat said, the Permian does rank at the high end of our investment portfolio and it should be good at the current price environment. It is good at the current price environment that we see. With respect to quantifying the acreage position, I think that\u2019s in the eye of the holder. We have a large acreage position. It\u2019s across all the different benches. Everyday, there is a new bench that looks productive out there. What I can tell you is that the areas that we are focusing on development activity are the sweet spot, as we and the industry define those things today and they are highly respected. They are highly sort out after.","We started looking at the edges of that basin. Other people are out there, they're trying new technology. They are testing those benches. So, I think what we are trying to do is not get out ahead of our skies on that and follow a bit appraisal work and the delineation of these things that are going on. But we are going to stay in highly perspective areas as we pace our development programs.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Is that what drives your location estimates then or is that kind of all more all-encompassing?","Jeff Shellebarger","The total location estimate is what we see across the basin with sort of the current and some advancement of the technologies that exists. Certainly, three years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have seen this kind of potential. Three years from now, it could be even better.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Yeah. It\u2019s trending that way. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please?","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Pat Yarrington","Hi, Ed. Yeah.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Great. So I guess some of the discussion around CapEx apart from oil prices comes from the slide at the Analyst Day this year where obviously you demonstrated that cash flow was going to come on from the major projects from the work that Mike Wirth has been doing in the Downstream and then obviously the shale contribution. But CapEx was going to stay relatively high to drive growth I guess beyond and into 2020. And the shade I see is sort of it $37 billion to $40 billion which is I guess more similar to this year. So, I'm trying to get a sense of what projects you were including in that sort of 2017 timeframe. You have mentioned Kitimat, IDD, Tengiz. How much of a contribution was there in that year, if you can share that with us, so we can get a sense of where the adjusted CapEx might be?","Pat Yarrington","I\u2019m not sure that I completely understand the question here. You are looking at 2017\u2026","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","I'm looking at how much of Kitimat and IDD and Tengiz, you were resuming in that sort of 2017 outlook that you gave us so that we can -- if they do delay not at Tengiz but Kitimat and IDD perhaps how much you would save?","Pat Yarrington","Yeah. I think for all of those you would be talking about modest contributions in the 2017 time period. Yeah. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an impactful element in terms of hitting that target.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Right on the CapEx side.","Pat Yarrington","No, I was talking on the production side, I\u2019m sorry. So you are talking on the CapEx side. But we didn\u2019t give a 2017 target. We did show you that slide that had cash from operations growing and C&E being more contained relative to cash from operations. We still stand by that overall profile. It is our distinct content to widen out our free cash flow over time once we get into the cash generation phase of these critical projects.","We\u2019ve been in this very unusual capital intensive phase with Gorgon and Wheatstone and these large projects right on the heels of under, we are coming off of that. LNG\u2019s spending this year is going to probably the peak LNG spending, $10 billion to $11 billion. It will trail off in 2015. It will trail off again in 2016. And we don\u2019t have that kind of sequential large projects queued up in the -- beyond that time period. So we\u2019ll come out with a revised target on future year C&E as best we can in March at the Analyst Day meeting.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then one for Jeff. The 20% CAGR if I calculated that right in the Permian is obviously quite impressive for any independent or major, what are the constraints? I mean, the resource is clearly there. What are the constraints on perhaps even going faster, perhaps as you get out into the second half of the decade in the Permian?","Jeff Shellebarger","Okay. Well, I think the basin itself if you look back the last three years, it\u2019s certainly capable of demonstrating that growth potential. I think we are up 0.5 million, we are almost 3 million barrels a day as an industry in that basin. The constraints are what everybody talks about, it\u2019s just basic stuff like the labor force out there. That\u2019s been challenged. It\u2019s a boom time out there.","Water is a area of concern for some people. We work hard on that in terms of moving from fresh water to brackish non-potable drinking water securing those supplies and the infrastructure around that. Sand has been an issue, but I think the service companies and others are starting to address that supply chain issue.","I think the real uncertainty for me is just how high that activity could go and what would be the knock-on effects of that, but you got to look at, there is a lot of companies in there and the current price environment maybe some of that stabilizes out. I don\u2019t see the activity levels that we see being at risk from takeaway capacity or really the contractor\u2019s ability to deliver, and that\u2019s one thing that we take into consideration when we look at our pace of investment.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Asit Sen from Cowen and Company. Your question please.","Asit Sen - Cowen and Company","Thanks. Good morning. Two quick ones here. First, could you update us on Kitimat? The potential timing of FID looks like at least one competing project is getting delayed. And secondly, could you update us on any labor productivity items on the West Coast of Australia in light of recent union agreement on Curtis Island? In other words, are things getting better?","Jeff Shellebarger","I could give a quick update on Kitimat. I will let Pat talk about Australia. So Apache has announced their intent to fully exit the project. We are still committed to this project. We think that the low cost potentially prolific reserves up in the Liard and Horn River are going to make an attractive LNG project in time. We have been very clear that we will not take FID at this project until we have gas contract signed and we know that we have got a value adding economic project.","With respect to FID, we haven\u2019t given a data on that and we continue to do the feed work on the plant, the plant site. We continue to work with the government of British Columbia. We are encouraged by the recent news that\u2019s come out of there with respect to how they want to treat LNG in taxes, but our primary focus up there is really the appraisal and the delineation work that we\u2019ve got going on in the Liard Basin.","Pat Yarrington","Okay. And with regard to the union contract issue in Australia, at this point in time we know that there has been a Downstream agreement reached in-principal with certain construction unions and that it still needs to be put to a vote to the -- by the union membership. So we have agreement at the leadership level, but we still need to vote at the union member level. Frankly there is more dialogue in the press about challenges, union-related challenges for us on this project than there have been reality on the ground.","So the project continues to make a good progress here. And I guess one of the exciting things that I would just mention, we didn\u2019t put it in the formal remarks, but we have secured, I guess I will call it a float-tel, I am not sure what the right hoteling accommodation nomenclature is, but we\u2019ve got the capacity over the next several weeks to bring overtime about 1200 additional workers to the island to work on the MEI work, that\u2019s underway that needs to be done in the next year. So that\u2019s a good boost we think in productivity for that.","Asit Sen - Cowen and Company","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from BMO. Your question please.","Iain Reid - BMO","Hi, there. Pat, I wonder if you could give me an update on the Wheatstone budget. It\u2019s I think about 49% through now in terms of spend. Is it time now that we get a kind of a complete updates in terms of how much that project is going to cost?","Pat Yarrington","Right. I mean at this point. Yes, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re about 49% complete. It is a typical process for us to go through and do a mid project to update. I don\u2019t have a specific calendar date for that but it would be a reasonable thing that we would do anytime between 40% and 60% when the project is done. So I would say, that\u2019s coming but I don\u2019t have a specific date as to when that will be completed.","Iain Reid - BMO","Okay. And maybe as a follow-up on another big international asset, Angola LNG. Can you give us a kind of cost to repair and some schedule for re-startup of that project?","Pat Yarrington","Sure. I can talk a little bit about the schedule side of things but there is not a cost estimate that I am available -- that I have available to give to you. Let me just make sure, we are just a 36% partner in a consortium here. We are not a controlling entity to work through the partnership there. But in terms of the progress on the repair work, we continue to make good progress there. We do at this point anticipate an initial restart somewhere around the middle of 2015. ","And after initial performance testing as it is typical that plant will go down. For a couple of month period of time where we clean out and remove the strainer, clean out the filter et cetera, then it will be brought back online. And we anticipate restarting and working towards sustained production levels late in 2015.","Jeff Shellebarger","Did that answer your question?","Iain Reid - BMO","Yeah. No, it did. Thank you.","Pat Yarrington","Okay. Thank you. All right. I\u2019ll guess, we\u2019ll take the next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allen Good from Morningstar. Your question please.","Allen Good - Morningstar","Good morning, everyone. A couple on the Permian. First of all, when you look around you benchmark yourself against maybe some of your smaller peers there on operating costs and other efficiency metrics. How do you see yourself backing up? And then secondly, on the new projections for growth, would it be -- does it imply a commensurate step-up in spending as well or have you been able to achieve some capital efficiency improvements from your initial projections that suggest that spending won't quite increase as much as the production is?","Jeff Shellebarger","","Yeah. Good questions. We benchmark ourselves all the time. We benchmark ourselves with respect to cost efficiency, or finding the development cost et cetera, et cetera. A year and a half ago, we were probably down at the lower end of our competition, part of that was because we were new in the basin and part of that was because we were focused on the appraisal in some of the other work to really understand what's going on in the basin and these new areas.","And we made a concentrated effort in that area over the last 14 to 16 months. We\u2019ve made significant improvement in our execution efficiency, our cost-efficiency. Today, I would say, we\u2019re probably in the mid-upper part of the second quartile. Our performance targets here to be the top of the heat there and we\u2019re making very, very good progress on getting there.","With respect to how we\u2019re improving and what's going on there, I mean, it\u2019s really a host of thing. Certainly, we are seeing capital efficiency in what we\u2019re doing. So we\u2019ve been able to drill more wells with the same amount of money. We\u2019re seeing efficiencies in our completion. But I think, even more important to that moving to horizontal wells, moving to longer lateral length, moving to more stages, our acreage position allows us to do that and we\u2019re going to see more of an impact on that in our production forecast than probably anything else.","Allen Good - Morningstar","Hey, great. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up. Was the Duvernay sell down, was that included in the original $10 billion estimate of asset sales and then is there any potential upside for that figure over the next couple years?","Pat Yarrington","Yes. So we wouldn\u2019t really talk to what included or excluded in our overall target. Obviously, it\u2019s a significant component there. And in terms of future, I think your second question was is there future effort in that regard? I think that\u2019s \u2026.","Allen Good - Morningstar","I mean, do you think there is -- I'm sorry. Is there upside to that $10 billion figure? Now that you've gone through it a little bit and progressed through do you see upside from your initial estimate?","Pat Yarrington","So I think, that\u2019s going to be a function of what the market is going to allow. We have certain assets which we\u2019ve tried to describe that are either early in life or late in life. We know what those assets are and we\u2019ll as I said only go for the sales when we can get good value. So it will be a function of what the market will look forward at that point in time. But we\u2019re on track for the $10 billion.","We can see our way to that almost at this point in time. Certainly this year 2014 or maybe there will be some slippage into first quarter 2015 of some of the transactions that I\u2019ve line of sight on. But I feel very good about what we fit at this point in time.","Allen Good - Morningstar","Great. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones on LNG. First in relation to Kitimat. With the tax announcement from the BC government earlier this month, is that still a hurdle or are you pretty satisfied with how that went?","","Jeff Shellebarger","Well, that\u2019s just one element of our investment decision. I think that what we\u2019re satisfied with is that the British Colombia Government is very attentive to the realities of the industry. They\u2019ve listened to what we\u2019ve said. They listened to what the buyers have said. And I think they\u2019ve made some very good moves in terms of what reality is out there and what it takes to make these projects economic. I mean, there are -- we\u2019ve got to work a whole lot of other issues between now and FID. And I think they'll remain. Our view is that they will continue to remain flexible in those discussions.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Okay. And then you mentioned you want to sign offtakes for Kitimat before FID, but you also have some remaining capacity at Gorgon, which as I understand is still not covered by offtake. Are you prioritizing one versus the other if a particular customer is open to either option?","Pat Yarrington","Well, I think the fundamental driver there is that the volumes would be available under different time frame. I mean Gorgon production starts in a year from now and ramps up with three trains over the subsequent years. Kitimat was going to be in a much longer term horizon there. Just speaking to the Gorgon unallocated volumes or uncontracted volume at this point time, yes, we are sitting at about 65%.","We did have notionally some of that volume earmarked for as a backstop behind IDD from a customer arrangement standpoint. Now that the Indonesian deepwater is no longer going forward on that same development time plan, we are available to take some of those volumes that we had earmarked there and market them. And that\u2019s exactly what we're doing now.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Okay. That\u2019s useful. I appreciate it.","Pat Yarrington","Okay. So I think that ends our queue at this particular point in time. So I'd like to thank everybody on the call for your interest in Chevron and your participation with questions. We wish you a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5009":["Chevron Corp.

Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Frank Mount, the General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two.","Turning to slide three, today we announced a quarterly loss and annual results that were significantly below prior years. Pat will walk you through the financial details, but prior to that, I would like to provide a few thoughts. In 2015 we delivered strong underlying operating results. We had one of our best years in personal safety, process safety and environmental performance. On most measures, we either matched 2014's record low or set new lows in 2015.","The downstream business produced strong financial performance underpinned by one of the best years ever in terms of facility utilization and reliability. In upstream, we grew production by 2%, within the guidance we provided a year ago. Additionally, we logged a five-year reserve replacement ratio of 113%.","Despite the strong operating results, an oversupplied market led to prices fall to levels not seen since 2014. As expected, our financial results suffered. Across the corporation, we are responding to this low-price environment. Our priorities remain completing projects under construction and reducing spend, both operating expense and capital, to levels consistent with current conditions. We will also continue to divest assets where we can obtain a good value. Our number one financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend. We have a strong balance sheet for precisely transition times like this.","Pat will now take you through our financial results.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Okay, thanks John. I will be presenting three slides on our financial results. Additional earnings and production variance slides along with a tabulation of special items are available in the appendix section of the presentation on our website.","Turning now to slide four, an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter loss was $588 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange, impairments and other special items, earnings for the quarter totaled $491 million or $0.26 per share. For the year, earnings were $4.6 billion, or $5.6 billion excluding special items and foreign exchange. Return on capital employed was 2.5% and our debt ratio at year end was approximately 20%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends, bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.28 per share. 2015 was the 28th consecutive year of annual per share dividend increases.","Turning to slide five, cash generated from operations was $4.6 billion during the fourth quarter and $19.5 billion for the full year. Fourth quarter cash flow declined because of lower commodity prices and lower downstream margins. Proceeds from asset sales for 2015 were $5.7 billion, bringing our two year total to more than $11 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $7.4 billion for the quarter and $29.5 billion for the full year. At year end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $11 billion. During 2015, we borrowed approximately $11 billion and at year end our net debt stood at $27 billion resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 15%.","Slide six compares 2015 full year earnings with 2014. Earnings for 2015 were $4.6 billion or approximately $14.7 billion lower than the 2014 results. Special items such as asset impairments, project suspensions and other charges, along with lower gains on asset sales, reduced earnings between periods by $3.1 billion while the change in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by approximately $300 million.","Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased $14.6 billion between periods, as lower realizations were only slightly offset by higher liftings, lower operating costs and other items. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $2.2 billion, primarily due to higher margins. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects lower tax items.","I'd like to now turn it back to John.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, we are aggressively reducing investment and driving cost out of our business. During 2015, total spend was down approximately $9 billion or more than 12%. Capital outlays alone were down $6 billion. Part of this reduction was long scheduled as in-progress major capital projects were completed and outlays ramped down. In addition, capital expenditure savings were achieved because of deliberate choices being made to reprioritize and repace investments and by challenging supply chain costs.","Operating expenses also declined between years. The largest impact occurred in our upstream and corporate segments, reflecting purposeful initiatives to rationalize head count and boost workflow efficiencies. In upstream, declining cost in growing production led to a lower operating cost per barrel, which is expected to exceed 10% when the final results are reported in our 10-K. Looking to 2016, we expect to see additional spend reduction in the range of 13% to 18% as the full year run rate effects of many of the 2015 initiatives come to bear and incremental cost saving projects are implemented.","Turn to slide eight. Our investment priorities remain consistent. We will fund investments to ensure safe, reliable operations, complete the projects already under construction, enable investment in high-return short cycle opportunities and preserve options for viable long-cycle projects. In December we announced a 2016 capital program of $26.6 billion, which was within the guidance range provided on our third quarter earnings call. Since then, market conditions have deteriorated and we will be responsive. Flexibility in our capital program allows discretion in our spend with a likely outcome for 2016 being near the bottom of our guidance range. Looking beyond 2016, our flexibility will continue to increase and we expect further reductions in our capital program.","Turning to slide nine. Divestitures are a normal part of our portfolio work. We will divest assets that no longer have a strategic fit or do not compete for capital with our other investment alternatives. Our asset sales program has been successful as well-timed transactions have captured good value and generated $11.5 billion in cash through the end of 2015. Over 2016 and 2017 we are targeting another $5 billion to $10 billion in investments.","Publicly known in-progress transactions include New Zealand and South Africa downstream businesses, the Hawaii refinery, upstream and pipeline assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and gas storage assets in Canada. Additional opportunities are being pursued and will be disclosed in due course when commercial sensitivities permit. In all cases, we will only sell assets where we can realize fair value.","Turning to slide 10. In 2015 we grew annual production by 2%. Ramp-ups at major capital projects including Jack\/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bibiyana expansion in Bangladesh, along with shale and tight production growth of approximately 30% contributed to increased volumes. Additionally, current prices benefited production through PSC and other entitlement effects. Offsetting the increases was the effect of a shut-in of the Partitioned Zone production, the impact of asset sales and a base decline of less than 2%.","For 2016, our production guidance is a range of flat to 4% growth. The uncertainty is a reflection of market conditions, current activities and divestments. To clarify, production from the Partitioned Zone remains shut in. The exact timing of production restart is unknown and dependent on dispute resolutions between sovereign states. Contributions from major capitals project startups and ramp ups will be significant in 2016 and small movements in timing or the pace of ramp-ups can make a significant difference in annual production. Uncertainty in exact timing and precise composition of asset divestments will be another variable because we are value-driven on all sales. Finally, current market conditions will create impacts related to PSC and other pricing-related entitlement effects. Additionally, low prices will restrict our overall spend levels, which in turn will result in somewhat higher base decline rates.","Turning to slide 11, our reserve replacement in 2015 was 107%. We saw significant adds in our shale and tight assets, which reflects strong well performance results and new geologic data in these plays. Additional volumes were booked based upon development drilling results at Wheatstone. Strong base business performance resulted in positive reserve revisions including Tengiz, Thailand, Nigeria and the Gulf of Mexico. Commodity price impact benefited entitlement volumes for profit sharing and variable royalty contracts. Our five-year reserve replacement ratio is 113%.","Now let's talk about progress on our major capital projects starting with Gorgon. Turning to slide 12, at Gorgon system commissioning from train 1 is in the final stages with key process units starting up, a cooldown cargo delivered and system cooling under way. The first LNG production is expected within the next few weeks with first cargo anticipated soon after that. We'll be ramping up train 1 in the months ahead. Gas for a train 1 startup will come from Io-Jansz wells. These wells have been successfully flow tested, and initial performance indications look good. On trains 2 and 3, all modules have been delivered to site and construction is progressing. Lessons learned from train 1 are being applied and key milestones are being achieved on schedule, with startups expected at approximately six-month intervals after train 1.","Turning to Wheatstone on slide 13. On the upstream portion of the project, hookup and commissioning of the offshore platform is progressing. The trunkline is ready for service, and final tie-in work is ongoing. Six of nine wells are drilled and completed offering sufficient well capacity for the first train. At the plant site, the operations center and LNG loading jetty are complete, and tank hydro testing is ongoing. As previously communicated, initial module fabrication in Malaysia was delayed. We were successful in mitigating further delays, and all modules required for train 1 are now on site. Piping and cabling work is ongoing. The pace of this work will determine critical path towards first LNG, which is expected to be mid-year 2017. Train 2 module deliveries are underway and on track.","Turning to slide 15. I've just run through the steps we've already taken to improve our financial results and to be responsive to current market conditions. On the elements we control, operating expenses, capital outlays and project execution, you can expect even more improvements in 2016. However, price remains a significant uncertainty. I'll come back to that in just a minute. What I would like to talk about is other projects that we have that are also contributing to our performance.","If you look at the chart on page 14, you'll see that we have significant progress on new projects. We have the Lianzi and Moho Nord, which came on in the fourth quarter. Chuandongbei, the first train on Chuandongbei, has come online. And here in January of 2016, we're seeing progress on Angola LNG as recommissioning is under way. We expect to introduce gas to the plant later this quarter and have first LNG cargo in the second quarter. Mafumeira Sul in Angola, Bangka in Indonesia, and Alder in the North Sea are also progressing towards expected startup later in the year.","I mentioned that price is a very significant uncertainty to us going forward. If you look at slide 15, you'll see a chart that was put together by WoodMac. This obviously represents a significant source of uncertainty in cash flows going forward. Consistent with many of you, we believe demand will continue to grow. The larger wild card, or uncertainty if you will, is supply. Non-OPEC liquids production, which is shown on this chart, remained much more resilient in 2015 than most predicted. With the significant contraction in global investment caused by low prices, the world would see supplies drop off. WoodMac shows that occurring this year, thereby pushing the oil market into better balance. Until that balance occurs, prices will continue to be constrained and the financial damage to the energy sector seen in 2015 will continue.","Relative to balance sheet strength and growing flexibility in our spend, Chevron will be advantaged relative to the others in this industry as prices rebound. We are well positioned to benefit when the market does balance and prices begin to rise because of the leverage that we have and our growing production profile.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up, if necessary. We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Phil.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for all the color today. The dividend coverage priority is obviously key and very clear. On the third quarter call, you built us a bridge to cover the dividend with free cash flow by 2017, which looked fairly reasonable in the $50 or so environment and you highlight the flexibility for 2016 in the slide. So I guess what I was wondering is looking out to 2017, if we're sub $50, how low can you realistically go with additional CapEx and OpEx cuts before you feel like you might need asset sales or the balance sheet to bridge the gap? Is there a level of CapEx you really don't want to go below?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, our flexibility continues to grow, and Phil, we're obviously working that number very closely. The level of spend, if we continue to see the kinds of prices that we're seeing now, the cost of goods and services will continue to decline. We've got the impact of foreign exchange rates, et cetera. The biggest change between what we'll spend this year and next year is really the ramp down from major capital projects. So for example, this year we'll be spending about $6 billion on LNG projects around the world. Obviously finishing Angola LNG, and then as we wind down Gorgon and have a little more to spend on Wheatstone, we expect next year that spend will be under $2 billion. So you gain $4 billion right there, and then our flexibility grows as time goes by.","We obviously have to invest to keep our operations reliable. We will still have some projects that are under construction and being completed and additional commitments in drilling off of platforms and things of that sort. But I think our flexibility is significant. We gave you a range of $20 billion to $24 billion, but we're going to continue to drive that number down. I guess my overall message is that we're going to continue to live within our means that we have. And it obviously makes sense to finish the projects under construction.","We have a strong balance sheet. And maybe I'll offer a couple of comments in that area, because a lot of people ask. I've given the priority is to pay and grow the dividend, and in order to do that, obviously you do have to invest in the business because we are a depleting resource business. So those are always the first two priorities that we have consistent with good economics on the spending. We've indicated that we're in a long-cycle business. And in such a long-cycle business where you can have ups and downs in the commodity markets and you get started on long-cycle projects, you need a strong balance sheet. And so we have always advertised that and indicated that a AA rating was what we were looking for. And that's really indicative of needing to have a strong balance sheet.","But the reason you keep a strong balance sheet is so you can withstand the ups and downs in the business, and right now we're in the downs with prices low. And so we'll use our balance sheet this year, almost regardless of where prices are during the year, and we're going to cut costs. We're going to reduce spend where we can, and that flexibility grows in time. We work very closely with the rating agencies. We've talked to the rating agencies. They see our internal forecasts around our business. They see more than you do, in other words. And so we'll be very clear where our priorities are and where the flexibility is. And then they have to do their job. But we think that we'll retain a very strong balance sheet and the ability to withstand these ups and downs.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's very helpful, thanks. And then just on the projects, I appreciate all the updates there. Maybe you could just let us know where you stand on the FID for Tengiz, and given what you've been saying about the macro environment and how long it's going to last, where does that stand today?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well as you know Phil, it's a good question. Tengiz as you know has been a very good business for us in Kazakhstan. We and our partners have had very good relationships there, and we've had a lot of success, financial and otherwise. And the next phase of opportunity there is the wellhead pressure management project and the future growth project. And we've been working this for some time. And we consciously delayed FID when prices came down. We consciously delayed FID so that we could get additional definition around the project, get greater certainty around what the costs would be. And frankly to drive costs down, given the opportunity that is present given conditions in the industry, and we've had some success with that. But we're not at the point where we're ready to take FID today.","With low prices that we're seeing, we're working closely with our partners to ensure that we have adequate funding for the project and to further take costs down. We have been pacing investment. We've been doing critical infrastructure work, but we're still working this project to get it in condition for FID. So I think you'll see us continue to pace investments and we'll keep you updated when we can. We do think these projects are good. We do think that they will go forward. But we're continuing to work it to drive costs down and get alignment on financing.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Phil, appreciate it.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question, please.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys, good morning.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","John, two questions if I may. For 2016 you give a range of $25 billion at the low end and you indicate that given the market condition, you'll most likely to go down to $25 billion. If you really have to, are there are any additional area that you would be willing to cut and drive it down further? And what that area and by how much, or that this is really the minimum that you can go, given the major project spending?","The second question if I could is a quick one: We understand that you have one of the strongest balance sheets, but the credit agencies are also becoming increasingly hostile to the energy sector and looks like they may have a sector downgrade anyway. So what may be the minimum credit rating that is acceptable by the company?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well in terms of flexibility, when it comes to capital program, we've given you that range for a good reason. As I indicated, we've got some committed spend that's likely to go forward regardless of the price environment, and really it pertains to the big LNG projects and the projects that are under construction. So we're going to continue to work spend down. And there's always a little bit more flexibility. There's the uncertainty of exchange rates and things of that sort. But I don't want to flag a significant reduction below the range, below the $26.6 billion that's in our budget and below the range that we've talked about, because I don't want to shut in all rigs around the world, for example.","There are obviously are things you could do that I don't think are the proper things to do, given our expectations going forward. For example, we've done terrific work in the Permian Basin to get our costs down and we want to keep that momentum going. So we have six operated rigs. There are 14 non-operated rigs. We want to continue that activity. Our group has done a terrific job of getting costs down. And obviously at $30, every business is stressed, but we think that supplies are going to be needed and we want to continue the activity that we have there. Need to continue to drive down costs, but want to continue that activity. So there's a little bit more room, but I don't want to flag something outside the range.","Maybe I'll let \u2013 I offered some comments on sort of the philosophy, but maybe I'll let Pat talk a little bit about interaction with the rating agencies and her view on what sort of minimum requirements might be.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so as John said, the rating agencies need to do what the rating agencies need to do and they have conservative oil price scenarios out there and I think that's understandable. If you were in their position, you would be doing the same thing. And I think it's perfectly reasonable to think Chevron, along with everybody in the industry in this particular price environment, would be up for review. They've indicated that many of the companies are up for a review. I'm certain that Chevron will be in that queue right after the first tiering goes through. So if a downgrade does occur, and I think they're moving in that direction, but if that were to occur, we would not be the only one that that would happen to. I don't see it materially impacting our cost of funds or materially impacting our ability to secure financing.","And in terms of a minimum, I guess I don't think of it that way. We have a strong balance sheet, even if there were to be a downgrade. We have a very strong balance sheet, amongst the strongest in the industry. And we've already committed and said multiple times that we are going to get balanced. We will live within our cash flows. And I think that is the profile that we put forward to the rating agencies.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll just say, you asked about flexibility on CapEx for 2016. I don't want to suggest there isn't additional flexibility for 2017 and 2018 because there is, particularly if lower prices persist. But we've given you a range that reflects what we think today, based on the forward look. Obviously if conditions remain where they are today, we'll review those numbers just as we would all our other operating statistics.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Paul.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thank you, and hi everyone. I just wanted to ask about, as you're reviewing potential capital expenditure reductions, how the deepwater program actually fits into this discussion. Because I note a string of successes in both exploration and appraisal that's occurring in the deepwater right now. So how do you think about that drilling program? And then secondly within the deepwater, how do you see that competing over the medium term? Do you still see that as being within the cost curve based upon your own projections of where oil prices could go?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jason, it's a great question and it's one of the areas that I think we and others in the industry are looking at very closely. And I guess if I can take just a second to sort of to back up a little bit. If you look at the macro environment on where supplies are going to come from to meet any demand estimate that might be out there, the world's going to need deepwater oil. It is a significant resource, and over time those barrels are going to be needed. Now, right now the costs in the deepwater haven't come down quite as fast as they have onshore. We obviously have seen some rig rate reductions, but in general as we get to deeper and deeper water, some projects are challenged. We have mentioned last year in our analyst meeting that we felt it would take larger accumulations to make some of these deepwater projects successful, so the precise numbers are being worked. But you're going to need bigger accumulations and larger hubs in order to justify the infrastructure. And then tiebacks similarly will need somewhat higher prices.","We have some special charges in the fourth quarter, and $0.5 billion was writing off Buckskin and Moccasin. And that's a project that we thought would go forward. First, we thought it might have the potential to be a hub, and then we thought it had the potential to be a tieback. And I won't say that that project couldn't have gone forward and that it wouldn't meet minimum thresholds depending upon your forward view of prices. But relative to our alternatives, we felt that for the foreseeable future, we've got better places to put our money. And so we made the very difficult decision to not go forward with that project. And so the clock was ticking where it was going to require a couple billion dollars of investments over the next few years. And we just felt over the next few years, we're going to have better places to put our money, notably the Permian.","So there are tough choices being made. Now, we have a good position in the deepwater. We've been as successful as anyone there. And we have been successful in driving costs down. We've seen I mean really unbelievable progress last year. We had a 30% reduction in days per 10,000 feet in 2015 versus 2014. So our experience in the lower tertiary, in particular, we're getting better and better at understanding it and driving costs down. We're encouraged by what we've got at Anchor. We've got some appraisal work that's undergoing there. We've got another potential hub development with a group of fields that we had put together with a couple of partners in the industry to try to create a hub class development. But this is a work in progress for us to make sure we can have a resource cost balance to make these projects attractive to meet our thresholds. I'm confident we'll be able to do that. It's just we were pushed with Buckskin and Moccasin, and you're seeing others make similar choices if it doesn't quite fit relative to their alternatives.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Appreciate those thoughts, John. If I could ask a real quick follow-up. The $1.1 billion write-down that you had in the upstream, are you able to provide any split between exploration and depreciation on that?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Why don't I let Pat give you a little bit of color on some of those. Because you're right, it's important to know which. It does hit multiple lines on the income statement, and you saw that those numbers were up a little bit.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so I would just say for the full year, if you look at the income statement, the X, the special items that are categorized under exploration expense would be about $1.1 billion. And if you look at the full year for DD&A off the income statement, the special items amount to about $3.5 billion.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","That's great. Thanks very much, folks.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. I think you're going to get 17 different questions on the same theme, but just you talked about $20 billion, $24 billion of CapEx in 2017 and 2018, and I think on the last call you mentioned sort of a slower rate of growth, 1% to 1.5%. Obviously that rate of growth would also help project execution and hopefully costs will come down. If you were to go down to a lower number of terminal sort of CapEx for a period, maybe just talk a bit about the growth implications beyond 2017. How would it affect the growth rate? And then I have a follow-on.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm not sure I'll be answer to that fully here. I think we'll probably give you, we will give you a more complete answer when we get to March where we have a chance to run through it. But I would just say, if you look at growth not just through 2017, but through 2018, we feel pretty good about it. And that's largely a function of the projects we have in flight. In 2018, you'll have a full year of production obviously from our big LNG projects, which you won't have in 2017. We also have other projects that remain under construction now that will come on during that period, projects like Hebron in Canada and Big Foot and others that will come on in that window. So we'll have continuing momentum from those projects, and we'll be ramping up our shale activity during that period, notably in the Permian. So I think the profile will be attractive beyond 2017.","Now ultimately the cumulative effect of the reductions in capital, if they persist at a low level, will be felt. But I think we'll have a little more resilience than people think. Now, that's other things being equal, depending upon where prices are, depending upon asset sales and things of that sort. But in terms of what sort of spend do you need to sustain production indefinitely, that would be a function of a lot of things, notably the cost environment that we see. I do think that our position in the Permian gives us a little bit of an advantage over others during this period because you've seen some of the numbers we've given you previously. We have the capability to ramp that up and mitigate some of the declines. So even if we see a slight increase in our base decline, which has been tracking at under 2%, even if that goes up a little bit, we should be able to substantially mitigate a lot of that through the activity that we have in the shale. But we'll try to give you a little longer-term outlook in our upcoming meeting in March if that's okay.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then the follow-on is on the OpEx and SG&A part of that reduction of 13% to 18% from $61 billion down to a lower number. I mean, obviously the market helps give you some OpEx and then there's some structural changes that you've made, some difficult decisions. I mean, should we think that there's another big structural shift that you can make to maybe even outpace the market in terms of OpEx and SG&A reductions, say into 2017?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're working really hard and we're pulling all levers. Obviously, though, the cost in goods and services in our procurement group is having a fair degree of success. I will say we've had more success in the US than internationally, number one. And so we'll continue to drive that hard. That's just a function of contracts and the competitive environment overseas. So one, we'll be working that very hard. We'll be working additional efficiencies.","Just as an example, we still have reorganizations in flight. So our employee count was down about 3,200 between the end of 2014 to the end of 2015. There are another 4,000 coming this year and a lot of that work is ongoing right now. So we're being careful. We're pretty thoughtful about the way we do this sort of work to make sure that we keep the right people in our organization for the longer term. But the reality is activity is likely to be lower and we do have a number of projects that we'll be ramping down. Now, we're going to work to be fair about how we do that so that we keep a lot of the great talent that we have that's been working around the world. But there's no question we're looking at organizations and have a number of reorganizations in flight. So our desire is to keep moving that.","Now, I will say on a dollar basis, when you're growing production and bringing on new assets, you have operating expense that you will incur. That's why we gave you the unit OpEx number. But we drove that one down. There's still some final allocations for what goes in the 10-K in the oil and gas disclosure, but it's down over $2 per barrel and I think that general trend, we're going to continue to drive that number down.","Remember in our OpEx, 40% of our OpEx is downstream. And our downstream had record performance this year, and as you know they've had restructuring under way for some time. And it's not that they're immune from some of the efforts we have to reduce costs, but I don't think you'll see a structural shift in our downstream costs. The corporate center we've obviously looked at and made some significant changes. A lot of people left the payroll in December, and so those benefits will be felt and the ongoing work that I've described in the upstream. So my message is we're driving it hard, but we're trying to be thoughtful so that we keep the talent we need for the long haul in the organization.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Makes sense, thank you.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Ed.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI Group. Your question, please.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","I wanted to get some clarity on the 0% to 4% growth projection and the point that John made a few minutes ago about higher decline rates. And specifically, is it reasonable to assume that we're going to have growth this year from the United States, Africa and Australia and declines elsewhere? Is that the accurate way to think about it?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Africa, Australia, and the United States.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Yeah.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that is a pretty good way to look at it. We tend to look at it by project. But we do have obviously the shale and tight that's growing and ongoing ramp up in the deepwater. Obviously, the projects in Australia and then Angola, and volume from Angola LNG. So I think that's a pretty good characterization of it, yes.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Okay. And then also, John, on the neutral zone, there's been some more commentary on progress and so my question is, is the project real to your knowledge? And if it is, if we are seeing progress underway, what period of time could those fields return to full production if in fact there was movement, meaning is this something we should think about in terms of weeks or months or quarters? So just an update there would be appreciated.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry, I missed the first part of it, which location?","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Yeah, John, on the neutral zone there's been some commentary.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry. Yeah, in the Partitioned Zone, look, I gave you guys a long explanation last quarter. The fields, they're still shut in and there have been ongoing dialogue between the Saudis and the Kuwaitis. And as I described before, there's plenty of incentive to bring those fields back online and I probably have to leave it there.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What I'll tell you, implicit in our assumption is about, is a mid-year startup. The middle of that range includes a mid-year startup, but remember 2014 production was about 80,000 barrels a day. When you start up mid year, you don't start up at 80,000, you start out at something lower than that because the facilities have been mothballed and preserved for a period of time. So that's what's reflected. To the extent that agreement is reached, and there have been discussions, to the extent agreement is reached and it's started up sooner, it'll be to the higher end of that range and to the extent that it continues, the bottom of the range is zero if they don't start up at all this year.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay, fair enough, John. Thanks a lot.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning everybody.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","John, I know I've kind of tried this one before, but in light of the further collapse in oil prices, I wanted to ask again about growth versus growth per share. And what's really behind my question is whether investing in a highly uncertain environment in what I'm guessing are potentially sub-economic assets, is it an argument just for outright deferral and outright declines that can be picked up again through share buybacks, if indeed oil prices did recover absent any major capital commitments? I'm just wondering philosophically how you think about that, given the potential risk to your credit rating that we stand right now.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No Doug, actually I think it's a fair question. I mean the message I've been trying to convey is that we are dramatically cutting investment going forward. We all have to make estimates of what oil and gas prices will be going forward, but in terms of longer-cycle projects, we aren't initiating any. As I've described, we've got some momentum in the system from projects under construction, but we are, you are going to see us preferentially favor short-cycle investments. And if they don't meet our hurdles, we won't invest. Taken to the extreme, we're not just going to invest to hold volume. We're going to invest where we think we can get good returns.","And so we've repurchased shares in the past and we'll do that again. We won't fund opportunities that we don't think will be effective for the company. And you and I can both put some hindsight on some of the things that we and others in the industry have put money in right now, but we're tightly scrutinizing what we're spending right now. And I hope I can make that really clear to you. I mean, that's indicative of the kinds of choices we made with Buckskin Moccasin. It's indicative of the kind of changes we've made with a big development in the North Sea. That's the direction that we're going, again trying to balance our expectations for the forward curve.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","I appreciate your answer, John. I know it's not fun for anyone right now. My follow-up is really, I don't know who wants to take this, but it's on the asset sales. There seems to be, everybody and their grandmother seems to be looking to sell assets right now. I'm just wondering if you could characterize how you see the depth of the market, and whether or not you think you can still execute on that program. And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no, that's a real good question. In fact, I think your point is spot-on. I think it's a terrible market to be trying to sell most assets out there, particularly obviously oil-related assets. And that's why I've been pretty circumspect around asset sales. We sold $11 billion over the last two years, but we're giving you a $5 billion to $10 billion for the next two years in the numbers that I've given you. And from a strategic point of view, there's some opportunities out there that I think will be tough to execute. And if we can't execute them, we won't sell them.","If you look at the kinds of things we have sold, we've gotten very good value. So for example over the last two years, there was a lot of strength in the infrastructure market selling pipelines, for example. And on strategy grounds and on valuation grounds, we felt that we were going to limit our investments in the pipeline business to those that are critical to our upstream and downstream sector and we can sell those. Things like Caltex Australia, we thought values were very strong and assets had \u2013 we'd been very well aligned with them, but they were heading off potentially in a growth direction. And we felt that from our strategic point of view that it'd be best to exit when we did.","So we've been very careful. And I can tell you the assets going forward, we don't advertise them, but if you look at the ones where there's information in the public domain, I think you'll see that those are assets where there are potential buyers out there at good value. So I think your admonition is a very good one, and it's why we haven't put big numbers out there.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, John, you answered the Tengiz question before, yet are there any FIDs that are currently baked into 2016 and your 2017 to 2018 budget ranges? And I guess as it relates to CapEx, I mean how much flexibility is there to open or reprice contracts within projects post-FID? It appears to be there's more flexibility than at least what we had perceived?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously for any project we had in flight, we went back to all the project teams and created an expectation that they will look to try to capture cost reductions. In some cases where you've bid contracts and the terms and conditions are fixed, you are where you are. But on anything where you have not taken FID, you have some flexibility to go back to the providers of those services. And that's why we've delayed our costs. I mean, part of the recycle of the projects is to see if there's a different development scheme and things like that.","For example, Rosebank has a different development scheme. But part of it is also to be sure you can capture the cost reductions that are available, that might be available in the marketplace. And sometimes you have to just say we're not going to do this if we don't get better costs, and that tends to focus partners and others. So we expect to see declining breakevens as a result of those initiatives, both to reframe projects in some cases, or to try to drive costs out.","In terms of what we've got actually planned, most of the effort, most of the things that we would call FIDs are really things like infill drilling. So for example, the next phase of drilling at Agbami, the next phase of drilling at Jack\/St. Malo, which are utilizing existing rigs and drilling off of existing to support existing infrastructure. In terms of big new greenfield projects, it's relatively few. There are some that could be in the budget, but it's going to depend on that price\/cost balance I've been talking about. And that's why I say we have significant flexibility going forward as we complete things like Gorgon, Wheatstone, Mafumeira Sul, Angola LNG and others.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, so it sounds like they're not currently in the budget. Let me just add a follow-up question or a smaller item. Are the startup volumes at Gorgon, are they at spot or contract pricing, and can you give us any color or update on the spot LNG market and whether you see an ability to term up any incremental uncontracted Gorgon volumes? And I'll leave it at that.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, in general the sales will be under contract. In fact, you've probably seen recently we have signed a couple of additional HOAs. We said all along that we thought that it's appropriate to have about 85% under long-term contract for Gorgon and Wheatstone. And with those HOAs, assuming those turn into SBAs, we'll be over 80%. So we feel pretty good about that. And those are medium-term type contracts that we've put in place. So we feel good about it. But during the ramp up, we've got contracts that are available for these volumes. Now as far as the overall LNG market, it's lousy. When you look at spot cargos and prices, and I expect we're going to go through a challenging, as an industry, we're going to go through a challenging period for any volumes that will be sold spot into the marketplace.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Appreciate it.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Evan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Question, maybe you've talked kind of indirectly a bit about your view towards the short cycle on the US onshore in the near term, and I appreciate some of that color. But can you talk about trends and activity levels and volumes, in particularly in the Permian? And I guess just in a broader sense how you look to manage the short cycle spend over the near to medium term. I mean it sounds like it's clearly taking preference over long-cycle spend, but what's dictating the difference between spending $3 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion and so on? How do you manage that over the medium term?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's a fair question. I mean the short answer is there's some judgment that we're applying. We have been on a pathway in the Permian of first assessing what we have. So we've been drilling both vertical and horizontal wells. Over the last year, we've really converted our entire program to horizontal wells, and really getting, an overused term, but getting our factory model in place. And we've done that. And our costs are now very competitive with some of the best in the business. So that is taking place and we want to continue that effort. Our view is not that prices are going to stay at the low range they are today.","But part of living within your means is limiting just how many rigs you deploy. We've got six operated rigs today. We got 14 in our JV rigs that are operating today, and we think that's about the right balance. We have flexibility to move up. And what I've told our people, if they stay on the cost trajectory that they are, we're going to look to fund them. The economics in some of the best areas at strip type prices work. They're not as good as we'd like at higher prices, but they work. And so that obviously is guiding us, but I would hate to lose the momentum that we have in the Permian with some of the cost reduction efforts we have under way. We've told you, we got 3,000 locations that we think meet economic threshold at $50. So obviously, prices aren't $50 today, but it's indicative of the strength of the portfolio that we have.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one kind of step-back question. We spend a lot of time these days talking about how rough everything is and all the costs that are having to be cut. But maybe if you tick around and just look at the other side, can you address any positives or opportunities that you're seeing? I mean, a resetting of the cost structure is clearly one, but anything that you're seeing emerge as you look towards your position in your business for the next cycle, some of the positive things whether it's resource capture or fiscal terms, or any other opportunities that are kind of a silver lining of what we're seeing right now?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you for a silver lining question. We're looking for those internally too. You're right, it is very tough times. A couple thoughts that I'll give you. One, I think the cost reductions we're going after, most of them will be permanent. For example, the efficiencies that we've gained in our drilling, those are permanent regardless of what happens to rig rates going forward, so whether it's a deepwater that I talked about earlier or onshore. So that's number one.","Number two, I think the benefits that we're taking on in some of our organizations and some of our structures, I think a lot of that will be permanent, and I think we've undervalued what simplicity in org structures can provide. So obviously we're taking out some layers. We've got rolling reorganizations that are being implemented around the world, and I think that simplicity and clarity will be a positive for the business.","In terms of resource capture, there are better opportunities today than there might have been a year ago. And the balance between what I'll say the expectations and value of resources getting better aligned. So there are opportunities emerging. I mean, our priority is obviously the things I've been talking about this morning. But we are in a resource business and you do want to be attentive to the opportunities that are out there.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Ryan.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","John, you made the comment that non-OPEC supply has been relatively resilient over the course of the year. You also made the point that the base decline rates was less than 2% in your portfolio over the course of this year. How does that compare relative to history? And as you look at 2016, how do you think your base decline rate looks like towards the midpoint of guidance?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In general, I mean the two are somewhat related. Our base decline has been good because we've operated very reliably and we've actually gotten quite efficient in our business. So we have been able to mitigate the declines. We've also flagged though, that with the lower level of spending on base business, infill drilling in places like Bakersfield and elsewhere, you are going to see declines slightly higher. And so that's why we've suggested that, and we do expect to see that across the industry. The history has shown during downturns like this, you can see an increase of 1% or 2% industry-wide in that base decline, so that is, I think that's clear.","In terms of the resiliency that we've seen in production, it's partly related to that. But to me it's been, if you look at 2015, the impact of projects that were in flight has probably been more than we as an industry anticipated. So we're not the only ones with Jack\/St. Malos and Bibiyanas and other projects that are under construction that are coming up. Secondly of course, you've had the impact of hedges in the unconventional business, and the brief uptick that took place in the middle of 2015 in prices did allow some additional hedges. So you've still got a few hedges that are out there in the industry in 2016 that will allow some level of activity.","But increasingly, all that's wearing off as all the projects come online, as base business declines start to take over and as hedges are no longer available. And so I think that's why you're seeing those volumes.","The other piece that I've consistently said has been underrepresented is the stress around the world, the stress on host governments, the stress on those government partners, national oil companies and others. And you've seen announcements that have been made because while we tend to think of living within our means as a function of forward capital spend, for host governments living within their means is social, the choice between social spending and reinvesting in the business. And you've seen some of those choices play out in the guidance that's been given by host governments to national oil companies in certain countries. So I think the cumulative weight of all this action will tend to bring things into balance. You still have potential sources of supply out there. Obviously Iran is bringing volumes on, but I think the trend is inexorable.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Neil.","Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Frank.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, good morning, everybody. John, you've part answered this question. My original question was going back to the volumes. It looks like quite a big percentage range, but in barrels a day it's only about 100,000 barrels a day for 2016, that's to say the 0% to 4% range of uncertainty. You part answered the question because you addressed the partitioned neutral zone. Can you talk a bit about the variances in the other elements, so how much volume potentially variances there in the startups, the divestments, the price effects and the spend levels? Because it feels like that 100,000 variance actually is not that wide. It seems big in percentage but not so much volume. Thanks.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a very good observation. The range is wide. And you've got multiple moving parts in the business. Let me see if I can give you a little bit of color.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just if you look at the difference between $30 and $60 per barrel, just on price effects, it can be over 100,000 barrels a day for that alone. And so you're right, there is a range there. And what happens in a place like Indonesia for example, for a given level of spend and you have cost barrel reimbursement, the lower the price, the more barrels you get. And these curves aren't all linear in different locations around the world, so there is considerable variability from price alone.","If you think about ramp-up of production, I'll give you an example on Gorgon. Gorgon, the three trains at Gorgon, our share is a little over 200,000 barrels a day. So if you think about each train is 65,000 to 70,000 barrels a day, and we've said that we expect production to commence within a few weeks. There's an industry curve. There are industry averages around ramp-up schedule that takes place over a period of months. To the extent you're at the high end of that range where you have a smooth startup, we have the well capacity, so you could have a very rapid ramp-up.","Our people in Australia don't know what they don't know and so we have taken more of an average approach. And to the extent you encounter something unusual, you can be on the downside of that. Our people in Angola LNG at this point are pretty gun shy because we've had challenges, but that's 60,000 barrels a day. And we've said that we expect to be introducing gas later this quarter and to have cargos in the second quarter, but there's variability around that in the ramp-up. And so all of those \u2013 and by the way, there's a second train at Gorgon as well later this year. So all of those can impact the pace of development. And then there's just the outright spend that's a function of rigs and activity. I think it's fair to say that if we keep seeing prices in the low $30s, we're going to drop rigs as the price moves on.","And the last piece, and it's one that I won't provide much in the way of specifics, is really divestments. Because we've indicated for example that our shallow water, our shelf activities that we have packages for sale out there, and those have some volumes attached to them. And then there's some other potential assets in the upstream that are under consideration, but it really depends on getting value and the timing of those. And so that is why you get a range. And you are correct, the range can be broader than indicated there. But I felt if I gave you any broader range, you'd say this wasn't very helpful.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alistair Syme from Citi. Your question, please.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thanks very much. John, can I just come back to your comment on the divestment market. You said it's a terrible market for selling assets, therefore I guess it must be a great market for buying. Appreciate the balance sheet constraints, but what leads you away from temptation?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What leads me away from temptation. Well just, I know you've heard me over the years, but if I just to ground everyone that's on the phone, we've said over many years that we're in the resource business. It's declining, and we'll replace resource through a combination of exploration, discovered resource participation and acquisitions. And Chevron has done that over time. Our growth position has been pretty good, and so M&A hasn't been a particular priority for us. But we are mindful of the opportunities that are out there.","I wouldn't want you to think our focus is anything other than getting the projects we have under construction, and completing the work we have and ramping up the assets that we have, because I think we've got a pretty nice business profile going forward. But we do need to look at what is out there and we're going to be value driven. But there are opportunities that could present themselves in the current market. So we'll be mindful of that. But remember, we're trying to grow the dividend and invest for the long term here, and so we're not driven, we're not particularly transaction driven in any period of time. I have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Asit Sen from CSLA. Your question, please.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks, good morning. A quick one on shale, if I may, and tight oil. On slide 23 of the presentation, the year-over-year production bridge, shale and tight oil is shown as an impressive 44,000 barrels a day in 2015. What was the split between Permian and Vaca Muerta? And also can we get a full year 2015 shale and tight oil production for Chevron?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The increase, of that 44,000, about two-thirds of it was Permian Wolfcamp, and the rest of it was between Argentina and some of our Appalachia activity. And in terms of what's forward looking, I think I'm going to leave that to the security analyst meeting that we've coming up in March, where we'll give you a little deeper insight into our work in the Permian and kind of the range of ramp-up that we can see there. And we've done that every year, and we'll update you this year based on both the cost improvements that we've seen and then realities of the price market that we're in. Okay.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks, John, and since we have you, one macro question on Iran. And you already talked an Iran ramp-up. And are you involved in any discussion that's been mentioned by your European peers?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll answer the second question first, no. We're not able to do that, so we don't. I would just say that we've got our hands pretty well full. We always look at opportunities when it's legal for us to do so around the world, but I don't have any particular insight into Iran. You've seen the range of speculation around their ability to ramp up production. Some have speculated that it's going to be a little harder than advertised, but I don't have any particular insight to offer you. And perhaps others can help you with that.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, I would like to thank all of you for being on the call today. We appreciate your interest in our company and your participation.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please, go ahead.","John Watson","Thanks Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Frank Mount, our General Manager of Investor Relations.","We will refer to the slides that are available on our website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Okay, let's start with the key messages on Slide 3. I've said we needed to do five things well to adjust the lower prices. First, finish project under construction which reduces spend and brings on new revenue. Gorgon Train 1 and 2, Shandong Bay, Bangka, Alder, Angola LNG are all on production and stable. In 2017 progress will continue with Gorgon Train 3 and Wheatstone coming online.","Second, we need to reduce capital expenditures and focus on work that's profitable lower prices. 2016 capital was down 34% or $11.6 billion from 2015. We're further reducing capital spending in 2017 and investing a larger percentage of capital in short cycle high return opportunities presented by our advantage portfolio.","Third, we are lowering operating expenses by getting more efficient in all that we do. 2016 operating expense was down 9% or $2.5 billion from 2015 and we expect further reductions in 2017.","Fourth, we need to complete planned asset sales. We're on track with $2.8 billion in proceeds in 2016 and we expect 2017 proceeds will likely move us toward the upper end of the 2016, 2017 guidance range of $5 billion to $10 billion we previously communicated.","And finally we need to do all of this while operating safely and reliably. The result, free cash flow is improving with momentum building through 2016. We expect to be cash balanced in 2017 and the cash flow improvement continuing to 2018 and beyond. Our actions support our number one financial priority which is maintaining growing the dividend as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit.","Turn to Slide 4, Chevron's total shareholder return outpaced our major competitors and the S&P 500 in 2016 and is number one relative to our peers for any cumulative holding period going back 20 years. We appreciate the support from our investors but recognize markets are forward-looking and expectations are high. We need to continue to deliver on our commitments and manage our advantage portfolio for growing cash flow and competitive returns.","Pat will not take you through the financial results.","Pat Yarrington","Okay. Thank you, John.","Turning now to Slide 5 which is an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were $415 million or $0.22 per diluted share while earnings for the full-year 2016 were a loss of $497 million. Excluding special items and foreign exchange, Chevron earned $1.8 billion in 2016. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation.","Fourth quarter results were impacted by non-routine item and timing effects. Downstream results were weak reflecting adverse timing affect because of a rising crude price environment and an extensive turnaround at the Richmond refinery, a once in every five year event.","At the same time, fourth quarter corporate charges which are known to be non-ratable were heavier than in average quarter. Our debt ratio at year was 24%. During the fourth quarter we paid $2 billion in dividends bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.29 per share. 2016 was our 29th consecutive year of an annual per share increase. We currently yield 3.7%.","Turning to Slide 6, cash generated from operations was $3.9 billion during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter cash flow benefited from stronger oil prices but had offset the seasonal downstream margin patterns and the Richmond refinery turnaround.","On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow totaled $12.8 billion, a function of low oil and gas prices and weaker downstream margins than in 2015. 2016 working capital consumption of approximately $600 and lower affiliate dividends relative to earnings reduced operating cash. We had deferred tax items of nearly $4 billion for example those associated with tax loss positions. These will benefit cash in future periods.","Proceeds from assets sales for 2016 were $2.8 billion. Cash, capital expenditures were $4 billion for the quarter and about $18 billion for the full year excluding expense expiration. This continues a trend towards lower outlays.","At year end our cash and cash equivalents totaled $7 billion. Our net debt stood at $39 billion resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 21%.","Turning to Slide 7. Slide seven compares 2016 annual earnings to 2015. Full year 2016 results were a loss of $497 million or approximately $5 billion lower than the 2015 results. The impact of special items primarily due to lower gains on asset sales reduced earnings by $515 million. Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by about $710 million.","Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased $798 million between periods as lower realizations were only partly offset by lower operating costs and exploration expense.","Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by $2.8 billion, primarily due to lower margins. Recall that 2015 downstream margins were among the strongest we\u2019ve seen in a number of years.","The variance in the other segment primarily reflects higher cooperate charges and interest expense. Full year 2016 results are in line with our standing guidance of $350 million to $400 million in net charges per quarter for the other segment.","Turning to Slide 8. I\u2019ll now compare results for the fourth quarter of 2016 with the third quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter sales were approximately $870 million lower than the third quarter. The absence of third quarter 2016 gains from special items reduced earnings by $290 million between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $50 million between periods.","Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased approximately $850 million between quarters, primarily reflecting crude utilization, higher volumes and lower taxes.","Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange were lower by $765 million. This outcome was primarily driven by decreased volumes and increased operating expense, associated with the Richmond refinery turnaround, lower worldwide margins and an unfavorable swing in inventory timing effect.","The variance in the other segment is largely driven by adverse tax effects and corporate charges. These impacts are non-ratable and tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.","And now I'll turn it back to John.","John Watson","Okay. Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 9, 2016 capital spending was $22.4 billion, that's approximately $4 billion less than our original budget and more than $11 billion lower than last year. Cash C&E was $18.7 billion. Productions are mainly from finishing our major projects under construction, pacing and hi-grading future investment and realizing efficiency gains and supplier cost reduction.","In December we announced a total capital and exploratory budget for 2017 of $19.8 million which is right in the middle of our $17 billion $22 billion guidance range for the period out to 2020. Cash, capital and exploratory expenditures, which exclude affiliate spend are expected to be $15.1 billion.","70% of our expenditures in 2017 will generate cash flow within two years, reducing cash flow cycle time and financial risk. 2016 operating expense was $25 billion better than we had most recently guided and more than $2.5 billion less than last year.","We're sizing the organization to fit the work we anticipate. Our employee workforce is down $9,500 since the end of 2014. We've improved work processes and have negotiated better rates from contractors and vendors. Upstream operating expenses excluding fuel are down nearly $3 per barrel since 2014.","Most significant workforce reductions are behind us, but our focus on improving efficiencies in all aspects of the business continue and we expect further progress on OpEx in 2017 and beyond.","Slide 10 shows the sources of changes in production between 2015 and '16. 2016 net production was $2.6 million barrels per day. Growth continues from completing and ramping up major capital projects, our short cycle shale and base business work was excellent particularly in light of significant reductions in spending.","We limited declines in mature fields by improvements in reliability and drilling work and an effective work-over program. Production was impacted by the ongoing shut in of the partitioned zone, security issues in Nigeria and Gulf of Mexico asset sales.","Looking at the fourth quarter bar, you'll see the fourth quarter was strong and production growth is accelerating. As we start the year two trains at Gorgon are running near capacity. Angola LNG is operating well and the successful Agbami and TCL maintenance shutdowns are behind us.","We expect production growth this year of 49% at $50 per barrel before asset sales. The uncertainty reflects variables such as the speed of major capital project ramp ups, external events such as the timing of the partitioned zone restart and ultimate base decline rates.","Growth comes from a number of areas. First, we expect to see full-year production from project started up in 2016. Gorgon train one and two, Shandong Bay, Angola LNG, Alder, Bangka and we also expect to see partially a contribution for project starting up in 2017, Gorgon Train 3, Wheatstone and Mafumeria Sul for example.","Shale and tight production headlined by the Permian will also show growth as we take advantage of our valuable acreage. Base declines along with full year 2017 impacts of sales consummated in 2016 will both reduce production. The impact of 2017 asset sales on the timing -- on the timing of the close of the individual transaction is one variable. Our current estimate is a reduction of 50,000 to 100,000 barrels a day.","Turing to Slide 12, the chart on the left side shows our $5 billion to $10 billion guidance range for asset sale proceeds for 2016 and 2017. In 2016 we made good progress with $2.8 billion in proceeds as we sold assets for value that were not essential to delivering on strategy, didn't compete for capital, with our current opportunity set and were worth more to others than to us.","Additional opportunities are in progress and many will close in 2017. We expect proceeds close to the top of the guidance range. With new assets coming online in the benefits of portfolio actions, we expect to increase cash margins. The chart on the right shows a doubling of production in the more than $25 per barrel category and a reduction in low margin barrel.","Despite a sharp reduction in capital spending we have a strong reserve replacement year exceeding 100% before asset sales for the one and five-year periods. We saw significant adds from the final investment decision on TCO's future growth project. Additionally there are reserves added from improved reservoir characterization in several areas and strong well performance in shale and tight and various other locations.","Lower commodity prices benefited entitlement volumes from profit-sharing and variable royalty contracts. This was partially offset by lower economic produce ability in a few assets. Asset sales resulted in a RRR reserve replacement rate slightly below 100% consistent with the expectation of 2017 asset sales impacting production we also expect an impact on 2017 reserves from the sales.","Let's talk now about some of the major activity starting with Gorgon. Gorgon currently is stable with growth output of over 200,000 barrels a day and 130 million cubic feet of domestic gas output, a total of 39 cargos have been shipped 10 since the beginning of the year.","Train 1 ramp up was below expectations as we work through start-up issues we've discussed previously. All learnings from Train 1 were applied to Train 2 and consequently Train 2 ramped up over 90% of capacity within a week and continues to exceed expectations. Train 3 is also expected to benefit from these learnings. Construction is complete and we're well into startup and commissioning. We expect first LNG early in the second quarter of this year.","At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. All modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are on the foundations and the site is under permanent power. Ongoing hook up and commissioning of the offshore platform is the critical path activity. We're leveraging our experience from Gorgon and incorporating learnings into our ongoing activities. We expect Train 2 to start-up six to eight months following Train 1.","Turning to Permian, we\u2019re making excellent progress. Last year we lowered unit development costs by 20% and lowered unit operating costs by 35% compared to 2015. We're improving recoveries and our results are validating expectations around improvements in type curves. We're currently running 10 company operated rigs and we're adding a new rig about every eight weeks. The story keeps getting better. We'll update this chart and provide much more information about our Permian operations at our Analyst Day in March.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind we actually have a very full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary and will do our best to get all of your question answered, thanks.","Jonathan please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Phil Gresh","Hi, good morning. I just want to start on the 2017 production guidance. If I look at that guidance maybe on an absolute volume basis at the midpoint it would be around 2.75 million barrels a day. And I know it is a little bit stale, but a couple of years ago you had talked about a 2.9 to 3.0 type of range and obviously a lot has changed from then to now. But I was hoping maybe you could help bridge some of those moving pieces between project timing, asset sales, P and Z effects and really just trying to think through ultimately after 2017 how much additional uplift to volumes there would be from projects.","John Watson ","Yes, it's a good question. If you go back to that time we did put out an estimate of 2.9 to 3 range and actually the results were shown - now are very consistent with a couple of exceptions. The first and obvious one is the Partitioned Zone. We were producing - we expected we'd be back up and operating and that's about 70,000 barrels a day. So that's a clear delta.","The second is the effects of asset sales that we didn't anticipate at that time. If you add up what's already closed, you can get another 70,000 barrels a day pretty quickly. And so you put those two together and that's 150,000 barrels a day and that really explains it.","Now as you point out, there are some other ups and downs notably, some delays in capital projects, but the flipside of that is we got benefits the shale and tight volume is growing, Jack St. Malo has performed better than we expected. We have some price, a little bit of benefit from price effects. But those about offset. So the two big items are really the partition zone and asset sales and you get kind of right back into the zone we talked about.","Phil Gresh","Okay, got it. That is very helpful. And then the second question would just be on the longer-term CapEx budget. Looking at the bars that you gave for 2017, there's still $2 billion in there for Gorgon and Wheatstone and then another $2 billion plus it looks like just looking at the bars for projects that are outside of Tengiz.","So I guess I was just wondering how you are thinking about that $17 billion to $22 billion range, especially as we look at 2018 and you potentially have a couple billion still rolling off. Are there a lot of projects in the queue that you think work in the mid-50s or how are you thinking about that now?","John Watson","Yes, first, if I got back a year and you told me we would be able to get our spending, do all the work we did this year and have spending at $22.4 billion, I wouldn't have believed it. So we've made remarkable progress in bringing our cost down.","I had my drilling guy in the other day and he gave me an examine, the wells we drilled in 2016 if we had had the productivity we had in 2014, we would have spent $1 billion more. So the drilling efficiencies that we have put in place and I was just in the deep water.","So the efficiencies we put in place had allowed us to bring down cost. So the trend of spend is down and as you point out we have some major capital projects that are being completed. If we're still in the $50 to $55 world, you'll see us tracking at the bottom end of that range. Now we have -- we're showing a range out of 2020 that's a four-year period and so when we think out over that time period obviously a lot of things can change.","Notably, I would expect that we would see an increase in unconventional spending. We talked about ramping up the Permian and I think that will be the case. We were budgeting about $2 billion this year, but you could easily see another $1 billion there. We have very little activity in the Marsalis now. I would -- we've gotten very efficient there. So we would expect better market conditions and an offtake capability there.","We made good progress in the Duvernay, Argentina. So just in the shale and tight area, you could see some increases, but again that's short cycle, high return activity. Now we do have some opportunities in the portfolio that if we continue to make good progress on concepts and delineation drilling, things like Anchor and Tigris and we've highlighted Rosebank and a few others.","So we have a good queue of projects, but we need to make sure that those have right economics associated with them, but all of that can comfortably fit in the range that we've talked about, but I'll just say that if where at $50 to $55, you should expect spending to go down next year. Thanks Phil.","Phil Gresh","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Banc of America, Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. You have normally talked about the base business and the tight unconventional business kind of in the same breath as one offsetting the declines in the other. So I guess my first question is, in the context of declining rates and maintenance spending, your budget this year puts that number about $8.5 billion. Is that how we should interpret Chevron's definition of maintenance CapEx on a go forward basis? At least for the portfolio as it stands today?","John Watson","Yes, I think that if I understand the question, we've been trying to isolate the shale from the other base business activity, just because it's such a high profile activity. The fundamental nature of it has a lot of similarities with base business in the sense that it's relatively short cycle activity and it has to compete for capital with for example infill drilling in Bakersfield or Thailand or places like that.","So I think that's the right way to look at it and that's why we talked about declines in the 2% to 3% range and despite the big drop in capital, we were able to maintain that sort of a decline rate, but I think that's the right way to look at it and I think we'll generally separate the shale from the base business, so that you have transparency in that way because you're right, when you put them both together you know if you lump them together it will mask what's going on in the underlying sort of conventional business. So if I understand your question right, I think the answer is yes.","Doug Leggate","Okay, I appreciate that, John. That is what I was trying to get at. I guess my follow up is also in the Permian. I realize you probably want to hold some details for the Analyst Day, but just to kind of frame this. So Exxon has done the [BotCO] [ph] deal, they are talking about going to 15 rigs; my understanding is it's a fraction of that number today. You are talking about adding a rig every eight weeks, stepping up your spending and so on.","Can you give us some idea, John, what is the strategic thinking here? Is there a real pivot away from large capital projects at least in the short term to work with Permian? And if that's the case, how big a piece of the portfolio would you like to see the Permian ultimately represent given things like dividend commitments and other portfolio decisions that you have? And I will leave it there. Thanks.","John Watson ","As told on Slide 15, we haven't updated since the last time we talked but we will update it, the next time that we see and if you - if my foreshadowing was any good, you know that it's likely to improve. So we have taken a different approach than some on the Permian. We've taken the approach of trying to delineate understand what we have and then put together plans that consider off-take, consider infrastructure and really get lined out so that we can steadily grow over the period consistent with generating good returns in this business.","Now we told we've been able to bring our cost down but we will continue to ramp up. We talked about over next couple years getting up to 20 rigs but we're not limited per se, we're only limited by the good planning that we can do, the planning on infrastructure around a rig contracts, the quality of crude, frac spreads and other aspects of this so that we can move forward rapidly and we\u2019ll continue to do that.","It's kind of interesting, we hear a lot about how rapidly others done but the facts are we only have five non-operated rigs running at the end of the year and we've been steadily going during the year and so there's a lot of up and down that other operators put in place. We want to do as we add rigs we want those rigs to be in service to us going forward we want to steady ramp up and not whipsawing our organization around.","And so you'll see it steadily growing and I've told my group in the Permian that they are not capital limited, they just need to be sure that they are disciplined about their spend, that we get good returns on it, and that we properly evaluate the acreage.","Just want to anecdote for you, the kind of getting the efficiency argument that might be of interest. We added to our resource base 500 million barrels this year in the Permian without spending any money. And we did that by watching what offset operators have done. So obviously these are continuous plays we were able - so we have been able to learn by being a little bit behind others we have been able to learn and that's help us to prioritize the stand that we're doing.","So we will prosecute our agenda, you'll see the potential on growth profile rise. In an overall sense it wouldn't surprise me to see our unconventional activity be 25% of our production by the middle of the next decade. So this is a really solid asset class but it's one it's going to be driven by our ability to generate good returns and fit the proper role in the portfolio.","Doug Leggate","Appreciate the answer. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, John, Pat, Frank. There has been some investor questions about Gorgon and Wheatstone timing especially with some of the choppiness around Train 1 in the fourth quarter. But it sounds like your messages, you think everything is tracking well here. Can you give us an up to date on what the confidence level is around construction execution at the assets and what the greatest risk to timing at Gorgon and Wheatstone ramp is?","Frank Mount ","Well Gorgon is done I guess would be the way I would describe the construction is completed on Train 3, Train 1 and 2 are operating near capacity in fact - the only remaining thing to do is to bring on the Gorgon offshore field. We've been running on the Jansz field and so we will fill out those plans 100% when the Gorgon field comes online shortly.","So in terms of construction activity at Gorgon all is good. Now we do have - we do have to have an effective startup and commissioning process and we had some bumps on train one. We talked about that before, but I've been really pleased that the organization has taken all that in and addressed anything that might from that those learnings on train two and on train three.","It's obviously been very effective on train two and I've got no reason to believe it won't be effective on train three, but a strong startup in commissioning is really key for Gorgon but my subtlety in my comments was we expect LNG early in the second quarter. So I think the story of Gorgon is a good one.","At Wheatstone we're making good progress, certainly at the plant and I think the comment I made is the critical path activity is the offshore platform. Now the well worth subsea flowlines, pipelines umbilical, all that is complete. Train one construction is nearing completion and commission is underway and so the critical path activity is in some of the platform piping systems. They\u2019ve taken a little longer to complete and be commissioned. We've supplemented our workforce on the platform, but it hasn\u2019t changed our expectation of a midyear start date.","But it's just the ongoing activity and ebb and flow in the construction work, but the plan is still for midyear startup of that plant, but the message I'm trying to give you is it's pretty good and as activity winds down, you can really focus on the work faces that are still open, high grading crews and so I expect you'll continue to see a good story coming out of this but it's obviously a little bit earlier in the process, so there's more work to do on Gorgon, but it's also progressing well.","Neil Mehta","And shifting to policy, there is obviously a lot of changes under this new administration. One of the things that's caught a lot of investor attention is the border tax adjustment. John, what is your view on whether that is good policy and whether that has a meaningful impact on global oil prices in the refining business if it goes through.","John Watson","Well Neil, I've seen what you published and others and I think you've assessed it reasonably well. Let me make a couple of comments. First, in an overall sense I've been very pleased with the agenda that the Trump administration has. We've seen an avalanche of regulation over the last decade and putting a much, much more balanced cost-benefit framework in place to assess the value of those regulations freeing up infrastructure pipeline, all of that is quite positive for our business for the country job creation and a lot of things.","So that is very much a positive and we all know that our tax system is not competitive. We want American companies to be able to compete and so there's a lot of work being done to try to bring down corporate rates so that we can compete both at home and abroad for capital and of course menstruation has a focus on bringing jobs and capital back to the U.S. and lower rate will help that.","In my view, they're looking for pay-for, they're looking for ways to make those always happen and so they're looking at a variety of different concepts and the truth is, there are a lot of different ideas being floated right now and I think they're looking for input and we'll continue to provide it.","President Trump has indicated that the border adjustment concept is complex and I would agree with that. And so I think we need to take a close look at perhaps the consequences of that both some of them could be positive and the unintended consequences in terms of impact on consumers, exchange rates and knock on effects on the global economy and I have no doubt that the anticipation will do a good job of doing that and will settle on the right kind of tax reform at the end of the day.","But I think we need to have a little patience for the different ideas that are being put out there and hopefully we'll get to the right outcome. Thanks Neil.","Neil Mehta","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.","Paul Sankey","Good morning, everyone. John, could you talk about OPEC this year and the impacts that you anticipate? My understanding was that Partitioned neutral Zone would be part of the cuts. But also I would be interested if you had observations on some of your other areas of exposure. And a couple of the more obscure ones would be obviously Venezuela and whether or not -- exactly where you are at in Nigeria right now. Thank you.","John Watson","Sure. The short answer is I don't expect a significant impact from any of these things on our operations, certainly in Venezuela and Nigeria indications are they been operating at lower rates and we've had no indication that we're going to be impacted.","When I look at the Partitioned Zone, and you look at the public comments that have been made by Kuwait, they have a strong desire to get the onshore Partitioned Zone where we - where that Saudis and Kuwaitis are partners and we represent the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have a strong desire to get that online and they have indicated that it won't have an impact on quarters.","So to me the issues are between the two governments and if they can resolve those, we will be able to bring it back up and I think both countries have flexibility in terms of which fields they produce and where that volume will come from.","We think those are high margin barrels when they come online. I mean if you look at the work during this time and we've been down there, our people have taken the time to dramatically reduce costs and they have taken a close look at the reservoir and we've got a queue of base business activity that is very high return, it will compete with the best we've got in the world and it's very economic.","So I think the Kuwaitis understand that. And I think there's a desire to move it back to get it back on production but look this is - these are issues between governments, I'm not going to give you a forecast of when that might be resolved.","Paul Sankey","Right, but on balance you are expecting little impact from OPEC. My follow up is on decline rates. John, you have talked in the past a lot about them. Have you been surprised by how little global oil supply has declined post 2014? But do you anticipate an acceleration in declines? Thank you.","John Watson","It\u2019s a really good question Paul. I think the shorter answer is, I have been surprised at how resilient production has been in many locations around the world some of that is we just keep getting better. If you look at for example some of the Deepwater developments that we and others have, we've been on plateau at Agbami for a long time, we\u2019ve been in plateau in some of our Gulf of Mexico projects and I think we and others are getting very good at extending plateaus and technology only goes in one direction. We hear about in the context of the shale but the same thing is true in other conventional activity.","So I think the short answer is, I have been little surprised and with the benefit from - for example in Russia from declining exchange rates and things of that sort, it's made some of that base activity more competitive.","Ultimately however you do need new major capital projects to fill the gap if you look out a few years and we are not just seeing FID's been taken on significant new Greenfield opportunities and so at some point we do need - we do expect to see at least in the conventional area some declines in production and there is a limit to this and it has surprised us that it's held up as well as it has, but at some point you're going to need new activity.","Paul Sankey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.","Jason Gammel","John, I wanted to come back to the comment you made about 70% of capital spend having an effect on production within two years. Now I assume part of that is still spending on major capital projects that start in that time. But, nevertheless, it does illustrate how much you are shifting towards short cycle spend. And really the question is how has this changed how you manage the risk profile of the Company on a move forward basis? Thinking really about how you view uncertainty of earnings from the production profile by not having the big step changes necessarily being as impactful? And how you think about the balance sheet without having those big capital commitments?","John Watson","I think it's true. There are - there are different kinds of risk when you think about it Deepwater development versus some of the base business activity or some of the shale development and so we're cognizant of that and I think that driven some of the comments you heard me and Pat make about how we look at the balance sheet.","During the period of time in the early part of this decade, I was very clear going back to five years plus. We were heading into a period where we had significant major capital projects, we were going to keep some capacity on the balance sheet and so we had more cash than debt on the balance sheet. And so because we knew we were going to be drawing on that - drawing on the balance sheet.","Now we didn\u2019t expect to see the drop in prices as big as we saw but it proved to be pretty wise to keep that capacity on the balance sheet. Now we're on a different period. We do have the Tengiz project but I don't see the same anything like Gorgon, Wheatstone or Tengiz in our future. We could see a deepwater development but none of these are of that same magnitude and with the drop in interest rates that we've seen during that period, debt is a very effective form of financing.","And so we want to keep some capacity on the balance sheet to withstand the ups and downs in and be in a good position to take advantage of opportunities, but you I think you'll see us carrying more debt on the balance sheet than we have in the past.","We've talked in the 20% to 25% debt range and we think that balance is keeping some capacity and taken advantage of the low cost of debt. The key for us is having some financial flexibility around our capital spending that really reduces the execution risk and means you don't have to keep that as much capacity on the balance sheet.","Jason Gammel","Can I ask one follow up, please?","John Watson","Sure.","Jason Gammel","Okay. I just wanted to -- I have two quick questions about what is included in the production guidance. If I look at the chart on page 10, if I take the net of the base decline and the base investment, it implies a mitigated decline rate of 1%. Could you tell me what factors into the guidance range and then also how the Partitioned Zone factors into the 4% to 9% guidance range.","John Watson","Sure. I think if I understand the question, the base decline that we show by the red bar are kind of in the 2% to 3% range and we do have a range, the bottom of the production range in our estimate that we put forward, assumes that we get nothing from the Partitioned Zone this year. The top of the range assume it starts up about midyear or so. So those are the two variables and that's why we put the fuzzy bar and some brackets around it because I just can't -- I just can't handicap that perfectly, but the base decline is that 2% to 3% range.","Jason Gammel","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please?","Paul Cheng","Hey guys. Good morning. John, if we look at the industry it seems like you already bottom and the Company is in good shape, that projects are coming on stream and you should reach cash flow neutral not and it depends on the projects should be cash flow positive.","So can we -- using this opportunity that you're already resizing your company also for this -- currently the lower oil prices. So, can we step a step back and maybe that you can tell us that how the next 5, 10 years how you want to position? What are the roadmaps that you have in mind?","How do you want to differentiate yourself with the peers and the other international major corporations? Is it that everyone is now saying that oh I mean there is no differentiation, we're in commodity business and the big major IOC is really in a disadvantage on the business model? So, can you help us that to wrap it altogether now that you no longer -- not you necessarily, but for most other people that no longer is in the mode of survival, can we look a little bit further out, now can you afford that business to look at it and saying that give us what is the roadmap?","John Watson","Sure. Well Paul look, it won't surprise you that I don't agree with some of those assessments. I think we're in a terrific position and some of the TSR data that we show even looking at independence over a period of time we look pretty good and I would say that we are differentiated from some of our competitors and let me see if I can describe why.","We aren't integrated oil and gas company and we have shown a bias toward the upstream portfolio. We think over time, we can earn very strong returns and that we have competitive technology and assets to do just that. We do have a strong downstream and chemical business. It earns good returns. It has complementary activity that add value to some of our resources around the world as well as a lot of very talented people.","So we will have a downstream and chemical business, but certainly we will be predominantly an upstream company and that in and of itself is a bit of a difference from some of our competitors.","Within the upstream, I think we also differentiate ourselves by the quality of the assets that we have. There are risks to being a company that's only in one particular asset play regardless of how good that play is. We got a diverse portfolio for example if you look at our position in Australia, the resource base we have there will have five LNG trains plus a position in a six that's or a third project down there in the Northwest shelf.","We have a very advantage manufacturing position and a lot of resource that can feed those facilities over time. So Australia is a terrific asset. Tengiz we have talked about. That distinguishes us from many of our competitors and the Permian is of course the emerging asset and we got a terrific position there that I think is the envy of a lot of others and you will see - you are seeing us and you'll see us in the future really get after that business. And I haven't even talked about the talent we have and the asset position we got in the deepwater and elsewhere.","So we have a very good portfolio that I wouldn't trade with anybody and I think over time the diversity in that portfolio will show benefits and anyone asset has some risk associated with it from an industry perspective and I think we've got a position that second to none.","Now our approach is going forward is to - we know we have to improve returns because in a lower price environment the financial returns haven't been what you and I would want them to be but if you look at the cost trends and efficiency trends we've got and - where we\u2019re putting on capital going forward as capital base roles over I think we've got some very strong assets so that going forward the assets that we got the investments that we\u2019ll able to make will earn good return.","So I think all of those things distinguish us in what is - from a topline point of view a difficult time that we're emerging from and one that will not likely be the same $100 environment that that we saw a few years ago, maybe that's a long answer.","Paul Cheng","Really great. Just a quick second one, Venezuela. Any insight to how bad is the industry - oil industry in the country at this point? And do you think that any systematic risk is likely? Or that if not, then do you think that the current production capacity actually will be able to hold relatively flat or will you going to continue to see this decline for the year?","Frank Mount","Well for the most part I\u2019m going to comment on our operations and we've been able to navigate pretty well down there have good relationships in Venezuela but we've been able to maintain and we have a structure in place that is enabling us to continue work, enabling us to continue to invest and enabling importantly to enable the contractors, the tax authorities and ourselves to get paid.","And so that seems to be working very well. What I point out is despite the - obviously the concerns about what's happening in the country right now and some difficulties there encountering, they have a huge resource base and Chevron is well respected there and I think there's an opportunity for us to play a very constructive role in Venezuela going forward certainly maintaining the existing assets that we have and potentially as time goes forward participating in other opportunities there but it's unquestionably difficult time thus far we've been able to manage it working well with the government.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","Ed Westlake","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the margin improvement chart into 2017, that was very helpful. Obviously as you shift to short cycle and Permian you probably also get, plus with deflation, some benefits on the capital intensity side as well, which should lead, as you pointed out, to returns and free cash flow. You spoke about debt balances, but what about growth say over the next decade versus dividends, buybacks? I mean any philosophical changes there?","John Watson","There aren't changes philosophically, but let me make a couple of comments because I am encouraged - you touched on cash flow, I am very encouraged by what I see going forward on cash flow. If you look at 2016 cash from operations in the 13 billion range but it's easy to see big chunks of improving in cash flow going forward. Capital spending, the cash C&E was 18.7 last year with 15.1 that's 3.5.","Oil averaged $44 a barrel if it averages 55 our sensitivity is you know that that's another $3.5 billion. We made a capital contribution to TCO technically alone for $2 billion last year and didn't receive a dividend of consequence last year. So you could see another $3 million swing net out of TCO and that doesn't even count the Gorgon and Wheatstone.","The fourth quarter had a once in five years shutdown of Richmond refinery that probably cost us $3 million. We had Agbami down for once in eight years that's a very profitable investment. We had record production at TCO last year despite one of the biggest shutdowns they've ever had that was done successfully. All these things are portending strong cash flow with the \u2013 obviously the underlying risk will have to be considered in price, but certainly the message going forward is good.","So the prospect for us to improve earnings, improve free cash flow and increase the dividends are good and the priorities that you referred to really haven't changed. We want to increase the dividend as a pattern of earnings and cash flow permit.","We need to continue to invest in the highest return opportunities and we are definitely high grading that, not funding everything that meets minimum hurdle rates and we need to do that and manage the balance sheet at the same time and it's something that Pat works very hard on and dividend policy ultimately is a purview of the Board but in speaking for them we just reviewed what our plans are going forward. I think we have a very good support for the Board from the full Board on this subject.","So I think the outlook is good and I'll tell you four years ago I wouldn't have thought that would be the case at moderate prices. So I think it's a good story and we\u2019re going to continue in that direction.","Ed Westlake","And then maybe a follow-up on the question on decline you spoke more globally. But as you think about the Chevron assets and the ability to keep the decline rate, [Atwater] [ph] has been a relatively low level over the past year. I mean, how long do you think that you can keep that up? I mean the Tengiz decline rate when that was announced did surprise a few folks. And so I am just wondering if there is any things that we should be concerned about as we forecast out over the next several years.","John Watson","There's always a requirement to reinvest in the business. In the case of Tengiz, it\u2019s a technically complex field and so those needed pressure management equipment and we have to make those investments. That's very different from say Bakersfield California where there's infill drilling that you need to do but it's a pretty well understood phenomena. If you invest a certain amount of capital you can manage the decline.","So I don't have the real \u2013 when we were early last year we were down around $30 a barrel and we weren\u2019t investing in the business and really we were cutting back activity in lots of areas. There was the potential for declines to accelerate because we just weren't drilling wells and we were I think it was very difficult time for everyone in the industry.","But if we get back to a more normal level of activity you can see sort to 2% to 4% kind of declines that I think would be normal and the individual asset ultimately matures but -- I don\u2019t think I can give you a lot more general guidance than that.","Frank Mount","Thanks Ed.","Ed Westlake","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Evan Calio","Yes, good morning. John, you should tweet your US policy and BAT response later. My question is on, you mentioned the Permian story keeps getting better with an ambitious 25% production potential in the middle of next decade. I mean as much as border tax, I think investors remain focused on service cost inflation here in the US. So any color or outlook there and how much inflation would it trigger -- would it take, sorry -- to trigger a capital reallocation away from the Delaware in your plan? Or how do you offset there as they maybe relate to continuing improvement in well performance and otherwise?","John Watson","Yes, Evan, boy, that\u2019s a topic that gets a lot of attention and my view is I think if you look globally, there isn\u2019t a lot of pressure on the supply chain. I don\u2019t expect continuing reductions necessarily in market conditions. But there isn\u2019t a lot of upside pressure globally.","In the Permian, activity has picked up and going forward we would expect to see some pressure but if you look at the dramatic reductions in cost that we've been able to achieve it's been mostly a function of efficiency measures that we think are sustainable.","One of the reasons I made the comments I did earlier bouts about steady ramp up of rigs and having sort of a consistent and well thought through plan is it will be important to have consistency in workers for example. Not all rigs are the same so you want to have the best rigs, you want to have the best crews, you want to have consistent relationships with suppliers who want to be with you through thick and thin so that you can have that maintain that productivity that we\u2019ve worked so hard to put in place.","Our view is despite some increases, potential for increases, we don't think it's going to make a material difference to us over the next couple of years and I\u2019ll confide it to that period, but we don't think it\u2019s going to make a big difference even if you should see some changes.","I should also point out in areas like the deepwater our costs are going to come down because we've got deepwater rigs that are under contract at above market rates. We're going to be releasing a couple of rigs here literally over the next couple of weeks so we\u2019ll be down to four deepwater rigs. But over time all these rigs come off contracts and so when you think about the future of a deepwater development, the costs are coming down not going up. So there's some risk in isolated markets in areas but I think overall we\u2019ll be able to manage it.","Evan Calio","No, we kind of agree Permian is a winner here. But my follow up is on the Permian and how big is your 2017 program either in rig or well terms? I'm just trying to understand how much of the 2017 CapEx is being spent on infrastructure, pad development or otherwise that is reflected in 2018 and beyond. It affects -- it would affect the model growth path.","John Watson","We ended the year at 15 rigs, 10 operated, 5 non-operated and we\u2019re going to be ramping up over the course of this year, we expect up to 15 rigs operated by the end of the year with more on the non-operated side. We've got - our budget is about $2 billion there and look we expect to ramp up this year in the $50 to $60 range. We're going to continue to ramp up and I just want to say we want to do it efficiently.","Frank Mount","Thanks Evan.","Evan Calio","I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please.","Alastair Syme","John, global LNG demand looked to have picked up a bit last year. Can you comment on the state of the market? And are you seeing any positive signs from your customers towards a willingness to turn new contracts in the market?","John Watson","Yes, it\u2019s been interesting and it's been maybe a little surprising to some. We've had good demand for LNG. We were able to sign a couple of contracts last year. So that now Gorgon and Wheatstone sort of 85% maybe slightly more sold which is right about where we want to be.","And if you look at where spot pricing have been it\u2019s clear that there's been incremental cargos going into China and Japan. So it's been somewhat encouraging I think and if you look at some of the environmental objectives they are particularly throughout Asia, it\u2019s actually some encouraging signs.","Now I temper that with the understanding that we\u2019ve got projects that are coming online but the long-term trend for LNG demand is good because it's competitive on price in many locations and it certainly has desirable environmental characteristics and the security of that steady supply out of places like Australia it remains in demand.","So by 2025 or so people are looking at demand increases that could be 65% or more. So it's a good story. I don't think we\u2019re yet at the place where you're going to see a lot of FID is taken on new projects but it's been encouraging to see a bump up in prices.","Alastair Syme","As a follow-up John, are you having any sort of indicative marketing discussions around the Gorgon Train 4 or Kitimat or any of these projects?","John Watson","Well we've had discussions over the years. I would say the most likely - you need to underpin a project like Kitimat with some type of contract and off take and I don\u2019t want to represent that we're very far along in those discussions. We\u2019ve been looking at different concepts for an LNG plant to be able to put one in more efficiently. We\u2019re proving up the resource side which is encouraging up in the Liard and Horn River area and of course we've done some work on pipeline. But I don\u2019t want to advertise, that's moving real quickly primarily because of the economic side.","When it comes to Gorgon, I think the first thing that you\u2019ll see at Gorgon is first we got the three trains lined down and operating smoothly and I think that will happen then you'll see the potential for debottlenecking and re-rating of those. And I think those are probably in the queue, certainly in the queue ahead of a Train 4 or other trains at Wheatstone for that matter where the same sort of principles will apply.","We want to really get the most we can out of the year and hardware that we have and then contingent on market. We have a strong resource base there. We\u2019ll contemplate additional development.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Hello, good morning. I guess a quick question for you, Pat, just to come back to the comment about the -- kind of the other expense in the quarter. You said it wasn't ratable. Was there anything in there that is likely to reverse next year or that you can think of that we should expect next year in terms of higher taxes or unusual payments","Pat Yarrington","Yes. So I think it\u2019s a good question. I wouldn\u2019t say that there is anything necessarily that\u2019s going to reverse. An example that you might not have thought of, when we have as many retirements as we have had for example, out of the U.S. John referenced, over the current year we have 5,200 pure employees this year and over the last couple of years it\u2019s about 9,500.","For example, if you look at the U.S. we're slightly under funded on our pension and now those retirements occurs and of course you need to accelerate the recognition of that pension settlement cost. So, that\u2019s an example of what's sitting there in that corporate and other sector.","And since we anticipate moderating, certainly we\u2019re not going to have the same kind of employee reduction, that kind of thing will moderate going forward. There is a fair amount of lumpiness just on a tax sense, where we continually every quarter go through and make assessments of our outstanding positions and make the appropriate bookings that are required there and I can\u2019t say that there is any pattern to that necessarily.","As you look forward into 2017 though. I would say the one thing that probably is going to continue to grow would be our interest expense. Because our debt balances are higher. So we have had a guidance range of the $350 million to $400 million is probably towards the high end of that range probably you want to think in your mind around $400 million for each quarter for 2017.","Roger Read","Okay, great, thanks. And then, John, maybe following up on Alastair's question but stepping out a little broader on FIDs. Is there, and I recognized the Analyst Day, that it might be more detailed coming then. But as you think about kind of moving into the offshore, are costs down enough now, are prices high enough and the returns attractive enough we should expect something in 2017? Or is it still maybe more patience and waiting","John Watson","I think most of the money that we'll be spending in fact the four deep water rigs I mentioned will be developing drilling. I think it\u2019s a bit early to think about FID on something on Anchor and Tigris. We\u2019re just completing a couple of appraisal well if you will. We need to evaluate those. We're looking a different concepts for example in the deepwater there is technology that needs to be qualified there to be sure that it move them along we got industry groups that are working with vendors and suppliers to try to take cost out so I would say its work-in-progress, there is plenty of work to do that I would call brownfield activity you know off of existing facilities and so that\u2019s where most of the money will be spend.","We talk previously about Rosebank and I would just tell you Rosebank, Anchor, Tigris, all are potential FIDs but we just have to get the cost resource development balance right and so I wouldn\u2019t think any of those big ones where we likely to see and FID in 2017.","Roger Read","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simmons and Company. Your question please.","Guy Baber","Good morning everybody. I just wanted to follow up on the cash margin discussion a little bit more and slide 12 where you highlight that improvement. But you introduced a slide I believe around a year ago that highlighted cash margins in 2017 at about $20 a barrel at $60 a barrel oil. But since then over the last year I believe your cost reductions have been more successful than anticipated, some lower margin barrels have come out at the portfolio and the Permian is looking better.","So, can you just help us to understand how your view on those 2017 cash margins has maybe evolved over the last year or so? And is it reasonable for us to think that those margins could be higher at the same price.","John Watson","Yes, we put this chart in thereto kind abate you a little bit and to watch your appetite and I think we successfully did that and I think all the things you point to are or what we were trying to get at. I am going to push off a little bit though and tell you that Jay Johnson will talk more about what we see in cash margins in our portfolio. With the cost improvements you are seeing the place of portfolio actions that we're taking, we'll update you little bit more to SAM guys. It's a really good question and I think it's one of our strengths and one of our good stories. But I'll push off to the SAM in five weeks or so.","Guy Baber","Okay, understood. And then the follow up for me, I thought your reserve additions and the replacement metrics were pretty favorable overall in light of the environment. Could you perhaps share with us the early view on F&D costs this year? And then given F&D can be lumpy in any year and the cost deflation you have seen, your shift to prioritizing short cycle brownfield, do you have a view on maybe the new normal of F&D for your business going forward to 2020?","John Watson","Well I agree with you that the reserve replacement numbers are pretty good, I'll tell you, if I go back to beginning of the year we weren't expecting to be near 100%, so a lot of the work that the people on our business units did, we got them focused on shorter cycle activity and it's an excellent work in terms of characterizing reservoir seismic work and others to enable us to appropriately book reserve. So you're right, we had a good year and particularly given that we understand dramatically relative to plan. So all that is - all that is good.","F&D cost if you think the oil and gas disclosure can be really lumpy and you really have to look at and averaging over time. We've tended to give you development cost on a project-by-project basis. It doesn't always line up exactly with - the proved reserves bookings that tend to be how things are viewed in the oil and gas disclosure. So I won't make comments on what will appear on the oil and gas disclosure because that's a very specific set of calculations. ","But I think as we look forward to the security announcement we are going to have in a few weeks, I think Jay will be able to talk a little bit more about progress in the Permian and what we're seeing in some of our - what we're doing on deepwater and other asset classes to give you better idea of what development cost for any of those might be. So, we'll give you more. It's a real good question, but we need more time to talk about when I got here today.","Guy Baber","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH. Your question please.","Anish Kapadia","Thank you. My first question is - correct me if I am wrong, but Chevron seems like it will be free cash flow positive in 2017 after dividends around current oil prices. And then if you factor in disposals certainly at the top end of the range, you are going to generate some significant excess cash flow. So I was wondering if you could talk about the priorities for the use of that excess cash flow this year.","John Watson","Well, sure the expectation is to be cash flow positive with between all those things you mentioned, the ongoing improvement, finishing capital projects, lower spending, some assets sale proceeds et cetera. We do expect to be cash-flow positive.","The priority on the dividend is that we said we'll increase the dividend as a pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. So we'll take stock of it, the board take stock of it. Every quarter we make a look and we'll increase it as we find appropriate. I guess the one point I'm trying to make is we're very cognizant that we've increased the dividend 29 years in a row and I view that any increase in the dividend would be something I want to be able to sustain in perpetuity.","So going in that would be my expectation. So we always want to increase the dividend in a way that we can sustain over a period of time. So we will - we've given you the guidance on capital, I don't expect us to exceed the capital numbers that we have certainly. We are cognizant of the dividend policy and we are going to maintain the strong balance sheet. But I am not going to give you a specific guidance on the dividend at this time other than to say I am acutely aware of how much we all like dividends and so is the board.","Anish Kapadia","Thank you. And a follow up going back to the Permian again. Just to kind of think of it bigger picture. I was just wondering how important is it for you -- is it to you for the market to recognize the value of your Permian acreage? And if it is important how do you get the market to recognize that? And I am kind of thinking of it in the terms of you can easily bring value forward by running a lot more rigs on the acreage or disposing of some of your acreage that I suppose you -- given the huge inventory you might not be drilling for 20, 30 years. So just how do you balance managing the asset versus kind of showing the value to the market?","John Watson","It\u2019s very important for us to have value realized in a reasonable period of time. And there is no intention to warehouse acreage that we are not to going to get to. In fact, if you look at the asset disposal we have, we've been high grading our portfolio very steadily. What I don't want to do, is dispose a acreage prematurely before we've been able to assess it fully.","If we have followed what some wanted us to do, we would have sold things a couple of years ago that are now worth five times what they are. So we continue to assess it. If we find that there is acreage in the portfolio that we\u2019re not going to get to for a long period of time, I am more than happy to monetize it. But that is not the way we think that we can realize most value.","And I will just make a minor editorial comment. There are lot of people with ulterior motives out there when it comes to disposal of assets and we are prosecuting our agenda across our competitive and we will utilize our acreage and expose that value to shareholders in a way that will give them confidence that value will be realized from it. That is and we recognize that we do continue to get more information and provide that so that you have that confidence. So, it's a very fair question and it\u2019s on us to do that and you\u2019ll see a lot more in March.","Anish Kapadia","Okay. Very clear, thank you","John Watson","I think we have one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please.","Blake Fernandez","Thanks for squeezing me in. Back on the deepwater, Roger's question, Mad Dog was noticeably absent and your partner and the operator has announced sanctioning there. Unless I missed it I don't believe we have heard from Chevron. So you can talk about that and whether that's in the 2017 budget.","John Watson","Yes, in a word, it is.","Blake Fernandez","Okay.","John Watson","We have a relatively small interest. We're not the operator, but yes, we work with the operator. We\u2019ve been able to get cost down. They\u2019ve taken FID. We have not yet taken FID, but I expect that we will.","Blake Fernandez","Great. Okay. And the second question, Pat, this may be for you. But you mentioned about $4 billion of deferred tax. And I assume that that begins to be a net positive once the US Upstream is net income positive, which it was this quarter. So is it fair to think that that is kind of a cash contributor into next year or this year I should say?","Pat Yarrington","I think it will be a cash contributor a partial cash contributor in 2017, yes. Because we have the ability in the U.S. to take some the tax losses and carry them back to earlier periods where we have taxable income. And depending upon what happens to prices and how we operate U.S. both upstream and downstream, we will get a schedule of repayments over time.","Blake Fernandez","Thank you very much.","Frank Mount","Okay. We went a little longer. I wanted to get as many of you in as I could. Thank you for your time today. We appreciate your interest in the company. We look forward to talking you again in March and until then, we\u2019ll continue to prosecute our agenda.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, our Vice President and CFO, who you know very well, and Frank Mount, our General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on our website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you read that cautionary statement that is on slide 2.","I will now turn the call over to Pat, who will take you through our financials, briefly. Pat.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","All right. Thanks, John. I'll be presenting four slides on third quarter results. Our normal earnings and production variance slides are available in the appendix section of the presentation, which is available on our website.","Starting now with slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. Third quarter earnings were $2 billion, or $1.09 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and impairments, earnings totaled $1.9 billion, or $1.01 per share. On this basis, third quarter results were modestly better than second quarter, despite a much weaker oil market. This reconciliation is also available in the appendix. Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.4 billion. Our debt ratio at quarter end was just under 19%.","During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we declared a $1.07 per share dividend, payable in the fourth quarter. This takes our 2015 annual dividend to $4.28 per share and makes 2015 the 28th consecutive year where we have increased annual per-share dividend payments.","Turning to slide 4, cash generated from operations was $5.4 billion during the third quarter and nearly $15 billion year-to-date. Downstream cash generation strength was sustained in the third quarter, while upstream cash flow fell, commensurate with an approximate 20% drop in global oil prices between quarters. As of September 30th, working capital effects reduced 2015 operating cash flow by $2.3 billion. Year-to-date proceeds from asset sales were $5.4 billion, bringing our total over the last seven quarters to more than $11 billion. We are tracking very well against our four-year asset divestment target of $15 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $6.8 billion for the quarter, $800 million lower than second quarter. Year-to-date cash capital expenditures were $22 billion, down $3.6 billion or 14% compared to the same period in 2014. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents were $13.2 billion, and our net debt position was $22.6 billion. Debt issuance through nine months has amounted to $8 billion.","Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2015 earnings were approximately $3.6 billion lower than third quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased $4.6 billion between quarters, virtually all of this related to significantly lower realizations between periods. Downstream results increased by $824 million, primarily driven by higher margins and favorable foreign exchange effects, partially offset by the absence of third quarter 2014 gains on asset sales. The variance in the other segment was mainly lower environmental reserve additions, in particular, the absence of a reserve taken last year in the third quarter related to a closed mining operation.","I will now compare results for the third quarter 2015 with the second quarter of 2015. Third quarter earnings were $1.5 billion higher than second quarter results. Upstream earnings increased by 2.3 billion, primarily reflecting the absence of second quarter impairments and other related charges worth $2.6 billion. Lower realizations reduced earnings between quarters, but a favorable swing in foreign exchange and lower exploration expenses were largely offsetting. Downstream earnings decreased $745 million, mainly due to the absence of a $1.7 billion in asset sale gains recorded in the second quarter. The current quarter also saw stronger margins and volumes, particularly in the U.S., favorable foreign exchange impacts, as well as lower operating expenses and positive timing effects in the face of declining prices. The variance in the other segment was primarily unfavorable tax items, partially offset by lower corporate charges.","John will now provide an update on the current priorities and focus areas.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 7, I would like to start by reinforcing that our priorities \u2013 financial priorities are unchanged. Our first priority is to maintain the dividend and grow it as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. As Pat mentioned, we announced our quarterly dividend earlier this week and are very proud of the fact that we've increased the annual per-share payout for 28 consecutive years. Back in March, we committed to delivering free cash flow to cover the dividend in 2017. At that time, the futures market was envisioning $70 prices in 2017. Today, the futures market is lower, but our intent remains the same. Our goal is to balance our cash equation by completing projects under construction and reducing capital spend and operating expenses to levels consistent with the current market conditions. We will also continue to divest assets where we can obtain good value. We will achieve this while operating all businesses safely and reliably. I'll address each topic on this slide on the slides that follow.","First, a little bit of an overview on the market. It's clear that low prices have reduced upstream earnings for the sector, and, for Chevron, we're no exception. Prices are low because the market is producing more than consumers want, but the markets are showing signs of rebalancing. Using Wood Mac data, this chart depicts worldwide liquid supply with the black line and demand in red. The blue represents the shortfall from or surplus to inventory. In the early part of the decade, the pattern was clear. Supply could not keep up with demand, in part because of supply disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa. The success of shale in the U.S. and some growing production from Iraq allowed the market to rebalance for first several months of 2014. However, note the spike in production when the Saudis increased production and the shale growth continued its surge in late 2014. The resultant 2 million barrels per day surplus has pushed prices down.","Suppliers are adjusting. World production peaked and turned down last month. U.S. production, particularly shales, has peaked and is now in decline. We expect this trend to continue and accelerate at current prices. Demand is strong, as low prices provide stimulus to the consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere, leading to annual growth of 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day.","Markets will likely rebalance at some point next year, though seasonal demand patterns are apt to blur the exact timing. With a new equilibrium will come price recovery, which is one of the levers that will help balance our cash equation. While we're confident in a price recovery, the timing, of course, is uncertain. We're taking actions that will allow Chevron to compete effectively in a low price environment while positioning us effectively for value growth over the longer term.","Turn to slide 9. A second lever to help us balance cash flow is volume growth. As most are aware, we expect to see a significant inflection point over the next two years as a number of major capital projects move from being cash consumers to cash generators. Gorgon and Wheatstone are obvious contributors, but the list is long, starting with Lianzi in West Africa. Over the next several quarters, we expect a progression of start-ups that will include Angola LNG, Mafumeira Sul, Moho Nord, Sonam \u2013 all these are in West Africa. Chuandongbei in China, the Bangka development in Indonesia, Alder in the North Sea, the Chevron fields chemical project on the U.S. Gulf Coast and, of course, three trains at Gorgon and two trains at Wheatstone. Our strong shale and tight portfolio, particularly in the Permian, gives us low-cost, short-cycle investment opportunities that nicely supplement production growth from the major capital projects. In the shale and tight class, our focus is on high grading our investment opportunities to maximize returns and cash flow. We like our portfolio diversity, which, when market conditions improve, will provide growth opportunities.","In slide 10, we're in the final stages of commissioning systems to allow start-up of Train 1 at Gorgon. At the plant, our focus is on starting up the process units ahead of commencing liquefaction. An LNG cool down cargo is planned to arrive mid-December to assist in cooling down the LNG tanks and associated facilities prior to first LNG export.","The Jansz-Io Field sub-C infrastructure is fully complete. We've opened the first two wells to the Jansz pipeline confirming the full operability of these sub-C systems. Our current outlook for loading the first LNG cargo is early 2016. We are continuing to make good progress on Trains 2 and 3, with all Train 2 and nine of 13 Train 3 modules installed and hookups under way.","At Wheatstone, all sub-C infrastructure and over 100 kilometers of flowlines have been installed. Hookup and commissioning of the offshore platform continues on plan. All nine wells are drilled with the top of the reservoir, with four of nine wells now completed and sub-C trees installed. At the plant, 17 of the 24 modules required for first LNG have been delivered and all refrigeration compressors and gas turbine generators have been installed. Installation of all pipe racks and electrical switchgear buildings on the product loading facility is now complete, as is start-up of the power systems in the plant operations center. We're still targeting the first LNG cargo by year-end 2016, however we continue to work to mitigate Wheatstone schedule pressures from previous delays in module delivery. We've posted some new pictures today, and I encourage you to look at them on our investor website at Chevron.com.","Turn to slide 11. Another lever to deliver free cash flow is reduce capital spending. As indicated during our March Analyst Day, we have significant flexibility in our capital program as we complete projects under construction. Given the near-term price outlook, we're exercising more discretion and pacing projects that have not reached final investment decision. We are also negotiating cost reductions from suppliers.","Overall, our investment programs are being set at levels that will enable us to complete and ramp-up the projects under construction, fund high-return, short-cycle investments, preserve options for viable, long-cycle projects, and finally ensure safe, reliable operations. We expect capital exploratory spend in 2016 to be in the range of $25 billion to $28 billion, down from $35 billion this year. We expect further reductions in 2017 and 2018 into the $20 billion to $24 billion range depending on business conditions. Of specific note, the plan does include funding for the wellhead pressure management and future growth project at Tengiz in Kazakhstan, which has undergone rigorous engineering and readiness reviews based on learnings from other projects.","Turn to slide 12, to another cash flow improvement lever. We're working on reducing cost across the company and are beginning to see the results. Compared to prior-year day periods, enterprise operating costs are 7% lower. In the third quarter to third quarter comparison, they're 12% lower. On another basis, year-to-date upstream unit operating expenses are down 13% versus last year. At this point, we have identified spend reductions of approximately $4 billion on an annual full run rate basis. About half of this is coming through organizational reviews and portfolio rationalization. And about half working through the supply chain. On the organizational side, lower investment activity, portfolio changes and efficiency reviews across the upstream, gas and midstream and the corporate and service company groups are expected to result in employee reductions of between 6,000 to 7,000. A similar number of contractor reductions are anticipated over the same period.","Supply chain initiatives including rate reductions, greater equipment standardization, project re-scoping, and timing optimization are expected to contribute approximately$2 billion also on an annual run rate basis. An example, we're leveraging our enterprise spend for drill pipe across the company and we're seeing cost reductions of up to 35%. These supply chain benefits will show up as lower operating expense, lower capital expenditures, and lower cost to goods sold. Finally, we're seeing efficiency improvements throughout the organization, which are driving improved value capture. As an example, in the last year, we have seen the drilling cycle time from spud to rig release reduced by 55% within our Permian horizontal drilling program.","Turning to slide 13, a final cash flow lever is asset sales. These are a normal part of portfolio work and contribute proceeds to help manage the balance sheet. We divest assets that no longer have a strategic fit or where we no longer see the cost-effective application of our technology, where future investments do not compete for capital within our portfolio and where we can obtain good value. So there are a number of drivers on asset sales. As you know, we made a commitment to generate $15 billion from the asset sales program from 2014 through 2017, and over the last seven quarters, we made real good progress and achieved $11 billion of this goal. From today out through 2017, we could see another $10 billion in sales proceeds. There's a range around this new expectation because of uncertainties on future market conditions. We're only going to sell assets where we can obtain good value.","Turn to slide 14. We expect to end this year within the production guidance range we provided back in January. Over the next couple of years, you will see the growth projects we've talked about for some time come onstream. Gorgon and Wheatstone and Angola LNG are collectively expected to provide the majority of our volume growth. This growth will not be realized at one time as there's a ramp-up over three years and there's variability depending upon start date. We expect offshore projects, the majority coming from West Africa, also to be a significant part of our growth. Our projected shale and tight ramp-up is steady, though the current price environment is expected to lead to a slower pace of growth than we anticipated at our March Analyst Day.","Similarly, our future base business spending is influenced by the current environment and its impact on economics and partner funding capabilities. We anticipate lower base business spending and, as a result, expect to see higher decline rates compared to our more recent pattern. Under these assumptions, we're anticipating a 13% to 15% increase in production from year-end 2015 to a range of between 2.9 million and 3 million barrels per day in 2017. In 2018, we expect volume growth momentum to continue, largely because of project ramp-up schedules. Note, this range excludes the impact of divestments. Their specific timing is difficult to predict. Actual production growth is also dependent upon production sharing contract effects and the Partitioned Zone restart timing. We will issue further guidance for 2016 production as we normally would in January.","Turning to slide 15, that brings me back where I started. We like the go-forward prospect for energy as we are constructive on the long-term price outlook, but sober about the current realities of lower prices. We have consistent and clear financial priorities. We are taking significant action to balance the cash equations and cover the dividend with free cash flow by 2017. We expect to deliver volume growth and emerge on the other side of this downturn leaner and better. All of our actions are geared toward delivering value through dividend growth and stock price appreciation.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question come from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","John, thanks for the full update here. My first question is that one of the criticisms I continue to hear from investors about big oil is that most of the companies in the industry are just trying to manage two dividend coverage at a point in the cycle rather than through the cycle. And I fully appreciate Chevron has a full stable of capital projects over these past few years, so the spending flexibility is very high. But I was hoping you could just help us tie this new capital spending guidance to what kind of underlying capital spending would be required to keep production flat or what kind of long-term growth rate you think Chevron could achieve using this lower capital base?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a fair question. We do try to invest through the cycle. We got into a period at the early part of this decade where we had some good projects that were frankly stacked up on top of one another. We thought it was the right time to take Gorgon forward. We had good contracts in place. And, frankly, it was somewhat countercyclical when we started in 2009, very late in 2009. Wheatstone, very similar. We thought it was a good market and we needed to move that one as well. We also had Gulf of Mexico projects that following the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, came on \u2013 we started it at the same time. So we went through a period of capital spend that was pretty high. We thought these were very good projects, but there's no doubt that we were going through a period of heavy capital spend. And we kept our balance sheet pretty strong to enable us to withstand the ups and downs that we see in the market.","Now, we saw prices rise dramatically, and then we've seen them come back down a little harder than we thought, so we do have to manage through this cycle. But I think we've been able to weather that pretty well. We are completing the projects that we've got. We're working to preserve the options that we have on some of the nice opportunities we have going forward. But we do have to live within our means here, and if you look at the \u2013 as you know very well, when we look at the pattern of dividends, it's a nice, smooth pattern with increases over 28 years. The pattern of earnings is a lot more volatile during that period, depending upon commodity prices. So we do invest through the cycle with some of these long projects, we have to be able to do that. But we have had a period of heavy spend for \u2013 that we've had to go through. So there is an adjustment when prices go from 100 to 50, and we're just having to deal with that. But, certainly, we're investing through the cycle, but making some adjustments to deal with the low prices we've got.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And is there a specific growth rate you think you can achieve with this new spending base?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well \u2013 certainly, we're going to see disproportionately strong growth through 2017, frankly, into 2018 that, we think, will be very good. Long-term, overall, hydrocarbons are growing in the 1% to 1.5% range. And so that's probably a more reasonable expectation going forward, but frankly we make our investment decisions based on what we can do that is economic. If you look at the history for companies our size, growing at something significantly greater than where aggregate demand for oil and gas is growing is pretty hard to do. And, frankly, we'll be guided by what we think we can do economically.","We'll give you a little bit more information on what we think post-2017 as we finalize our business plan. We're still grinding \u2013 the reason we gave you a range on some of these capital numbers is we're still grinding through that business plan right now to be sure we strike the right balance, and that level of spending will dictate what the growth will be in some of the out years. Just so you have some confidence, though, I made specific comments on the future growth project, the Wellhead Pressure Management project in Tengiz, as one example of investing through the cycle. And that's a significant project, which we're working through final details with government and partner. But we're doing a lot of early work on that project, and that's one that, as we take final investment decision, we won't see the production from that until the next decade. And so that and other investments will provide growth going forward.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure, Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Hey, guys. Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, Paul.","Unknown Speaker","How are you doing, Paul?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very good. Thank you. John, two questions. One is really short, and let me go for that first. With the \u2013 the CapEx is saying that the base operation decline rate will be higher. I think, for the last five years you guys have been about 3% to 4%. Do you have a new number for us?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Actually, we've been better than that. Our base business has been more like 1%. It's been less than 2%, certainly, during that period, and we see it being more like 3%. And so, frankly, if you take just the difference between about 1% and 3% and apply it to our base level of production, you get a little bit lower production than you might have seen otherwise.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Excellent. Second one is a little bit more strategic, I think. If we look at hallmark for Chevron, it has always been on the LNG deepwater macro (00:23:47) project development. But I think the market is concerned, this type of development, there's a high-cost curve, has increasingly choose the last several years at the high end of the industry. And that also that the recent cost deflation that they have not seen as much comparing to the short cycle. So the question is that, do you agree with that view, and is concerned that the hallmark of the company what you're good at and of that to be at the high end of the supply cost curve? If you sort of agree with that, what initiative that Chevron is thinking to try to improve your cost curve position so that they will become, say, at the top quartile or top half at least.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That is a philosophical question, and I'll give you a few comments. First, I think it's true that onshore costs have come down more than offshore costs. So I think that's just factually true, particularly in the United States, but also around the world. So rig rates and service costs, things of that sort. So that certainly is true. It's also true that some short cycle base business spend traditionally has lowered cost, once you have infrastructure in place, and it, certainly, is true that some of the shales are low cost.","I think what's important, though, is if you step back and look at the market overall, it's a 95 million barrel a day market. The shales are about 5 million barrels a day. And there's a decline curve that's very rapid in the shales, of course, in every other producing asset. And it's going to take contributions from all asset classes to meet demand. And so we're going to need all forms of supply, and what we're doing is trying to take on cost reductions and get better everywhere to take costs down. And we've been able to do that. We've shown you some charts periodically, and \u2013 I mean offshore is about 25% of worldwide production and Deepwater production continues to grow and will continue to make contributions to worldwide supply.","But if you look at drilling and completions technology, we've talked about things like the single-trip multizone frac pack, which is just a more efficient to get in and out of the hole to do work. If you look at ocean-bottom nodes work that we're doing, that really gives us better seismic imaging on the ocean floor, subsea systems and boosting technology. All these things are bringing cost down. In fact, in our Gulf of Mexico operations, our Deepwater, we've been able to reduce drilling days significantly. Our drilling days for 10,000 feet are down 25% over the last two years. So we've been able to take those costs down.","And I think you're also likely to see the work that we did in the Gulf of Mexico to consolidate holdings, to create \u2013 for the industry to collaborate to create hub class developments will also help with economies of scale. So I think you'll see bigger hubs, but I think all classes of assets, at the current low prices, will have some spending that will fall out. So it's \u2013 some of your points are true, but I think costs \u2013 you'll see costs over time come down everywhere, and, of course, these projects are over a long period of time. LNG are 40-year projects, so you have a different lifecycle to these things as well, which can impact \u2013 some long-cycle LNG tend to be \u2013 because they're long-cycle, tend to be a little bit lower than \u2013 in RORs, but they have a very long life and cash flow. So they have a little bit different characteristic to them.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for all of the color. Just on the opening remarks, I think you said slower ramp-up on projects. So I presume that's going to be LNG, just looking at the cartoon which you put in the presentation in terms of LNG volumes. Maybe just a bit of a color around Gorgon and Wheatstone. Thanks.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we said that the ramp-up would take place over time. The key is getting them started and getting first LNG and then the ramp-up will take place over time. So, I think, all I was trying to say with the ramp-up is that they will take place over the next three years. My comment wasn't so much about the ramp-up as it was that there will be a start date.","Just in terms of what we're expecting, I indicated that Gorgon will see first cargo in the first quarter. I had updates yesterday afternoon on both Gorgon and Wheatstone, and I was pleased with the progress that I heard. I gave you some of the kind of key points that \u2013 the kind of proof points to where we're headed there. ALNG will start up early next year as well. I mean there's no secret that this has been a challenge, as we work through some of the engineering issues, but once that gets started, I think we've addressed some of the engineering issues that we encountered. There were also some technical bulletins that were issued by the technology owner. We took care of those, as well, during this downtime.","So ALNG will start up early next year as well, and my update on Wheatstone, the key issue there has been module delivery. We had some modules out of Malaysia that were late. The team is working very hard to mitigate schedule there, and what I mean by that is, with some delay in modules, we're really now looking at both construction timing and some of the start-up and commissioning work that will need to be done. We've taken a close look at all the other projects that have been done in Australia and elsewhere, on the East Coast of Australia and Gorgon, and really looking to see if we can take time \u2013 taking time out of those schedules by really taking all the best practices that were effective in those projects to keep us back on a fourth quarter 2016 start-up schedule. So the work is progressing well. The point in having a range on production is really that a quarter one way or another when you've got projects that go up to 200,000 barrels a day at full capacity makes a difference. And so it's just reflecting that reality.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, okay. Second question's on cash flow, maybe for Pat or John. So you can see this year you've done $17.2 billion before working capital so you could gross that up and say $23 billion. Obviously, you've got these new projects, so they'll add cash. And your cash CapEx is going down. So your overall group CapEx is going down to $20 billion to $24 billion. So you can see how the dividend is sustainable in sort of this year's condition. So that works fine. It's still a long way away from the cash flow that was presented a few years back at higher oil prices. So I guess my question is, is there anything this year in the cash generation of the company that you feel has underperformed? Because I guess the downstream has been pretty strong. Maybe it's start-up costs in some of these projects.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Actually, I think if you look at our cash flow, and the rule of thumb that we gave you for the effective oil prices was roughly $350 million after tax in earnings and cash flow for every dollar per barrel. And you multiply it by the change in barrel, I'd think you'd find that our cash flow is better than what you might expect by that rule of thumb.","Now, we're trying to diminish that or reduce that rule of thumb by taking on costs and other things to get better at what we do, but I think you'd find that between those rules of thumb for oil and gas, I think you'd find that it's pretty consistent with that. And in fact, it's better because our downstream has performed so well. So I mean the grim reality is when you have on oil prices in the $40s, as we saw in the third quarter, as you look across the sector, particularly in the United States, it's tough sledding. And if you've got natural gas prices where they are in the U.S., it's a challenge. But we're taking it on by reducing costs. You saw some of the pretty aggressive actions that we're taking around the world to size the organization at the right level, and we think if we get some recovery in prices, you'll see a nice pop from that. But I can't control prices. I can only control my costs and spend.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So it's just oil sensitivity. I understand. Thanks.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Ed. Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes, thanks very much. Hi, everyone. You've already touched on a lot of drivers here, John. But I was just trying to reconcile the new production range of 2.9 to 3.0 relative to the 3.1 million barrels a day that was presented at the analyst meeting. And I wasn't really clear rather the Partitioned Zone was included in the 2.9 to 3.0 or rather it's out, because that's obviously a big reconciling factor. And then how much of it would essentially just be production being pushed into 2018 versus an actual lower production figure from declines?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, there are lots of effects that are in there. First off, the biggest effect in the change versus what we've talked about previously was my comment on declines. You can't take \u2013 depending on which numbers in the range you want to use, we've taken $15 billion of capital out of the business in the go-forward projections from 2016 and 2017 in total. And that impacts, as I said, base decline. So if you add 2% to the decline, that's 100,000 barrels a day over a couple of years. So that's number one.","But to answer your question about the Partitioned Zone, that production a year ago was roughly 80,000 barrels a day. And if you look at where we expect it to be in 2017, it was somewhere under 70,000 barrels a day. And that is included in both estimates. We expect to be back online by that time.","I just returned from the Middle East, and I'll tell you, this has been pretty perplexing to me why we remain shut-in. You have two great allies in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait who are having a disagreement over administrative matters in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It's in the Kuwaiti portion of the zone. And so, they administer work visas, equipment permits and things like that, and they stopped issuing them. And so we ended up shutting in May, and so we've lost the better part of 80,000 barrels a day net to our production.","The reason I think production will come back is because the Kuwaitis themselves are actually being hurt by shutting in a gross amount of 200,000 barrels a day, half of which is theirs. They are hurt; Chevron is hurt, but Saudi Arabia is able to increase production elsewhere. So I think there's motivation for the Kuwaitis to begin issuing work permits and allowing work to continue while whatever disputes are resolved. And our plan is for that production to come back by 2017. In terms of other factors that are out there, we are high-grading some of the investment that we're doing in the shales, so while the growth profile will be nice, it'll be a little lower. Certainly, in the gas area, we've curtailed spending.","We have really gotten our costs down very well in the Marcellus. We can compete with anybody there now. But nobody makes money, that I'm aware of, at $1.50 gas, which is where we are now. And futures prices remain low. So we can compete with anybody, but for the time being, we're scaling back investment there. So these are the kinds of effects that we've rolled in as well as schedule and timing of projects. A notable change from where we had been previously, of course, is Bigfoot, which we show no production in 2017 for.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. That's obviously a big factor, then. Great. And John, just as a follow up. I think you kind of answered this in your response here, but if I'm looking at the capital spend slide in the analysts meeting, I was looking at $32 billion or so of capital spend in 2016 with some flexibility around that. Is the incremental flexibility that you've identified in the numbers you put forward today mostly coming out of that base investment, which is why you're seeing the higher decline curves?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a little bit of both. At $70, when we presented the information that we did to you earlier, that was with the expectation that we would be able to take costs out and that certain projects would continue. So we had funding in the out years. I mean, again, some of it was ultimately discretionary around certain projects. Some of that has been removed or deferred in some cases. And that's just reflecting the realities that we're seeing lower prices. So there's some in large projects, but there is also a good chunk of it that's coming in the base investment area.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Jason.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Good morning, John.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John, I'm wondering how the \u2013 first of all, you've given a lot of information this morning. We really appreciate that, so thank you for all the disclosure. But when we get to 2017, let's assume your prognosis on oil prices or at least the supplied line balance is a little bit more optimistic. How does Chevron's sort of strategic go-forward view change in terms of, perhaps, reupping into another round of large scale projects of which you clearly have plenty of options versus being with the short cycle, I guess, flexibility until it sorts itself out? And what was really at the back of mind is I'm curious if you feel that you've got a big enough footprint to offer you that kind of flexibility. And I've got a quick follow-up, please.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's a very fair question. I commented a little bit earlier, as you know well, Doug. We went through this period with a number of projects stacked on top of one another. I don't think you'll ever see something like that in our \u2013 it was a series of circumstances that got us in that position. I don't think you're likely to see that. We do have a good queue of projects. I talked about the Anchor discovery which could mature into a project, and we've got others. So we'll take the best of those projects and move them forward. But I think on balance you'll see a higher proportion of shorter cycle spend. Five to seven years ago, we didn't really have a good understanding of our Permian basin position, for example. So you will see, over time, additional monies that will go to the shale developments. I mentioned that I had some reviews in my business units yesterday. I also had reviews with my four shale organizations, which are nicely sharing their successes. And the Permian is doing well. I mentioned the Marcellus is doing very well. The Duvernay in Canada, they've taken the practices and implemented them very quickly to get down the cost curve, and we're working closely with YPF and trying to put those same practice in place. We've delineated, we know where the sweet spots are down there. Now we're starting a horizontal drilling program, and we expect to get better. But I think you'll see a more balanced portfolio, and I think you'll see projects that will have good economics at moderate prices, as we work to standardize and take costs down. So we'll have some optionality in the portfolio. And I just \u2013 I can't envision having two big LNG projects at the same time. The Tengiz project is a significant capital project, but I don't see anything like having two Gorgon and Wheatstones plus several Deepwater developments stacked on top of one another.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answer, John. My follow-up is, really, it's kind of on the head count reduction and the fact that you are now getting to the point where these major developments are coming onstream. Are there any portfolio consequences of having to amortize or rationalize a smaller head count across a much larger portfolio? And, of course, the tail changes when Gorgon and Wheatstone come on. So I'm just wondering if outside of the disposals you've given us so far, is there another round of portfolio restructuring that we should maybe look for at some point in Chevron's future? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, there are some changes that will happen in the portfolio. First, just a general comment on the people reductions. One of the large areas for reductions is in Australia. As we ramp down these projects, obviously, you need fewer people. That was known, and in most cases, we had \u2013 Australia has a provision for fixed-term employees, and so those \u2013 some of those people will be coming down off \u2013 will be coming off the payroll. We've got a significant reorganization that's taking place in Angola. And frankly, as we've gone through our business units and gone through our portfolio, we have found ways to make our organization simpler. I don't know any other way to say it. And so we'll be seeing reductions in a lot of different places. Some of them have already happened, in the Marcellus in the North Sea and in our home offices. So we've season those kinds of reductions. There is some portfolio work that I would \u2013 some of it I would classify as normal as assets mature.","You saw the \u2013 for example, we sold our Netherland operations. Our view was that the Chad business was sort of on that \u2013 a lot of the value had already been extracted, so we sold out of that business. So there are assets that get mature where another operator \u2013 as you know well, there are smaller companies or others that want to grind out that last little bit of value that may take on opportunities that won't fit in our portfolio. And so sometimes there's a good match for them, and we'll sell those. Those can result in reduced employees, and I expect it will. But I would classify that as a normal part of our business. These reductions don't include any huge \u2013 the reductions that were forecasted don't include a major portion of the divestitures. The divestiture portion, at this point, is looked at as maybe 10% of that employee reduction, and I would classify it as more routine activity.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, John.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks very much, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. We've covered a lot of ground today, so thank you. John, I know other than matching the cash flows, improving upon project execution is a key focus for you and Chevron. Positive advances in the quarter. Can you discuss the changes you have made here and your confidence that execution will improve as you move through this key execution phase?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you're right. We are focused on that. You know, Jay Johnson went through some of those in a little bit of detail, and Jay, of course, is really good on projects. And I guess I would say there are a couple of things that I would highlight. I mentioned Angola LNG earlier, and that is symptomatic of something that's hit the industry, I think, overall, and that is engineering and engineering maturity. So we simply have to \u2013 in order to have better \u2013 a better understanding of what we're going to build, we have to advance engineering further. So understanding pipe diameter and things down to a more granular level so that we know what materials we're going to need and we can do better cost estimates is, I would say, number one. You know, the example we've given is the Tengiz project, which is a big one that we'll move forward with here. But that one \u2013 we're over \u2013 we're 35% done with the engineering now, and we'll be somewhere close to 50% by the time we take final investment decisions. So that's number one.","But once you complete the engineering, you also have to do more reviews of that engineering, and, I would say, at a higher level, taking a look at constructability of facilities so that you don't \u2013 so that you're sure what you build really is what you want. I'll give you an example. One of the changes we're making in Angola LNG is designing more flexibility in the front end of the plant. It's an associated gas project, and so there's greater variability in feed quality. And I think if we had done more work at the front end, perhaps, we would have designed that with more flexibility in mind. So those are the kinds of things that we're going to need to do.","We also have to be very cognizant of the contracting work that is \u2013 the kind of contract that you sign and what incentives are in that contract for the contractor. And that will dictate the level of oversight better. We're likely \u2013 for example, we're likely on the Tengiz project to do more in the way of coordinating the activity of subcontractors on that job, ourselves. So all of these things, I think, are going to make us better, not to mention the usual things around quality assurance that the industry have seen and things of that sort. So the answer is, yes, we're working on improving execution.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And my second question Anchor, it looks like great appraisal results. Any comments on reservoir quality, size range or next appraisal steps, and maybe even somewhat related to Doug's question before. I mean, in a down cycle, do you see an advantage in developing these longer cycle assets where you can cement or secure a lower cost structure versus an onshore asset where you benefit faster on cost savings, but you will presumably reflate over time with a higher decline rate? Maybe how do you think about that?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We have to \u2013 we just finished the second well, and so we're going to drill \u2013 we're likely to have another appraisal well that we'll drill, but we're sort of assessing those results. It's likely to be a hub scale type development. You recall, we've said previously that hub scale assets are going to be 400 million to 500 million barrel type developments, and so we feel pretty good about this one. We've got more work to do, but we feel good.","As far as doing them off-cycle, this one needs more work to do before we can progress it. So there's a cycle time to that. Costs, I don't want to give you the wrong impression, costs have come down. Deepwater rig rates, you can get deepwater rigs a lot less than previously. They have come down. I think the opportunity, if you talk to some of the equipment providers, they would say the industry can do a better job in standardizing to help them drive costs down. I think the tendency is to think we can continue to extract money out of the supply chain just based on working rates down, but we also have to work with them to help them become more efficient in what they do. And finally, some of the big cost reductions are in drilling efficiency, which I noted \u2013 which I noted earlier.","So our view \u2013 just to be clear, our view is that hub class developments in that 400 million to 500 million barrel range can be developed at moderate prices that wouldn't be out of line with the kinds of prices you all are thinking about, and that tie-backs in the 100 million to 200 million barrel category can also be economic. But we're going through our plans right now doing exactly what you described in trying to decide which of these to move countercyclically and which are just going have to wait.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Makes sense. Thanks.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Evan. Thanks","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","John, a year ago you were guiding to $40 billion of spending in 2017; now you're guiding to $20 billion to $24 billion. Can you break down what compromises that $15 billion? And just a very quick follow-up as well. Can you give us the start date for Tengiz? Thank you.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, but, you're saying a year ago. If you're saying before oil prices dropped, yeah, we were guiding to a higher level of spend because we've got a good queue of projects, and that would be the opportunity set that we would contemplate (50:27).","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, I guess what I wanted to know is what projects, how much of it is cost saving, how much of it is deferred projects? Which projects have been deferred? The specifics of where we got the $15 billion to $20 billion of savings from. Thank you.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, it's across the board. I mean, there are some specific projects. An example, yeah, we've talked about the Rosebank project. We've talked about the Indonesia Deepwater development project. Both of those are not in these forecasts in terms of significant spend during the planned period. I think both projects will ultimately go. Kitimat was on our list. We're pacing that project as well. Multiple Angola projects were in pre-feed, so there were a lot of projects. Bear in mind, some of these projects we think will go, and it could be that they start in the third year of the plan. But for now, a lot of these have come out, and we're going to pace them.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","But I guesstimate that about half of it is cost savings from lower prices, and half is deferred projects. Is that an \u2013 I'm guesstimating. I just wonder.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Paul. Look, I don't have a precise number for it. Certainly our view of development costs for the shales have come down significantly during that period, but I don't have a good breakdown for you on that. Sorry.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, and just the start-up for Tengiz?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's a function of when we take FID, but we'll give you more details on it. But you can think of it as being into the next decade.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","But just to be clear, I think that you said that the spending in the 2017 number does include some Tengiz spending?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It does. It does.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, we've been doing work to get the port ready. We've been doing work on site infrastructure. I mean, one of the lessons learned on these big capital projects is that you need to take care of some of these certainly long leads in certain cases and site infrastructure and preparation work. So we're spending some money as part of the feed work that we're doing to get greater certainty on costs. But this is a five-plus year kind of construction project, so you can think of it as being into the next decade. And we'll give you more detail after we take FID.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you, sir.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Thank, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question, please.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Folks, good morning. Just two quick points of clarity, if I could. For one, I presume that the CapEx numbers you're providing here include equity affiliate spend. I think historically that's trended around $4 billion and has been self-funding. I'm just trying to see if, for one, making sure that, that is in there, and is that a fair estimate in those numbers? And then, secondly, U.S. natural gas has been ramping up pretty healthy as far as production is concerned. John, you mentioned a low breakeven on Marcellus. I just wanted to confirm, is that the main driver of that? Thanks a bunch.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The answer is yes. It's $4 billion to $5 billion in equity and affiliate spend. Remember, as we ramp up the Tengiz project, we've got the CPChem project. We've got some significant spending that's taking place in affiliates. And your second question on Marcellus, we're not shutting down activity completely there. Don't get me wrong. But we're not going to be running six to eight rigs or anything like that in these kinds of conditions. Right now we've just a couple of rigs that are running there.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. And John, if I could confirm this. Equity affiliates, that should remain self-funding, is that correct?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not necessarily. I mean, in general the answer is yes. It's depending on where prices are. I mean, it depends on circumstances. Because as the Tengiz project ramps up, there is significant spend. And there are loan provisions that are being worked as a part of that project, some of which will be equity partners' loans.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe if I could follow up a little bit on some of your commentary around the longer cycle project spend. The deferrals that we've seen, I mean, I guess it comes from a combination of things, which is either lower levels of operating cash flow as well as kind of an effort to drive down project costs and improve economics.","As you think going forward of where you are right now, I mean, your effort to continue to defer at this point, is it driven primarily by this point by your outlook on cash flows, or do you think that there's still a meaningful amount of either cost deflation on the projects, or, I guess, strategic engineering improvements on your end that have to happen? If cash flow is sure to improve, do you feel like you're at a point where the industry will be able to start to re-invest in those, or is there still gains to be made?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a fair question. I would say a lot of it is cash flow driven right now. We're still in the final throes of our revisions to the Tengiz project cost estimates, but we have a pretty good idea where that's going to land. And we have a pretty good idea of the sort of the glide path on technology and where costs are going to go for deepwater projects.","But there is some uncertainty on price, and, look, I know my shareholders value our dividend. I know our shareholders value increases in the dividend. And I know they value us investing in high-return projects, and so there is some uncertainty on price. And we want to be sure that \u2013 we've kept our balance sheet in good condition, and we want to be sure we just strike that right balance to continue to pay and grow the dividend and invest in good projects. So we're just working through the cycle and kind of living within our means while we take cost down.","One of the things that happens if you're taking on fewer projects is the organization will focus harder on getting more efficient at what they do. And we need to do that. We've got a very good U.S. upstream business, but we didn't make any money in this quarter. And so, we need to get more efficient at what we do, we need to look at our structures and we need to get our costs down. And in the meantime, we're going to be ready for some of the projects that I talked about earlier to move them forward. We'll have some countercyclical investment, but we do need to live within our means.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. So then maybe if I could just get your quick thoughts on maybe on global gas demand, Asian gas demand, maybe even more in particular and whether probably less is a relation to Gorgon and Wheatstone, as those are contracted to a large extent. But has there been any shift in your view on global gas demand or Asian gas demand longer term? And how would that affect potentially your longer term view on incremental LNG projects going forward?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's a fair question. I think overall, demand is set to grow very rapidly. And I think the conventional wisdom has been that you're just going to see natural gas displacing coal and gas demand just growing at very rapid rates. Gas has to be competitive with other options in the portfolio for these developing countries. Affordability is very much key, and so while we see literally a doubling of LNG consumption if you go out 10 years versus now, very significant growth in demand, I don't think that's changed. What has changed is the supply picture. We have seen a number of projects take FID and a number of projects are under construction, and the world economy isn't growing quite as fast as we might have thought a few years ago. It's still growing, but it isn't growing quite as rapidly as a few years ago. And so it's a well-supplied market right now. There still are contracting opportunities out there. Customers do value security of supply. They do value having a known source of supply. Not everybody wants to run their economy on spot gas. And so I think there are a number of buyers that want to firm up supply. For example, we signed a medium-term contract earlier this year, and we think there are other opportunities to do that. And as you see slowdown in FIDs on this, I think you'll see consuming countries take stock of that and start to think about additional commitments more toward \u2013 that would be more geared toward supply in the early to middle part of the next decade.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, John. I appreciate it.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Ryan.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, thank you, and good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess I'd like to kind of get a little more into some of the impacts of potential production declines from \u2013 that you've mentioned from the equity spending at Tengiz, but think about spending on non-operated projects that you're on or non-operating legacy production, and how that may impact the sort of revised production guidance we should think about, or even as a challenge in the 18 and beyond world.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not \u2013 what \u2013 is there a special non-op question or concern?","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, not a specific one, but let's just think about anywhere where you're not necessarily making the decision, right. You're dependent on someone else for that. How do you maybe take that into account in your forecast as a risk factor?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, certainly we're in dialogue with operators. For example, Total is operator in some of the West Africa projects that are potentially in the portfolio. We're an operator of some, and they're an operator of some. And so the dialogue has been pretty good. I would say the biggest area where we can get influenced, frankly, is in the Permian where we've got some smaller companies and they're very good at what they do, but their budgets can move around a little bit. But that's nothing that we can't deal with and accommodate. But I would \u2013 I don't think that's going to determine our flexibility in our capital budget.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, I wasn't thinking so much of capital budget as I was just -","you mentioned earlier the underlying production decline kind of being close to 1% in your outlook. You're thinking maybe more of the 2% to 3%, and I'm just kind of wondering what would push you to the 3% or potentially beyond the 3% being these things that are not necessarily in your full control.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's \u2013 I'm not going to push the 2% to \u2013 I'm not going to say the change of 1% to 3% is a function of non-op decisions, because I think everyone in the industry is doing similar things now. We've been reasonably well aligned on budgets with our partners, whether we're the operator talking to them or they're the operator talking to us.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next -","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've got time for one more.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI Group.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, everybody.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","John, your new capital management plan appears to be one of the more direct steps towards better capital allocation outcomes that we've seen announced thus far in a super major category on these calls. And on this point, I wanted to see if you'd elaborate a little bit on the drivers of the proposed changes. Meaning, a few minutes ago, you talked about how the cyclical element, which is in response to lower oil prices and the need for cash flow to cover the dividend at some point was part it. But also, is there an element of the new plan which relates to the more challenging, competitive condition that appeared to have been a factor for the longer term industry returns in recent years? So the question's really, what's driving the more disciplined approach to investment at Chevron internally when you guys put this together? Meaning, is it cyclical, is it secular, is it both? Could you just spend a minute on that?","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Truthfully, I would say that there's an element of all the things that you described. I think in general we were heading through a period where we had a disproportionate amount of our spend in big, long cycle projects. So we were going to head to a period where we were going to be digesting those projects and then we would supplement those with a more ratable number of long cycle projects, but then continue to invest in that new base of assets that we've acquired. And so I think that pattern is playing out. I think the issue is what can we do to enhance returns? We've said before, we took down our price deck a little bit from where we were before. And so there is a new reality in that sense, and whether that's due to industry supply conditions or the U.S. dollar or a lot of other factors that have taken commodities down, there is a new reality, if you will, in the commodity price environment for both oil and gas that we're seeing. The industry has been fabulously successful in providing supply. A lot of it is through shale, but also elsewhere. So our focus going forward directionally is consistent with what we would have done anyway. But we've taken spend down, as I commented earlier, to help us really focus on getting the most out of the assets that we have and taking costs down so that we can improve returns. It's unacceptable for us to not be able to make money at whatever commodity price the market is giving us. And that's where we are.","Now, I do think commodity prices will improve, and I've said that, but we need to improve our returns. And so, I think that's the focus. And as I commented earlier, if you push the organization in that direction \u2013 I mean, we're already seeing \u2013 I mean, it's hard to put together a business plan right now because the organization is achieving good things in terms of getting our costs down, and it's hard to be forward-looking to know exactly where all the efficiencies might come from as the organization gets more focused on making the best of the assets that they have. So maybe that's the way I can describe it. So it's all of the above including taking costs out of bigger projects going forward.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Thanks, John.","John S. Watson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, so. Well, thank you very much. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in the company.

Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","All right. Good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pierre Breber, Executive Vice President, Downstream & Chemicals; and Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.","But before I get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements and we ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.","Turning now to Slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $4 billion or $2.11 per diluted share. This is more than $2 billion higher than the same period a year ago and this is the highest recorded earnings per share since third quarter 2014. The company's year-to-date earnings were $11.1 billion or $5.79 per diluted share. This was $5 billion higher than the same period a year ago.","The quarter included the unfavorable impacts of a project write-off, an impairment, and a nonrecurring contract settlement, which totaled $930 million. These were partially offset by a $350 million gain on the sale of our Southern African refining and marketing assets. Foreign exchange losses for the quarter were $51 million.","A reconciliation of special items, foreign exchange and other non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange impacts, earnings totaled $4.7 billion or $2.44 per share.","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $9.6 billion. Excluding working capital effects, cash flow from operations was $9.2 billion. Cash flow from operations continued to grow in the third quarter and was the highest it has been in nearly five years, back when Brent crude prices were averaging about $110 per barrel. Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled $21.5 billion, about $7 billion more than a year ago.","At quarter-end debt balances stood at approximately $36 billion, giving us a debt ratio of 19%. During the third quarter we paid $2.1 billion in dividends and we repurchased $750 million of our shares during the quarter. We currently yield 4%.","Turning to Slide 4. Our third-quarter cash flow from operations, excluding working capital effects, increased to $9.2 billion, reflecting higher realizations and growing volumes in our U.S. and international upstream.","On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, totaled $23.3 billion. This included $600 million in discretionary U.S. pension contributions, $800 million in deferred income taxes, and affiliate dividends approximately $2.5 billion less than equity affiliate earnings.","Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.6 billion and $9.8 billion year-to-date. The result, free cash flow excluding working capital effects of $5.6 billion for the quarter and $13.5 billion year-to-date.","Through the first three quarters of the year, normalized for $60 Brent, we are on track to deliver the $14 billion cash generation guidance communicated at the Analyst Meeting in March.","Turning now to Slide 5, a view of our sources and uses of cash through the quarter. We are delivering on all four of our financial priorities. We maintained our commitment to competitive dividend growth by paying out $2.1 billion in cash dividends to our shareholders. We continue to fund our highest return projects at a reasonable pace. We further strengthened our balance sheet and paid down debt by $2.4 billion, lowering our debt ratio to 19%. And finally, we commenced our share repurchase program in the third quarter and returned $750 million of surplus cash to shareholders.","Now on Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update on our portfolio optimization efforts. Through the third quarter. We received before tax asset sale proceeds of $1.9 billion, including the divestment of our Southern African refining and marketing business. Most recently, we signed sale and purchase agreements including the sale of our 12% non-operated interest in the Danish Underground Consortium and the sale of our 40% interest in the Rosebank project west of Shetlands in the UK.","In addition, we continue the process of marketing our UK Central North Sea assets. As with all divestments, we are focused on generating good value from any transaction. The progress we have made year-to-date on portfolio optimization puts us on track to generate $5 billion to $10 billion in asset sale proceeds over the 2018 to 2020 time period as we guided back in March.","Turning to Slide 7, third quarter 2018 after tax earnings $4 billion were approximately two times that of third quarter 2017. Special Items reduced earnings by approximately $1 billion between periods. In the current period, special items included a gain on the sale of South African R&M assets. The write-off of the Tigris project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, an impairment on an asset held for sale, and a non-recurring contractual settlement. All of which netted to a negative $580 million.","In third quarter 2017, special items included a gain on the sale of Canadian R&M assets, less project write-offs, for a net positive impact of $455 million. Foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by $61 million between periods.","Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by almost $3.5 billion between the periods or about five times, mainly on improved realizations and higher liftings. Oil prices were approximately 45% higher in the current period than a year ago.","Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by about $100 million. This reflected lower margins in Asia and in the U.S., along with foregone contributions from our Canadian downstream assets which were sold. Favorable timing effects and higher earnings from CPChem were partially offsetting. The variance in the other segment was primarily the result of higher corporate tax items and interest expense.","Turning to Slide 8, this compares results for third quarter 2018 with second quarter 2018. Third quarter results were approximately $600 million higher than second quarter. Third quarter special items as detailed previously, when compared to second quarter's non-recurring receivable write-down, resulted in a net negative variance between the quarters of $310 million.","Of about equal size was an adverse swing in foreign exchange impacts between the periods. Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $1 billion between the quarters due to higher liftings and improved realizations.","During the quarter we were in an overlifted position but on a year-to-date basis we are modestly underlifted. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange improved by almost $240 million, reflecting lower operating expenses, particularly those associated with the second quarter turnaround at the Pascagoula Refinery. Favorable timing effects were also evident between periods.","Turning to Slide 9, third quarter production was 2.96 million barrels a day, our highest ever production for a quarter. This moved our year-to-date production to 2.88 million barrels a day. Excluding the impact of 2018 asset sales, which is the middle bar, our year-to-date production growth through the third quarter was 6%higher than the daily average production for full year 2017.","As Jay mentioned on our last quarter call, we had planned turnaround activity across multiple locations in the third quarter. The production impact from these turnarounds was 103,000 barrels per day. 2018 asset sales impacted third quarter production by 18,000 barrels a day and impacted year-to-date production by 12,000 barrels per day. At year end we expect to be at the top of our original guidance range, approximately 7% growth excluding the impact of asset sales. And this is even without normalizing for the impact of current prices on production sharing contracts.","Turning to Slide 10, third quarter 2018 production was 2.96 million barrels per day, an increase of 239,000 barrels a day, or 9% from third quarter 2017. Major capital projects increased production by 237,000 barrels per day, as we continued to ramp up multiple projects, most significantly Wheatstone, Gorgon and Hebron.","Shale and tight production increased 155,000 barrels per day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, where production grew by 80% from a year ago.","Base declines, net of production from new wells, such as those in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria were 6,000 barrels a day. Major turnarounds, along with planned and unplanned downtime reduced production by 59,000 barrels per day between the periods.","Entitlement effects reduced production by 41,000 barrels a day due primarily to rising prices between the periods. The impact of 2017 and 2018 asset sales reduced production by 31,000 barrels a day between the periods.","Now on Slide 11, Gorgon and Wheatstone continued to operate very well. Combined, these plants averaged 379,000 barrels a day of production during the quarter. This is a 35% increase over the previous quarter.","We had two planned maintenance activities on Wheatstone during the quarter, a scheduled compressor overhaul on Train 1 and a startup strainer removal on Train 2. These reduced production by approximately 21,000 barrels a day on average over the quarter.","We are finalizing the commissioning of the Wheatstone domestic gas plant and expect first sales in first quarter 2019. For this gas, production and sales activity will be dependent on local demand.","With all five Australian LNG trains running reliably, we're focusing on finding opportunities to incrementally add production and enhance reliability.","Turning to the Permian, on Slide 12, Permian shale and tight production in the second quarter was 338,000 barrels per day, representing an increase of 150,000 barrels per day. Let me say it again, this is up 80% relative to the same quarter last year. As many of you will realize, that's the equivalent of adding a mid-sized Permian pure play E&P company in a matter of months.","In our operated Permian acreage, where we hold 100% of the working interest, we had an average of 20 rigs in operation during the quarter. We also had 21 non-operated rigs working on our acreage, which equates to approximately 7 net rigs, Chevron's share.","As Jay discussed on the last earnings call, we remain focused on returns, capital efficiency and operational discipline. Within this framework our production levels are trending about one year ahead of the guidance we gave in March.","I'll now pass it on to Pierre, who can give an update on our downstream and chemicals business.","Pierre R. Breber - Chevron Corp.","Thanks. Pat. We have a tightly integrated and profitable downstream and chemicals business. Slide 13 shows that Chevron's downstream has consistently led our peer group in earnings per barrel. And during the past five years our adjusted return on capital employed has averaged over 15%.","Our fuels businesses are focused in the best markets in the U.S. and Asia. In petrochemicals, we are feedstock advantaged, heavily weighted to ethane. And we are the only major integrated with wholly owned lubricants and additives businesses. Looking forward, our objective is to grow earnings across our feedstock to customer value chains and target investments to lead the industry in returns.","Now let me address IMO 2020. As a reminder, new International Maritime Organization regulations will reduce the sulfur emissions from bunker fuels starting in 2020. Although there are a lot of unknowns and uncertainties with how markets will react, most agree that complex refiners should benefit, as demand increases for marine gas oil.","Slide 14 shows that Chevron's refining network has the highest complexity and the highest percentage of conversion capacity among its peer group. It is a result of high-grading our refinery portfolio over the years and investing in upgrading capability. Forward markets expect mid-distillate margins to increase post-IMO and high sulfur fuel oil and sour crude discounts to widen.","Chevron's refining network produces over 40% mid-distillates and about 5% fuel oil. And as a complex refiner, we run a high proportion of heavy sour crudes. We believe we're well positioned to benefit from IMO impacts.","We like the petrochemicals business and have highly competitive 50-50 joint ventures in ChevronPhillips Chemical Company and GS Caltex. Slide 15 shows our major chemical projects in various stages of development.","CPChem successfully started up its Gulf Coast project after a remarkable recovery from Hurricane Harvey. The ethylene plant reached full production rates two weeks after a March start up and exceeded nameplate capacity soon after. CPChem is focused on additional de-bottlenecking opportunities.","Following its success with this project, CPChem is in the evaluation stage of a second one in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We like the Gulf Coast because of its feedstock advantages and expect competitive ethane supply for a long time. We are focused on developing the most capital and cost efficient project, one that is on the left side of the supply stack.","GSC is in front end engineering and design for a mixed feed olefins cracker, about two-thirds naphtha and the rest refinery LPGs and off-gases. We plan to make a final investment decision next year. Estimated costs are not final, but we expect our share of the capital to be a little more than $1 billion.","The fundamentals of chemicals are strong, but costs always matter. We'll continue to be disciplined in how we invest in our next set of chemical projects.","In our fuels businesses, retail is an important part of a tightly integrated value chain that starts with our complex refineries. Two recent retail highlights are shown on Slide 16.","In Mexico, we have about 100 Chevron-branded marketer-owned sites. Customer response has been very positive. Stations rebranded during the first half of 2018 averaged 30% higher sales through September.","We've also signed access agreements for two new terminals under development. After the terminals are complete, we will have built, in a capital-light way, an additional market to integrate with our West Coast value chain.","We continue to grow our convenience store offering with now over 800 stores. As the only major with a leading C-store franchise in the U.S., we have an advantage in retaining and growing our relationships with retailers. Same-store sales at ExtraMile C-stores have grown 7.4% year-to-date, more than double the industry average.","In the digital space, we made announcements on new mobile pay partnerships in the U.S. and went live with a pay app in Southeast Asia. These are important efforts to speed up and simplify the fuels retailing experience.","In our Oronite additives business, we celebrated the groundbreaking for our blending and shipping project in China. This facility will help us serve the growing Chinese market when it's operational in 2021.","Finally, in our lubricants business we are co-developing a renewable biodegradable base oil with ultra low viscosity and ultra low volatility, important properties for OEMs as they develop engines to meet increasingly stringent fuel efficiency and environmental regulations. It's early days, but we're excited by the potential of this new product.","As shown earlier, Chevron's downstream and chemicals has a track record of consistent financial performance. That said, in any one quarter refinery planned turnarounds impact our results. Through our recent investor engagements, we've heard your requests for improved guidance in this area.","Slide 17 shows the average after-tax quarterly earnings impact of planned turnaround activity for the last five years for our refineries in the U.S. and Asia. The impact is defined as shutdown expenses, plus the forgone margin from volumes not produced. Planned turnarounds are seasonal, but have a fair amount of variability in any given quarter. As a result, we believe that the best way to provide forward-looking guidance is by characterizing turnaround activity as high if the earnings impact is expected to be greater than $200 million; low if it's expected to be below $100 million; and medium in between. During 2018 the first two quarters had high turnaround activity and the third quarter was low.","Now I'll turn it over to Pat to close out with fourth quarter guidance and year-to-date results.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay. So now looking at Slide 18 just a couple of comments about expectations for the remainder of the year we expect positive production trends to continue in the fourth quarter fueled by sustained Permian growth and fewer planned upstream turnarounds.","Downstream in contrast has a high turnaround activity planned and this is expected to weigh on this segment's fourth quarter earnings and cash flow. For C&E, you'll recall that we don't budget for unanticipated inorganic spend. Through the first nine months, we have spent approximately $150 million on inorganic C&E and we expect to spend a total of $600 million for the full-year, primarily as the result of six blocks won in the Brazil licensing round. Organic C&E is running modestly above our plan and we expect it to be approximately 5% higher than our full-year budget of $18.3 billion.","Cash flow from operations is expected to be strong in the fourth quarter. Oil prices of course will be the primary determinant of this outcome and we can't predict those. While we do anticipate fewer affiliate dividends in the fourth quarter, we'll continue to benefit from further production growth, modest asset sale proceeds and some expected additional release of working capital.","Lastly, let's revisit our year-to-date results and how they compare against commitments that we laid out earlier in the year. Cash flow from operations is expanding as anticipated given our strong production growth, favorable market conditions and asset reliability. Excluding the impact of asset sales, production growth is currently at 6% relative to full-year 2017 and we expect to end the year closer to a 7% year-on-year increase. Our Permian assets are performing well ahead of guidance.","We continue to rationalize and optimize our portfolio, with proceeds of $1.9 billion captured year-to-date. We're demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline and are returning cash to our shareholders.","Total shareholder distributions have amounted to $7.2 billion year-to-date, $6.4 billion in dividends and $750 million in share repurchases.","We've had a very solid operating and financial performance so far in 2018 and we expect that performance to continue. We're seeing significant growth in cash generation due to the above plan production growth, continuing capital and operating expense discipline and favorable market conditions. As a result, we've been able to grow shareholder distributions and strengthen our balance sheet.","We believe that Chevron offers a very attractive offering for investors with oil price levered momentum in the up cycle and low cost portfolio resilience in the down cycle.","So that concludes our prepared remarks and we're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue and so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll certainly do our best to get all your questions answered. Jonathan, please go ahead and open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thank you very much. I guess first turn to the Permian. Obviously very strong operational performance there in 3Q. And while I certainly wouldn't prorate the growth that you saw there moving forward, I was hoping you might be able to address some of the factors that led to such strong production growth.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay, Jason, thanks. I think, first of all we have been ramping up to the 20 rigs throughout the last couple of years and we achieved that 20 rig potential or realization here in the third quarter so that was the primary determinant. We are operating off of a new basis of design and we're finding that that has been incredibly successful. We're pursuing high density fracs and we're finding that that has been successful as well. So there's a number of factors that have led to the overall improvement that we have seen and I would say too, our NOJV partners, because prices have been stronger, perhaps than they were thinking at the beginning of the year, the NOJV activity has risen as well.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","That's great. And maybe to take advantage of Pierre being on the call. Pierre, we've had the discussion before about your downstream business being very high return and very high margin but relatively small compared to your competitors. I believe you've been quoted as saying that you may be interested in expanding your refining presence on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Can you, if that's correct, maybe talk about some of the strategic drivers for wanting to expand there?","Pierre R. Breber - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Jason. Look, I won't comment on media reports or speculation but what I can say is I have for almost as long as I've been on the job now, over two years, talked about the strategic rationale of a Gulf Coast refinery, for three primary reasons. One, we're the only major company that operates one refinery in the Gulf Coast. Second is, we have a strong retail presence in Texas that we supply with third party barrels. And third is the possible integration and synergies with our advantaged position that Pat just talked about in the Permian.","At the same time, I've also said we don't need to do anything. Pascagoula is a top quartile refinery. We have a tight value chain built around it. And I've also said we're value-oriented. Any acquisition has to be at the right price. Any investment that we do has to earn attractive returns. And so, I think that's all I can really say at this time.","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Jason.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. Appreciate the comments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey congrats, guys on a good quarter. Pat and Pierre, I want to get your thoughts on divestitures. You laid out a $5 billion to $10 billion target. You're about $2 billion of the way there, just how do you feel about the ability to achieve that? Where do you think you guys are going to fall in the range and just any updates on deal \u2013 on processes that might be outstanding.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yes, I would say, overall, Neil, we feel positive about coming in within the range that we've indicated, the $5 billion to $10 billion over the three-year period of time. We're at $2 billion a little bit and change so far. There is a little bit more that will come in we believe in the fourth quarter. And then we have certain, I guess, I would say marketing activities that are underway already that should, we believe, realize results in 2019.","So we feel comfortable about the $5 billion to $10 billion range. The assets \u2013 we're finding for those that are being marketed for example in the U.K. we're having reasonable interest. Actually, I'd say probably significant interest being shown by multiple potential buyers. So I think we feel very good about that range that we've given.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's great. And then when we talk to investors about \u2013 who are a little bit more skeptical of the bullish view on Chevron, they point to two things. I want you guys to address it head-on. And one is the concern that post-2020, capital spending might need to materially increase because you're in a period of harvest right now, but you might not have the projects to reload growth post-2020. The second source of concern is around production sharing contracts in Asia and the risk of them rolling off, particularly in Thailand, less so of a concern around Indonesia but anything you can say on both of those topics to help comfort the market would be helpful.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay. Well, let me just speak here to the issue around growth once we get into the early part of the next decade and investment opportunities therein. We obviously have a wonderful position in the Permian and with other unconventionals. And as you know, these are low capital intensity, short cycle high-return opportunities for continued volumetric growth. So that's number one.","We've got TCO coming online with production in 2022. We have opportunities for de-bottlenecking on our LNG plants in Australia. We're just getting them to a fully run rate, high-reliability position now and we think the opportunity for reasonable de-bottlenecking is evident over the next several years.","We have growth potential in deepwater. We have three potential areas in Gulf of Mexico; Ballymore, Whale and Anchor. And I think that's where people are thinking there will be substantial capital. And the reality is our objective is to pace those out over a several year period of time. And there's nothing in terms of the intensity on future investment there that would ever come close to the intensity that we've had in prior years which is where I think people's \u2013 they're thinking the history is going to color our future and that's really not the case.","So I think we have growth potential, but it's going to be at a much lower capital rate. There may be some need to increase capital coming in say, 2021, 2022, that kind of range. But it will be small relative to where people might be thinking. Now I've taken so long on that; what was the other question that you had? Oh, the concession extension?","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Concession. Yeah.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yes. Okay. So I think it's \u2013 I'm really glad you asked the question because there's been a lot written on this and it's a good opportunity to try to work through the specifics. So if you look at our particular situation \u2013 and by the way, we put concession extension information, our expiration information in our stat supplement. So I really encourage people to look at those documents and get a good understanding of what is coming due when.","But if you look out over the next three to four years, we've got about six contracts that will expire. We have one that is in a non-producing area, this is the Nsoko contract in Congo which expires in 2018 here. In Indonesia, we have the East Kalimantan PSC that expired just about 10 days ago or so. And the Makassar Strait PSC is going to expire in 2020. And we have a small NOJV PSC in China which is going to expire in 2022.","So there are a couple of others that have more substance to us. All of those are relatively immaterial and not substantive. There are a couple that do have impacts for us and one would be the Rokan PSC in Indonesia and this has gotten a lot of press lately. We did bid on this, but we were not the successful bidder. The government of Indonesia elected to return this asset to Pertamina and this will expire in 2021. We're disappointed in that but we did put in a bid that we felt offered value to the government of Indonesia, as well as to the Chevron shareholder. Our net production in Indonesia today is about 100,000 barrels a day. But the earnings and cash contribution out of that is much smaller than that would indicate as a percentage of the upstream portfolio.","And then the other contract of note, concession area is the Erawan PSC in Thailand and this expires in 2022. I can't say a great deal about this at this particular moment, but we have put in a bid that is under evaluation. We are taking the same approach that we did in Indonesia, which is to put in a bid that we feel offers value for Indonesia but also offers value for the Chevron shareholder.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time.","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning. First question, I guess...","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Good morning.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...would just be a follow-up on the Permian, given your success that you're seeing there and that you hit your rig count targets for the end of the year. How are you thinking about the go-forward plans here? You talked previously about leveling off with the rig count at this point. But given the success you're seeing, does this make you want to kind of lean forward and add rigs in the Permian? Or how are you thinking about that today?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","So I think we feel good about having gotten to the 20 rigs. And our approach right now would be to take a bit of a pause and to really focus on capturing all the efficiencies that we can that a 20 rig fleet would necessitate basically. And that's from the land position to the drillings to the completions, all the way through to the market realization.","So our approach right now is to take a pause, gain all that efficiency. We're really focused on the returns that we're getting from the investment that we're making. And we want to make sure that we're as capital efficient and as operating efficient as we can possibly be. And then we can always reappraise and look at our options and decide what we would like to do going forward.","I will say that it's not so much about the actual rig \u2013 number of rigs that you have drilling, but it's the activity that's being generated and the results that you're getting and the cost per BOE that you're getting. And so I think over time we're going to try to move what we consider to be a critical performance metric away from just the rigs to something that would be more indicative of an efficiency measure.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Got it. That makes sense. Second question is just on the balance sheet metrics, 19% gross debt to cap, but 15% net debt to cap, so you're trending quite well on the balance sheet.","How do you think about the desire to \u2013 given where we're at in the cycle, to continue to lower that metric versus other opportunities? You obviously started with the buyback last quarter of $3 billion. Is there any desire to potentially at some stage in the future increase that amount? Or given \u2013 do you have a more kind of conservative macro view, and you'd rather stick with where you're at?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yeah, I think \u2013 so it's a wonderful question and it's a great position to be in, Phil. We have only three months into the share repurchase program. We obviously feel very comfortable and good about the cash generation that is occurring in the company. And we also know that we've got a confirmed $18 billion to $20 billion capital program.","So if we are in a position where we continue to see high cash generation, the market continues to give \u2013 to be at prices at current levels or approximately current levels, and we know our confirmed spending, then there's going to be surplus cash that is being generated.","And if those circumstances all materialize, then we would obviously give consideration to the size of the share repurchase program. We will want the same kind of parameters that I outlined back in the last quarter to be evident. In other words, we want to make sure that whatever we do, we can have it be sustainable and that it's a reliable component available to our shareholders.","I will say in that regard, the improvement to the balance sheet supports that sustainability. Because to the extent that we have a stronger balance sheet, then when we get into a downturn on price, and we believe that at some point in time that will come. When we get into that position, then we've got a balance sheet that can help support distributions to shareholders through the thin part of the cycle.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. Okay, thanks a lot.","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, Pat, I'm afraid I'm probably the guy responsible for all these PSC questions, so I apologize. But I do want to follow up on the question from earlier if I may.","Thailand is a legacy tax concession. And it's been re-bid as a PSC. The government has been quite transparent about the minimum terms. So I just wonder if you could address one issue. If you look at third-party analysis on this, meaning tax \u2013 very old tax framework information, this thing could be as much as $2 billion of your cash flow this year. Is that anywhere close to being right? And if so, under the new terms, how would you expect the delta on cash flow to look, even though that you might retain the contract from a production standpoint?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yes, Doug, you're putting me in an uncomfortable position. I really can't comment while commercial discussions are underway and bids have been put forth and are being evaluated.","I think we're going to have to wait and see what the outcome is from the discussions and the \u2013 whatever gets awarded. I think by the end of this year is sort of the planned date for understanding what the outcome will be. We'll have to give you an indication then of what the results will be.","I can confirm that the bidding package does contain tougher fiscal terms. So I think you can build that into your expectations. But exactly what the degree will be, I'm not at liberty to say at this point.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I certainly did not mean to put you in an awkward spot, but thanks for trying to answer it. My follow-up is hopefully a bit more constructive and it's on the Permian.","So you're saying \u2013 in your prepared remarks you said you're running about a year ahead of schedule. So with the change in design and obviously the improvement we expect next year, at least in Permian spreads, differentials and so on, would you expect to basically maintain the same plateau target? Or given that you're running so far ahead, would you expect to see further upside risks to your production outlook?","In other words, will you do more with less? Or maintain the same \u2013 or continue the same growth trajectory and take what it gives you with the same level of activity if you know what I mean?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yes, I mean, I think we're really constructive on the Permian. And just some things to keep in mind, right. We've been ramping up to the 20 rig rate. We're now going to have 20 rigs for the full calendar year, once you go into 2019. So that will be a positive.","We're seeing continued benefits coming from our new basis of design and continuing improvements in efficiencies as we move along. So we think that there's upside potential here as we continue to fine-tune our well placement; fine-tune really the entire I guess I would say value chain associated with the Permian. So, I think we're constructive on the Permian. And we'll certainly give you an update at our March in 2019 SAM, which we've done for several years now running. But I think it's a positive outlook that we feel for that asset.","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my questions, Pat. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Pierre \u2013 hi, Pat. Pierre, since you're especially on the line, I thought we'd go back to your IMO comments. There's been some recent press that the potential is for the market impact to be too severe for perhaps the administration to handle. I would imagine that would have to be on the gasoline price. Can you talk a little bit more \u2013 U.S. gasoline price for that matter, can you talk a little bit more about how you think the effect of IMO will play out? And to be specific, do you think there will be a major impact on U.S. gasoline prices as opposed to distillate?","And one other thing I would ask is that, as regards fuel oil where do you expect the unused residual to end up and how will that clear the market given the transport difficulties there? Thanks.","Pierre R. Breber - Chevron Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Paul. Well, let's see. There are a lot of unknowns and uncertainties around how IMO is going to roll through the system. I think part of the challenge is that IMO is not in a vacuum, right. You can't hold everything else constant and think of IMO because it will be happening in 2020 when there will be other supply and demand factors happening. What's the economy doing at that point in time? What are sour crudes global production happening?","So there are a lot of moving parts that are going on. But what you can step back and say and one of my comments sort of alluded to, if you look at the forward markets right now is you would see mid-distillates, diesel, gen diesel, crack spreads increasing post-2020. And you'll see HSFO or high-sulfur fuel oil and sour crudes discounts widening. And that makes sense, right?","As you point out, there is a lot of fuel that goes to the bunker market. The expectation is that there's not enough scrubbers that have been put in place to consume all the high-sulfur fuel oil. So they are going to look to alternatives and those alternatives will be marine gas oil that will look like distillate. And\/or it could be a low-sulfur fuel oil and there's a lot that's going on in that space.","So in terms of MO gas, it's a difficult thing to predict, because there's so many factors. I think one thing I would say is that the underlying \u2013 we've seen crude move plus or minus $10 in a few weeks the last couple months. Those movements are much bigger movements on gasoline pricing or any product pricing. We're really talking just about differentials.","And MO gas can really \u2013 you can see it going either way. It could get pulled up if some of the intermediates that are used for MO gas go to make distillates. You could also make arguments that it could weaken a little bit if runs are higher and there's excess MO gas.","So it's really something that I can't predict. What we're focused on is being prepared for it, minimizing high-sulfur fuel oil production in our refineries by making small-scale modifications. We are seeing scrubber uptake increase for ship owners. We are looking to sell what we do produce to them. We're looking at alternative markets that are non-marine, like power generation, asphalt, folks, who have excess upgrading capability. And we're confident that we're prepared for IMO.","We're also working on testing low-sulfur fuel oils, so different marine fuels, lubricants and additives and we're a leader in marine lubricants and additives. They are going to be a big part of the solution, so we're testing and developing new products for that. So there's a lot of work underway. We got a little more than a year to go and we'll be ready for it.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Pierre, I feel like I'm not the first guy to have asked that question. Can you just give us any sense for the power generation market and your expectation of scrubbing penetration? Thanks.","Pierre R. Breber - Chevron Corp.","Well, again on scrubbing penetration, our view if you step back, the most economic way to comply with the IMO regulations is for ship owners to put in scrubbers, right. That's a much more cost-effective mechanism than investing capital. And we're not \u2013 or for refineries to invest capital. We're not looking to make any investments that \u2013 large-scale investments that are IMO-related. It's because we view it as transient. One thing about our markets is they work. And when arbs open up, they get closed. There's lots of players. There's lots of capital. And there are lots of people who are working to reduce arbs. So our view is that \u2013 sorry, I lost the track on that a bit.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Power.","Pierre R. Breber - Chevron Corp.","Oh, on power generation, I'm sorry. Yes, on power generation there's a pretty good-sized market in the Middle East and other places. Again, it's not the \u2013 it's a lower-value market clearly. But our view is it's likely to require some power generation market to go through the transition. But again, over time, we expect scrubber uptake to increase and that will be the primary mechanism of complying with IMO.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Pierre, thanks. I'll let someone else have a go. Thank you.","Pierre R. Breber - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys, good morning.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Pierre, since you are here, so two questions for you; one really short. Your refining system, can you tell us what percentage you run as heavy oil, those we define as over \u2013 below 25 API? And how much is the medium sour you run, those we define between 25 to 30, 31 API?","And the second question is that given your position that when you're looking to support your upstream, will you be involved or that think you need to be involved in terms of helping to ensure we have sufficient Gulf Coast oil export capacity because you may have some concern by late 2019 or early 2020 where you may have a gap. Or that you think that it's so transitionary that it's not really a concern and you guys don't need to be as an equity owner in those?","And also then if you can comment on Duvernay, that it seems like we also have infrastructure issue. And that will \u2013 given your position and you're doing some pilot project and all that, is that something that you guys will involve? Or need to be involved I guess the question is.","Pierre R. Breber - Chevron Corp.","Okay. Let me see. Let me take the first one at least. We do not disclose specific sour content or API gravity. What we do disclose in our Annual Report Supplement is the region or country of origin of the crudes. And I think folks can figure it out from there. Again, I showed a chart that showed that we're the \u2013 have the highest Nelson Complexity, the highest amount of upgrading capacity. I mean, we are designed to run lower-value feedstocks and we've invested to make that happen but we don't disclose specifics on that.","On your second question, on how we think about the upstream in the Permian, I guess, I would say the downstream is \u2013 has to stand on its own. Any investment we do has to stand on its own. We're competing as a segment. We're \u2013 I showed charts that showed how we are in earnings per barrel versus our major competitors. And so we have to look at that way. Now we're part of an enterprise; and if we can have synergies with the upstream, of course, that's an added benefit. But investments in the downstream can't ride on the back of, in particular, very attractive economics in the Permian. Again, we have to have investments that stand on their own merit that compete against our competitors. Any extra benefit from synergies is upside on that.","On the third question, I think it was around takeaway and I'll leave that with Pat.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I was just going to add, I think you had a question about export capacity. And I think our corporate view would be yes, there may be a little bit of a need to build out export capacity over the next two or three years. But kind of going back to the belief that markets see this opportunity and that that capacity will be in fact built out, we don't see it as a risk to flow assurance.","We have ourselves dedicated export capacity of about 25,000 barrels a day now. We see that expanding in the early part of next year to about 80,000 barrels a day. So far we've exported about 8 million barrels, I believe is the number. So we feel that we're investing appropriately for our flow. But we don't think in general over time that there will be a risk to flow assurance in the Permian because of export capacity.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Pat, is that the same apply to in the Duvernay area in Canada, that you don't believe that you need to involve on the build-out of the infrastructure there?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","In Canada?","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Your question is in reference to the oil sands, Paul?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","No, to the Duvernay?","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Oh, Duvernay.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Duvernay? Yeah, I guess I don't have any particular insights associated with Duvernay.","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Yeah, I think I would just chime in. Pat, I think we have previously disclosed that we...","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","(00:49:07).","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","...a while ago we committed to the Pembina infrastructure agreement that is well-paired to enable our production out of the Duvernay. And you'd expect that as we continue to progress that development there that we would be able to step into additional capacity agreements to enable that flow.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons & Company. Your question please.","Blake Fernandez - Simmons Energy","Hi, folks. Good morning. Pat, a question for you on CapEx, it looks like you're trending about 5% above. Could you talk a little bit about what the drivers are there, whether it's activity or inflationary based? And should we be thinking about that kind of giving upward momentum into the next couple of years as well? So maybe like toward the upper end of your range?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Right. So, good question, Blake. Yeah, we're about $600 million on a year-to-date basis. We're about $600 million above plan if plan were ratable there. And about $150 million of this or so relates to inorganic, lease acquisitions, bonus lease payments that we have made. And as I said in my prepared remarks we expect that number to go to about $600 million by the time we get to the full year.","But back to the nine months, that means we're about $450 million over on an organic basis, and there's really several reasons for this. It's not concentrated in any one particular area. The first thing I would call out is, just the fact that oil prices have been noticeably higher in 2018 than the planning premise that we use when we put the budget together. So there has been some cost savings. There were cost savings that we had built into our plan that we thought we would be able to capture from a capital standpoint. And we really haven't been able to capture those. Because the cost trends stopped going down; and in fact they leveled out, and in fact have turned the other direction along with oil price.","So there's a piece of the overrun that relates to that. There is a piece that relates to major capital projects. Jay mentioned TCO on the last call, but there's other projects as well that I could throw in there with small overruns. And then, there's also more that's being spent in the Permian and again, we've talked about the drilling efficiencies, a new basis of design, the fact that we're able to prosecute the development plan against more acreage than we had originally envisioned.","And with the high density fracs, they cost more, but in fact, the economic outcomes are really outstanding. And so the dollar per barrel per EUR is much better. So that's money \u2013 that's good money being spent. So those are the reasons that I would outline for the overrun that we have so far.","In terms of pressures, inflationary pressures, I will say, we are continuing to see inflationary pressures, for example, in the Permian. And we do expect increases there, maybe in the order of 5% to 10% in the 2019 period.","In general, because oil prices have been sustained higher, I think that the cost structure in the industry has moved up some. So I would say, yes, we are facing that and that would be something that would be reasonable to build into your expectations.","Blake Fernandez - Simmons Energy","That is helpful. Thank you very much. The second question, I hope you didn't necessarily kind of cover this in exact detail on Paul's question, but mine was on the Permian takeaway.","I think in last quarter's call you had kind of highlighted excess capacity through June and then ample takeaway for non-operated production through 2019. I'm just curious with the massive ramp-up that we're seeing here, are you still pretty well taken care of from a takeaway capacity through that same timeframe and say throughout next year?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yes, we are. Absolutely. I mean the whole process that we have, whether it be for crude or NGL transportation or fractionation, the whole setup that we've got is trying to stay ahead of what we expect the Permian growth to be.","And so we do this through securing from \u2013 in increment, contractual offtake. So we feel very nicely covered for our position out of the Midland on those elements for the next couple of years. And of course, the team that we have working this will be working for the three year period and the four year period. I mean, it's a perpetual step-up that we are trying to orchestrate here.","Blake Fernandez - Simmons Energy","That's great. Thank you.","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Pat, can I just ask what makes Tigris different to Ballymore, Whale, and Anchor?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","I think it really comes down to the \u2013 it fundamentally comes down to the economics that we anticipate out of those individual developments. So you're influenced by the size of the resource, the demands as to whether that needs to be an independent topsides or whether it's got tieback opportunity, the complexity of the reservoir. I mean, there's a whole number of factors that go into account. And Tigris had its own complexity, because it was a three-field aggregated development.","So you shouldn't read in to the fact that we decided to exit the Tigris leases, you shouldn't read in anything there about our dedication to the deepwater. We are still dedicated to the deepwater. We think we have expertise in the deepwater. We picked up a significant number of leases in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater as well as offshore Mexico and Brazil as well. So we're still invested in the deepwater.","And we're just looking for the highest return projects. It's all about making choices and going after what we believe will be the best opportunity to secure high returns in our portfolio.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Can I \u2013 as a follow-up, can I just return to the discussion around PSCs and just clarify for the sake of the guidance that you put in the SAM around cash returns out to 2020. What sort of assumptions are made around contract renewal?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Right. I mean, on the two important ones that I talked about for both Rokan and Erawan, both of the assumptions in the materials that we provided back in March were that those concessions were extended.","In terms of the concession extension dates though, I think that's important. Both of those are 2021, 2022. So for the next several years we still have those available to us.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thanks for the clarification.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay. And I'd just say, and we can still, because we've seen such strong growth in the unconventional, even without those concession extensions, our \u2013 we can still see growth in our base plus shale and tight.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I guess could we follow up a little bit your comments on the cost inflation on the CapEx side, specifically any update on TCO relative to where we were? And then, how these cost inflation issues or CapEx overruns affect the overall spending budget or run the risk of? And then as you're starting to think about where projects are going to bid out for 2019, is that already being incorporated in expectations?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yeah, Roger, thanks for the question. First, let me let me just reiterate, staying within the $18 billion to $20 billion range is our focus here. And that comes with any sort of adjustment that needs to be made, whether it's on the major capital project side or it's on the inflationary side. We're making choices. And our choice is to stay within that $18 billion to $20 billion range. And we think it's very doable, because we've got lined out activity over the next couple of years.","To TCO in particular, let me just make a few comments about that, because I did happen to visit the plant about 10 days or so ago with both Wayne and Jay Johnson. And so I do have a firsthand view of what's going on there.","And just making a couple of personal observations here, got to start with the fact though, that we're only 2.5 years in and we still got 3.5 years to go. First oil is still scheduled for 2022. So we're only about 50% of the way through on all this.","And I would say from my observation, a number of things are going quite well in the project. It's a big complex project. It's been broken down into individual, five individual work streams and those individual work streams have gotten lined out, kind of what I'll call productivity packages, work packages, where daily\/weekly\/monthly they've got identified activity that's being done and they're tracking their progress daily. And so we are seeing site productivity improve tremendously.","I think Jay mentioned on the second quarter call, that 2019 \u2013 the rest of 2018 and 2019 are the really critical execution years. We're moving away from being out of the civils and undergrounds into the MEI phase. And so, 2019 will be an absolutely critical year from an execution standpoint.","So I'm really \u2013 I was really impressed with the productivity gains that we're seeing. And of course, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. I don't want to get too far out over my skis or overstate anything here, but things are working well. The logistics are working well, the modules are being delivered. It's being lined out and proceeding quite nicely.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's fair. I think given the performance of the quarter we won't try to put you on the rack or stretch you right here.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","(00:59:31). I appreciate that.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","The follow-up question, as we think about the outperformance in the Permian this quarter, and I mean, it's been building for a while, just really spiked up here. Between the operated and the non-operated and thinking about your comments on the high density fracs and so forth, is \u2013 should we think about the outperformance being overwhelmingly within Chevron operated rigs, or spread out? In other words, you're \u2013 what you're learning in your own wells is being applied even to the non-op. I'm just \u2013 as we think about a change in rig percentages operated versus non-operated, whether or not that would affect growth going forward?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yeah. So I would say in the quarter, the contribution in terms of absolute production between operated and non-operated was about the same. We had been building up activity, rig activity, as well as the non-ops had too. But of course, the non-ops had kind of rig activity that had started \u2013 production activity that started several years previously. So I feel, as though the contributions in the quarter are relatively comparable between non-op and co-op. Both areas are seeing improvement.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Wayne Borduin - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Roger.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.","Sam Margolin - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning. I'm sorry, it's late stage in the call. I sort of have a thematic question, but I'll try to keep it concise. You made a reference to fiscal terms kind of tightening or escalating in Thailand. That might be happening in other places too and at the same time, even with cost inflation in the Permian accounted for, sort of effectively the opposite is happening, where you're getting more efficient and economics are improving.","So I guess, my question is just broadly, how do you manage that? In the past you've kind of set a level of where you think unconventional production could be within your portfolio, but if the economics on a relative basis are getting so much better than they are everywhere else, what's the process of kind of managing your mix here to make sure that you're optimized when things on the screen seem to incent you to go wildly in one direction?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yeah, yeah. Sam, I would just say, we have a fundamental belief in the value of diversification and having a diversified portfolio. And we have several legacy assets whether you think of Australia or unconventional in the Permian, TCO, deepwater. We have several significant asset classes that we want to continue to pursue.","And you're right, in some locations around the world, you see a tightening of fiscal terms, but in other locations around the world you see the fact that the host governments are realizing that in order to incent foreign investment they need to revise the fiscal terms in a more kind of favorable to the investor, like a Chevron would be situation.","So it ebbs and flows and we're in the business for the long term. And so we just \u2013 we continue to assess our portfolio and try to make the best decisions we can make not only for a short term, but also for long term; production growth, reserve replacement, cash flow growth, dividend growth, et cetera. So it's a \u2013 we look at it as a portfolio.","Sam Margolin - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thanks so much for all the color on a long call.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay, thank you.","Pierre R. Breber - Chevron Corp.","Thank you.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay, I guess that was our last call. So I want to thank everybody for your time today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron and we appreciate everyone's participation on the call. Have a good day. Jonathan, back to you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."],"4923":["Chevron Corp.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","All right. Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President-Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide two.","Slide three provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter earnings were $571 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments of $1.96 billion and other charges of approximately $670 million relating to project suspensions and adverse tax effects, all of which were non-cash charges stemming from a downward revision in the company's longer-term crude oil price outlook. Excluding these special items, as well as asset-sale gains and foreign-exchange effects, earnings were $1.8 billion, or $0.97 per diluted share, approximately $400 million higher than first quarter on that same basis. A detailed reconciliation of the special items is included in the appendix to this presentation.","Cash from operations was $7.2 billion, an improvement of $4.9 billion from the prior quarter. Our debt ratio at quarter end was 17%. During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to shareholders of record as of August 19. We're currently yielding 4.6%.","Turning to slide four, cash generated from operations was $7.2 billion during the second quarter and $9.5 billion year-to-date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than in the first quarter, the result of higher crude prices. We also benefited from strong cash generation from our downstream and chemicals business. Temporary working capital effects reduced year-to-date cash flow by approximately $2 billion. We expect this impact to reverse in future quarters. Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled approximately $3.9 billion, the vast majority of which related to our sale in the interest in Caltex, Australia.","We are well ahead of pace on our four-year asset divestment program. In the past 18 months, we have recognized asset sale proceeds of nearly $11 billion, compared to our stated $15 billion goal over the 2014 to 2017 time period. Cash capital expenditures were $7.6 million for the quarter, essentially flat with the first quarter. Year-to-date cash capital expenditures were $15.2 billion, down $2.2 billion or 13% compared with the same period in 2014. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $12.2 billion and our net debt position was $19.4 billion.","Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2015 earnings were $5.1 billion lower than second quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased to $7.5 billion between quarters. The impairments and other charges I noted previously accounted for $2.6 billion of this decline. Significantly lower crude realizations and the absence of second quarter 2014 asset sale gains make up the remaining variance between periods. Downstream results increased by $2.2 billion, primarily driven by higher worldwide margins and gains from asset sales, principally the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia.","Operationally, the second quarter continued a positive quarterly pattern of high reliability, strong margins and good cost management. The variance in the other segment was primarily favorable corporate tax items.","Turning now to slide six, I'll compare results for the second quarter 2015 with the first quarter of 2015. Second quarter earnings were $2 billion lower than first quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased by $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting the charges I previously discussed. Unfavorable foreign exchange effects and the absence of first quarter asset sale gains and the positive UK tax adjustment were also large variances between periods. Downstream earnings increased $1.5 billion as gains on asset sales were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange swing between the quarters. Operationally, the quarters were fairly comparable. The variance in the other segment was primarily favorable corporate tax items, partially offset by higher corporate charges, including severance accruals.","Frank will now take us through the comparisons by segment.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide seven, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $578 million lower than the first quarter's results. Asset impairments and project suspensions across multiple assets, primarily as Pat indicated, from a reduced price outlook, decreased earnings by $630 million. Higher realizations, consistent with an increase in domestic crude prices, increased earnings by $190 million. Exploration expenses, mainly associated with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, decreased earnings by $70 million. The other bar reflects higher production, which was more than offset by higher DD&A rates.","Turning to slide eight, international upstream earnings were $3.2 billion lower than last quarter's results. Asset impairments, primarily at Papa Terra in Brazil, project suspensions and adverse tax effects from price changes previously discussed reduced earnings by about $1.9 billion. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings between periods by approximately $670 million. The absence of last quarter's gains on asset sales and the deferred tax benefit from the UK tax change decreased earnings by $660 million. Increased exploration expenses resulted in lower earnings of $170 million. Higher realizations increased earnings by $395 million, consistent with the increase in Brent prices between the quarters. The other bar primarily consists of an unfavorable ruling on a decade-old tax issue and severance accruals booked in the second quarter.","Slide nine summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 85,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital project ramp ups, primarily at Jack\/St. Malo in the Gulf of Mexico and from the expansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh increased production by 22,000 barrels per day. Growth from our shale and tight assets, primarily in the Permian, contributed 11,000 barrels per day.","As we foreshadowed in our first quarter earnings call, production in the Partitioned Zone was shut down at the end of May based on the inability to secure work and equipment permits. The shutdown decreased production in the second quarter by 38,000 barrels per day. We're still not producing in the Partitioned Zone, and we have no updated guidance as to when production is likely to restart. Planned and unplanned downtime reduced production by 34,000 barrels per day between periods, primarily in Canada and in Australia. Price and cost recovery effects decreased production by 23,000 barrels per day between quarters as high crude prices and reduced spending decreased volumes associated with production share and variable royalty contracts.","The remaining variance in the base business and other bar primarily reflects natural field declines and weather-related production limitations at Tengiz.","Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2014. Net production increased by 51,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 71,000 barrels per day due to production ramp-ups, primarily in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bangladesh. Shale and tight production increased by 46,000 barrels per day due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, the Marcellus and the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina. Price and cost recovery effects increased production by 61,000 barrels per day due to the roughly 45% drop in crude prices between periods.","The shutting of operations in the Partitioned Zone decreased production by 45,000 barrels per day. Asset sales resulted in lost production of 33,000 barrels per day, principally driven by the divestment of our assets in Chad and the Netherlands. The decrease of 49,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines and the impact of higher external constraints, partially offset by a favorable variance from less planned turnaround activity. Our base business continues to perform well with a managed decline rate within our existing guidance range.","Year-to-date net oil equivalent production was 2.638 million barrels per day and within our 0% to 3% guidance for 2015 growth. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, the third quarter is expected to be a comparatively heavy turnaround period, and we believe the full year production guidance remains appropriate.","Turning to slide 11, U.S. downstream results increased $25 million between quarters. Tight product supply, primarily on the West Coast, boosted refining and marketing margins and increased earnings by $165 million between quarters. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $185 million, reflecting planned maintenance and turnaround activities at the El Segundo Refinery and commitments related to the Richmond Refinery modernization project. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects stronger results in our chemicals business.","Turning to slide 12, international downstream earnings improved by $1.5 billion between quarters. Gains on asset sales, primarily related to the sale of the company's interest in Caltex Australia, increased earnings by $1.7 billion. Lower refining and marketing margins decreased earnings by $120 million between quarters as product price increases, including the negative price lag effects on naphtha and jet fuel failed to keep pace with rising crude costs. An unfavorable swing in the foreign currency effects lowered earnings by approximately $155 million. The variance in the other bar reflects multiple unrelated items.","Jay will now provide an update on our upstream operations. Jay?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Thanks, Frank. Turning to slide 13, I'm going to discuss our Upstream business, where we continue to make good progress in delivering the projects that are driving our growth in volume, in value and in cash. Gorgon is a critical part of that growth, and we continue to work towards the first LNG cargo. As you can see from the photo, plant construction has advanced. We're nearing mechanical completion of the first train with over 60% of critical subsystems handed over to commissioning. We've posted new pictures today and I encourage you to look at them on our investor website and chevron.com.","Turning to slide 14, the upstream work scope for initial production from the Jansz field is largely complete with the control systems now active. We've established communications from the central control room on Barrow Island to the subsea wells, which enables us to conduct commissioning activity on the upstream and pipeline systems. Final testing is underway for the subsea infrastructure and controls. At the plant, all LNG and condensate tanks required for first LNG are ready and commissioning of completed process systems is underway. Currently the critical path is through the refrigerant compressors and the hydrate prevention system for the subsea wells.","We expect to perform the first commissioning run of the compressors and testing of the hydrate prevention system in late September. Once we're satisfied with the operation of these systems we'll be ready to introduce gas from the Jansz wells into the upstream pipeline and begin the startup of Train 1, which we currently expect late this year. The schedule is dependent on managing commissioning and startup risks, including equipment malfunctions, possible labor and weather disruptions, as well as other unforeseen issues. Our focus is on a safe and incident-free startup that leads to reliable long-term operations. We're working to achieve the first LNG cargo by year-end. However, given these risks, it's likely to occur in early 2016.","Now let's talk about Wheatstone, moving to slide 15. Wheatstone is now over 65% complete. On the upstream side of the project, we successfully completed the float-over and installation of the offshore platform in April. Hook up and commissioning is on plan with all subsea structures now installed. The flow line installation is underway and the development drilling program ongoing. All nine wells were previously drilled to the top of the reservoir and we're now drilling the reservoir sections of each well and running the completions. At the plant site, 11 of 24 major process modules for Train 1 have been delivered. All refrigeration compressors and gas turbine generators have been installed and the domestic gas pipeline has been completed. The focus of activity at the plant has shifted from civil works to mechanical, electrical and instrumentation systems.","The work on site is going very well. Our biggest challenge has been the delays in module delivery from a fabrication yard, which is putting pressure on the schedule. To address the delays, we've expanded to an additional yard and provided increased oversight in the yards. We've seen positive results from these actions and are not anticipating any further delays in the module delivery schedule. Additionally, we've increased bed capacity at the plant site and are updating our work plans to mitigate the impact to schedule. Our objective remains first LNG by year-end 2016, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress over the next 18 months.","Turning to slide 16. Performance at the Jack\/St. Malo lower tertiary development continues to exceed our plan. The sixth well was brought online ahead of schedule and total production has ramped up to around 80,000 barrels per day. The development drilling program continues and we're seeing some get improvements in cycle time, costs, and stimulation effectiveness with the most recent completion 20% better on cost and schedule than previous wells. Work to install the Big Foot Tension Leg Platform was suspended in early June when nine of the 16 tendons lost buoyancy. There were no environmental impacts or injuries, and we are investigating the root cause of the incident. We have secured the site, including successful recovery of the seven remaining tendons. The tension leg platform was undamaged and is being moved to a safe harbor location.","Site surveys and equipment inspections are in progress to determine whether the installed piles and recovered tendons can be reused and what equipment will require replacement in order to complete the project. At this point, we are not expecting any Big Foot production in 2016 or 2017, which is a reduction from our original plan of 10,000 net barrels per day in 2016 and 22,000 net barrels per day in 2017. As we complete the investigation and update our plan, we will advise you accordingly.","Appraisal drilling is ongoing at the Anchor discovery and in the Northwest Keathley Canyon area, now named Tigris. Tigris has the potential to offer a multi-field, hub development of the Guadalupe, Gila and Tiber discoveries with the potential addition of the Gibson exploration prospect, which we plan to drill around the end of this year. Appraisal drilling is underway at Guadalupe and recent results from deepening the Gila discovery well are encouraging with further appraisal planned. We continue to progress our opportunity cue in the deepwater and in the second quarter made another lower tertiary discovery at the Sicily prospect in Keathley Canyon Block 814. We're encouraged by the results of the discovery well and follow-up appraisal work is planned.","Turning to slide 17. As we communicated in March, our Permian position is strong. We have a large, high-quality acreage position with advantage royalty, which we are cost-effectively developing. We remain on track to drill 325 wells this year and have expanded to multiple factory mode, horizontal well development programs across the Midland and Delaware basins.","We remain committed to our pace development approach, but the short cycle nature of these investments allows us to adjust this pace relatively quickly. In the current market, we've been active in negotiating cost reductions with our suppliers, achieving rate reductions of 20% to 50% across our major drilling and completion spend categories. At the same time, we continue to improve our drilling and completion efficiency. Since last year, we achieved roughly a 15% increase in drilling footage and a 20% increase in frac stages per day. The initial production rates for these wells are also very encouraging with our Bradford Ranch laterals averaging 1,100 barrels a day and comprising around 90% liquids. In addition, current estimated well recoveries have increased by 30%.","So in summary, cost reductions, improved efficiency, and increased recoveries have improved our development cost per barrel by around 35% relative to 2014 and make more than 3,000 well prospects economic at $50 per barrel WTI.","Let's move to slide 18. The major capital projects driving our growth are nearing completion, and are underpinned by our strong base business. The volumes associated with this growth are accretive to our cash margins and will contribute to long-term cash flow. We've reduced our current year capital spending by $5 billion relative to 2014. In the current environment, we are planning to reduce our 2016 and 2017 capital programs and our flexibility in capital spending significantly increases as our projects already in execution are completed.","We are pacing projects not yet in execution to ensure we capture the cost advantages presented by the current environment and are prioritizing them to manage our capital program. We continue to drive cost reduction and efficiency to strengthen our cash flow by systematically reviewing our organizational structures and activity levels in our business units and by working with our suppliers.","Pat will now conclude by sharing the enterprise impacts of these efforts.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","All right. Turning to slide 19, I'd like to now provide an update on the self-help efforts that we have underway to lower our costs and improve our efficiency. To-date, we've identified more than $3 billion of spend reductions with about half coming through organizational reviews and half working through the supply chain. On the organizational side, efficiency reviews have recently concluded that covered our corporate gas and midstream and service company group. Similar reviews are occurring on a rolling basis within our upstream business units. Work activities in these identified groups have been prioritized, streamlined, and right-sized to the current environment.","Savings totaled approximately $1.4 billion on a full run rate basis and represent both dollar and workforce reductions off the relevant base of about 20%. These benefits to our cost structure should become increasingly evident as we move through the next several quarters. In future periods, we expect to see additional savings identified as our remaining upstream units complete their reviews. We're also aggressively pursuing savings through the supply chain, particularly in the U.S., where our supplier responsiveness has been high. We have negotiated an excess of $1 billion in immediate savings, achieving product category reductions of typically 15% to 30%.","We are also changing the way we work through greater standardization, project re-scoping, refinement of fit-for-purpose designs, and timing optimizations. In combination, we estimate negotiated savings and work changes will lower our future supply chain spend $1.6 billion. These savings will appear in multiple ways as we move through 2015 into 2016. Impacts will come in the form of lower operating expenses, lower capital and lower cost of goods sold. And we're not done. We expect more supply chain savings to be identified in future months, particularly as activity continues to flow and as additional spare capacity emerges. We are being aggressive in pursuing these self-help measures in response to a very challenging industry environment.","Moving to slide 20, I'd like to close with a few thoughts. We made a commitment to our investors in March. We said we would cover the dividend from free cash flow in 2017. We stand by that commitment. We are taking the steps necessary to ensure we are a resilient competitor regardless of the ensuing price environment. Our focus areas are shown on the slide, get our capital projects currently under construction online, rebase and reprioritize our capital outflows, maintain reliability and drive our cost structure lower, and conclude our planned divestment program. If a lower price environment persists for longer, you'll see even more significant cost savings and even greater cuts in capital. As we showed you in March, we have tremendous flexibility in our 2017 C&E spend. We are confident that we can and are committed to scaling our C&E outflows in a manner that will allow us to continue our 27-year record of annual dividend payment increases.","So that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in. We're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up if necessary. And we'll do our best to get all of your questions answered.","Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. And once again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please?","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes. Thanks very much. First of all, if I could just ask on Gorgon. Jay, you mentioned the key risks still to getting to the first commercial cargo included labor risks, and there has been a lot of media attention to the \u2013 one of the unions that is employed by one of your primary contractors. Do you have any update on any industrial actions that could prevent getting that first commercial cargo in early 2016?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Thanks for the question. At this point, the work with the contractors and the unions to agree a new contract is ongoing. The discussions continue. There was a fourth vote that was unsuccessful recently, and so the unions have requested and received permission to seek a strike vote, but there is warning time that has to occur before that happens. At this point in time, any action that would occur would be relatively short in duration, 24 hours or less, and we would have ample warning time before that would occur.","But I think it's important to recognize that a strike at this point is really not going to be in anyone's benefit and so the negotiations continue between our contractors and the unions, and I'm optimistic that they will be able to find a solution and a way forward. I think the issues have largely been addressed. The primary one appears to be just around work schedules, and so that's an area that's receiving quite a bit of focus as we move forward.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. Appreciate that. If I could, just as a follow up, ask a question about the charges that were recorded in the quarter for project suspension. Would you be able to give us any examples of projects that are being deferred and the level of CapEx savings that's being associated with these deferrals?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","We really aren't going to go into any specific projects that have been deferred, but as we look at our pre-FID capital, the projects that have not moved to sanction, we're really looking to do either deferments as we slow them down to take advantage of the current market environment, build lower cost structure into this projects. We're also looking to pace those projects as we build our capital programs looking ahead to 2016 and 2017. But some projects that we feel are not going to be competitive rather than keep them moving we've just elected to go ahead and suspend those and those costs reflect some of those projects that we've suspended.","Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. Thanks for your thoughts, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please?","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Good morning.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question, I appreciate the additional color on the operating cost reduction potential and if we think about the capital cost side, looking at your Analyst Day deck, you had a grey bar with respect to capital costs of about $20 billion in 2016, so I guess I'm just wondering like how much reduction potential is there from a deflation standpoint, a deferral standpoint, and really if you kind of wrap it all together with the operating costs, your guidance at the Analyst Day suggested that you could cover your dividend at $70. So how low do you think that could go given where we are in this current oil price environment?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","So I think there's two elements there. Let me just start with the last component here. Really, we did say we would cover our dividend from free cash flow at the $70 price. What I was trying to indicate in my earlier words is we intend to cover the dividend from free cash flow at whatever the ensuing price is. That is a firm commitment on the part of the company, and we have tremendous flexibility, really, in our 2017 C&E to flex that down. We are being very successful in driving our operating costs lower and working through the supply chain to accomplish not only operating expense but capital reductions as well. And that really is an affordability component for us. It's a cash flow management element for us, and after we get these projects that are currently under construction online, that flexibility in C&E becomes quite significant in 2017. So I'll let Jay talk to his prioritization process in terms of looking at the capital program in 2017.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","So as we're building \u2013 we're in the process of building our plan right now for 2016, 2017, and 2018. And as we go through, as we've said before, our primary focus first and foremost is on putting the investment back into our base business around asset integrity and maintaining good, reliable operations. And then we also fund the major capital projects that are in execution and as you have seen in our slides, that will decrease significantly as these projects come online. Just for example, in our LNG projects, this year we expect to spend around $8 billion in LNG, C&E, but by 2017, that's down to $1 billion. So we'll see tremendous flexibility coming in just from that.","At the same time, we're looking at our base business, and as I mentioned, we are bringing our costs down, our efficiencies up, so we're seeing very good performance out of our base business and able to compete even in this environment. So we're evaluating how much money to put back into the base to maintain and continue to grow, particularly the short cycle, high value returns. And then finally, we're looking at the projects that are pre-FID, and as I said, we want to build in the lower cost structures, and we want to be able to preserve the option so that as prices recover, we can decide at what pace and how to ratably bring these projects back into the program. Moving engineering forward so that we have better definition, better understanding of these projects is a very low-cost way to build more confidence into our program for the future.","And the last area is our exploration. We've been very successful in the last several years, so we've built up a bit of an inventory on the resource side, and so we can pull back on exploration over the next couple of years as we consolidate and wait for prices to recover. So I would see a dramatic and significant reduction in capital as we move forward. We're building that into our plans but the exact amount is yet to be determined.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question in just in light of the commentary about Big Foot, some of the risks around Gorgon and Wheatstone, maybe you could just discuss your degree of confidence with the 3.1 million barrels a day production target for 2017 at this point, and to what degree you might be able to quantify what you see as the downside risk, because I know there was some cushion in that at one point, but maybe just kind of update us with your latest thoughts on that? Thanks.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","We still feel very confident about the growth we're going to deliver, and that's primarily because the growth is captured and driven by these major capital projects that are currently in execution. And as I said, we'll continue to fund those and bring those to completion. So that growth is there, it's real, and it's based on our underlying base business performance, which has been very strong, and we've done a good job of being able to maintain our underlying decline rates. But we're in a different world, and so we're seeing costs change, obviously as the cost \u2013 or prices structures have come down, costs are moving, and so just as we did with North American gas, there's still opportunity to make adjustments in how we continue to invest in some of the shorter cycle opportunities. So I see us as having a very strong base. The growth, we're very confident with that. The level of the divestment, the level of base business, those can be some factors that go into it, but on balance, we are very strong on the growth prospect and the growth story that we presented to you.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question, please?","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes. Good morning. So maybe a small question to begin with. Just obviously Big Foot delay and then you're talking about extra fab space for Wheatstone and extra beds, I presume that the CapEx impact that you might be able to speak to or not and then obviously would you be able to offset that with the cost reduction efforts that the industry is going through?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Thanks. That's a good question. With Wheatstone, when you put extra beds in, there are some costs associated with that. At the same time, because the modules were delayed, we didn't build up the manpower initially as we had originally planned, so there were some savings early on. But in general, we're facing cost pressure on the projects just as we are around the world. At the same time, we're seeing very favorable exchange rates in Australia that are a countervailing force to that. So we're still working under the cost forecast that we've already provided to you. We'll continue to monitor that and see how we progress through the next 18 months, and we'll update you if we feel costs have changed significantly.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Right. And then this is a broader question. There was a period where Chevron had very good project execution, and then there have been, obviously, some well publicized setbacks more recently. If there was one change or one message that you were trying to get to investors and to the organization about how to hold on to better project execution, what would that message be, and is there any anecdotes or data to illustrate that that is changing?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","That's also a good question. I think what we have seen, some degradation in terms of performance, and it's driven by a couple of things. One, the projects have been very large and complex. In and of itself, that's not just something that should be difficult to manage, but because of the number of projects being simultaneously managed I think both the industry's resources were stretched thin as well as our own resources to manage these projects was stretched thin. As we now consolidate and finish this big wave of projects that drives the growth that we have, roughly 20% from 2014 to 2017, we won't see that kind of sustained effort to maintain that growth going forward. It'll be at a much more moderate pace. So I think we'll have the more ratable queue of projects back into the range that's more straightforward to manage.","At the same time, we're also working to lower the cost structures and increase the predictability of these projects by advancing engineering before we move them to FID. So as I mentioned on many of our pre-FID projects such as FGP, we talked in March about advancing the engineering past 50%, that 40% to 50% range by the time we take FID. Just as an example, you're looking for a proof point, when we took Gorgon to FID, we had modeled 12-inch pipe and larger in our 3D CAD models at the time of FID. FGP will have 3-inch and larger pipe in our system and sketches done for everything below that. So there's a great deal more definition in the design before we're moving these projects forward. So I think the combination of having a more ratable program along with better engineering, more advanced, higher-quality engineering will pay dividends for us.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thanks, Jay.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question, please?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jay, if I could, two questions. If you're looking at a company the scope and size of Chevron on a going-forward basis \u2013 historically that you spend most of your capital in the long cycle macro development, how is that going to change, and is there \u2013 may be a sweet spot how that's going to shift between the short cycle and long cycle development effort going forward?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Yes. I think as you look at projects like the Wheatstones, the Gorgons, the FGPs and TCO, these are projects that will add very large base and very long term assets to our portfolio. As we execute our small capital projects, which are often infill drilling programs, work-over programs and de-bottlenecking, we typically see rates of return above 50%, and they're built on these assets, we've already made the investments. So I think we're really doing a good job of rejuvenating our base and putting some new life into the base that we can continue to exploit over a long period of time, but at the same time we're building our capability day by day in our ability to go after the shale and tight largely in North America and in Argentina.","So as you've seen our performance numbers continue to increase, we're coming down that learning curve and we're becoming more and more competitive, and it's going to give us a very good balance between deepwater projects, large base projects in the LNG and sour gas as well as access to the shorter cycle of shale and tight unconventional projects. So I see a very good balance and a very good diverse portfolio (39:21).","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Is there a percentage that you can share that on the going forward basis there was that capital spend between the long and the short cycle going to look like?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","At this point in time, I don't have a ratio or a percentage to share with you. Our resource base has increased about 15%. Our portfolio has increased in the unconventional side by about 15% over the last five years in particular. So we're seeing more of our resource base being the unconventionals but the unconventionals have very high, very fast decline rates, and that is always going to be something we balance against the longer-term projects with their stable production. So that's something we'll work through as we react to market conditions, our view of forward pricing and the capital that we want to invest across the portfolio.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The second question is that, Jay, going back to your early comment, not just Chevron, it looked like the whole industry the last maybe 10 years has got openly optimistic about their capability to deliver and execute. And so, it seems like everyone is stretching themselves to the limit and we start seeing all these execution issues. For Chevron, learning from the mistake of the last several years, have you changed the way \u2013 I mean you are talking a little bit about more definition. But at the top how have you changed the investment decision process on the FID? Will you be \u2013 I mean in the future \u2013 in the past the industry tends to just looking at the financial capability and whether that you can afford the project and whether it is a good project. How that is going to change in the future particularly for Chevron ?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","For Chevron, we have traditionally looked at individual products and the economic opportunity each project presents in making an investment decision. I would say now in the current environment and looking forward, there'll be two additional lenses that will be added to that decision. First and foremost, the project and the economic proposition it presents, but then we'll be looking at what is the overall level of investment we want to be making and also what is the level of human capacity we have to manage the projects? And those will certainly be factors that we will build into the process, and we are building into the process now so that we can keep that as we move forward.","We've also done a lot of work to put in what we call readiness reviews, and these are to make sure that both from a design and a design assurance standpoint before the project moves to execution but also before we start up these projects, we're going to readiness review that are much more rigorous and help us make sure we have the resources and the capabilities in place to execute these projects as expected.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Thanks.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please?","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Maybe if I could do one follow-up on the costs, on the slide you have there, on slide 19, there is the $3 billion and spend reduction targeted. I'm not sure if I miss it when you said it, but is this all, is the CapEx and OpEx, is that all in the OpEx side? Can you estimate how much you've captured to date, how far along you are at this point?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so the combination of the $3 billion is for both operating expense and capital. The $1.4 billion is predominantly going to be operating expense, and the $1.6 billion is going to be a mixture of both and probably leaning a little bit more towards the capital side of things. And from a \u2013 and these are elements that should begin to show in an accelerated basis as we move through the third and the fourth quarter. I would say captured to-date actually has been some but not a high proportion of the $3 billion total.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And is there a timing on when you hope that this \u2013 something you hope to capture over the next year or two years or...?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Oh, I think it will be more immediate than that. I mean think it will be into the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2015 with some carryover into 2016 as well. I mean, a large portion of the supplier engagement element there, a billion dollars of that are negotiated price reductions off of planned 2015 activity. So those negotiations began, as you know, back in the January, February timeframe, we're sort of concluded in the May, June timeframe and so those rate reductions we should begin to see coming forward in the next half of the year.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Very helpful. And then maybe if, I appreciate the color that you gave earlier on Big Foot and the contribution of Big Foot to the 2016 and 2017 plans. Could you maybe give the same numbers for what \u2013 in the 2017 plan, let's assume for the Partitioned Zone, and Angola LNG and maybe any updates you have on both of those projects?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Sure. And first I'll start with the PZ. The PZ, at this point in time, we have around 60,000 barrels a day to 70,000 barrels a day expected in the 2017 plan but we do not expect that field to still be shut in, in 2017. So my expectation is that we will be able to resume operations. There is an issue that's being discussed between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The impact on us is the difficulty receiving visas and equipment permits. So we were unable to continue operations and we stopped operations there as this issue is addressed. Our goal would be to return to normal operations in the short term as the \u2013 any other issues are continued to be worked out between the two governments. And so we work and we're trying to support the activities in that area accordingly.","In terms of the ALNG, progress is moving along quite well there. We are completing the work on all the piping modifications, you recall this is as a result of the acoustic-induced vibration analysis that was done, so that work should be finishing up in the month of August, and then that will allow us to start the recommissioning process at the plant. The other work, in terms of the conditioning equipment on the front end of the plant to handle the diversity of the associated gas feeding the plant will be complete as are the technical bulletins. But we would expect to see restart late the year and then sustain production in 2016 and onward. So that's really the status of those two projects.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. I'll leave it.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Ryan.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Hi, Neil.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, Pat, I just want to talk philosophically about how you're thinking about the dividend and your strategy there. Didn't raise the dividend in the third quarter, but the way we read the comments was that we'd look for you to raise it here in the fourth quarter even if it's a nominal level, and it's a priority to continue to raise the dividend going forward. I just wanted to confirm that and then get your thoughts on the broader dividend strategy.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","A good question. So our broader dividend strategy hasn't changed. Our financial priorities haven't changed. Maintaining a competitive and growing dividend is our absolutely number one objective. What has changed, though, is obviously our immediate financial environment, and so the board chose not to raise the dividend in this quarter. I think that's a prudent action at this point because we're not running as strongly, certainly, as we would like on both earnings and cash flow because of where commodity prices sit. And it's not \u2013 I would say it's probably we're not in a very stable either revenue or cost environment. We have a lot of fluidity on those two components here.","I will say the board is very committed to growing the dividend and seeing our pattern of dividend increases every year materialize, but what's important here is that it's the annual dividend payment that has moved up every year. That doesn't mean you get an increase in the per share every single year, because we typically have moved them in the second quarter. So it's an annual dividend payment history that applies to the 27-year factor. So I think the board is committed to that. We are committed to that.","So I would like to be able to say our entire objective is being able to grow the dividend when the time is appropriate. We don't want to get out over our skis. We want to do it in a manner and at a time when we can see that we can hold on to that increase, sort of in perpetuity. We don't want to put ourselves into a position where we're pushing things, where we are having to fund the dividend off the balance sheet for an extended period of time, so we'll do it as soon as the financials really allow us to get there. It is our number one priority, though.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, Pat. And, Jay, a question for you around Latin America. Two regions in particular. Venezuela output generally seems to be very robust across the country. Curious what you're seeing there and if you can comment on your relationship with \u2013 just politically over there, and given some of the potential tensions? And then the outlook for Argentina as well, it looks like a very powerful resource, obviously a dynamic political situation there as well, but comments on both of those plays would be terrific.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","The performance in both of those areas has been good, and our relationships with the government in both countries I'd characterize as very strong. We have a long history and we have worked hard to maintain both our performance and our relationships. In terms of the unconventional play in Loma Campana, we are seeing continued progress there. We have linked in that asset team, and they are tied to our North America asset teams, so there's good sharing of the information as we continue to move down the learning curve, as we gain knowledge from the industry and offset partners, we're plowing those back into the business, moving to consistent sets of metrics. So that drive to continue to improve in the unconventional space is being applied in Argentina as well. And so we're quite excited about that potential for that asset.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, Jay. Thank you, Pat.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks Neil.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Thank you.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Frank.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody. I think you mentioned earlier the inability to slow offshore exploration spending in this current environment or in your outlook here. But can you quantify exploration spending in 2015 and 2016 from at least from an Analyst Day timeframe and discuss rate commitments that limit your flexibility into that timeframe.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Yeah, the Deepwater drilling that's going on in the Gulf of Mexico, of course, we have six rigs there, and it moves back and forth between exploration and appraisal. So as we have exploration success, than rigs get taken out of exploration and moved into more appraisal and development work. So for example, right now, we have, of the six rigs, four are working on production and development wells and two are working on appraisal wells, and we'll move some of those back into the exploration area. We currently expect to drill about 12, what we consider to be high-impact exploration wells around the world this year. We continue to see activity in West Africa, Deepwater West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico are two of our primary areas but we also have some other work in the unconventional going on as well.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. So it's more of a shifting then maybe a reduction on the rig side.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","I think as we move forward, we're going to, on the rig side, we shift those back and forth. Of course, they're under long-term contracts, the large Deepwater rigs. But in terms of some of the unconventional work, those rigs are on shorter cycle, and we can move accordingly with our capital allocation.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Going forward, my comment was really around how much additional work we're going to put in outside of those committed Deepwater rigs.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, Jay. And since I have you while you're on the call, maybe a question on the Permian. Your EUR's are up 30% on the slides. Any color on the driver there, whether it's completion, lateral lengths, different zones? And maybe just generally within your portfolio, given the returns, I mean is this region a net receiver of more capital versus other areas where there may be more capital pressure in this environment?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Yeah, on the first question, I would say it's all of the above. As we're getting more effective in our drilling, we're learning a lot from our offset operators and we're moving, as you know, from vertical wells to horizontal wells, and our preference is to really be able to drill those 7,500 foot laterals. The IP rates are consistent with what we were hoping for. We're seeing high liquids content in Bradford Ranch. So everything's looking pretty positive there and when you combine that with the reductions we're getting from our cost of suppliers and the efficiencies, that's what's driving that 35% reduction and our development costs per barrel. I would say that as we look forward, we certainly see the Permian as a very lucrative area for us to continue to grow, but because so much of that acreage is held by fee, we have the luxury of being able to moderate and decide just how much we want to put in there and really can use that as a flywheel. As we put more infrastructure into the area, it really gives us increasing flexibility and profitability as we move forward.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for your answers.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Evan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, everybody.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Good morning.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","On the industry deflation theme, I wanted to see if Jay could comment on whether \u2013 Jay, whether you think the pace of cost capture that Chevron's experiencing is different between the U.S. and overseas markets, meaning is one of them lagging the other? And also, do you think it's reasonable to believe that the pace of cost productivity captured for larger companies like Chevron might lag that of smaller companies during this part of the cycle?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Good questions. I'll talk first about the U.S. versus International.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","We have seen a faster response in cost reductions in the U.S. than in the international side. A lot of that's driven by the competitiveness of the U.S. market. There are more contractors out there, there are more service providers, and you can work and make transition from one to another faster if needed. As you get into the international environment, it varies country by country, but the barriers to entry can be much higher. There's often local content issues. Many of these companies may be in joint venture with local companies. So it just makes it more difficult sometimes to drive those costs lower in the short term. But what is happening is we're seeing the activity levels come off substantially, and as activity levels come off, we're seeing that drive the cost structure lower. So I think we will see, and particularly as low prices persist, we will see the international continue to come down. It just hasn't been at the rate that we've seen in North America. I'm sorry, the second part of the question?","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Yeah. And also, Jay, do think it's reasonable that larger \u2013 that the cost productivity capture for big companies like Chevron might lag that of the smaller companies during this part of the cycle?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Yeah. I think in North America the small companies can also drive costs down just as we do, because as I said, there's enough competition for provision of goods and services that they can make those switches just as we can. And so they can drive very, very rapid reductions in price. In the international area, what we're trying to do is really work as an enterprise so that we are working with our major suppliers and coordinating our efforts to drive those costs down around the globe. That's why I think a big company has some leverage that a small company wouldn't. We can work with these very large companies to drive those efficiencies, to make sure that our global contracts and terms and conditions support a lower cost structure.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And I'd just add that I think because of our spend and our size, that gives us additional leverage that some of the smaller firms don't have.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","It seems like it would over some period. And then also, Jay, you talked about the neutral zone a few minutes ago and it's obviously been shut in for a few quarters. And I know it's hard to know whether the Saudis and the Kuwaitis are close to resolving their issues, but my question is if those fields were able to be brought back on stream, over what period of time do you think this could happen? Meaning is this something that could occur over months or is it quarters or is it a longer term period, given the extended nature of the shut in? So how do you think about that?","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Well, the fields were shut in \u2013 the Wafra field was shut in, in mid-May. So that kind of gives the beginning of the timeframe. And obviously it depends on how long they remain shut in. If we were able to restart in the next couple of months, I think we'd be looking at probably like about a six-month ramp-up to get back into kind of normal operation. Obviously visas have to be issued, we have to get workers into the country, we have to get the facilities restarted. So we've been doing steadily since the facilities were shut in, preservation work to make sure that the facilities are protected and that we are ready for a restart. There's extensive planning around the restart. So I think as we work to get approval to restart that field it really just depends on how long it's going to take before that restart initiates. But at this point in time, we can restart in a relatively short period of time. Couple of quarters I would say.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Doug. Yup.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question, please?","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. A follow-up just from earlier comments, and then I have a separate question. I wasn't quite clear what you're saying about the dividend. Did you say that the 27-year record is not of increases in per-share dividends but is an absolute payout? I think that's what...?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","It's an annual payment record, yes.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","So we're looking at the dollars that you pay out as an amount? Is that \u2013 that's the increase...","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","That's correct.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","That's correct.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So what you're saying is it may not increase on a per-share basis?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Each year it may not. But the payment in each year has increased 27 years.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, given all the moving parts here, if we could just \u2013 I'm sorry if I missed it, but are we still reiterating the $3.1 million a day for 2017, and is that changing with the asset sale element here? I'm not clear if you've increased your asset sale target. And I think your net asset sales from the $3.1 million a day, is that correct? And furthermore, is the cash flow neutrality target dependent on asset sales? And I'm again not clear if you've increased the asset sales. And finally, is the cash flow neutrality a number at which you keep volumes flat or you grow? Thanks.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so let me just go back and talk about the original objectives that we put out in 2017 and $70 oil and the cash flow neutrality. That \u2013 the assumption that we had in there was independent of asset sales, at the $70 price. Now depending upon where you go on price, I have indicated that we would continue to work our cost structure. We would continue to work our capital outlays. I think we also need to keep asset sales in the portfolio. It is an arrow in the quiver. It is a lever that we would have. And what we showed you back in March, we were cash flow neutral covering the dividend without asset sales in there. Depending upon where prices end, obviously I think that's a lever that we still need to have in the \u2013 available to us.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","So when we gave you the SAM information in March, we had about 65,000 decrease from the 2014 to 2017 in asset sales. And that, as Pat said, can certainly change as we determine what the level of asset sales is going to be. But the $3.1 million is really driven by the major capital projects that are under construction that are going to be coming online. I think one of the key points was, as we also said in March, those volumes that are contributed are accretive from a cash margin standpoint. So as those projects come online, we still see that as the main driver of our growth, and then we just have to evaluate both from a divestment standpoint and any moderation in capital into the base, what the impacts of that might be.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So we're sticking with the $3.1 million. It's not necessarily contingent. You're not adjusting for asset sales but neither are you adjusting for the project issues that you talked about in the call. The cash flow neutrality doesn't or does include asset sales and can you grow from there in 2017 if you are cash flow neutral? Thanks.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","Yeah, I think from the standpoint that the $3.1 million is an outcome. It was $3.3 million, and as the North America gas pricing came substantially lower and we saw it staying lower, we pulled back some investment from North America gas and brought our target down accordingly. At this point, we're still at $3.1 million, we still have all these projects that are under construction and driving forward, but obviously, we just have to see if this very low price condition persists. It may have some impact. The $3.1 million is good a number as an outcome that I can drive it to at this point in time.","In terms of going forward, we'll actually see our capital programs. We've talked about moderate quite a bit because we're not going to be trying to do the \u2013 and accomplish the organic growth that we're underway right now. So as we look forward, we're evaluating that now, we'll see some momentum continue. Projects like Gorgon have two trains that will come on, Trains two and Trains three and then the ramp ups that are associated with those Trains. Wheatstone will have a second Train coming on. We'll have some other projects that are still in the ramp up phase. So I see some momentum carrying past 2017. Those are also going to be strong volumes from a cash margin standpoint. And then as we look out into the next decade, a lot of that is going to depend on the options that we've been able to preserve and the degree to which we've moved to any of the pre-FID projects forward. That's part of the work that's undergoing now in our business plan.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So I don't want to go on too much with it. But just a final specific, one with the cash neutrality does include asset sales.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","So in the $70 case, the answer was no, it did not. Depending upon what case you're going forward with here, a $60 case, a $50 case, whatever your case is, I want to preserve that degree of flexibility for us. Our primary levers are going to be getting our cost structure down and getting our capital program down for whatever price environment prevails out there. But depending upon where prices do go, I don't want to take off our available set of options. I don't want to take asset sales off that available set of options.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I understand. Can I slip in another one? Why was the...?","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","You see, Paul, we're overtime. We got a couple of guys (01:03:43).","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. I'll let you go. Thank you.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","All right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question, please?","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi, everyone. Can I just ask on the impairment exactly what it was that triggered it? Is it just oil price or is it something about assets going up for sale or some geological review?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so...","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","And can you can say what oil price it is?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","I can answer most of those questions here. The trigger really was a lowering of our corporate longer-term price outlook on crude oil. We took that action in May, and as you know, when there's a trigger event like that, we do need to run impairment tests on our assets. Any time there's a significant trigger, whether it be a reduced price outlook or increased costs or some change in the geology in the reserve or production profile, those are elements that when that trigger occurs we need to do the impairment reviews. And we have a process set up where we look at that every quarter. In this particular instance, the vast majority of the impairments related to Papa Terra, and that was a price-induced, crude oil price-induced impairment. We did have a couple of other smaller assets in this category as well where they were assets held for sale where we were writing it down basically to what we felt was the realizable value.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","And on the oil price? Is it possible to talk around that?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Right. We're not going to give you our proprietary oil price. I can just say the revised outlook was really based on two factors. One had to do with the rate we were expecting of global GDP growth and in particular around China, so we've seen softening in China, and we've taken our view of that down accordingly. And the second major factor that lowered our overall price outlook had to do with the U.S. tight oil shale produceability. We've seen obviously much stronger production coming out of the U.S. and with the ingenuity and cost efficiency of the U.S. industry we've seen costs continue to fall, and economics of those barrels continue to rise, and so that puts more supply onto the market place. And so it's those two factors that's led us to lowering our longer term price outlook.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Right. And finally, is really anything taken on Big Foot other than the impairment or in the suspension, project suspension (01:06:07)?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","No. Nothing of any material size, no.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Frank Mount - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks, Alastair.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, and, guys, thanks for letting the call run over. I really appreciate you letting that. I just want to get on with the end here. I guess I wanted to kind of follow up on a couple of things that Paul mentioned. I really had two specifics. But $11 billion out of $15 billion on disposals, what is your thought on raising disposal target at this point given that you've still got two and a half years left in the program? It would seem you've got a lot of upside potentials. So that's my first.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","All right. And we're not in a position to move that target at this point. We just moved that target back in March. We feel very good about the assets that we've been able to move forward and the value that we have captured for that. So we have a number of assets kind of lined up in our own mind about how we could meet that $15 billion target over the next several months, 18 months or so. But it really will depend on whether or not that value is capturable. And we're not going to just sell the asset for the sake of meeting a target. We want to capture value while we do it. So I'm not in a position to raise that target at this point. We feel good about where we sit. When we get to March of next year, if we have a different view, we'll update it at that time.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate it. My follow up, and I guess last question of the call is on Gorgon, not so much on the timing of the startup, I think Jay's been pretty clear on that, but the timing of getting to full capacity because obviously the cash flow delta that comes from the slowdown in spending versus the cash flow contribution is quite important. And I guess what I am getting at is if everyone is really starting to think lower for longer, what does the cash contribution look like and how long does it take to get to full capacity? So, I don't know how you want to try and answer that, but if you could help us with the contribution from Gorgon when it does come on, that would be \u2013 Gorgon (01:08:18) that would be very helpful.","James William Johnson - Executive Vice President, Upstream","So our current view on Gorgon is that each Train, the second Train should start up about seven months after the first Train and then followed by four to six months for the third Train. And it should take around eight months on the first Train to get to capacity is our plan, and then six months for Trains 2 and Trains 3. So you can kind of put all that together to get a rough profile of what Gorgon's going to look like coming forward. And even in the lower price environment the cash generation that it has is still substantial, so we're looking forward to getting that cash on stream.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Okay. I think that was our last call. I want to thank everybody for your time and attention here this morning, and I'll turn it back to you, Jonathan.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. John Watson. Please go ahead.","John Watson","Well, thanks Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Gustavson, the General Manager of Investor Relations. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on our Web site.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Turning to Slide 3, I'd like to highlight some of our key accomplishments for the year, starting with safety environmental performance. We had our best year ever and virtually every measure of personal safety, process safety and environmental performance. We expect to lead the industry again. Although commodities prices fell sharply late in the year, our overall financial performance was strong, upstream and downstream had solid years overall and both ended the year with very good reliability. We had excellent progress on our asset divestment program with significant well-timed upstream sales in Chad and in Canada and high valuation mid-stream transactions.","In the first year of the program we finalized just under $6 billion in investments versus the $10 billion three year target for the period 2014 to 2016, we'll update this target at our March meeting. Looking at our downstream business, we completed important liability investments at several of our key refineries, which contributed to high utilization rates in the second half of the year. We became the world's largest premium base oil producer with the start-up of a 25,000 barrel per day plant at our Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery. We continued to make progress on our U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project through Chevron Phillips Chemical Company our 50% owned affiliate. It is now 50% complete.","Moving to the upstream business, we started Jack\/St. Malo which is ramping up ahead of plan and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico. In Bangladesh we successfully expanded production at the Bibiyana field. On our LNG projects in Australia, Gorgon is now 90% complete, we're targeting first gas into the system around the middle of the year and first LNG sales this year. Wheatstone made excellent progress and it's 55% complete and on-track for late 2016 start-up. We've posted a number of photos highlighting our construction progress on these two important projects on our investor webpage.","We progressed development of our shale and tight resource holdings, notably in the Permian. We had one of our best years from an exploration and resource capture standpoint with 35 discoveries at a 66% success rate. We added 1.4 billion oil equivalent barrels with significant conventional and unconventional adds. We had two potential hub class discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and we announced the transaction yesterday to consolidate holdings around one of them. Our one year reserve replacement ratio was 89% taking our five year replacement ratio to 96%.","With that I'll turn it over to Pat, who'll take you through our financial results. Pat?","Pat Yarrington","All right, thanks John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance, the Company's fourth quarter earnings were $3.5 billion or $1.85 per diluted share. For the year earnings were 19.2 billion this equates to a $10.14 per diluted share. Return on capital employed was 11% and our debt ratio at year-end was 15%. 2014 marked the 27th consecutive that we\u2019ve increased our dividend payment. Given the change in market conditions, we are suspending our share repurchase program for 2015.","Turning to Slide 5, cash generated from operations was 6.5 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full year, cash from operations totaled 31.5 billion. Cash capital expenditures were 9.7 billion for the quarter and 35.4 billion for the full year. At year end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $13 billion giving us a net debt position of about 15 billion.","Slide 6 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2014 earnings were approximately $1.5 billion lower than fourth quarter 2013 result. Upstream earnings decreased to 2.2 billion between quarters. Lower crude realizations and asset impairments driven by the sharp decline in crude oil prices during the second half of the year and higher DD&A charges were partially offset by higher gains on asset sales and lower exploration expenses. Downstream results increased by 1.1 billion driven by stronger international refining and marketing margins, higher gains on asset sales and favorable timing effects. The decrease in the other segment primarily reflected higher corporate charges and tax items.","Turning to Slide 7, I'll now compare results for the fourth quarter of 2014 with the third quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.1 billion lower than third quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased by approximately 2 billion reflecting lower realizations and asset impairments partially offset by higher gains on asset sales and more favorable foreign exchange effect. Downstream earnings increased by 130 million driven by favorable timing effects and gains on asset sales partially offset by higher operating expenses and a one-time economic buyout of a legacy pension obligation. The decrease in the other segment largely reflected higher corporate charges.","Moving to Slide 8, our U.S. upstream earnings for both the fourth quarter were about 500 million lower than third quarter results. Lower liquids realizations decreased earnings by 600 million consistent with the approximate 25% decline in the U.S. liquids prices indicators between periods. The decline in prices also triggered impairments of several smaller assets which negatively affected earnings by 90 million. Higher gains on asset sales improved earnings by 160 million. The other bar reflects the number of unrelated items including unfavorable tax effects which were more than offset by the absence of the economic buyout of a long-term contractual transportation obligation in the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 9, international upstream earnings were about 1.5 billion lower than last quarter's results. Lower crude oil prices negatively impacted earnings by $1.4 billion. Our average international crude oil realizations were down $25 per barrel between quarters consistent with the decline in Brent prices. The significant drop in prices triggered impairment for several late-in-life assets decreasing earnings by 570 million between periods. Higher operating cost reduced earnings by 110 million. Gains on asset sales increased earnings by 670 million, mainly driven by the farm-down of a 30% interest in our Duvernay shale interest in Canada as well as the sale of our upstream business in the Netherlands.","Slide 10 summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2014. Net production increased by 14,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects start ups and growth from shale and tight resource developments contributed 13,000 barrels per day. Project start-ups included the expansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh as well as the start up of Tubular Bells and Jack\/St. Malo in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Jack\/St. Malo achieved first production in December on-time and on-budget.","Entitlement effects increased production by 13,000 barrels per day between the quarters. Lower crude prices increased volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts partially offset by lower cost recovery volumes. Higher plant turnaround activity at TCO's Tengiz SGI\/SGP facility in Kazakhstan early in the quarter and turnaround activity in Thailand and in Australia decreased production by 19,000 barrels per day. Asset sales in the Netherlands, South Texas and Norway negatively affected production by 11,000 barrels per day between quarters. The increase of 18,000 barrels per day in the base business in other bar reflects primarily higher reliability from Tengiz following the previously mentioned turnarounds completed earlier in the quarter.","Slide 11 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between 2014 and 2013. Net production declined by 26,000 barrels per day during 2014 compared to the prior year. Shale and tight production increased by 41,000 barrels per day driven primarily by growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian as well as the Vaca Muerta in Argentina. Ramp up associated with Papa-Terra in Brazil and the expansion of the Bibiyana field in Bangladesh increased production by 13,000 barrels per day.","Production entitlement effects decreased production by 14,000 barrels per day. Price effects were positive due to the decrease in crude oil prices of almost $10 per barrel between years. This were more than offset however by negative entitlement effects in Kazakhstan and lower cost recovery volumes in Bangladesh and Indonesia. Assets sales decreased production by 12,000 barrels a day due primarily to the sale of our Chad asset earlier in the year. The base business in other bar principally reflects normal field declines partially offset by base business investments in Nigeria, in the San Joaquin Valley and in the Gulf of Mexico. Our base business continues to perform well with a managed decline rate of less than 3% per year.","Turning to Slide 12, U.S. downstream results increased $80 million between quarters. Realized margins decreased earnings by 190 million. Refining margins were weaker on both the West and the Gulf Coast as the decrease in product prices outpaced the decline in crude oil prices. This reflected abundant supply, high inventories and lower seasonal demand. Timing effects represented $195 million improvement in earnings between the quarters largely driven by year-end inventory effects and marking to market on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions. Higher gains on mid-stream asset sales improved earnings by 210 million. The other bar consists of several unrelated items mainly unfavorable tax effects and higher operating expenses primarily associated with planned shutdown activity.","Turning to Slide 13, international downstream earnings increased by $51 million between quarters. Higher margins particularly in Asia increased earnings by 280 million. Refining margins benefited from falling crude prices while marketing margins were supported by favorable price lag effects for naphtha and jet fuel. Inventory effects represented $100 million improvement in earnings between quarters mostly reflecting favorable year-end LIFO impacts. A one-time charge related to the buyout of a legacy pension liability decreased earnings by 160 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency effects.","With that I'll turn it back to John for a few comments on 2015.","John Watson","Okay, thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 14, earlier today we announced the $35 billion capital program for 2015. This is $5 million or 13% lower than last year, excluding expenditures by affiliates the cash component of this program is 31 billion. This program is lower than we signaled last March and is responsive to current market conditions. It funds key projects where we've taken final investment decision and are already under construction. In the upstream this amount is approximately $14 billion representative of the dark blue on this chart. It includes monies for Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack\/St. Malo, Big Foot and others. This category of spend will decline in the future as projects are completed. Base business and shale spending in medium blue on the chart is about 12 billion. A portion of this base business spend includes critical and maintenance reliability work which has limited flexibility. The majority of the base spend, including shale and tight is being screened at current prices. We have increasing flexibility in this component of spend as the year progresses.","Spending on Pre-FID projects and exploration work is being high graded, paced and significantly reduced in response to market conditions. Downstream spending of $3 billion is limited to key projects under construction such as the Gulf Coast chemical project which by the way is 35% complete I think I said 50% earlier, 35% complete. And also the spending in the downstream is also limited to critical reliability and maintenance work.","Turning to Slide 15 we've reduced our capital budget for the year conserving cash and preserving value. We also are reducing the costs of goods and services and operating expenses. We enter this period of lower prices with a very competitive cost structure. We routinely show you a chart that tracks total cost per barrel in our upstream business relative to our competitors. You've seen we are industry-leader and we have significant cost reduction efforts underway. This chart shows the IHS upstream cost index, industry costs have more than doubled in the last decade. Market conditions will create surplus capacity in most key supply chain categories and drive rates lower. We are actively engaged with all suppliers and have enjoyed early success. We expect the opportunity will grow with time and particularly so if prices remain low.","We're also taking action to reduce internal costs. You may have seen press coverage of staffing adjustments in the UK and Pennsylvania. We have other reviews under way in multiple other operating and corporate units. Managing cost aggressively is not new to us Mike Wirth was quite successful in making significant reductions in the downstream in recent years and if you go back and look at our financial statements in 2008 and 2009, you'll see that we took operating and administrative cost down $4 billion or about 15% between years in response to that brief price excursion. We know how to manage costs. Our production guidance is the range of flat to 3% growth the uncertainty is the reflection of market conditions. I'll highlight several of those uncertainties.","First, we've had great success in the base business area limiting decline in mature fields to 3% or less in many years. Our shale programs in the Permian and elsewhere continued, but I have indicated we're screening the spend at current prices. I have also indicated we're active in our efforts with vendors and suppliers to reduce costs. The uncertainty in prices and the costs of goods and services creates some uncertainty in the amount of base business investment and the decline rate and growth from our shale resources.","Second, we've had success in our asset sale program. The full year effect of last year's sales reduces production 22,000 barrels a day from 2014. There is uncertainty in the timing and precise composition of this year's asset sale program creating uncertainty in the additional volume impact. Remember we're driven on all sales by value and this can influence timing.","Finally, the contributions from major capital project ramp ups and start ups this year is significant but relatively small movement in the timing of deepwater development wells at Jack\/St. Malo, Tubular Bells or Papa-Terra can make a significant difference in annual production. Similarly, small movements in restart dates for Angola LNG or start up of Gorgon and other new projects can cause variation. Finally, production sharing contract and other entitlement effects are sensitive to prices and spend levels. Our 3.1 million barrel a day target for 2017 remains on-track as the major projects under construction drive that outcome.","That concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate your listening in this morning we're now ready to take some questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan please open up the lines and we will take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.","Jason Gammel","John, I just want to ask about taking FID in the current price environment. You spoke about how you were beginning to see cost savings from your providers and is that something where you would probably just try to delay making an FID to see how that type of negotiation goes with suppliers, or do you expect that you will actually have some fairly significant FIDs this year? And I am really thinking Tengiz\u2019s expansion as much as anything else here?","John Watson","And I think that's the key one to focus on, if you look -- we have many projects that are in concept development and frontend engineering and design. And so the overall economics of some of them are impacted by the current price environment but the project at Tengiz is a good project and that project will ultimately go forward. And we've made significant progress and have good line up with our partners on that. But we're taking the opportunity in the current price environment to take a look at contracts, take a look at spend and see if we can bring costs down further. Now we have in the plan and expectation that we will take final investment decision later in the year in 2015. Other than that I can't think of too many significant projects where we're likely to take FID this year.","Jason Gammel","And then just as a follow-up, John do you have any deflation built into the capital budget for 2015 or is it all reduced activity levels?","John Watson","Well it's a little bit of both Jason, we do have -- I think for example we've dropped over 20 rigs, which is about 15% of our worldwide rig count. So as I said we're screening projects based on the current level of prices if the return is near at hand. So if you have short cycle based business or shale investments and they don't meet investment hurdles at current prices which is the revenue you're likely to realize, we're pulling them from the program and we've cut rigs all over the world.","Now many things continue to pass the hurdle and so we\u2019re continuing with our development. For example our work in the Permian passes is the hurdle. And so we're continuing that and have had good success. But we're also taking on costs in a fairly big way, if you look around the world. Rigs get a lot of attention, but that's actually not the biggest category of spend. EPC cost, well construction services, transportation, the fab yards are going to empty out here and rigs. We're taking on all of these things and we have a centralized procurement organization as well as a lot of people in our unit that are taking advantage of the opportunity in spare capacity and the supply chain.","It varies considerably depending upon the category of spend that we're talking about and the precise timing. On rigs, we had one offer in one location around the world of a 50% reduction in rig rate. We've already captured retroactive January 1, rig reductions in some areas. So we're taking this on a big way and we have targets. We've baked in a little bit into our numbers but this is a very fast moving market and the longer this downturn persists the more we\u2019re likely to capture and the more it will be reflected in the major categories of spend like EPC cost and major fab yard spending that we might make on projects. Sure. Sir, Ed Westlake.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake","John, so I mean, just the high level picture and yes-no answer probably, has anything changed to your view that oil demand is growing? And has anything changed about the decline rates that you feel the industry has to overcome?","John Watson","Yes. Overall the general picture that I've laid out here before and we've talked about is that, as long as the world economy grows, there's a reasonable correlation between world economic growth and growth in energy demand. If the world economy grows 3% to 4%, we tend to see 1% to 2% growth in energy consumption. In our view, maybe 1% for oil, 2% for gas over that time period, so that general picture hasn\u2019t changed. Now it can be influenced in the short run by macro events and prices and things of that sort. One of the things that we're trying to get a handle on and that others are looking at is how responsive will global demand be to the price reduction. If you look at some of those who follows very closely, they could see increases from 3,000 to 5,000 barrels a day from lower prices, but you've also got countries around the world that are reducing demand side subsidies and things of that sort. So it's a function of economics and it depends how long this persists. Truck sales in the U.S. are doing pretty well right now, so I think we get a bump from lower prices and I think we'll see growth of perhaps a 1 million barrels a day in demand worldwide in 2015, but that number can move around a little bit.","Ed Westlake","And then specifically Gorgon, you've kind of reiterated the timetable I mean can you give us any nuggets to give you confidence that we will get that first gas in Gorgon mid-year and the first LNG cargo this year?","John Watson","Well I'd tell you that there's nothing at the higher priority for us right now than that Ed. And as I said we're 90% complete. We've got 8,000 people on the site right now, that's a little more than we might have thought in the past. We've brought in a bigger combination vessel and so we have put more people on site. We've made terrific progress on the upstream side basically all 18 wells have been drilled all upstream subsea infrastructure is in place, pipeline installation is complete. You can see a lot of this on the Web site, so those things are good. So we're working all those things really hard. We've got really mechanical electrical instrumentation work that's in high gear right now and we're basically milestone driven and commissioning and starting up systems right now. And that's really our focus. We're monitoring very closely contractor performance and productivity on the Island we're working with the unions on contracts and industrial relations. We've been able to manage through those things fairly well and we're planning for a flawless start up commissioning and start-up process. We've got risks of adverse weather that are there, but look we're shooting to get gas into the system in the middle of the year timeframe and get some cargos out this year. That's our focus. George and Jay Johnson are heading down there here in February so when we come back in March at the Analyst Meeting we'll have some very fresh information for you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please.","Alastair Syme","Can I just come back to the chat on CapEx, I'm just trying to get a feel for how the different buckets of CapEx are moving year on year so the base business and the projects under construction, where the big revisions are?","John Watson","Spending has come down $5 billion overall some of that is in LNG spend. It was a little over $10 billion in 2014 in total, it's a little over $8 billion planned in 2015, so that's a little bit of the spend. Deepwater spend is relatively flat. Shale and tight spend is a little bit higher, but some of our other base business spend is down. We've got about 10% to 15% reduction in exploration expense between years. And of course we also have those mid cycle projects those that are in concept design or engineering that there are fewer of those there's little less spend in those categories this year than in the past, so we're working very hard on all of those costs.","And of course you may be asking about how do those categories look going forward? And we do expect growing flexibility in our spend as we move forward. One of the things we'll show you in March when we get there is that that bottom bar those projects under construction the $14 billion that number comes down in time. The LNG spend this year and next will continue to be significant, but as we get to 2017 it\u2019s under $100 billion, so I expect you'll see some reduction in that category. Now we may take FID on some projects, so you may have some additional spend in that category, but in principal there's a very high roll-off rate from that category of projects under construction.","The base business spend is a function of both economics and how much we can wring out of the system from a cost point of view so there's activity and there is the cost of that activity and I commented on some of the sort of trends that we're seeing in that category. I will say exploration we're going to continue to explore. We had fabulous success particularly towards the end of 2014 in the Gulf of Mexico where the couple of discoveries and the transaction we had with a couple of other players in the business. So we'll continue to high grade that activity but we have growing flexibility in all categories is I guess the comment I\u2019d like to leave you with.","Alastair Syme","Could you give us some sort of sense of about as you droll down that base versus payments in 2015, what impact that might have on underlying decline rates in the business?","John Watson","Yes I think that it is a risk for the industry I think I've commented earlier I think that is a growing risk for the industry. If you go back to 2008 and 2009 period and this is a hard number to get at but we saw an increase worldwide in decline rates for all companies, basically for the entire industry. Increase by a 1% or 2% and that\u2019s very significant. We've done a good job of keeping decline rates to 3% or less I think we\u2019ve got a good chance to do that but obviously when you cut some rigs you have some risk of a higher decline rate in 2015 relative to past years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Evan Calio","My question is just to follow-up on CapEx and I appreciate that it is a fluid process yet on your current guidance today, where do you expect the production impact? I mean it doesn't appear to impact the guide for 2015 at least in the high-end? I mean is it altering that 2017 guide or is it really much more long dated impact given being in a longer cycle time of a lot of your resource?","John Watson","Yes Evan you just said the impact is predominantly over the longer term because we're continuing with the projects under construction and we're deferring some projects and spend that will have some impact on production but it's generally outside the window the window that we're talking about. For example the Tengiz project will be a good project but it\u2019s not going produce volumes inside the 2017 window. Similarly when you cut make reductions in exploration spend you're not going impact a production inside the window. So I would think of most of it as being a long dated impact.","Evan Calio","And the 3%, the \u201915 production guidance, that's on current prices, I presume? Assuming no asset sales is I guess how I read the sensitivity. Obviously there is PSC effect there in asset sales? Is that correct? That is based on current prices, current strip?","John Watson","It is I think it really governs the full range it's a pretty good range frankly normally we've given point estimates but there are a lot of moving categories this time. So it really encompasses the range of outcomes that are possible based on where we are today. For example as you point out at lower prices you do get a benefit in some of our PSC agreements from those lower prices where you spend money it takes more barrels to repay cost for example on cost barrels. But the flip side is that you may spend less and so there will be less to recover for example, we are reducing spend and have cut some rigs in Indonesia in response to economic. So you do have some offsets in these categories and of course depending upon when you make asset sales that has a direct impact on volumes.","Evan Calio","And just a follow-up if I could, you mentioned you continue to monitor and be responsive to market conditions so I presume that further cuts would be responsive to a deterioration in market conditions. And then I guess you gave -- I like the classification on Slide 14. I guess how much of the $12 billion base is being spent in \u201915 on shorter cycle that may be more controllable if conditions warranted?","John Watson","Well virtually everything in that category is shorter cycle activity there are some critical maintenance and reliability investments that we will continue to make same thing in the downstream. You need to keep your facilities running and in good shape. So there is a category that I would say is inflexible that is in the base business. Although the cost of delivering those goods and services may go down during the period, the activity itself will continue from an activity point of view as time goes by and rig contracts roll off we have growing flexibility in this category. I mean ultimately you have a great deal of flexibility in this category of spend. But as I say and we'll be responsive to market conditions and screen activity out if it doesn\u2019t meet our thresholds.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Ryan Todd","If I could follow-up with a question on pricing in the current environment, between the changes in the LNG market that we've seen in terms of where LNG is coming from in particular potentially a ramp in U.S. supply and then the reduction, the collapse that we've seen in oil price, are you seeing anything in potential LNG market pricing either for existing projects or for future projects, any change in the trends?","John Watson","Any change in trends, well the trend has been a very fluid environment and a very frankly there has been a lot pressure on LNG pricing both in response to immediate conditions and response to the projects that have gone to FID around the world. So there is pressure on LNG markets. Notwithstanding that, we did signed a contract during this period that's an oil linked contract with a reputable company for a medium term slice of volume towards the end of the decade which gets us up into the range where we feel pretty good about the projects Gorgon and Wheatstone where we will basically be at our target for sales will be between 75% and 80% on Gorgon and 85% for Wheatstone. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good shape.","We obviously need good contracts that to underpin new developments. So one of the projects that we\u2019re pacing until we can see conditions that will support a project is at Kitimat in Canada, we\u2019re continuing with some of the work we have underway to delineate the resource and reach agreements with First Nations people and permitting and things of that sort. But we\u2019re significantly pacing the spend of that project and we\u2019ll get alignment on it and have good alignment in early days with Woodside which is replaced Apache. Other than that I think there is, I think people are pretty cautious right now in the LNG market. Our view is it\u2019s not clear that all the Greenfield projects that are being contemplated can meet economic hurdles at some of the prices we\u2019re seeing. And demand is out there.","Ryan Todd","Maybe speaking of Kitimat, that's a good transition to a second question, which is from a high-level strategic view, when you look out from here over the next 10 years, has your view of the future changed at all in the sense that when you look back I guess over the last 10, are there projects, business models, efforts that have been part of your business model in the last five to 10 years that when you look forward over the next 10 you think just may not work anymore whether it's large-scale gas projects or oil sands or any type of -- I guess your views at high level on changes in the industry over the next 10 versus the last 10?","John Watson","My basic view that in fact was referenced in the question which was asked earlier is energy demand continues to grow and if you look at the decline curve that\u2019s inherent in our business and let\u2019s talk about the oil side for a moment. Oil fields decline worldwide roughly 15% a year without investment. The industry works very hard with base business investments to attenuate that decline every year but still you do get declines of 3% to 5% industry-wide. So you need new oil fields to meet demand. The 3% to 5% decline on 90 plus million barrel a day base is significant. So you need investments in new fields and $50 does not support large new field developments and what I would call the big volumes that are going to contribute to meeting demand whether it\u2019s oil sands, deepwater aren\u2019t supportive of the 50 bucks. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing forward prices and most in the industry expecting to see some rebound in prices because we simply won\u2019t be able to support those projects at those kinds of prices.","Now there in the short run when you have supply that is exceeding demand in our business short run supply and demand are not very responsive to prices so it takes that decline kicking in or action by OPEC or a stronger economic growth to close that gap and that\u2019s what it will be required here over the next period of time to get prices into a range where they can support the sorts of projects that you\u2019re referencing. Our view is those forces are at work right now and we can debate when that gap will close but the forces are working with every announcement of C&E cuts it\u2019s more likely to happen sooner. So my basic view is the world needs energy and the prices have to support the activity and of course we monitor the cost environment that we\u2019re in. We can see short run reductions in costs that can make projects more economic but in general the projects that are going to meet demand going forward are more complex than 20 or 30 years ago and so the cost of those projects will be higher and require higher price than we\u2019re seeing today to meet the volume targets. Probably a long explanation but that\u2019s how we think of it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Cheng","John, often times that risks also come opportunity and especially that you foresee maybe longer that potentially that you could have distressed assets out there in the U.S. and maybe also overseas. So from a high level, how do you guys look at under that circumstances I mean how much are you willing to use your balance sheet or perhaps that risk in your balance sheet a little bit and also that to use perhaps your currency not necessary at the best point that you want but will you be willing to also use it in a decent sized transaction?","John Watson","Well, we -- old times Paul you and I've talked many times over the years, we're a depleting resource business, so we have to acquire leases discovered resource and frankly companies overtime. And we're very targeted in how we do that and we have tried to be commercially smart and take advantage of the opportunities when there's less competition for those assets. So we are actively screening the opportunities that are out there and we'll take advantage of opportunities that we see, I mean a one that's on the smaller end of the scale, but just a couple of days ago we did announce a consolidating transaction in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with a couple of partners. And we think we've acquired resource at a competitive cost relative to exploration costs and so -- and there are benefits to all parties from working to develop a common set of assets together in one hub, but that's -- so we do take a look at the opportunities that are before us. Now I have to tell you, our priority right now isn\u2019t acquisitions. Our priority at the moment is completing the projects that are under construction. And we do have balance sheet parameters that we work within to do that, but you point out on a relative basis, we've got a pretty good currency and we're mindful of the opportunities that's there.","Paul Cheng","Can I just follow-on a quick question, that in your supply costs, any rough idea of what is the percent of your supply contract whether it is rig EPC, those have a duration longer than two years. So in other words what is the percentage of your cost base both in capital and operating costs that potentially we could see the benefit from the deflationary environment that expecting over the next 12 to 18 months?","John Watson","We have a number of contracts that roll-off during that period. I would say by the time you get to 2017, almost all spend becomes variable if you will, so in fact a lot of it this year rolls off. Now we do have deepwater rig contracts that have been staggered and go out a few years. We do have fabrication contracts that have already been led they can go out several years, but the vast majority of the spend going forward if you look out to say 2017, the vast majority of that spend will be reflective of current market conditions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.","Paul Sankey","John, from this level are you saying that you expect CapEx to go lower and do we now say that the 3.1 million barrel a day 2017 target for volumes is gone? And one query I would have about that is it was previously lowered because of an assumption that oil prices would be higher. If you recall your previous planning assumption had been I think $79 and it was the move up to a higher price that caused you to lower the target. Wouldn't that be a reverse effect down here? Thanks.","John Watson","Yes well I did reaffirm the 3.1 in my comments earlier, so I have reaffirmed that target. And I will say there are quite a few moving parts in getting to the 3.1. First, most of the growth between now and then in underpinned by Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack\/St. Malo, Big Foot, Mafumeira Sul and others that are under construction. And I've indicated we're continuing to fund that spending. We have had over the years some changes in the composition of the remainder of the volumes that contribute to the 3.1 for example, we've previously flagged in response to U.S. gas prices, we had reduced spend in that area. On the other side, the Permian wasn\u2019t in our plans when you go way back to 2010 and volumes coming from that area or higher.","There has been a big change in prices and price effects as I indicated earlier can impact volumes. Other things being equal there is a contribution if we get to 2017 and prices are much lower, there will be a positive contribution that's inherent in that 3.1. The other side as I also commented is that we have fewer -- we have less impact from that, if our spend goes down in places like Indonesia and finally we have asset sales that can influence that target, but as we see it today with all those effects some that are positive some that are negative, we still see that 3.1 target.","Paul Sankey","John, just I guess what I am driving at is that based on the 35 would you think you could come lower on the 35 billion of spending and still make the 3.1 and would you manage towards the 3.1, is that what you are saying because I guess you do have a view\u2026","John Watson","No that's specifically not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that we have always -- the volume has always been an outcome. It's always been an outcome. We make decision based on economics. What I'm telling you is that I see the outcome being 3.1 because 80% to 90% of the volume increase between now and then are the projects that are under construction. And we make the investment decisions on our best view of go forward economics and in response to the best value propositions that we can see. The precise level of spend going forward the only thing I'll flag as you know I've been reticent to talk about C&E going forward and this last year is a perfect illustration as to why. We have a lot of moving parts many of which I have described. We also have currency movements and uncertainties, we have growing flexibility in our spend going forward. And if the kind of price environments we see the day persists you will see lower spending absolutely.","Paul Sankey","I mean guess what I was driving at is that you had previously guided towards the flat CapEx from the previous 40 level in order to meet the 3.1. I think what you're now saying is you can still meet the 3.1 and we could even then still see lower CapEx again in meeting the 3.1. Or do I think about it that you are potentially not going to meet the 3.1 and bring down CapEx appropriately with the oil price?","John Watson","I think the outcome is a function of spend that is largely already committed as one of the questions earlier commented is there much volume effect for some of the cuts most of the volume effect will be after 2017 because there are these longer cycle projects where we're taking a pause and trying to work the costs spend. So you know very well Paul we are in a long cycle business and so if you defer longer term projects now it will mean lower production than you might otherwise have seen beyond the target date of 2017. So there is an impact beyond 2017 of the decisions that we're making today but because we have all these projects in flight we don\u2019t see a significant impact to our target beyond the fact as I talked about before of base business spend, timing of asset sales and quantity of assets sales cost barrel effects and things of that sort.","Paul Sankey","And a very quick one, could you indicate how high you think that can go in order to then allow you still to maintain your targeted credit rating? Thanks.","John Watson","I'm going to let my CFO talk about the balance sheet and credit ratings.","Pat Yarrington","Yes, and Paul we have a lot of borrowing capacity still available to us we ended the year with a 15% debt ratio and there is a lot of appetite in the capital markets for our debt and under the scenarios that we're talking about here in this price range with this capital program we anticipate still being very nicely within the double A band and after you get through 2015 really and you look ahead obviously we're going see more production growth. John talked about the flexibility that we've got as time rolls on with our capital program we talked about and we do believe that there will some recovery in oil price we don\u2019t know at what level or exactly how quickly and there will be adjustments to our cost structure. So we feel very comfortable with the position that we're in and John referenced earlier managing within certain constraints and one of the balance sheet constraint is maintaining a strong AA.","Paul Sankey","Is there a rule of thumb for how much that you can have and still be AA?","PatYarrington","I don\u2019t think there is rule of thumb because the rating agencies take into account not only what your financial parameters are but also what's your operating parameters are and what's your prospects for future cash flow generation really are, so it's a combination of what the overall business plan so to speak for the enterprises if the rating agencies take into account. But suffice it to say we have incremental borrowing capacity of several-several 10s of billions of dollars there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","First question is just kind of following up. In terms of trying to achieve dividend coverage and how you think about when you can get there full 100% dividend coverage, any color you can provide about how you kind of bridge to that? Because it looks like this year kind of the shortfall in the free cash flow and then the dividend, you add that up it's maybe $15 billion to $20 billion, so anything you could n provide around that. It sounds like operating costs you've highlighted maybe $4 billion of opportunity but just generally how you are thinking about that?","John Watson","Sure, our plan is to cover the dividend in 2017. And we won't do it this year in all likelihood and in fact we flagged that if you go back two or three years or three to four years we have said in fact it was in response to questions around our balance sheet at that time where we had more cash than debt on the balance sheet and a lot of you were encouraging us to repurchase more shares and to really take advantage of the lower cost of debt and we said look our primary case may not be falling oil price. But we've got a lot of projects under construction and we're in a commodity business and we need to be able withstand the ups and downs of our business and so what I said at that time is that we would be restoring our balance sheet to something that might be a more normal level for AA credit rating as time goes by and these projects roll off.","So when you get the reason I say 2017 is our production will grow between now and then by about 20% and so at whatever price level we're at we'll see benefits to free cash flow from that I have talked about the flexibility in the activity level that we have which can moderate spend and bring us back into balance. And then of course as you mentioned the cost reduction efforts that we have underway both in the supply chain and internally will help us attenuate that. Finally bridging us and helping us on the balance sheet are the contributions from assets sales and you saw we got off to a pretty good start in the program this year but we've flagged and indicated that even at higher price that we were going to use our balance sheet and we were going to use a little of it this year than perhaps would have been the case with higher prices but we\u2019re able to attenuate that over a couple of years.","Phil Gresh","So just a clarification on that then, with the strip in the low 60s is it fair to say that your production growth later in the strip take out 4 billion cost you would actually plug the CapEx to get to a level that carries within that?","John Watson","I\u2019m not going to give you a specific price forecast, I\u2019ll just say that the boundary conditions that we\u2019re operating under and these are things Pat has talked to you many times the boundary conditions, the dividend is the highest priority of spend for us and we want to keep sufficient flexibility on our balance sheet to withstand the ups and downs in the commodity market. So we will work very hard on CapEx and OpEx in order to get balanced in a couple of years.","Phil Gresh","Okay. And just my follow-up question, is there anything in the production guidance for 2015 for Gorgon and for Angola LNG at this point or would execution on that timing wise be upside to the guidance just how to think about and the update on the Angola LNG in general?","John Watson","Well, there is a scenario where we can be to the upside of the range that we\u2019ve indicated, but frankly I\u2019m a little gun-shy on that sort of thing given the kind of the operating environment that we\u2019re in right now given oil prices are and potential adjustments to spend. So yes, we expect to see volumes from those assets this year. The exact timing brings in some variability but our plan is to have both of those contributing volumes this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from Bank of Montreal. Your question please.","Iain Reid","Just a question about your onshore drilling activity, you seem to be maintaining or increasing your drilling in the Permian whereas some of the other companies seem to be deferring it on the basis that it will be worth more in a couple years time by leaving it in the ground. Just kind of interested in your take on that versus what you are planning?","John Watson","Well, we have about 30 rigs running in the Permian and we continue to screen the economics of both I think what I said is our spend on unconventionals will be, in shale will be higher this year than last. But that encompasses our worldwide activity that we expect to see. So we\u2019re still, by the way we\u2019ve had some terrific performance in the Permian, and part of the reason we\u2019re able to do that is we\u2019ve been able to dramatically reduce cost. When we get ahead to March at our Analyst Meeting we\u2019ll give you a fair amount of information on how we\u2019re doing some of the horizontal pad drilling programs that we\u2019re putting in place we\u2019re seeing very-very good early results. But we need to see good returns on these things to make investments. And so I\u2019ll just say we do expect some recovery in prices as the year moves on but if we end up in a depressed environment we can make adjustment to that. Remember a lot of our volume in that area, we benefit from no royalty and that\u2019s a big competitive advantage, as you get down where others might be at the margin more than we are. We\u2019re in pretty good shape because we don\u2019t have royalty and we\u2019ve got a long-long queue available to us.","Iain Reid","Okay, just one other thing, I heard what you said on Wheatstone in terms of schedule. I just wonder though where you are in terms of budget and CapEx. Is there any update you can give us on that relative to the original budget because we haven't had a project update for that one?","John Watson","No, we\u2019re still operating under the current appropriation request that we approve which is the -- the Wheatstone project was a $29 billion U.S. project and we\u2019ve had some ups and downs frankly right now we\u2019re benefiting from currency movements if you -- the Australian dollar I think is around $0.78 so we\u2019re benefiting from that. We\u2019ve had some ups and downs there but -- and have used some of the contingency in the project but we\u2019re still operating within that same appropriation request.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your question please.","Doug Leggate","John, you've done a -- you've obviously got a tough job of trying to manage through the cycle and if you look at the near-term growth I think you've been pretty clear that that is pretty much prefunded with the commitments you've got going on. But once you get to 2017, once you've delivered your target, assuming an oil price range which is lower than we have had in the last five years, how do you think about the trade-off between continued growth versus other uses of cash like a return to buybacks? And what's on my mind is over the last 10 years before the growth phase, the share prices did just fine in a relatively flat production profile over that 10-year period? So that's my first question. I've got a related follow-up, please.","John Watson","Well, I guess I\u2019d say volume has always been an outcome of our views about the quality of the investments that we available to us and that will continue to govern our decisions. If we wind up in a lower price environment in 2017 that we might have thought we would be in a year ago I think there will be contributing factors to that, one will be costs. And so, we don\u2019t make decisions to invest based on our volume target, we make decisions to invest based on our perception of the value that's available to us. There were confluents of events that resulted in several significant projects coming together at the same time. We had lease retention issues we had good gas contracts available to us for example on Wheatstone. We've had a moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico which is good things. And so -- and you had lease commitments and things of that sort, so you would not only choose to have all those projects be together, but we've felt individually they were good and we felt we had the capacity to handle them. And we're starting to see them deliver today and frankly if you look at our -- for all the talk about these projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone are 30 year to 40 year projects, and didn\u2019t come online yet.","And when they come online and over the cycle, I'm very comfortable that the economics will be just fine and they'll be prolific contributors to the Company for years to come. And all these new projects also have follow-on opportunities to them, because we typically -- first phases of projects don\u2019t result in all the resource being developed and the incremental economics are better. Our priority around spend has been pretty clear. One, we're going to pay the dividend and we're going to increase it as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit. And we'll invest to do that. And we'll do that within the parameters of our balance sheet. We have viewed share repurchases at the Flywheel and the Flywheel is -- was available to us. We have cautiously spread out share repurchases over time, so we've tried not to just be in for a short period of time, we were in for a longer period of time. But obviously with the price environment we're seeing, we're discontinuing that program. But if we get to a circumstance where we're generating cash flow, we don\u2019t see the opportunities we get no reticence at all to repurchase shares if we think that's a better opportunity for us.","Doug Leggate","My follow-up, and I will be quick I realize we are at the top of the hour, but it's kind of more of a macro question. It's going to be a tough one to answer. But when we think about Chevron's role as a global player, 1.9 million barrels a day of oil and the operated obviously is a lot bigger than that, do you think that Chevron has been representative of big oil and non-OPEC, meets a certain oil price environment to maintain flat production, what would that number be for Chevron? In other words to hold production flat close to the start-up of the major projects, can you hold flat at 50 or 60 or 70? What do you think that number is now? I will leave it there.","John Watson","Well Doug you're right it is a tough question. If we're in a $50 world, there will not be -- just as I said at a macro level around the world I don\u2019t see many investments that are going to go with the fiscal terms we see in place today with the cost levels we see today. I see very few major oil projects going forward. There will be incremental investments on existing projects to mitigate the decline there will be some shale investments that maybe economic, but I don\u2019t know for example around the world of full cycle of economics deepwater projects that go at $50 at the current cost structure. I don\u2019t know of new oil sands volumes that can come on at $50 and there are oil fields in decline everywhere so I just don\u2019t see that.","Now cost can adjust, fiscal terms can adjust and so it's hard to speak definitively for a very long period of time, but it is very clear that the incremental barrels are coming from more complex developments overtime. With all the enthusiasm around shale I think it's important to remember it's 4 million barrels a day out of a 92 million barrel base. And you're going to see the rate of growth in that volume was due to slow and you're going to see a reduction in that rate of growth in response to current prices.","I think we're at the end of our time I thank you very much for the questions. That -- and in closing we\u2019d just say we appreciate everyone's participation. I especially want to thank the analysts on behalf of all participants. We look forward to seeing you at our March Security Analyst Meeting, so Jonathan thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And thank you ladies gentlemen.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead.","Mike Wirth","Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations.","We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Moving to Slide 3. This is a score card outlining performance against our 2017 commitments. We had a good year and accomplished what we set out to do. We met our objectives to get cash balanced. In fact, we were cash balanced without relying on proceeds from asset sales. We stayed below budget on capital spending and continued our downward trend in operating expenses.","We\u2019d renew high margin production consistent with our guidance. We realized value from asset sales, with proceeds of more than $8 billion over two years, above the mid-point of the target range and we ended the year within the debt range we predicted. 2017 was a very successful year. We are proud of our progress and we intend to build on this momentum in 2018.","Moving to Slide 4, as you can see from the bar chart, 2017 cash flow including asset sales and before dividends grew more than $17 billion from 2016. Some of this growth was a result of rising prices and some was from an increase in asset sale proceeds, but the majority was due to specific actions we took to improve cash generation from our operations. And the result, we were a cash flow positive without asset sales in 2017, a full year earlier than our commitment, with a little help from prices. And we enter 2018 with strong momentum.","We know who owns our stock and what they expect. Our number one financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend when we can sustainably support the increase with cash flow and earnings. That\u2019s why earlier this week we announced a dividend increase of $0.04 per share, putting us on track to make 2018 the 31st consecutive year of increased annual per share dividend payout.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat, who will take you through the financial results. Pat?","Pat Yarrington","Alright, thank you Mike. Starting with Slide 5, an overview of our financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings were $3.1 billion or $1.64 per diluted share, while 2017 full-year earnings were $9.2 billion. In the quarter, we had two special items. We recorded a non-cash provisional gain of $2 billion related to U.S. tax reform. We also recognized a non-cash remediation charge of $190 million associated with the former mining assets.","Foreign exchange losses for the quarter were $96 million. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange impacts, earnings for the quarter totaled $1.4 billion or $0.72 per share. For the full-year, earnings on the same basis totaled $7 billion.","Full-year cash flow from operations was $20.5 billion. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $6.2 billion, reflecting strong upstream production and higher realizations. Downstream results were noticeably lower than in the third quarter and I\u2019ll say more on that in just a moment. Excluding the $2 billion differed tax provision I just mentioned, the three items we have called out all year as headwinds to cash flow meaning changes in working capital, affiliate dividends less then earnings, and deferred taxes aggregated to around $3 billion for the year.","For the quarter, these components represented a tailwind of approximately $350 million, in large part because of working capital effects. In the quarter, we had a noticeable increase in international income taxes payable. For the full-year, working capital was a minor benefit. Return on capital employed for 2017 was 5%. Our debt ratio at year-end was 21% and our net debt ratio was approximately 18%.","During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. You\u2019re already aware that we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.12 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of February 16. We currently yield 3.6%.","Now on Slide 6. Slide 6 compares full-year 2017 earnings with 2016. Full-year 2017 earnings were approximately $9.7 billion higher than 2016 results. Special items, primarily U.S. tax reform gain of $2 billion lower impairments and other charges of $1.9 billion, and increased gains from asset sales of $1 billion benefited our earnings by $4.9 billion. A swing in foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings between periods by $504 million.","The passage of tax reform legislation in late December required that we revalue our net deferred tax liability to reflect the new lower 21% tax rate. Earnings impact from this adjustment are evident in all three of our were reporting segments, and again, I will refer you to the appendix for the detailed segmented information.","Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by about 5.1 billion between periods. Higher realizations, increased volumes, and lower costs were partially offset by higher DD&A, which was mostly associated with increased production. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by just under 400 million. Higher margins were partially offset by lower volumes and lower earnings from CPChem, mainly due to the impacts of Hurricane Harvey.","Full-year 2017 other segment results were in line with our guidance. Our 2018 guidance for the other segment is $2.4 billion in net charges. This includes approximately $600 million of interest expense that was previously capitalized and $300 million worth of incremental tax effects as net charges are deducted at the lower rate post U.S. tax reform. As a reminder, our quarterly results in this segment are non-ratable.","Turning to Slide 7. We are aware of the challenges of modelling and integrated company like Chevron, and in particular modelling downstream results in the quarter were oil prices grows as fast as they did. I therefore like to provide some additional commentary. Our downstream margins were squeezed by rising feedstock costs. We estimate this adverse margin effect between third quarter and fourth quarter to be about 500 million across our operations, but specifically on the West Coast where we have two or our three main U.S. refineries.","Industry refinery utilization in PADD 5 was very strong during the second half of the quarter, leading to abundant supplies and putting even greater pressure on margins. We also experienced adverse impacts from two hurricanes. We estimate a further $119 million penalty from these, relative to the third quarter. I\u2019m referencing both Hurricane Nate at the Pascagoula, where a precautionary shutdown was taken; and Hurricane Harvey, which flooded CPChem\u2019s Cedar Bayou plant.","While the hurricanes were known to have hit our facilities, sizing the financial impact would have been difficult. I\u2019d note that these fourth quarter impacts are not structural, they are transitory and we believe the fundamentals around demand, supply, production, prices and margins for refined products and chemicals are positive for 2018. The other segment for the quarter was a sizeable negative, but the full-year charges were aligned with the guidance I gave third quarter call.","And lastly, but very importantly, we had very solid results in upstream in the quarter. Our strong operating performance was complemented by rising prices and both favorable elements are expected to continue in 2018. As you know, our earnings and cash flows are highly leveraged to crude prices and this leverage is expected to grow as our production grows in 2018.","Turning now to Slide 8. Slide 8 illustrates 2017 production is of 2.73 million barrels a day, an increase of 134,000 barrels a day or 5%, up from 2016. Major capital projects increased production by 240,000 barrels a day, as we started and ramped up multiple projects, including Gorgon and Angola LNG. Lower plant turnaround effects, primarily at Tengiz, favorably impacted production between periods by 34,000 barrels a day. Shale and tight production increased 46,000 barrels a day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian. ","Base declines, net of production from new wells such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria were 45,000 barrels a day. PSC effects reduced production by 68,000 barrels a day, as rising prices and lower spend reduced cost recovery barrels. The impact of asset sales, mainly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and mid-continent reduced production by 66,000 barrels a day.","I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mike.","Mike Wirth","Alright, thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 9, reserve replacement is a real success story. As this chart shows, over the last five years we\u2019ve added about 400 million more barrels than we produced and divested. Our reserve replacement ratio was 155% in 2017, and 107% over the last five years. We\u2019re especially pleased with this outcome because it was achieved on top of growing production last year.","Our reserves to production ratio stands at a healthy 11.7 demonstrating the strength and sustainability of our business. In 2017, the Permian was the largest contributor to reserve additions, where we continue to lower our cost structure, focus our investment, and develop our resources in a capital efficient manner. As we continue to ramp up our rig fleet, we\u2019re confident this pattern should continue. We also saw significant adds elsewhere across the portfolio, including from the Gorgon Project where well performance has been encouraging.","Moving to Slide 10. This chart shows the continued progress we\u2019ve made on spend reduction. As you can see, capital on operating expenses were down again this year. 2017 C&E spending was $18.8 billion, down $3.6 million from the prior year, and more than $21 billion from three years earlier.","2017 full year operating costs were more than $1 billion lower than 2016, despite higher upstream production. When compared to 2014, we\u2019re down by nearly $6 billion. I expect this to maintain capital and cost discipline. We\u2019re improving work processes, negotiating better rates from contractors and vendors, and becoming more efficient in all that we do. And technology offers opportunities for even more. We are in a cyclical commodity business. Capital discipline always matters. Costs, always matter.","Now to Slide 11, and asset sales. This chart shows asset sale proceeds of $8 billion over the last two years, with 5.2 billion coming in 2017. The two-year total is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $5 billion to $10 billion. Moving forward, we will continue to optimize our portfolio where appropriate, using proceeds to support strong asset and shareholder returns.","The criteria for divestments is straightforward. We will plan to sell assets that don't have a strategic fit or won\u2019t compete for capital and work more to someone else, and when we can receive good value. We don't discuss specific assets until we\u2019re into a transaction. We have one of these underway. The sale of our Southern Africa refining and marketing business, which is expected to close in 2018.","Moving to Slide 12, our Australian LNG assets are becoming strong cash generators with cash margins of more than $30 per barrel at $50 Brent price. Currently, four trains are online and running well. Well performance for both projects looks good. During the fourth quarter, we completed pit stops on Gorgon Train 1 and Train 3 to improve reliability and increase production.","Gorgon's average January production was 459,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 86,000 barrels from the fourth quarter average on a 100% basis. During 2017, Gorgon shipped 170 cargoes. At Wheatstone, during the fourth quarter, we started Train 1, reached design capacity, and successfully address the commissioning strainers, which is a standard part of commissioning this type of LNG plant design.","Wheatstone Train 1 average January production was 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a 100% basis. First LNG for Wheatstone Train 2 is slated for second-quarter 2018. We start-up for Wheatstone domestic gas the following quarter.","Now, let\u2019s go to the Permian on Slide 13. Production in the Permian continues to exceed expectations as we drive further efficiency gains and improved well performance. In the fourth quarter, we produced approximately 205,000 barrels per day, up approximately 60,000 barrels per day from the same period in 2016. Full-year 2017 production averaged 181,000 barrels per day, up 35% over the prior year.","We\u2019re currently operating 16 rigs in the basin and plan to end this year with 20 company operated rigs. And in support of our development program, we\u2019re currently employing six pressure pumping crews. I\u2019ll update you on progress to optimize our land position in the Permian on Slide 14. In 2017, we enhanced the value of our position by transacting more than 60,000 acres through various swaps, joint ventures farmouts and sales.","These transactions improve capital efficiency and create value by consolidating land positions, allowing longer laterals and other infrastructure efficiencies. Last year's transactions enabled nearly 600 additional long laterals to be added to our well inventory. We intend to continue this activity to consolidate our land positions and optimize the value of our future developments. We\u2019ll provide further information on the Permian at our Analyst Day in early March.","Now, let\u2019s move to the overall production outlook on Slide 15. For this year, production at $16 Brent is expected to be 4% to 7% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2018 asset sales. Growth is expected to be driven by LNG in Australia, Shale and tight particularly in the U.S. and Canada, and other capital projects.","Partially offsetting that will be full year impacts of 2017 asset sales and base decline. The forecasted production range reflects the uncertainties associated with start-up timing, rates of production project ramp up, base decline and external events. In summary, we anticipate another year of strong production growth.","Moving to Slide 16, we\u2019ve had a number of recent developments that I\u2019d like to acknowledge. Earlier this week, we announced a major discovery in the U.S. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico at Ballymore. This discovery has 670 feet of net oil pay with excellent reservoir year and fluid characteristics. And importantly, it\u2019s close to our existing Blind Faith platform. We\u2019re currently drilling a sidetrack well to further evaluate the extent of the resource.","Also, this week, we confirmed a major discovery at the Whale prospect in the US Gulf of Mexico where we\u2019re 40% partner. This find is approximately 10 miles from the Perdido platform. These discoveries are exciting for both their resource potential and their proximity to existing infrastructure, which offers the possibility for faster and more capital efficient development.","Also, this week, we along with our partners were successful bidders on a large Deepwater block in Mexico, adding to our position there. An installation is underway at Bigfoot. We\u2019re installed seven of the 16 mooring tendons. On Tuesday, the tension-leg platform sale from the dry dock facility in Ingleside, Texas. First production is forecast for late this year. In downstream, CPChem reached mechanical completion of the Gulf Coast cracker in December and has begun the process of commissioning.","We expect to start up later this quarter and reach full production in the second quarter of 2018. You'll recall that the derivative units achieved first production in September of last year. Finally, on tax reform, we believe the new legislation is good for business, and for consumers. It is a positive for Chevron making attractive investment opportunities in the Permian, the Gulf of Mexico, and in our US downstream and chemicals business look even better. Our US capital and exploratory spend is expected to be up approximately $8 billion this year, and some $25 billion over the next three years.","Moving to Slide 17, I would like to share a few closing thoughts. Over the last decade plus, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to get to know many of you. I\u2019ve been listening and your input has been helpful as I move into my new role. I\u2019m guided by my background, experience and a few core beliefs. I grew up playing sports and I like to win. I intend to lead Chevron to win in any environment. To win, you need to have clear convictions. Here are some of mine.","We must be disciplined in returns driven in capital allocation. Our cost structure needs to improve further. Costs, always matter. We can get more out of the assets that we have as we can operate them better and more reliably. We can optimize across the entire value chain to capture more value. And we need to continue to high-grade our portfolio and our resource base. To build the assets to win today and tomorrow, not yesterday.","For those of you I know, I look forward to seeing you more in the coming months and years. For those of you I don't, I look forward to meeting you. I\u2019m committed to continuing to grow cash flow, improve, returns, and deliver value to our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions. Jonathan, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question, please? ","Phil Gresh","Hi, good morning and congratulations Mike.","Mike Wirth","Thank you.","Phil Gresh","I\u2019ll start with, I have one for Pat and one for Mike. So, Pat, you talked about these moving pieces around CFO items, these transitory factors that have been going on throughout 2017, and I was just curious how you think about 2018 with those factors, the deferred tax, working capital, equity affiliates, you know does that continue to be a headwind, does it dissipate in anyway?","Pat Yarrington","So, I think the short answer would be, to a large extent there will be some continuing factors. The largest single component there would be the difference that we would expect between affiliate earnings and affiliate dividends. That will continue to be a component there. The harder one to predict, clearly will be what\u2019s happening on that deferred tax side of things that will be very price dependent, and then of course working capital is always very hard as well. ","But if I assume that there is no change in working capital, just assume prices at the beginning of the year or the same is at the end of the year, and our activity levels are relatively flattish. So, no impact from working capital and I put the other two components together. So, the affiliate distributions versus earnings component, as well as an estimate around deferred taxes, I would say somewhere on the order of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion worth of headwinds would be the best estimate, but I have to say, I reserve the right at any time to come back and tell you as different number of prices are significantly different than where they are, today.","Phil Gresh","I understand, but I appreciate that. Mike, just on your final remarks that you made, appreciate those and I guess my follow-up to that would be, we saw a nice hike in the dividend, $0.04 and as we think about the cash flow profile for the company heading into 2018 at current price levels, it seems like you have a lot of excess cash, so any initial thoughts you could share with us about how you think about deploying that cash, is there room for buybacks, is prices holding where they are?","Mike Wirth","Well Phil, the first thing I would say is, our priorities have been consistent for quite some time, and I have no expectations that those will change. So, dividends come first and you\u2019ve seen that and I\u2019m pleased that the board saw, has a confident view of our future and was willing to authorize the increase you just saw. Reinvestment in the business, we\u2019ve talked about that, and we\u2019ve got our budget outlined and a good program underway this year. Third is, balance sheet and we\u2019ve gone from having relatively for us higher levels of debt down to a range lower within the range that we\u2019d indicated further and then of course, historically one we\u2019ve had cash surplus to those needs, we have bought back shares.","So, I think we\u2019ll continue to be consistent in those priorities. It\u2019s always a balance across all of those and we really been in a period where we\u2019ve seen three years of declining or unexciting commodity prices, and three months of encouraging ones. I think it\u2019s a little premature to get ahead of sales on this, but the dividend increase was certainly a signal that we feel good about where our business is positioned to the fact that we\u2019re cash balance, and if we continue to be in a constructive environment, obviously we\u2019ll have cash to balance across all of those priorities. So, more to follow.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Thanks Mike.","Frank Mount","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. I think it\u2019s still morning, good morning everybody and Mike congrats on officially taking the reins and getting on the call this morning. I have two questions. I guess one is, kind of a follow-up to Phil\u2019s and it really relates to the strong performance in the Permian. You\u2019ve kind of positioned the Permian, in the past there is something of an offset to base decline, but obviously it\u2019s a pretty strong growth in asset in its own right. Is that how we should think about the Permian as basically a means of resetting your sustaining capital or should we think about something that can actually become a bit more of a topline growth engine for the company?","Mike Wirth","Well, I think if you look at it on its own, it clearly is a growth engine. The nature of the activity is more aligned with what you would traditionally think of our base business, right. It is ongoing drilling of wells that individually carry with on a low risk profile that are relatively quick to execute and it\u2019s the kind of thing that over time you can Flex that up or you can flex it down. ","So, one of the reasons I think it\u2019s been useful for people to think about putting base and Shale and tight together is their operational characteristics, their flexibility, the cycle time, the risk profile. I have more in common than our base business does with the really large major capital projects that we\u2019ve had.","So, I do think you can think of them together. We\u2019ve done a really nice job of mitigating our base decline on its own, and then when you add the Shale and tight with it, the growth there is actually and you can see it on Slide 8, greater than the base decline is. And so, we\u2019ve got low risk, a very predictable flexible and controllable growth offsetting that base decline, and giving us a strong foundation as we move forward that just has a very, very different risk profile than a long cycle major capital project where there is a big bang at the end, but there is a greater latency period. ","So, we will certainly talk more about this in March, but I think it\u2019s one of the fundamental shifts in the outlook for our company. I think it\u2019s a fundamental shift in risk profile, and the variability around our cash flows, and frankly it really underpins a really good story as we move forward.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the full-answer. My follow-up is really harking back to the breakfast you hosted in December, and it really relates to, I think a comment you made about the culture of cost reduction from other parts of the business hadn't really, and not to put words in your mouth, but hadn't translated into E&P. So, during a period of growth, obviously so I\u2019m just curious, are you happy with the cost structure in the E&P business, and the maturity profile of the underlying portfolio, and I guess it is another way of saying, should we expect another rest in the asset sales program as we go forward? And I will leave it there. Thanks.","Mike Wirth","All right. Well there is a couple of things. I think cost culture and the portfolio. The entire industry as commodity prices went into the surge and then stayed strong for a long period of time had incentives to try to capitalize on that, and there is no doubt that the cost structure within the industry grew as a result of that. Most of my working life has been spent in our part of business where those periods of times are in frequent and short in duration, and so I come from a mindset that you always have to be looking at cost and in particular, you need to be very cost conscious at a time when external conditions are incenting you to be less so. ","And so, I think that being focused on efficiency throughout the cycle is one of the keys to success. I tried to make that point in my closing remarks there. Our upstream business has done a fantastic job in getting our cost down, and I\u2019m really pleased with what I\u2019ve seen, and what\u2019s been accomplished, and so there has been great progress I mentioned $6 billion in spend reduction over the last few years. I think going forward, the challenge is, how do we sustain that momentum, and there is an opportunity to continuously focus on this to challenge everything that we do for more efficiency to look for technology, which I think can unlock a lot of cost reduction. ","And then to leverage some of the things we\u2019re learning in our Permian activity, and our shale and tight activity and ask, how does the supplier cross other parts of the business. So, it\u2019s a long answer to saying, yes, I expect us to continue to work on costs, irrespective of the external environment. When I moved to portfolio, I made a comment about focusing on those assets that are the ones that allow us to compete and win today and tomorrow, and I do expect as to invest in those things that we think are the assets that will be a highly competitive as we move into the future, and to test ourselves on the things that may have been really important in our past and may still be or may not be as we go forward. ","So, the last couple of years are as said, transaction activity has been in part at least driven by the intent to get cash balance. As we move forward, it\u2019s driven more by the intent to ensure we\u2019ve got a portfolio that\u2019s highly competitive that deliver strong returns and is set up to compete in the future.","Frank Mount","Thanks Doug.","Doug Leggate","I guess we'll wait on the Analyst Day [ph]. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta, Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Neil Mehta","Hi, thanks and congrats Mike. I actually wanted to follow-up where you left of there on the asset sales program, any early thoughts on 2018? You\u2019ve been through a two-year pretty substantial divestiture program, a fewer things on the docket it seems like in 2018, so how should we think about what the new normal is for our divestitures?","Mike Wirth","Yes, Neil, I think you should expect us to continue to monetize assets where we can get fair value and they\u2019re worth more to someone else than they are to us. And we have gone through a lot. You\u2019ve seen those close. The Gulf of Mexico Shelf exit was one where those assets have some running life ahead of them. Within our portfolio, they\u2019ll struggle to compete for capital in somebody else's portfolio, they\u2019ll draw capital in investments and continue to create value for that company. And so, we probably have other assets that would, could fit that profile. ","So, I think when we get to our Analyst Day in March, we\u2019ll probably speak to this a little bit more, but my view is, you can't fall in love with your portfolio, you have to constantly challenge whether or not it will compete in the future, and you have to be willing to make moves to invest in the things that you believe are highly competitive, and be willing to face the realities and things that you are less likely to fund and that you may be able to redeploy that cash into assets that strengthen your competitive position. So, more of an optimization philosophy. It is what we have done in other parts of the business and it served us very well, and we will talk to you more about that as we have things that are ready to be discussed, publicly.","Neil Mehta","I appreciate that Mike and then, in the slides the 4 to 7% production growth in 2018, I think is generally well received, is still relatively wide range relative to the base of production that you have, can you talk about some of those uncertainties that could drive you to the upper end or the lower end of the range?","Mike Wirth","Yes. So, I realize there is a bit of a range there. What we\u2019ve done is try to reflect the realities that project start-ups are things that we have got plans, and then you work hard to deliver those, but there can be some variability in start-ups and then you\u2019ve got to ramp ups as well. And so, and I guess the final thing that I would say is, you do have unexpected events that can get you. We\u2019ve experienced sabotage, you know the partition zone is still down and that was not something that was necessarily anticipated. ","We work in parts of the world that have challenging environments and things happen. So, there is a range there, clearly, we\u2019re working to deliver strong growth and we\u2019d expect to be within that range. Over the years, we have ended up on Mr. Sankey's Porcupine Chart, I think, when we've gotten out of our skis a little bit. So, I try to be sure that we can give you a range that we\u2019re confident, and in this year, we gave you a range that was little wider may be than you would have liked, but we landed squarely in the middle of that. And so, we're just trying to reflect the realities that these things are, you know they\u2019re not precisely forecastable, but we\u2019re trying to show you that we\u2019ve got a strong commitment to deliver good production growth again this year.","Frank Mount","Thanks, Neil.","Neil Mehta","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.","Paul Sankey","Well thanks for that Mike. And I guess I know what I'm going to be publishing on Sunday as a chart, but firstly congratulations and I would like to second previous comments that we do greatly appreciate that you guys take the time to come on the quarterly call every quarter. So, thanks for that.","Mike Wirth","You're welcome.","Paul Sankey","Mike, having said all that, there is a theme of the day which is cash flows that you guys are generating and you did mention cash flow breakeven balance, and when we look at oil at 60 for the quarter-ish, I guess we're totally perplexed by why cash flows, and you\u2019ve given an ex-working capital number, why cash flows are so low given the move in oil? Could you talk about where that\u2019s going to go next year, and whether, if oil prices were to persist, what we would expect to see for cash flows versus CapEx from the company? Thank you.","Mike Wirth","Yes, so Pat has given you given you some of the pieces, and if she wants to try to go a little deeper, I\u2019ll invite her too in a second. I have got to tell you Paul, I\u2019m very pleased and optimistic with the outlook for cash flow. You know, our cash flow from operations improved every quarter during 2017. I sighted a few of the things that are already evident this year, which is significantly stronger production in January at Gorgon, significantly stronger production already this year at Wheatstone.","Significantly stronger production in the Permian, in a price environment that you\u2019ve just described. The downstream issues that we faced in the fourth quarter are not structural. They are not repeating, hurricanes happen, but they tend not to hit the same places every year, and margins in the business can ebb and flow. We don't have structural issues in the downstream at all. Our downstream has been a strong contributor of our earnings returns and cash flow for many, many years.","So, I used the word momentum a couple of times in my remarks, and we in fact do have momentum in cash flow. So, we have got growing production. The production we're bringing in line is cash flow accretive. You know, I mentioned that our LNG out of Australia is $30 cash margin at a $50 Brent price. Obviously, we\u2019re above that today. So, all the fundamental drivers of cash flow are moving in the right direction. There is a few are headwinds, which Pat touched on, but the fundamentals here are very strong and those are what I am focused on. So, I feel good about 2018.","Paul Sankey","Yes, Mike, just quickly to follow up, could you just reiterate the 2018 balance aspirations, I think they were excess of sales for cash flow versus CapEx?","Mike Wirth","Yes, we said, we would be cash balance in 2018 without asset sales at $50 Brent. Clearly, if we have a year that is above $50 Brent, we will be better than cash balance without asset sales. And you also mentioned capital in there Paul, so let me just touch on that. You know, we\u2019ve got a capital budget and that capital budget is driven by a program that will deliver the results I just spoke to.","We don\u2019t budget based on the oil price of the day. We have got a longer-term view on commodity prices and we set our plans based on those views not the then current oil price. So, the fact that we\u2019re enjoying a little bit better commodity price environment as we sit here today is not something that is going to change our capital plans or our capital budget.","Frank Mount","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please. ","Jason Gammel","Hi, everyone and Mike let me add my congratulations as well. ","Mike Wirth","Thanks Jason.","Jason Gammel","I just want to go to the chart on, excuse me the graph on chart 13 that depicts the Permian production, and the actual production is clearly way ahead of the type curves that you got laid out, and that\u2019s for 16 rigs, and conscious you're going to be going to 20. So, other than Bruce Niemeyer getting a well-deserved promotion, I was hoping that you might be able to come up with some of the factors that have led to this outperformance, and realize that you are not going to necessarily change the curves and tell at least March?","Mike Wirth","Well, what I would say is, it has just been a focus on the fundamentals. We\u2019ve used technology to do better assessment of seismic attributes and better understand the resource. Our petrophysical modeling continues to improve. We are using new technologies to control drill bits and improve the precision of our lateral placement. There is a new basis of design where we change well spacing, optimize our sand concentration per stage, we have increased the number of stages.","We have got tighter perforation. There is a continual optimization process in place and I would just tell you same thing that Bruce and others have reiterated is, we not only learn from what we are doing, but we are brining the learnings from joint venture partners and others that we see and rapidly applying those to improve performance. ","So, our costs are going down. Our productivity is going up. Our recoveries continue to grow and I don't think we\u2019ve seen the end of the improvement curve here. We\u2019re finding more efficiencies, our development costs this year are lower than our target was. Our target for, or last year they were, our target for 2018 is lower than it was in 2017, and so we expect to see continual improvement. For those of you that visited the Permian last year, I think you heard our people describe what they call the Frankenwell, the perfect well where we continue to redefine what that looks like, and redefine what goods looks like.","So, this is a story that when you match it up with our large land position, which we\u2019re optimizing. I talked about that and building a deeper inventory of long lateral and highly efficient acreage for us to get after the ability through the midstream and downstream to add value and create more margin. And on top of that you put a royalty position. This is an asset that I expect to continue to get better. We will talk about that more when we see in March and we will update some of the guidance that we\u2019ve given you on what to expect.","Jason Gammel","We'll look forward to that and as my second question Mike, just looking at the capital allocation for 2018 to the base upstream business relative to 2017, and this excludes the shale and tight allocations. Base business allocation is down by about 25% year-over-year. It doesn't look like your assumptions on the base decline curve have really changed, however. So, could you talk about some of the factors that you\u2019re seeing in the base business that is leading to the lower capital allocation with a similar expected result?","Mike Wirth","Yes, you\u2019re right. We do have lower capital going into the base business this year. Some of that is simply driven by what the opportunity set looks like there, and what the opportunity set looks like in the Permian. We\u2019ve, like I said, we\u2019ve done a really nice job across a lot of our producing assets in holding base decline at pretty flattish levels. And so, the efficiencies that I have talked about in the Permian are the kinds of things that we\u2019re seeing across the entire base business.","We\u2019ve taken cost out of the supply chain. We\u2019ve improved the efficiency and productivity of operations and at times some of the things in the base can be deepwater infield drilling, which tends to be a little bit bigger dollar. And so, as those programs ebb and flow that can cycle that base business a little bit as well, but we\u2019re in a range here as you look it, it says we can keep our base pretty flat at relatively manageable capital spend.","You put the Permian on top of that and you look at just a combination of those two elements and you say okay, we have a base load of capital that can hold our production flat or even slightly growing base load of capital that can keep production flatter. So, I think it is a relatively modest capital relative to the size of our company, and so we\u2019ll talk more about the sustainability and what you can expect on that when we see in March.","Frank Mount","Thank you, Jason.","Jason Gammel","Great, looking forward it. Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Cheng","Hi guys, good morning.","Mike Wirth","Hi, Paul.","Pat Yarrington","Hi, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Hi. Mike, may I add my congratulations to you. And also, I just want to echo what Sankey has said, really appreciate. You guys come on to the call from time to time. I hope that at least one of your other major competitors will do the same. Two questions. First, Mike, in the coming months, I will assume you are going to go and visit all your internal people around the group. During those visits, what is the number one and number two message that you want to send to them in terms of where you think you may need to do more effort in twisting [ph], whether it's in certain practice or culture? And where you want to sharpen the focus.","Mike Wirth","Well, thanks Paul for the kind words and the question. I do intend to get out and about and see people and deliver some messages. I mean the first one is, it has been a rough few years for people in, particularly in our upstream business and we have weathered that storm and so the message is, simply thank you for what you have done to put us in a position now, where we\u2019re cash positive going forward. ","With that asset sales we\u2019ve taken a lot of cost out of the business and they\u2019ve worked hard to do that. I\u2019ve touched on a couple of things already. One is, we have to be prepared to win in any environment. And I think that\u2019s particularly important as you start to see a little recovery in oil price that we not think that the hard work is over. We\u2019ve got to focus on returns. We still have returns that need to improve. And we can't count on market to do that. ","So, we\u2019ve got to keep focusing on self-help and that means we find efficiencies and everything we do. We challenge our portfolio, and some of the things I\u2019ve talked about. So, there is a - we\u2019ve got to win in any environment. We\u2019ve got to improve returns. I think, some of the areas that are focused on the things that really matter, and big companies can some time try to do everything, and there is few things we can focus on that will really drive performance. We need to execute, and that means capital projects. We need to execute on cost management. ","We need to execute on our safety and reliability initiatives. And then, the third one is, how do we bring more technology into our business? You look around and technology is changing the world. We\u2019ve got lots and lots of digital technology applications that are springing up all over our business. I\u2019d like to see that happen faster. I think there is more that we can do with technology. ","I think it can drive further efficiencies in our cost structure. I think it can drive further productivity in our assets. I think it can help us mitigate operating risks. And, so I talked to them about how do we continue to find ways to leverage technology to further improve performance. So those will be some of the key messages that they\u2019ll be hearing from me.","Paul Cheng","Okay. The second question is that, on the U.S. onshore market clearly on the [indiscernible] basis, we are seeing cost inflation. Just want to see whether you believe your productivity gain will be more than - or that could be fully offset and so your unit costs will be essentially flat? And in the outside U.S., I think the service cost, doesn't seem like on the spot rate is dropping. But should we assume that your overall unit cost may still be dropping because you have other contracts maybe rolling over? ","Mike Wirth","Yes. Paul, you are touching on important points. That\u2019s one of the questions a lot of people are asking, as are we going to see cost inflation. I will tell you right now as we go around the world and we engage in sourcing exercises, we are not seeing evidence of strong cost inflation really anywhere. Now, you mentioned the Permian. I\u2019ll come back and talk the Permian in a minute, but we really are continuing to find opportunities to hold or even improve costs as we look around the world.","In the Permian, there is more activity picking up, and so you can expect that there is talk of that, you know two-thirds of our spend in the Permian is protected with contracts right now. Those contracts have been negotiated before we went into this year. We\u2019ve got kind of a philosophy of managed competition there to lock in and with our size and leverage we\u2019re in an attractive base load for a number of these suppliers. So, we\u2019ve locked in a good pricing fixed index, fixed pricing in much of the portfolio. Some indexed pricing. So, if there are certain indices that moved, we will accommodate that and then there are incentive contracts where you have some of our service providers can meet performance benchmarks that drive our costs lower there is some sharing of that as well. ","So, we\u2019re focused on ways to continue to improve our cost position there and the efficiencies in activity and productivity that we\u2019ve seen in recent times have amplified reductions in input costs. If you start to see input costs level out or even turn a little bit, I still expect further improvements in productivity and efficiency will offset that. So, we could see some very modest, but I\u2019m talking single-digit, overall increase within the Permian, but a step back to our whole portfolio we\u2019ve got growing production, and we are not going to allow cost to grow at the rate that production is growing, and so from my unit cost standpoint, you can absolutely expect that we're still focused on driving unit costs even lower.","Frank Mount","Thanks Paul.","Paul Cheng","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please.","Alastair Syme","Thank you and hello, everyone. Mike, one of your peers has recently suggested that SEC reserves are becoming a less meaningful metric for the industry. And obviously, this is a metric that Chevron has scored very highly on in recent years. So, can I get you to offer your perspective on how you look - as you look closer into the E&P business, how you view reserve life as a management KPI? And whether you think there is an optimal reserve life for the business to be running?","Mike Wirth","Yes. So, we respect the SEC's roles and their reserve process. We are very diligent in setting up our own internal approach to reserves to be sure that we have the right checks and balances, and so we - I\u2019m not going to suggest the SEC regressive rules or anything with something that we understand, comply with and they are, I think a consistent benchmark for investors to use to evaluate companies. And so, like many things, you can argue are they perfect or not, but it is a consistent benchmark and we all use it. So, I think it\u2019s useful. I believe stability and reserve life is good. ","If you see reserve life growing it\u2019s either a sign that your production is declining, or that you are investing prematurely or too much. If you see the reserve where reserve life is declining, it starts to raise questions about sustainability about the need to go out, and spend money to acquire resource and so to me stability is the key. We\u2019ve had a good stable R-over-P ratio here for the last many years and continue to add our reserves, primarily through organic activity.","I talked about the reserve ads this year being driven by the Permian and Gorgon. Those are big contributors, and those are certainly contributors that we can see out into the future. We would expect to play a part in extending reserves life as we go forward. So, I think each company has got their own particular set of circumstances, and I\u2019ll only comment on ours. I think we\u2019re in a good strong and sustainable reserves position.","Alastair Syme","Brilliant. Thank you. That's very, very helpful.","Frank Mount","Thanks Al.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question, please.","Blake Fernandez","First, good morning, and my congratulations as well. Back, I guess, right on that reserves topic. Maybe Pat, this is a question for you, but given the nice increase that you saw this year, is it fair to think that DD&A rates have potential to move lower as a result of that?","Pat Yarrington","Yes. I do believe that. I don\u2019t have an order of magnitude for you at the moment because we are just finalizing that. You\u2019ll note that the numbers we\u2019ve put out are preliminary and we\u2019re tying that now between now and when we publish the 10-K later in February. But yes, I do directionally that will happen. We will have lower DD&A rates.","Blake Fernandez","Perfect. The second question is on the, I guess recent discoveries you\u2019ve had, both look pretty attractive and then look like they have fast track potential. Given this focus on short cycle, the past 12 to 18 months or so, obviously, you haven't sanctioned many projects, but these look promising. I guess I'm just trying to understand the timing of when you could look at sanctioning that and how that would fall into the capital program. And I guess what I'm thinking there specifically is phasing with Tengiz. As Tengiz rolls off, could these kind of make their way in and hopefully not create a step-change in total spending?","Mike Wirth","Yes. We\u2019re really still appraising these discoveries, and they\u2019re encouraging and we\u2019re very pleased with the first look and the proximity to infrastructure, but I think it\u2019s really premature to jump into exactly when and how those would be developed, other than the proximity the infrastructure does open up more capital efficient developments alternatives and you would see if you were distant from, but more work to be done to be sure that these have been fully characterized.","I think to get above that a little bit, I would just say that we really believed in a more ratable C&E program is important. I think it helps us financially. I think it helps us from our standpoint of execution. And so, I think that the swings you\u2019ve seen in our C&E spend are things that we will try to significantly dampen out and stay in a more ratable band. The last thing I would say is, no matter how good this resource looks, and how interesting it is, we\u2019ve got a great option in our shale and tight portfolio and other resource classes and Gulf of Mexico deepwater is a great example of that.","Need to get the cost down in order to compete for funding. Our people know that that\u2019s what they need to do to make these competitive within our portfolio for funding, and that\u2019s why I think the brownfield aspect of these is interesting, but they have to compete and they have to deliver attractive returns and economics relative to our other alternatives.","Frank Mount","Thanks Blake.","Blake Fernandez","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. Maybe another one on capital allocation. Post the tax reform, does the tax reform in the U.S. impact the way that you think about investment at all over the next five years, either from - in terms of an increase in cash flow or from an improved rate of return from associated or particular projects? Or should we think that you will generally continue to err on the side of capital constraint? I guess how - does it figure at all in terms of how you look at allocating capital over the next five years?","Mike Wirth","Yes, we\u2019re still grinding through the real details of our specific position and these are - companies like ours have complex tax positions and so to get too specific about that, it\u2019s probably premature. I would say that it makes U.S. assets and investments more attractive because they are going to be attracting a lower tax rate. And so, I think over time, as I said earlier, I think it\u2019s good for the U.S. economy. I think it\u2019s good for U.S. companies. I think it\u2019s good for investment in this country, and we have significant assets here already and opportunities to invest in the future.","So, we will grind through all of that and make sure that we get a clear understanding and guidance. The other thing if you think about it through the lens is, you know as we have assets around the world, some in fiscal regimes that have not changed for quite some time whether it\u2019s in response to lower prices or the changes in the US tax laws, those investments become tougher to make, frankly.","And so, I think, the other thing is governments around the world will over time have to evaluate the competitiveness of their fiscal terms relative to the options that a company like ours would have. We allocate our capital to drive better returns across the global portfolio, and so as these things move around it\u2019s a competitive world and we need to acknowledge that as do others.","Frank Mount","Thanks Ryan.","Ryan Todd","And then maybe a follow-up on the Permian. You've been relatively active and you have a slide in there on acreage sales that you've done over the past few years and expectations for 2018. If you think about the program, I mean, would you characterize it as more of an effort to core up your position? Or is it an effort to pull forward to some extent kind of the long-term tail of the valuation, a mix of both? And I guess kind of given your expectation of going to 20 rigs at year-end, you clearly have a very, very, very long resource life there. How should we think about your philosophy in terms of maximizing the value of the asset? Could you monetize more in terms of monetizing some of the tail or accelerating rig count? I mean, how do you look at maximization of the value of that resource?","Mike Wirth","It\u2019s a good question. The real goal is to maximize the value of the resource position and the largest driver by a significant amount is coring up acreage, so that we can get longer laterals in the efficiencies that we continue to see out of our operations. I mentioned, we understand the resource much better today than we did 12-months ago, and our 24-months ago, and I think we will understand the resource better 12-months from now, as we continue to use more and more sophisticated tools and gain more experience and insights into what makes it work. ","So, as you have that kind of knowledge and you\u2019ve got a large land position we would intend to drive our portfolio to what we believe are the sweetest of the sweet spots and the positions that will create the most value over time. If that means some of it is, what you would describe as further back in the queue, and the right thing to do is simply to exit it for cash and redeploying into coring up today, that is certainly a part of it. But it\u2019s a value driven strategy and it\u2019s to say, okay we\u2019ve, how do we get the most value out of the 2 million acres that we have there. So, it is not driven by any intent to sell the tail alone, but it is really to create value across the whole position.","Frank Mount","Thank you, Ryan.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question\u2026","Pat Yarrington","One more question, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Roger Read","Thanks for sneaking me in here at the end. Good morning, everybody. Mike, if I could follow up a little bit on Ryan's question, you kind of talked about the Permian position there, is it easier, the same, or more difficult to do the swaps and exchanges? In other words, as everyone gets more comfortable with what they own, or are we seeing it where people are less certain what they own and it is slowing down some of the exchanges? I know you had kind of a 200,000 acre, 80,000 done so far. I'm just curious how that's progressing.","Mike Wirth","Yes, what I would say Roger is, it is one of those unique places where you can drive win wins and because the way the acreage was defined over a 100 years ago and the way it has been held over time, and the technology today with these longer laterals and the value creation through that kind of a development program, it\u2019s in everybody's best interest to find ways to improve their position, and oftentimes in commercial negotiations we\u2019ve got a win lose and that can create a tougher dynamic than one where both parties can realize value. And you sit down at the table and both really have incentives to find a way to do a deal.","So, I would say, we may in fact have been a little more difficult to deal with, heretofore simply because of our, let\u2019s go slow to really understand what we\u2019ve got approach to this. And whether you're talking development or you are talking land optimization, there is a lot of activity going on in the basin where we weren't necessarily engaged in as much of it. Now that we are in a position, we feel like we really understand what we want, and where we want to go, and we\u2019re willing to deal. We\u2019ve got numerous conversations underway with counterparties, and I think there is strong reason to believe that we will conclude further value creating transactions this year and into the future.","Roger Read","Okay, great. Thank you, and I\u2019ll see you next month.","Mike Wirth","Okay. I know we\u2019re just a touch over time here. So, I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. I truly appreciate your interest in Chevron, and everyone's participation in the call. I look forward to seeing many of you in New York in a few weeks.

And welcome, everyone, to Chevron's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, you all know our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeanette Ourada, our General Manager of Investor Relations. And we'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.","Before we get started, as usual, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Turning to Slide 3, I want to begin with safety where we always do. In March of last year, I talked with you at some length about Chevron's safety journey, over 100 years of focus and improvements in our systems and processes. I said we work to improve every day. As a result of our efforts, every key measure of safety and environmental performance has improved dramatically over the last decade. In fact, we just had another very good statistical year in safety. We had world-class low industrial injury rates, we had fewer fires, serious auto and other incidents; some very good performance during the year, but we\u2019re nowhere near where we want to be.","In particular, we had drilling-related incidents in recent months in Brazil and Nigeria, sadly with 2 contract employee fatalities in Nigeria. We have full investigations underway and are doing everything we can to learn from these incidents. There is a great deal of information available on our website, and I'll be happy to answer any questions after we complete our prepared remarks.","Our financial performance in 2011 was outstanding. We achieved record earnings and cash flow, underscoring the strength of our portfolio and strategic direction. Underlying these record financial results is our outstanding upstream earnings per barrel. We invest to generate value for our shareholders, and we like high-value barrels. While our peers have not all reported their fourth quarter results, we fully expect to maintain our wide lead on this critical metric.","I'd like to summarize a few additional accomplishments in the upstream business. We sanctioned 3 major projects. We broke ground in December on Wheatstone, our second legacy LNG project in Australia. We also moved forward on Clair Ridge in the U.K. and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Thailand, our Platong II project start up and ramped up very quickly. We completed our acquisition of Atlas Energy and supplemented it with some additional acreage acquisitions in the Marcellus.","We continued our string of exploration successes offshore Australia with 4 natural gas discoveries, and we announced the Moccasin oil discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And we achieved 171% reserve replacement driven by the initial booking of about 740 million barrels of oil equivalent from our Wheatstone LNG Project.","Looking at our downstream business, we made great progress in the second year of a 3-year plan to improve returns. The completion of the Pembroke Refinery sale marked a significant milestone in our portfolio rationalization process. We also made a final investment decision and began construction on a premium base oil plant at our Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery, which when completed will position Chevron as the world's leading supplier of premium base oils. We're very proud of our performance this past year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pat, who will take you through our financial results. Pat?","Patricia E. Yarrington","All right. Thanks, John. Slide 4 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter earnings were $5.1 billion, or $2.58 per diluted share. For the year, earnings were a record $27 billion, or $13.44 per diluted share, over 40% higher than in 2010.","Return on capital employed for the year was nearly 22%, and our debt ratio at year end was 7.7%. Of particular note, 2011 marked our 24th consecutive annual dividend increase. We had 2 dividend increases during the year, which resulted in a combined 12.5% rise in the quarterly rate in 2011. This is significant, indicating not only our superior performance and our financial strength, but also our confidence in our future performance. It is also consistent with our priority of rewarding shareholders with sustained and competitive dividend growth.","In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares, bringing the full year share repurchase total to $4.25 billion. In the first quarter of 2012, we expect to repurchase $1.25 billion of our shares.","Finally, Chevron's 2011 total shareholder return was 20%. We hold the #1 TSR position versus our peer group for the 1-, 5- and 10-year periods. We are exceptionally proud of this achievement as it demonstrates our history of making wise portfolio investment decisions and executing well.","Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $8.3 billion during the quarter. For the full year, cash from operations exceeded $40 billion, a record for the company and over 28% higher than last year. This reflects our impressive operating performance and the cash-generating strength of our portfolio.","At year end, our cash balances totaled $20 billion, up $3 billion from the end of 2010. This put us in a net cash position of about $10 billion. Our strong cash flow and solid balance sheet continue to be competitive advantages.","Turning to Slide 6. I'll compare results of the fourth quarter 2011 with the third quarter 2011. As a reminder, our earnings press release compares fourth quarter 2011 with the same quarter a year ago.","Fourth quarter earnings were $5.1 billion, $2.7 billion lower than third quarter earnings. Upstream earnings were down $464 million, driven by an unfavorable swing in foreign exchange effects and higher operating expenses, partly offset by higher volume.","Downstream results decreased $2 billion between quarters, resulting from weaker margins, the absence of asset sale gains, lower volumes and an unfavorable swing in foreign exchange effects. The variance in the Other bar reflects higher corporate charges.","On Slide 7, our U.S. upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were $97 million higher than the third quarter's result. Higher realizations benefited earnings by $60 million. A 4% increase in crude oil realizations improved earnings by about $100 million, while a 13% drop in natural gas realizations reduced earnings by about $40 million.","Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $65 million between periods, primarily due to higher employee cost and increased maintenance activity. The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including gains on several small asset sales.","Turning to Slide 8. International upstream earnings were down $561 million relative to the third quarter. A net positive liftings variance across multiple countries increased earnings by $180 million. Higher operating expenses reduced earnings by $165 million, driven primarily by an increase in employee and maintenance expenses.","Tax items across multiple jurisdictions decreased earnings by $100 million between quarters. This net number includes the absence of the one-time catch-up charge booked in the third quarter due to our retroactive tax increase in the U.K.","An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects lowered earnings by about $305 million. The U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies, most notably the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar.","The fourth quarter had a foreign exchange loss of around $3 million compared to a gain of about $300 million in the third quarter. These foreign exchange effects have minimal impact on cash. As we've said before, they are primarily balance sheet translation effects.","The Other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including lower realizations and higher exploration expense associated with seismic acquisition cost across the portfolio, as well as some well write-offs in China and Angola.","Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Between quarters, production increased 42,000 barrels a day. Lower prices improved volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts during the fourth quarter, increasing production about 4,000 barrels a day.","Base business combined with external constraints increased production a net 6,000 barrels a day.  Tengiz returned to normal operations following a turnaround activity in the third quarter, but the impact of this full restoration was partly offset by some unplanned downtime in December.","Production in Thailand was also fully restored following a June third-party pipeline incident, only to be partly offset by lower demand as a result of flooding and seasonality in the fourth quarter.  Offsetting these net positive impacts were normal field declines and an extended turnaround in Trinidad.","On the third quarter earnings call, we told you we expected fourth quarter production to increase approximately 100,000 to 150,000 barrels per day. Obviously, our forecast did not include the negative impacts of the events I just mentioned.","Moving to the next bar, incremental production from major capital projects increased fourth quarter production by 32,000 barrels a day, primarily driven by the start-up of Platong II in Thailand and improved reliability at Perdido.","Slide 10 compares full year 2011 net oil-equivalent production to that of 2010. Production decreased 90,000 barrels a day. Price impacts from production sharing and variable-royalty contracts decreased production by 32,000 barrels a day. The average Brent price increased about $32 in 2011.  For the full year, each dollar increase in Brent results in a 1,000 barrel per day volume reduction.","Base business combined with external constraints lowered production by 103,000 barrels per day. Normal field decline and higher maintenance activity were partly offset by about 17,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent from our recently acquired Marcellus assets. Our decline rate for the year was about 4%, right in line with our prior guidance.","Incremental production from our major capital projects contributed 45,000 barrels per day, reflecting the start-up of Platong II in Thailand and the ramp-up of AOSP in Canada, Frade in Brazil and Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico.","Our original production guidance for 2011 was 2.79 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. We fell short of that guidance by about 115,000 barrels a day. About 1\/3 of that is due to higher prices; about 1\/3 is due to lower-than-expected major capital project performance, mostly Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico and Tombua-Landana in Angola; and the remaining 1\/3 is lower base business performance, about half of which is due to the third-party pipeline rupture and decreased demand in Thailand.","As John mentioned, our focus is on profitable barrel. For the year, our global upstream earned over $26 per barrel. This is an increase of over $8 per barrel from our 2010 results. We have led our peer group on this metric for over 2 years by a wide margin, and we expect the trend to continue as our competitors announce their fourth quarter results.","Turning now to Slide 11. U.S. downstream earnings decreased $908 million in the fourth quarter. Margins dramatically weakened between quarters, lowering earnings by about $400 million. General industry fuel margins fell, contributing about half the decline shown in the bar. Seasonal declines in base oil and finished lubricant demand also punished fourth quarter margins.","Maintenance at our Richmond, California and Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery also impacted margins and was the primary driver for lower produced volumes, which decreased earnings by about $200 million. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $155 million, resulting from increased employee cost and maintenance activity I just mentioned, along with associated higher transportation costs. Chemical earnings decreased by $80 million due to both lower margins and lower sales volumes. The Other bar consists of several unrelated items, including the absence of third quarter asset sales, negative LIFO affects and lower trading results.","On Slide 12, international downstream earnings were $1.1 billion lower this quarter. Refining and marketing margins fell, reducing earnings by $155 million. This reflected weaker Asian demand coupled with regional recovery from shut downs.","The next bar shows the $570 million negative earnings variance, primarily reflecting the absence of the third quarter gain on the sale of the Pembroke Refinery and related marketing facilities in the U.K. and Ireland.","A swing in foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $230 million. The U.S. dollar weakened against both the Korean won and the Australian dollar during the quarter. Fourth quarter's foreign exchange loss was about $85 million compared to the third quarter gain of about $145 million. The Other bar here reflects a number of unrelated items, including lower chemical and trading results and higher operating expenses.","Slide 13 covers All Other. Fourth quarter net charges were $553 million compared to a net $358 million charge in the third quarter. This is an increase of $195 million in charges between periods.  A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $30 million benefit to earnings.","Corporate costs were $225 million higher this quarter. For the full year, this segment had net charges of $1.5 billion, putting us at the upper range of our $250 million to $350 million guidance range. We believe, going forward, a higher range of $300 million to $400 million is more appropriate.","With that, I'd like to now turn it back over to John for a few thoughts on 2012.","John S. Watson","Okay. Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 14. In early December, we announced our capital program for 2012 at $32.7 billion. The 2012 program is in line with our overall 2011 investments once the Atlas acquisition is included.","We continue to develop an enviable project queue, with almost 90% of the program earmarked for upstream activity. We are progressing construction on our 2 world-class Australian LNG projects and deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments. We are planning for increased exploration activity around the world, along with additional work to further assess the Marcellus and Utica acreage we acquired this past year. The investments we're making today are on track to deliver significant production growth by mid-decade, which is expected to generate substantial cash flow over a long period of time.","Our downstream investments for 2012 will focus on the construction of a premium base oil plant at our Pascagoula refinery and improving downstream returns through a number of energy efficiency and feedstock flexibility projects.","Turning to Slide 15. This slide shows our net production outlook for 2012. Our full year outlook for 2012 is 2.68 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, essentially flat with 2011. The outlook assumes an average Brent price of $111 per barrel, the same average price as 2011 and does not assume OPEC curtailments, material security or market impacts.","Major capital project start-ups, including Angola LNG and Usan, are expected to be largely offset by base business decline and major turnaround activity at Tengiz. 2012 will be the first major plant turnaround for the SGI\/SGP facilities since start-up in 2008. We expect the turnaround to occur in the third quarter and last approximately 6 weeks. Base business decline is expected to be about 4%.","Looking beyond 2012, I want to remind you of our long-term guidance. At the end of 2009, we said we expected to grow production, adjusted for price impacts, about 1% per year through 2014 and then grow 4% to 5% thereafter. We exceeded the 1% rate in 2010. We're a bit below 2011, but overall on track to meet our goals.","With the strength and scale of our major capital projects and our strong base business performance, we continue to expect production to grow to 3.3 million barrels per day by 2017. We are advancing the queue, reaching critical milestones and are well positioned to deliver consistent growth and performance over the long term.","Looking forward, let me highlight some of the activities we have planned for 2012 on Slide 17. In the downstream, we will mark the final year of our 3-year plan to improve returns. We're well on track to deliver on the commitments we made when we first began our restructuring program.","Construction on the Pascagoula base oil plant continues, driving toward a 2013 start-up. We're on track for start-up of 2 major capital projects: Angola LNG and the Usan deepwater project in Nigeria. We expect increased exploration activity in both our core focus areas and some intriguing test areas around the globe.","We expect to enter the front end engineering and design phase of the Future Growth Project at Tengiz, the Steamflood pilot expansion in the Partition Zone and our first expansion of Gorgon in Australia. In 2012, we will have a laser-sharp focus on execution as we continue construction on our Australia LNG and deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. I look forward to further discussing these plans in more detail at our Security Analyst Meeting on March 13 in New York City. We had a great 2011, and we're looking forward to delivering some strong results in 2012.","Now that concludes my prepared remarks. We're now set to take some questions. So, Sean, if you'll please open the lines for those questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's been a tough few weeks for news flow clearly. Could you just underline for us the resolution that we now have on firstly, the situation in Brazil? The extent to which there's any more potential news flow from the spill or whether or not that's essentially got a line drawn underneath it. The same for Nigeria. And then finally, if you could address the recent legal news flow around Ecuador and where we are in that whole process, I would be grateful.","John S. Watson","Sure. Let me first talk about Brazil. As many of you know, we had a seep there from well drilling activity in November. And I would tell you that this is less a drilling issue as it is a subsurface issue. We were drilling a well in the Frade Field. Remember, we've had over 50 well penetrations in this field and know it pretty well. We hit pressure that was higher than we expected, took a kick, and our people responded in textbook fashion to control that kick, wading up the mud, et cetera. It took us some time to identify that seeps were as a result of that kick in the first couple of days. We\u2019d sent ROVs down the first day and didn't see anything around our wells. Remember, these are subsea wells, and there was nothing around the FPSO. We sent an ROV down again and saw these seeps. And so we commenced a significant action at that time to control the surface sheen that we were seeing and to control the seeps. And that has been largely a very successful effort. Now during that time, you saw some very strong reaction by regulators and in the media. I would tell you, we didn't necessarily put our best foot forward in some of the communication that we made at that time, but the event itself was handled in textbook fashion. Now since that time, we've been working very closely to improve the communications with regulators and to get them the necessary information that they need. But like the United States and some other countries, there are many different factions in Brazil. And there are a number of political issues around oil development from the environmental community, between the state and federal level. And so you have a lot of different views on oil development, and there are many forces at work in Brazil. We're doing our best to deal with the circumstance. I can't predict what may come. What I do know is the facts would suggest that our people responded very well to this event. And all we ask is to be treated fairly consistent with the facts and to be treated as Petrobras or others would be treated in a similar circumstance. In terms of Nigeria, the Nigeria event is a serious event and very concerned about it. Obviously we had 2 fatalities from that incident. I'm pleased that the evacuation that was put in place was fairly orderly and that 152 individuals were able to escape. As you might imagine, our first priority was dealing with those 152 individuals and searching for the 2 that proved to be lost. We've been conducting interviews with those individuals to try to better understand what happened. We have said that we had thought that there was some type of an equipment failure on surface facilities. What we know is that there were gas returns from the formation through the annuals that were being circulated out through the mud\/gas separator. This is not at all unusual. This is a fairly routine type of activity, but then something went wrong. And we don't know a lot more about it than that. We're doing a root cause analysis. We're trying to piece through the information that we're getting to better understand it. But our real focus right now is really on putting out the fire that continues to this day. As you probably read in the material we've put out, we've mobilized 2 rigs to drill relief wells. One is more precaution. We presume the first will be successful. But in the event that it encounters any challenges, we've got a second. We've received considerable help from the industry in making those rigs available, which we're pleased with. And we're doing well planning right now. I would expect we would spud one of those relief wells within the next week or so. We have seen the size of the flame go down significantly since the initial event, but we're monitoring that as we go. I'll remind you, this is a gas well that's burning. You do see a plume around the site. That's silt and mud as it's been \u2013 it\u2019s a very shallow site. It's 40 feet of water. And so as the gas comes up, a lot of silt and mud is being disturbed and so you see that plume. We've been sampling that, that's mud, and that will eventually dissipate and settle to the bottom. So more work underway. Certainly, I'm concerned about these events. They're fairly different events as I indicated. The one in Brazil I would categorize more as a geologic event than drilling related. The one in Nigeria is clearly related to drilling activities and surface activities. We'll continue to do what we always do in these circumstances. We'll work very hard to understand. We've got a root cause analysis team that's been flown in from around the world to understand it. We've taken actions, as you might expect, with stand downs in our drilling organization reinforcing well control standards, and that's on top of many of the proprietary things that we do. But certainly, I'm very disappointed in those particular events. Now when it comes to Ecuador, that has been in the news as well. I won't go through the case in great detail because I think most of you know the history. If you're on the phone and you don't, I encourage you look at our website because we have quite a bit of information. And I think it's generally acknowledged that this case is a product of fraud. Most of us know that. This is a collaboration between corrupt plaintiff lawyers in the U.S. and a corrupt judiciary in Ecuador. Nonetheless, we're moving it through the judicial system. There have been events in really 3 courts recently: one in Ecuador, one in New York and one in The Hague. So I'll quickly tell you what's happened in each one. On January 3, a panel of 3 temporary judges overseeing our appeal of the Lago Agrio verdict in Ecuador upheld that original ruling. So on January 20, Chevron filed an appeal seeking a review by Ecuador's National Court of Justice. Basically, we're pursuing all available procedural steps in Ecuador as you would expect. Remember, we have no assets in Ecuador. So the second area where there's been court activity has been in The Hague. On January 25, the BIT Tribunal, that is the Bilateral Investment Treaty Tribunal in The Hague, converted its previous interim measures order to an interim award, and that makes it have more standing in the international community. And basically, the award is targeted at the Republic of Ecuador and says that Ecuador is obligated to prevent enforcement worldwide, pending a full review and formal trial in the merits of the case. This award is helpful to us in preventing enforcement outside of Ecuador. I would also point out that in previous rulings that the tribunal has made, they have already indicated that Ecuador will be financially responsible for all the damage caused by this fraud if Chevron prevails. So we've had some strong wording out of that court and are encouraged by that, and there's another hearing scheduled. And then finally, on January 26, in New York, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an opinion reversing and vacating the Southern District Court's injunction. We had sought to stop enforcement in U.S. courts, stop the plaintiffs from enforcing any judgment that might be achieved in Ecuador in courts outside the United States. And in a fairly narrow procedural ruling, the courts held that, that statute cannot be implied for purposes of such enforcement. But it was a fairly narrow procedural ruling, and it doesn't change -- in fact, it made no comments about the merits of the case. And in fact, it made no comment about the RICO case. And so you can expect that, that will continue on its way. I know this can be confusing. We said at the outset with this case when you have a collusion and a fraud outside of the United States, you have to work many avenues to protect yourself. We still have many defenses, both in Ecuador, in The Hague and elsewhere where we've put together defense team should enforcement be sought elsewhere. It's certainly unfortunate that we're at this point. But when you have an elaborate fraud that's being perpetrated against you, that's what you have to do. So I hope that wasn't too long an update on those 3 matters.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John, I mean my follow-up would simply be the -- what are the next dates or events that we should look for as the next sort of meaningful news flow items on those 3 issues as we go into 2012? And I'll leave it there.","John S. Watson","Yes. At some point, we'll hear a final determination in the court of -- in Ecuador. I'll leave that to you to decide what you think will happen there. There could be more out of the BIT Tribunal, and then there could be more actions that we could take in New York under the RICO case. So that's where we are.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And dates for more news flow from Nigeria and Brazil?","John S. Watson","Those are hard to predict. I think as -- we'll notify you, for example, when we spud the relief well. To some degree, events will dictate what we -- where we put out news. But any significant change in the status of the well or the status of the work we're doing, we'll certainly keep you apprised. And for those that haven't seen it, we're putting up pretty regular updates on our website on both Brazil and Nigeria.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You mentioned, Pat, the $10 billion on the balance sheet continues to provide Chevron with competitive advantages, I guess only if you're going to do something with the cash, obviously long range growth targets unchanged. So just some color perhaps on, is it because portfolio options for additional spend are not yet matured? Is it because you're worried about inflation in terms of the existing projects you have? Or are you thinking perhaps U.S. gas prices being so weak will present a strategic opportunity for you guys?","John S. Watson","Well, let me make a few comments because we have some priorities for our cash. Clearly, we have a strong balance sheet, one of the strongest in the industry. We're heading into a period where we have significant capital expenditures ahead of us. And I've said previously that we want to be sure that we can execute this group of major capital projects uninterrupted. And you can have considerable volatility in the commodity markets. So even though we may think oil prices will be more than adequate to preserve our cash status so that we can fund these capital projects, we have a more conservative balance sheet than might otherwise be the case to ensure that we can execute these major capital projects. That's I guess number one that I would tell you. We want to be able to fund these projects. We of course want to be able to continue to pay the dividend and increase the dividend as the pattern of earnings and cash flow permit going forward. And then we have further flexibility to repurchase shares if cash gets above the rate that we think affords us those protections. And we have -- and as you've seen, we have done that. We're not saving it for a particular purpose. We are opportunistic when it comes to opportunities to add to the portfolio, and we want to be in a position of having sufficient resources to be able to take advantage of an opportunity. You've seen last year, we made small acquisitions in the Marcellus and add-on bolt-on acquisitions, and the balance sheet that we have affords us that sort of flexibility. We don't have to do any acquisitions, but we're in a position to take advantage of opportunities with the balance sheet that we have. So that's kind of the priorities that we have for the cash debt balance that we have today.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And maybe a follow-on then. So Gorgon, Wheatstone and Jack\/St. Malo, some of the Big Foots, some of the big projects. Gorgon, I think, maybe towards the end of this year, you'll be in a more comfortable position in terms of really understanding productivity. And the ultimate cost of that project probably provides a read through to Wheatstone. So at that point, would you be more comfortable to say okay, we've got through the hump of the CapEx and we could maybe return cash to shareholders or do something different?","John S. Watson","I think you hit it about right in terms of the sort of understanding what -- cost, if you will. If you look at Wheatstone -- I just had an update last night with the project team, for example, on both Gorgon and Wheatstone. I meet with them -- once a month, I meet with the project manager and line management and had a pretty thorough update on where we are at Gorgon. And we're 36% complete now. It's going very well other than a cyclone that's descending on Barrow Island as we speak. That's one of the things that we deal with. We have hardened facilities there, so we'll manage our way through that. But the project is going very well, 36% complete. And I'll just tell you, we're on track for kind of late 2014 start-up of Gorgon. I feel pretty good about the progress that we have made on that flagship project. From a cost point of view, and maybe just what you were getting at, we will have -- this will be the first year where we'll have a lot of on-island activity. And so we'll get a good chance to understand labor productivity and the progress that we're making. That, coupled with impacts of foreign exchange, for example, will dictate whether there's any change to cost one way or another. At this point, the $37 billion is the target for the project. And if we have anything more to say, it's probably more later in the year. So on the subject of will we change our balance sheet structure as the year wears on, I think it's fair to say that as we get closer to start-up of these big projects, remember, we've got Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack\/St. Malo, Big Foot, Tubular Bells, that all start up in that -- Wheatstone is a little later, but the big ones in the 2014 time frame as we get closer to that date, the need for flexibility on the balance sheet diminishes. And then we'll have choices for what we do with that additional cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, you outlined a number of the big projects, Australia LNG, deepwater, you got some big international projects. The big glaring hole is U.S. shale and U.S. liquids shale in particular. You do have the Marcellus, but as some of these opportunities start to expand and mature, they do actually look quite substantial. I'm curious how you -- if you can provide some comments on how you do thinking about addressing that seeming hole in your portfolio. There are a lot of jobs that come with these projects. There's a lot of opportunity to invest here in America. You are the second-largest energy company in the U.S. Between the inherent investment opportunity and some of the other benefits of investing here, how do you see that as a strategic need for Chevron?","John S. Watson","Yes, sure, Arjun. Look, we're very positive on shales. As you know very well, the shale gas business in this country was really built by the independents because you had to have strong land departments. And so major companies got involved by buying their way in. And so prices began to run up. And we felt we always were very focused on value even -- no matter how much we might like rocks, we're always very focused on value. And many have plunged in with big dollars, and perhaps those will prove to be money well spent. For our view, we had some pretty strict criteria, and we have made some targeted acquisitions at areas where we know we have a low-cost basis of doing business, including a substantial carry to cushion us through a difficult period in the gas market. I guess I'd point out that we have some 8 million acres of shale around the world. And in March, you'll hear George give you an update on not just the Marcellus and Utica shales, but also some of the things we're working in West Texas and otherwise. So we feel pretty good about our portfolio. We have opportunities overseas. We're just drilling a well in Poland. We're drilling a well, in fact, our second well in the Duvernay in Canada. So I think we have a little more than might be commonly recognized, but we're not ideologically against these things. And we have some acreage that we've had for a long time that\u2019s held by production in the Delaware basin, et cetera, that did show some promise as well. So I think we'll have an opportunity in March, Arjun, to give you a more thorough update of what we have. But we're not ideologically opposed to shales. We just want to enter in a way where we can generate some value.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, I realize there's sort of no absolute answer here in the sense that it's always case-by-case specific. But we\u2019ve generally presumed some of the joint ventures that some of the international and non-U.S. companies have done are probably inherently less likely for Chevron to pursue. Is that true? And then the related follow-up is do you feel a need to add expertise via adding employees of other companies, potentially in terms of pursuing U.S. opportunities?","John S. Watson","I think it's fair to say that if we were going to take on a significant new opportunity in the U.S., organizational capability would be a consideration. When we acquired Atlas, we picked up some very good people with that, and that was very, very helpful to us. Certainly, manpower is at a premium. So I think that is the important part of what we're looking for. So what was the other part of your question?","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on joint ventures. Again, that's been an avenue for some folks. We've thought it as less likely for you all.","John S. Watson","Well, there are 2 aspects to the joint venture. One is if you come in and are carrying the partner or the operator, you're paying a disproportionate level of cost. And with the gas market where it is, that's going to be difficult financially for a period of time. We acquired Atlas, and that came with a carry. So we like that better. Second, coming in as a non-operator isn't our preferred approach. If we were going to apply our expertise, we'd rather have some degree of control. We looked at a lot of these different ventures, and you had to come in with money, and you had to come in and really have the pace and activity and practices dictated by non-operators. And in many cases, those were operators we didn't want to be in that position with.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, I know you guys have an increase in exploration activity this year. I was wondering if you could provide an update on exploration, in particular Liberia, Bear's Hump basin in the Gulf of Mexico. I think you have 4 to 5 rigs working today and\/or some of the shale positions that you mentioned, please?","John S. Watson","Yes, we do have quite a bit of exploration activity this year. As you know, we've been accumulating acreage over the last several years. So where are we drilling wells this year? We have a key well that will be spudded shortly in Liberia. We've talked about that. We've got a well drilling now in China. That's a very encouraging well. We've got a well drilling now in Poland. We've got well drilling now in the Duvernay up in Canada. So we have those -- certainly those that are underway. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have 4 rigs currently. I should note, we have had one dry hole in China. So we're on our second well there. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have 4 rigs currently. Right now, they're all working salt activity, but we do have exploration wells ahead. We were unable to get the Coronado well down, so we're looking for a new location and a new opportunity to drill that well. And so those are some of the highlights that I would offer in the portfolio this year. We will have some tests in the Utica that we'll drill this year. And so that's encouraging, and more in the Duvernay.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So it sounds like there'd be some key exploration results maybe in the 1Q here?","John S. Watson","Yes. I don't know...","Patricia E. Yarrington","As the year progresses.","John S. Watson","As the year progresses, I think the Liberia well will be an interesting one for us.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","For sure. The second question I have, can you tell me the reserve bookings related to Wheatstone? And then with your recent discovery, in addition to the 5 others, that could support I think 11 straight right now? They could support a third train in Wheatstone. I mean, how should we -- how will that process develop in 2012, as well as any potential Gorgon expansion where I believe you have space for 5 trains? I'm just thinking you could see within the existing portfolio even an extended growth beyond calendar 2017.","John S. Watson","Oh, to be sure. First, the Wheatstone booking was 740 million barrels. And so obviously that was a significant contributor to our reserve adds for the year. In terms of what's likely to come next, we have 3 trains at Gorgon, 2 in the foundation project at Wheatstone. The most likely next step is a fourth train at Gorgon. And whether we can get to a fifth train on Barrow Island will remain to be seen. We believe we have the plot space. But subsequent trains at Wheatstone will likely then follow the fourth train at Gorgon. And that will be a proportion of the resources that we have accumulated and any third-party activity. Remember, that's a hub site. And so it'll also be a function of resources that we can bring to that site, which bring down fixed costs. And we're actively working that aspect as well.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So are those pre-FEED? Is that an accurate assessment?","John S. Watson","Yes. Those are earlier stages. The one that's most likely for FEED is Train 4 at Gorgon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","First of all, on reserve replacement, John, obviously a big number at Wheatstone. But even directing that out, it looks like just under 100% replacement from all other sources. Are you able to provide any further breakdown of the geographic reserve adds? And I think specifically, I would be looking at deepwater Gulf of Mexico because I believe last year, there were some price implications that prevented you from booking some of the reserves associated that you -- with the projects that are moving forward there.","John S. Watson","Yes. We did make a booking on Jack\/St. Malo this year. And so -- in fact, if you look at the typical categories of extensions, et cetera, all the categories of reserve movement were positive, other than the impact of price and obviously, production during the year. So Big Foot, we also made a booking this year. You'll see more as we -- in the annual report when we disclose it. But it was fairly broad-based. We did have bookings in the Marcellus as a result of our activity there as well. So it was fairly broad-based and positive. I'll just remind you, these things are lumpy. A year ago, when our bookings were a little bit low, we said these things are lumpy. And it's a function of largely major capital project timing. But we're also doing a lot of very good work in reservoir management to be sure that we're getting the necessary technical work done to book reserves as fast as we can when we know developments are coming, and they're really waiting on technical work or determinations to meet booking standards. So our reservoir management group continues to do good work around the company.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","That's great. And if I could -- with a second question. Upstream margins, obviously comparing you against many of your peers, they've been fantastic. But if I look at the fourth quarter and compare it to your own good history, I'm actually looking at capturing about 21% of the Brent price, whereas you've been capturing pretty consistently between 23% and 24% of the Brent price, really just referring specifically to the international margin. Is there anything going on in the quarter that makes it non-representational? Or should we be looking at the potential for cost inflation to start eroding that great margin that you had established over the course of 2011?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Yes, Jason, I think I'll take this one, if you don't mind. So realizations generally were relatively flat globally there. We had higher exploration expense. I mentioned the seismic activity and the well write-off that we had. So fourth quarter was a little bit higher on exploration expense. We also had higher operating expenses, I mentioned that. And then there was additional charges, one-time charges, tax-related charges in the fourth quarter that you would not see recur again. And that was -- it was a significant charge there.","John S. Watson","I think the general message I would give you is there hasn't been something fundamentally changed in our portfolio. We have a strong portfolio. We will continue to perform well, particularly with high oil prices. And in March, you'll see us talk a little bit more about our portfolio and some of the new projects coming in, because the new projects are very good also. And they are high return per barrel. So naturally, we've got a range of profitability across the portfolio. But on balance, we think this lead we have is something we're very likely to keep in the kind of oil price environment, in particular with the sort of North America gas prices that we're seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John and Pat and Jeanette, several part question if I could. Pat, can you give us a rough idea that -- how's the CapEx trend is going to look like from 2013 until 2017? I presume that there's a number of projects you still need to sanction and that you're probably not going to see any relief? So should we assume that it's going to be up, say, couple billion dollars on average a year comparing to this year level?","John S. Watson","Yes. Paul, if I can comment. The major spend projects, we sanctioned and are underway. And we're heading into a period of heavy construction. Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack\/St. Malo, Big Foot, all of those projects are kind of in their high-spend period in the period 2012 to '14. So that's when you should be looking to see kind of -- those are likely to be high-spend years. And we've given you a number for 2012. We haven't given numbers beyond that, but I would just say that period is likely to be the 3-year period. The next big project that will add a big tranche of cost is likely to be Future Growth Project at Tengiz. And we're likely to begin progressing that. But that's slated for start-up 2017, later, later kind of time period. And so that peak spend will likely be later in the time period. And same thing goes for the Steamflood Project in the Partition Zone, which would be a significant spend. That's behind these big projects. So I wouldn't look for a major tranche of increase from beyond what we've talked about during this period.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And, John, we're looking at all the noise surrounding your oil spill in Brazil and also the last couple years that some of \u2013 a little bit change in the political wind, how they treat the foreign oil company in the country, all those add together, does that change your view about the commitment of the -- or I shouldn't use the word commitment, but the appetite of the company in that country?","John S. Watson","Well, let me make a broader comment. I think that host governments, whether it's the United States, China or Brazil, have very high expectations for companies like ours. They expect the best. We trade on our reputation. Us and frankly other IOCs trade on our reputation. And so we get held to a very high standard. They expect excellence from us. And when they don't see it, they come down hard. And we've seen that take place elsewhere. So that's part of what the expectation is, and we need to not put oil in the water. And that's what we work to do every day. So expectations are high. Transparency is high, and anyone who has an agenda that might not be consistent with our objectives is going to point out any flaws or mistakes that we make. So we should expect that, and we have to deal with it. We do work very hard to get balance and facts out into these circumstances and assume that rule of law and consistent treatment will prevail. But certainly, expectations are higher today than they might have been 2 or 3 years ago.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just on the resource base. I understand it's lumpy in terms of moving into the proven reserve. Do you have a rough estimate you can give us between 2012 to 2015? How much is your existing probable resource that you can prove into the proven reserve from the major projects?","John S. Watson","I don't have it. I mean, I would tell you, over time, we're obviously targeting to replace more than 100% of reserves. But I don't have a particular target for you. George will give you a little more -- a little bigger breakdown on -- you'll recall, last year, he talked about some of our big projects and how much had been booked on those projects. We'll give you some of that same information in March to try to help you with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","On Angola LNG, could you discuss what marketing arrangements you have underway or in place for the gas? And then I have a follow-up.","John S. Watson","Sure. Mark, as you know, the project was originally designed to bring gas to the United States. We've been working with Sonangol and our other partners to put in place a diversion program, which of course makes sense given markets in Europe and Asia. And I expect that over time, we'll have the flexibility to move gas to those markets. So that's basically the plan for us.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","John, if I could just follow-up on that, are there any short-term contracts you have in place to move that gas to Asia?","John S. Watson","We\u2019re in the process of contracting kind of as we speak. And so I don't have, for example, a destination for the first cargo to share with you.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. My follow-up relates to the 2012 production forecast. I'm wondering, are there any production sharing contract thresholds that have entered into that number? And if you could be a little bit more specific in terms of what the volumetric impact might be of the Tombua-Landana disappointment, as well as the major Tengiz turn, is that a full plant turn for 6 weeks so it\u2019ll be completely shut down? Or is it something less than that?","John S. Watson","It is a full plant turnaround. So it's a very significant event. In terms of other PSC effects, the PSC effects can vary by price. So there are different impacts in the $70 range, in the $90 range, in the $110 range. So they do vary. But I'm not going to get into the specifics of those. Jeanette may have a comment here.","Jeanette Ourada","Mark, I think you\u2019re asking were we going to hit any PSC triggers in 2012, and there's no major trigger in our forecast that we're expecting.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the Tombua-Landana issue?","John S. Watson","Performance hasn't been up to what we had expected, and we're dealing with it to see if we can resolve some of the issues. But the production's a little shy of -- what we said is production was a little bit shy of what we had built in the plan this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Reid with Jefferies.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Could I ask a couple of questions again on LNG? You took FID on Wheatstone with I think a kind of industry low in terms of the amount of gas which had been marketed. Are you keeping some of this back for your own marketing operation? Or do you intend to contract that completely, say, during this year? And secondly, on Browse, this one seems to be slipping quite a long way down the program in Australia. Is this a project now you've kind of put in the post-2020 start-up frame, given the difficulty there?","John S. Watson","Yes. A couple comments. First, we've been pretty successful in our gas marketing. We're about 70% under SPA at Gorgon, about 60% in Wheatstone. And we continue to have good conversations with gas customers. Recall some have been impacted by -- some of the contracting has been impacted by the events around Fukushima. So it's been a very sensitive and difficult time for some of the Japanese customers. So I expect that as we move along, we'll get into 85%, 90% range. And every indication I have based on my conversations with our gas people is that, particularly with some events taking place around the world, there's plenty of demand out there at similar pricing to what we're seeing today. But we're 60% at Wheatstone, and I expect we'll move forward successfully.","Jeanette Ourada","Browse.","John S. Watson","Oh, and Browse. Browse, I'm probably best referring you to Woodside who's the operator there. I think the intent of partnership is to keep the retention licenses in place. Remember, there are some conditions that were put on development. There were some actions that were required of the partnership in order to retain the retention licenses. And the partners have been working through the economics of the scheme that was put forward by the operator. And so I don't want to prejudge or comment on that. I'll just say that we're committed. We're certainly committed to developing the resource, and it has to be done in an economic way. But I probably need to leave that to Woodside as they're the operator.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Could I ask just one very quick follow-up on something you answered earlier in terms of the impact of the Tengiz Future Growth Project on future CapEx. Are you basically saying to us that $30 billion, $33 billion is kind of where Chevron's going to be for the next 6, 7 years in terms of overall spend?","John S. Watson","No. I didn't say that. What I said was '12, '13 and '14 are peak years because of the LNG projects. And if you simply did math and took out those expenditures, you would see a big drop off. But we continually add items into the hopper, and the Future Growth Project is one of those. But it doesn't mean spending will necessarily be at this $33 billion level.","Operator","Our final question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I believe in  -- last year, when you guys put out your original budget for 2011, you talked about a $26 billion budget and you came in at $29 billion for 2011. So if you can talk about what caused that budget for -- what caused the number for '11 to be higher than your original budget? And you can also talk about for 2012 what the major variables are that can influence the budget for 2012 as we get to the end of the year.","John S. Watson","Sure. I'll let Pat take that one.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay, yes. So principally, there were 2 items that I'd call your attention to. One we did a little bit of coring up around the Atlas acquisition property, so a little bit of coring up around the Marcellus. That was not planned at the time we put out the original target there. And I would also say, because of the strong price environment, particularly in the U.S., we've had additional activity in the U.S. And that led to -- those 2 items really account for that increase of about $3 billion. In terms of any other outlook changes that we've got relative to the planned C&E target for 2012, there's nothing that comes to mind that we need to update you about. We feel good about the $32.7 billion figure that we've put out.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Then on your guidance for corporate expense, you said that was going to be a little bit higher this year versus kind of last year. Is it the major incidences kind of between Nigeria and Brazil that are influencing that corporate expense number?","Patricia E. Yarrington","No. Actually, if you look back, we have had the corporate guidance in that sector be $250 million to $350 million for quite some time, several years in fact. And all I was really trying to do was acknowledge the fact that we do have corporate departments whose salaries go up a little bit over time. In this particular case, we had some additional pension expense that's related to the funding position of our pension, and I expect a little bit of that to be higher in 2012. So it's really just trying to give you a little bit of better guidance.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And lastly, on the Coronado, you said the well was not able to get down, or you did not drill the well in Coronado?","John S. Watson","We drilled the well. We weren't able to get down. It couldn't get through the salt. ","Okay, with that, thank you, Sean. In closing, let me say we certainly appreciate everyone's participation in today's call. I especially want to thank each of the analysts on behalf of all the participants for their very good questions during this morning's sessions. Goodbye. Thank you, and we'll see you in March.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.

My name is Sean, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Good morning, and thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Jeanette Ourada, General Manager, Investor Relations. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. ","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. ","Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. It was a strong quarter financially, among one of the best we've ever had. The company's first quarter earnings were $6.5 billion or $3.27 per diluted share. Comparing the first quarter 2012 to the same quarter a year earlier, our earnings were up 4%. Upstream benefited from higher crude prices, while Downstream improved on gains from asset sales. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 21%. Our debt ratio at the end of March was just under 7%. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the second quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount. ","Turning to Slide 4. On Wednesday, Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.90 per share common stock quarterly dividend. This is an 11.1% increase in the quarterly rate. This is our 25th consecutive year of higher dividend payments. Also, 2012 is an important milestone for us, as it represents a remarkable 100 years of uninterrupted dividend payments to our shareholders. ","Turning now to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $8.4 billion during the first quarter. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled nearly $20 billion. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparison. Jeanette?","Jeanette Ourada","Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 6. I'll compare results of the first quarter 2012 with the fourth quarter 2011. As a reminder, our earnings release compares first quarter 2012 with the same quarter a year ago. ","First quarter earnings were $6.5 billion, over $1.3 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Upstream earnings were up $434 million, driven by higher crude oil realizations and lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower volumes. Downstream results improved by $865 million between quarters, resulting from lower operating expenses, better margins and gains on asset sales. The variance in the other bar reflects lower corporate charges. ","On Slide 7, our Upstream earnings for the first quarter were $76 million lower than the fourth quarter's results. Realizations lowered earnings by $20 million. A 31% drop in natural gas realizations reduced earnings by about $70 million. This was partially offset by a 3% increase in liquids realizations, which improved earnings by $50 million. About 2\/3 of our U.S. crude sales are in the Gulf of Mexico and California, where heavy Louisiana sweet, Mars and Midway Sunset crude markers experienced only modest increases in the quarter. The remaining 1\/3 of our U.S. crude sales are in the Midcontinent, where West Texas crude markers increased more dramatically. ","Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $15 million between periods. We had one fewer day in the first quarter and lower production resulting from the sale of Alaskan assets, partly offset by higher production in the Gulf of Mexico. Lower operating expenses improved earnings by $125 million between periods, primarily due to reduced maintenance activities and employee costs. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including the absence of gains on several small asset sales and higher depreciation expenses. ","Turning to Slide 8. International Upstream earnings were up $510 million relative to the fourth quarter. Higher realizations benefited earnings by $555 million. Average liquids realizations increased 9%, in line with the increase in average Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations rose 8% between quarters, contributing about $100 million to the positive earnings variance. Lower liftings across multiple countries decreased earnings by $195 million. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $250 million, driven by -- primarily by a decrease in employee expenses. ","Moving to the next bar, an unfavorable change in foreign currency effects lowered earnings by $205 million. The first quarter had a loss of $208 million, compared to a loss of $3 million in the fourth quarter. These foreign exchange effects are primarily balance sheet translation effects, for which there are no direct impacts on cash. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including a net favorable tax effect, partly offset by higher exploration expense, including dry holes in China. ","Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Between quarters, production decreased 10,000 barrels per day. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts, decreasing production about 7,000 barrels per day. Average Brent spot prices increased about $9 between quarters. Base business, combined with external constraints, decreased production 17,000 barrels per day. The decrease was largely due to the sale of our Alaska Cook Inlet natural gas properties, a planned turnaround in Angola and adverse weather conditions in Australia and Kazakhstan. The Alaska sale reduced production by 17,000 barrels oil equivalent per day. Offsetting these negative variances were the absence of planned turnarounds in Trinidad and at Tahiti and the Gulf of Mexico. Contributions for major capital projects increased first quarter production by 14,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by the ramp-up of Platong II in Thailand and improved reliability at Perdido, partly offset by well shut-ins at Frade in Brazil. ","In total, Frade reduced quarterly production by about 10,000 barrels per day. As we called out in the interim update, the incremental impact to the quarter as a result of shutting down the field mid-March was about 5,000 barrels per day. Also reducing production in the quarter was the drilling ban and shut in of one producing well required by Brazilian regulators in late 2011. Since the field -- since the full field shut in, the ongoing impact to net production is estimated to be about 33,000 barrels per day.","We are progressing with a comprehensive technical study to better understand the geological features of the field. We will resume production in the Frade field only when we are completely satisfied we can restart production safely and when we have obtained the full support of our partners and the Brazilian regulators. Excluding impacts from Brazil, the remainder of our portfolio remains on pace to meet the production guidance we gave in January. We'll give you an update on the second quarter call.","Turning to Slide 10. We've had a number of questions recently about the PSCs in our portfolio. We wanted to take a few minutes today to explain exactly how we define PSC-related terms and how changes in price impact our net production. PSCs currently account for about 25% of our net production. In addition, we have contracts with variable royalties that make up about another 12%. In PSC and variable royalty contracts, production can vary as a result of changes in commodity price, level of investment and operating costs. Some contracts also have triggers that reduce our net entitlement when certain rate of return or production thresholds are reached. ","Each quarter, we give you a price effect variance and a sensitivity to Brent comparing to the prior period. When we say price effect, we are only including the impact on production due to changes in commodity prices. We do not include in this price effect variance other items that may impact net production, such as changes in investment or operating costs. If a nonprice driver were material, we would call it out separately, for instance, as higher or lower cost recovery. We would also call out the impact of triggers if they were material. ","Under a PSC or variable-royalty contract, the barrels we are entitled to typically decline as prices increase. As illustrated on the chart, this is because fewer barrels are required to recover costs at higher prices. Moreover, as costs are recovered, the split of profit oil typically declines for the IOC participants. We measure this price sensitivity relative to Brent and the relationship is not linear. Each year during our planning cycle, we create price sensitivity curves and evaluate the potential impact of price across the portfolio. The curve changes slightly year-to-year, but the relationships shown have been fairly consistent over the last several years. We're currently in the $110 to $130 per barrel range, and our sensitivity is around 700 barrels per dollar change in Brent. ","During the planning process, we also review potential triggers. Based on our last review using average 2011 price levels, we do not foresee any material triggers in the next few years. While rising prices do slightly reduce our production volumes, the positive impact on our earnings is much more significant. For our portfolio at current price levels, there is a 40:1 relationship between the impact of higher earnings across the portfolio compared to the reduction in earnings due to price effects. ","Let me give you an example, and to keep it simple, let's start with a Brent price of $110. A $10 increase in Brent results in about a $3 per barrel increase in earnings margin. We produce roughly 1 billion barrels per year, so that generates about $3 billion in additional annual earnings. The same $10 increase in Brent reduces our production by 7,000 barrels per day because the sensitivity in this range is 700 barrels per dollar change in Brent. The 7,000 barrels per day, valued at our current earnings margin, is worth about $70 million. ","So at the portfolio level, we gain $3 billion in annual earnings due to higher prices and lose $70 million due to price effects. Or thinking about it as a ratio, we gain $40 of earnings to every $1 we lose to price effects. ","Governments benefit even more. Higher taxes on our increased revenue, higher revenue from their share of production and additional volumes from the impact we just discussed. All of this is built into our peer-leading earnings margin, which for this quarter is $26.79 per barrel. Based on available competitor results, we maintained our #1 ranking, continuing to outdistance our nearest competitor by over $7 per barrel. ","Next, let's move to Downstream. Turning to Slide 11. U.S. Downstream earnings increased $663 million in the first quarter. Margins improved earnings by almost $300 million, driven by better refining margins in both the Gulf Coast and West Coast. Refinery maintenance in both regions, plus continued product export demand on the Gulf Coast, drove stronger crack spreads. Lower maintenance activity in the Chevron system across multiple refineries was the primary driver for higher produced volumes, which increased earnings by $100 million. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $200 million, resulting from lower employee costs and the lower maintenance activity I just mentioned. Chemical earnings increased by $90 million due to higher ethylene margins and stronger sales volumes. The other bar consists of several unrelated items, including lower trading results.","On Slide 12, international Downstream earnings were $202 million higher this quarter. Refining and marketing margins fell, reducing earnings by $55 million. This resulted from planned turnaround activities, causing changes to crude slates and marketing margins being squeezed as prices rose. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $130 million, resulting from reduced employee maintenance and environmental costs. Gains from asset sales in Spain and Canada improved earnings by $195 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items. Timing effects represented a $225 million negative variance due to unfavorable inventory impacts during a period of rising prices. This was offset by a favorable foreign currency effect, net positive tax items and higher chemicals and shipping results. First quarter's foreign exchange loss was about $15 million, compared to the fourth quarter loss of about $85 million. ","Slide 13 covers all other. First quarter net charges were $504 million, compared to a net $553 million charge in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $49 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $4 million benefit to earnings. Corporate charges were $45 million lower than in the fourth quarter. You will note we exceeded the upper end of the guidance range we provided in January. If you look back over several years, you will see this is a typical pattern where first quarter net charges have often been 30% to 35% of the full year cost. Thus, we believe our quarterly guidance range of $300 million to $400 million for net charges in all other segments is still appropriate going forward. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Pat.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Thank you, Jeanette. Turning now to Slide 14. Last month at our Security Analyst Meeting in New York, we presented our financial results and gave you a competitive perspective based on information then available for our peers. We now have complete information to fully assess our performance on a relative basis and I want to share the updated slides with you. ","Our overall ROCE was stellar in 2011 and was also very strong on a segmented basis. In the Upstream, our ROCE was 29%, so we moved into a #1 position relative to our peers. This is a tremendous achievement. ","In the Downstream, we also delivered a strong performance with an ROCE of 14%. Here, we continue to narrow the gap with the top ROCE peer performer. ","For the Upstream, we have updated peer results for both realizations and costs as depicted now on Slide 15. Our realizations have exceeded those of our peers for the second consecutive year and are now more than $5 higher than our nearest competitors. Our Upstream costs increased last year, largely driven by higher oil prices and the resulting impact from royalties, taxes and fuel costs. Our cost structure is very competitive. Even with the oiliest portfolio, where costs of producing oil are higher than the costs of producing natural gas, we improved our relative ranking and are now at #2 in our peer group. ","Slide 16 shows the updated cash margin comparison. With a leading position in realization and a competitive cost structure, we've delivered an unmatched cash margin. Our 2011 -- Chevron's cash margins were nearly $39 per barrel and our #1 position remains intact, outperforming our nearest competitor by 40% or over $10 per barrel. This performance is as a result of the strength of our portfolio and our focus on selecting and executing well on the right projects.","Turning now to Slide 17. I'd like to share a few highlights of Chevron's strategic progress during the quarter. In the Upstream, both the Usan project offshore Nigeria and the Caesar\/Tonga field in the Gulf of Mexico achieved first production. Both deepwater projects are expected to ramp up to peak production within 1 year. We recently announced the signing of a Heads of Agreement with Chubu Electric to deliver 1 million tons per annum of LNG from our Wheatstone Project. With this agreement, Chevron now has over 70% of our equity LNG from Wheatstone covered under long-term offtake agreements. ","In the Downstream, we sanctioned a multiyear expansion of our Singapore additives plant. The first phase of the expansion is targeted to start up in 2014. We also continued our Downstream portfolio rationalization efforts, completing asset sales in Spain and Canada. And finally, we signed an agreement for the sale of our Perth Amboy terminal, which we expect to complete later this year. ","Turning now to Slide 18. Looking ahead, we are keenly focused on executing our major capital projects. We have line of sight on many of the significant milestones planned for this year. We're off to a good start and we intend to keep you updated on our progress throughout the year. ","In summary, we started the year with strong earnings and healthy cash flows. We are focused on safe and reliable base business operations and progressing our major capital projects. We continue to be disciplined in our investments and in managing our cost structure. And as we just demonstrated with our dividend announcement, we're committed to sharing our success with our shareholders.","That now concludes our prepared remarks, and we welcome your questions. So Sean, I'd ask that you open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And my first question is, since we have Pat on the call, my first question is on the large cash position that you oversee. Net cash is growing again in the quarter. And first, on the dividend with the 11% raise versus a 6% CAGR that drives a higher dividend yield and a more publicized raise by one of your peers. So is this a onetime increase or a design to draw down some of your excess cash position over time? Can you kind of provide some color on why and how you made the relatively higher raise in this quarter? And then secondly with a larger portfolio of capital projects and our view of a higher capital budget in '13, should we expect you to run a relatively higher cash position through 2014, when the free cash flow usually jumps and the new project queues begin to come onstream?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay, Evan, let me take a shot at that. First, with respect to our dividend, the 11% rate we felt was fully in-line with the cash generation capability of the firm currently and also as we look out. We have strong confidence in our cash flows coming forward. And also, if you look at our history really since oil prices began to appreciate back in 2004, we've had a CAGR on dividends that has been just about at the 11%. So I think of it as being fairly typical with our previous patterns. Last year, you'll recall that we had 2 dividend increases, that combined, gave us a 12.5% quarterly rate increase. So we feel we've been very competitive on the dividend. I don't want to get into a position of having to step out in front of our Board of Directors on this, so I can't provide any future guidance as to what the remainder part of the year might look like. But suffice it to say that dividends are a very important priority in terms of our uses of cash. It is our, in fact, the #1 priority, so we'll look carefully at that every quarter. In terms of the second part of your question about our cash balances and as we look out in terms of funding needs, I think we have been pretty specific in saying that 2012 is really it's the high C&E year. We've got significant LNG commitments. We've got significant deepwater commitments. And as we get further along into having some of these projects move into -- past the 50% mark on their construction phase, I think we will feel better about relinquishing some of our cash cushion. We really think of that cash cushion as being a risk mitigator to be able to handle commodity price swings and margin swings. These are really important projects that we keep completely on track from a funding standpoint, and so having a little bit of cash cushion as we're on this heavy investment phase seems to make a great deal of sense to us.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, I appreciate that. And second, if I may. I know you recently signed a Chubu -- the Japanese power company in long-term offtake for Wheatstone. I mean, maybe have you seen any changes here in this slope or the oil price linkage versus other offtakes signed for Gorgon and Wheatstone, and any comments just on maybe general demand levels? I know you're going to market an additional 10% to 20% of that gas.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Actually, we've been very heartened by discussions that we've had most recently with potential buyers of LNG, whether it be Wheatstone or Gorgon. I would say in a post-Fukushima environment, we haven't had seen any degradation of terms on these contract and discussions that we have had. Our objective for both of the projects really is to get into an 85-ish percent of the offtake under secure long-term agreements, and we're really well on path for both of those major projects.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And my question is -- has to do with Slide 15, I think, indicates that operating costs increased by around 10% to 15% annually during the past 5 years. So my question is that with your global perspective, I want to see how you envision this trend evolving in coming years? Or what you're seeing over maybe a term when using the Chevron oil price deck?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Well, actually, Doug, I think the way we look at this is over time, there's been a fairly steady pattern between an increase in the overall cost structure as associated with an increase in the overall revenue structure. So we have not seen any discontinuities of any -- in any way, shape or form to show that. And so I think it would be reasonable if you're thinking about how to project out using your own oil price forecast. I think keeping a somewhat common relationships in that profile would make sense.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. So -- and secondly, I wanted to see if we could get a kind of a summary update or brief update, to the degree possible, on the situations in Brazil and Ecuador? There's been movement on both and just any color or next steps that you can provide on these 2 situations, please?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Sure. Let me start. I'll start with Ecuador here. I think the most important thing that has happened of late is that The Hague has accepted jurisdiction and -- for the case, and has basically reiterated their requirement that Ecuador do -- take all means that it can through the judiciary, through the executive branch, through the legislative branch to prevent enforcement of the judgment anywhere in the globe. So that has been a positive step. In terms of the local Lago Agrio case, it has been remanded or is sent to the equivalent of the Supreme Court in Ecuador, but has not yet been accepted there. So I can't give you any more color there. I can't speak to timing. And I do encourage everybody to continue to look at our website, because we put everything that's happening out there on that website. In terms of Brazil, the criminal case against our employees and the 2 civil cases against the company have been sent or remanded to the Rio de Janeiro court out of the Campos court. And we are still very confident that a transparent and an impartial review of the facts will demonstrate that Chevron and its employees acted very responsibly, acted very appropriately to the incident, that we didn't violate any laws or regulations. We will continue to defend our employees to the fullest extent. And as Jeanette said, we have a technical review of the Frade field underway to better understand the entire geology there. And we won't restart production until we have a complete confidence ourselves in the reliability and the safety and the ability to do so, and we are working lockstep with the regulators and with our partners on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you had any update in terms of cost inflation trends in some of your major Gulf of Mexico projects? You've obviously got Jack\/St. Malo, I think Tubular Bells, Big Foot, Buckskin, in various stages of progression. I think Hess on their call alluded to potentially some inflation on Tubular Bells. I'm just seeing if you're seeing that across your Gulf project portfolio?","Patricia E. Yarrington","So, Arjun, actually, we're -- I don't have any specific information to point to. I don't -- there's nothing that's come to mind that is material at this point.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So you're feeling good about the estimates you provided for those projects?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Yes, we are, and we're feeling good about the schedule for them.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Excellent. Can you provide a -- just an activity update on the Marcellus and the Utica? Obviously, gas prices are very low. You do have the carry there. Can you just provide any color on how you're thinking about drilling plans in the Marcellus? And any thoughts on how the Utica's progressing for you, if you have any results you can talk about there?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Sure, Arjun. Okay, I'd say the Marcellus, all of our activities are going according to plan. And in fact, we are ramping up, we will continue to ramp up as the year progresses. We're seeing some efficiencies some cost efficiencies as we had expected. Safety is going well, and as I said, production will ramp up. In terms of the Utica, we're really just doing site preparation, pad preparation at this point and drilling will begin a little bit later in the year, And we'll have to report on that in the second and third quarter calls, but it's really just site preparation at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question on the cash statement. Obviously, $8.4 billion cash from operations. Were there any sort of negative effects like working capital in that? Can you quantity that?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Yes, Ed, certainly, I can. Inventory was a big effect in the first quarter here. And actually, as you look at the variance compared to fourth quarter, it's an even bigger variance. So we had a drawdown in inventory in the fourth quarter that released cash of about $0.5 billion dollars, and we had a build of inventory in the first quarter that consumed cash by about $1.8 billion. So you have over a $2 billion swing there in just inventory alone on cash.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, okay. So I mean, if I add that back -- cash flow probably before working capital would be somewhere over $10 billion?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Yes, be close -- very good.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, just on the -- the CapEx run rate seems a bit low at the -- just at the beginning of the year. Is that just the usual timing?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Actually, it is. We look at this every year and we have a typical pattern. And first quarter 2012 looks just like the first quarter of the last 7 years in terms of its rate of spending relative to the full year spending.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And then just to follow up on our operational side, any update in terms of activity rates as you perhaps start to delineate some of the shale that you have in the Permian?","Patricia E. Yarrington","I don't know that I've got anything more than what we said just a month ago or so. The overall activity level, our expectation was to have about 200 wells, participation in 200 wells over the course of the year and that is exactly where we exactly where we sit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering & Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Can I ask for a little bit more color around the variability in your operating expense? It just strikes me as interesting that basically both key segments in both the U.S. and international swung the same direction, both last quarter as a negative and this quarter as a positive. And you seem to mention in all cases employee cost as a variable there. It seems to imply that there's some sort of common central variance that's allocated as an overhead to the segments. Severance, for example, or something like that. Is that in fact the case? And if so can you speak to any underlying cost trends unique to the segments on OpEx as opposed to a corporate-level allocation?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Sure. You picked up exactly on some of the messaging that we had there. We've got a compensation system where we have pay at risk for a large part of our employee population. And so the payment is awarded based on performance against targets and also relative competitive performance. So we make an assessment in the fourth quarter of each year as to how well we've done, and 2011 was a strong performance year for us. And that's really what you see as the variance between the costs incurred in the fourth quarter and then the absence of those costs really here in the fourth quarter. That's really one of the primary drivers that you see. In terms of the overall cost structure around the globe, they're really -- other than this one particular variance that I've talked to, there hasn't been anything of significance that is noteworthy or different.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Would you characterize your Upstream kind of global lease operating expenses relatively steady over the last couple of quarters?","Jeanette Ourada","Yes, I think it has been fairly steady over the last couple of quarters. If you recall, in 2011, we did call out -- it's about a $1.3 billion increase in operating expense due to a gas for oil swap agreement, and it was replaced with a purchasing agreement in Indonesia. So if you're looking at year-over-year, that may be what you're seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gammel of Macquarie.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","I had 2 actually, if I could, please. First, Angola LNG. Would you say you're still on schedule to potentially lift the cargo from the project in June? And would you expect that you would be sending most of these cargoes into Asia rather than the original plan of moving to the Gulf Coast? And also, how should we think about production from Angola LNG? Are you guys actually able to recognize equity gas here or is this gas that actually belongs to Senegal?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. So in terms of the cargo, our expectation is that the first cargo would be available and lifted in sort of the middle of this quarter here, certainly by the end of the second quarter. In terms of ownership of that cargo, we believe the first offtaker will be one of the partners, but it's not clear yet. I don't think the decision has been made yet as to who that necessarily will be. And in terms of the gas ownership, it's ours.","Jeanette Ourada","And we will recognize production as LNG is produced.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's great. And then I'm just trying to think about second quarter volumes at this point. The liftings difference that you showed in the variance chart, were you actually underlifted in 1Q and would expect to make up those volumes in 2Q? And do you have any significant maintenance activity that we should be thinking about for 2Q?","Jeanette Ourada","So remember when we showed the liftings, really what that is, is a variance of sales between quarters. So if you just want to look at the under\/overlift within the quarter, we had a very slight overlift in the first quarter. It's about 0.5%.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And any planned maintenance?","Jeanette Ourada","Well, we won't -- we don't forecast for the second quarter, but we did have about 50,000 barrels a day. Well, that's a variance between -- we had a substantial amount in the first quarter and quite substantial at TCO.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions, if I could. One, Pat, can you talk about whether any of your investment program in Argentina, either in your thinking or that the actual spending level may or may not have changed after the recent nationalization announcement of YPF? The second one in Venezuela, you have, I think, a couple of years ago signed a new agreement with PDVSA on a heavy oil upgrading project, Carabobo 3. I think that you may actually have pay some upfront fees for that or a bonus for that. I want to see if there's any status update on that one.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay, sure. First of all in Argentina, I would just say that any time you see an expropriation of assets like has occurred and you're an IOC and you go in under certain contract terms and places all around the globe and you see that happening in a location, it does give you pause. I mean, we do believe in contract sanctity and so it makes you certainly sit up and take notice. In terms of our particular activity, there hasn't been any change. In fact, we did just extend our concession extension in the El Trapial concession for an additional 10 years now. We have a concession now to 2032. So work continues apace there, but we do certainly take notice of it, that's for sure. In terms of Venezuela, both in our Carabobo and our Delta creek project stay, under the evaluation phase, we're working hard to identify appropriate kind of commercial development opportunities there.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So you don't actually have any actual spending or major spending in those project yet?","Patricia E. Yarrington","We don't have any major spending on those projects at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Back to the balance sheet, Pat, you've got 6.9% debt ratio presented here, which obviously is the gross debt right? So the net debt is closer to over 8% cash positive?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Correct.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And there's $19 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Firstly, I was wondering about the debt paydown. What was the rationale for that, given -- I would have thought it's better to carry more, not less, in this interested rate environment?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Right, and that was just an internal operational event for us. We happened to move from a proprietary issuance of commercial paper to a dealer issuance. We just decided that it wasn't a business we needed to be in. We made the transition at the end of the first quarter here. And while we were doing that transition, we just wanted to get the balances down low just to make sure we didn't have any glitches anywhere. So that's just strictly an internal Chevron operational thing, so I wouldn't read anything into that.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. The -- to retain the AA rating, which I know you've repeated many times, is a key aim, I guess you could probably carry about $10 billion of net debt without threatening that?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Well, actually, Paul, the way I look at it is it really depends on what you're using the borrowing for. If you have significant commercial opportunities or M&A opportunities or whatever, I mean, the substance of the increase in the debt is really important for evaluating for the rating agencies, how they view your creditworthiness. And they take into account a lot more than just the financial parameters as you now know. They look at a lot of our Upstream and Downstream operating performance parameters and assessing that rating. So I think we have a tremendous amount of borrowing capacity under the right circumstances and still have the ability to maintain the AA.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I guess, what I'm driving at is the scale of the safety cushion you've got here does seem to be kind of extreme with $19 billion of cash. I would have thought that you could be very, very safe and not have to carry quite so much, unless this is going to be the mother of all CapEx overruns.","Patricia E. Yarrington","No, we're not anticipating -- using your [ph] terminology here, I don't want to even use that phrase again, but we're not anticipating overruns on our capital program. It really is a circumstance for keeping some cushion now while we're in this heavy investment period and acknowledging that you've got the opportunity. It may be a very low opportunity or very low probability for excursion south on crude prices or real deterioration in margins, but we want to make sure that we've got enough to live through this heavy investment phase.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, okay, because I was just thinking that kind of more buyback, because you haven't -- the buyback's basically unchanged, right? So...","Patricia E. Yarrington","That's right. And we will look at the buybacks every quarter. We do it every quarter. This quarter, we were focused on the dividend here, which I think was a tremendously strong message about our confidence in future cash flows. Obviously as we go and as every quarter goes by and you've got reasonably higher oil prices, we continue to move the projects through to a higher stage of completion, then obviously, our requirements around cash lessen. And we will evaluate the share repurchase program as we do every quarter with our Board of Directors.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, and I think -- you stated, if I recall, at the Analyst Meeting that you felt that it was going to be kind of end 2013 that you would be, if you like, more confident about CapEx, final CapEx numbers in the safe?","Patricia E. Yarrington","I don't recall giving a 2013 date. I just -- we just know that we've got these significant projects, Gorgon, Wheatstone, Jack\/St. Malo, Big Foot, Deepwater, Nigeria, et cetera, where we've got a large profile here for 2012, and certainly, the LNG continuing here into 2013.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And my second question would be on volumes for this year. Forgive me if I missed this, but is there a guidance? I mean, you had a -- previously had a, if you like, a target for the year. Is there a reset number for that for 2012?","Patricia E. Yarrington","At this point, we're sticking with the guidance that we gave at the very beginning of the year. We did acknowledge here as much information as we have about Frade. George will be on the call here in the second quarter, and we'll update you at that point in time. I'll just say as we look forward, the things that are important to us here, the portfolio is performing on plan, outside of Frade, so we feel good about the number that we gave, again, outside of Frade. Frade, we don't have enough information to be able to say how that will play out here in the second quarter, third quarter, et cetera. The ramp-up of ALNG is an important parameter for us. The ramp-up of Usan is an important parameter for us, and the TCO, SGI\/SGP turnaround is an important parameter, and all of those will be important factors in 2012 production.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick Upstream ones. First, U.S. gas production was down about 10% from the fourth quarter. Was that a price-related shut-in?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Well, U.S. gas would be the Alaska Cook Inlet sale. That property alone -- that property sale alone was worth about 17,000 barrels a day on a BOE basis.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so no shut-ins in your existing assets there?","Patricia E. Yarrington","No, I mean, I will say that we are -- we already have our portfolio and we have been working our portfolio to as minimal dry gas as we possibly can. The only exception that we've got going there would be Marcellus, and Marcellus has got the $1.3 billion carry. I guess it's actually now about a $1.2 billion carry because we've used some of it now since March. But we are definitely focused on liquids-rich plays.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on Liberia, can you just confirm that the first prospect is in fact spudding this week, and maybe provide a time line for results from that?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Well, we -- I can tell you that its spudding is imminent. I hate to go out further on a limb than that, and I really don't have any more information as to how long it will be and what the evaluation period will be, et cetera. So...","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On your -- could you give us a little bit of an update on your exploration -- the exploration wells you drilled in the first quarter? I believe you were still looking for results from Bear's Hump and then you were drilling a well in the Duvernay and the Pearl Mouth Basin in China. And also if you can give us a little bit of an update on what you will try to drill in the second quarter?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay, so Bear's Hump is -- the drilling results are basically are still being evaluated. In the Duvernay, we are on our third well, and we are, I guess I would say, encouraged from that standpoint. And what was the third area?","Jeanette Ourada","China.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Oh, China. So China, we did have our third dry hole. That was -- the quarter recognized 2 of those dry holes here. And so we've had our third dry hole, 1 each in the 3 blocks. But I will say we have significant acreage there and some of the results were encouraging, and those results will be used then to help us do the next site selection for the follow-on drilling program.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then your future lineup here for the second quarter? I believe you're going to spud Coronado or have you already spud that well?","Patricia E. Yarrington","No, Coronado would be later in the year. I don't have a definitive time for Coronado. And most of our drilling rig activity right now in the Gulf of Mexico are focused on development wells. We've got 4 rigs drilling on development wells for the Jack\/St. Malo and Big Foot properties. And we have the Santa Ana coming, which actually is in the Gulf of Mexico now and will be soon available for drilling operations.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us an update on North American onshore rig activity? How many rigs are you running in North America, and how many of those are devoted to kind of liquids-rich or oil-rich plays?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Yes, I don't have specific rig activity in North America. I can just tell you that in the Marcellus, we continue to execute the evaluation and development plan that we laid out. You'll see a gradual ramp-up in Marcellus production over the course of the year. And Wolfcamp, we were pretty specific in saying we expected to participate in 200 wells there. Those are liquids-rich plays. And I guess I would say from a -- going back to the natural gas versus crude or liquids component there, I mean, all of the gas that we've got here really is liquids focused. Everything that we're producing is cash breakeven or better on the natural gas side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Iain Reid of Jefferies.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can I come back to your production, your PSC sensitivity guidance? This is very useful, actually. And on the trigger part of it, I think you said that there's no triggers coming from rate of return or production thresholds over the next few years. Is it possible to say what oil price you assess that at?","Jeanette Ourada","Yes, we used the 2011 average prices, so around $110 per barrel for that sensitivity.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and that includes fields which have just started up, such as Usan, I presume?","Jeanette Ourada","Yes, that included the whole portfolio. We create a curve for each PSC and then combine them together and test each one and then test at the portfolio level.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on cost oil -- cost recovery, is it possible to say -- is there any kind of major fields coming out of the major part of cost oil, which is the CapEx recovery over a similar period?","Jeanette Ourada","Over that same period, not a lot, I would say. So if you would have asked me 2 years ago, we probably would have talked about Agbami. But I think we've talked about -- we pushed Agbami 2 back a little bit, because the first set of wells were performing exceptionally well. And pushing Agbami 2 investment back a bit has really muted any type of decline you see in cost oil.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and nothing in Angola?","Jeanette Ourada","Nothing material in Angola, no.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, interesting. And on a different topic, could you tell us what the status is of the Nigerian gas blowout?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Yes, actually. So we continue at this point to drill the relief well and to set ourselves up to permanently plug and abandon it. We haven't had any gas detected from the well since the fire stopped burning in the very early part of March. The relief well is fairly close to the intersection point. And our expectation at this point would be that if we're successful there, then we would a permanently abandoned well by the end of May.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what sort of production has been shut-in due to this? A few thousand barrels a day, huh?","Patricia E. Yarrington","It's very, very, very modest. It is just 2,000 barrels a day.","Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And there's been no knock-on effect from regulators, those Brazilian style labor [ph] reaction?","Patricia E. Yarrington","No, we have been working very closely with the Nigerian government and the regulators, the local communities to move this along constructively.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate Minyard of JPMorgan.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a quick point of clarification. On Slide 9, you walked through the variability in production versus the prior quarter. And if I caught you correctly, I believe you said the Alaska sale was about a 17,000 barrel equivalent per day impact. But then you also had mentioned the Angola turnaround. So it looks like the Alaska sale might have accounted for the entire block of net production constraints or the impact on the base business? Or am I -- was it a timing issue with the Alaska sale?","Jeanette Ourada","Thanks, Kate. There's certainly a lot embedded in that 17,000. So we also called out the negative additional impacts. We had a planned turnaround in Angola, and then we also had some cyclones in Australia and some pretty severe weather in Kazakhstan through the quarter, so those were both negative. But offsetting those, we had turnarounds in the fourth quarter in both Trinidad and then in the Gulf of Mexico, we were installing the water injection module on Tahiti. So both of those were positive impacts for the quarter that kind of offset each other.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, got it, that's clear. And then just one other question on the -- just looking at the tax rate, was there anything about the geographic distribution of the overlift that resulted in maybe a variability in the tax rate? It looks like your tax rate was coming in just a little bit lower than what we would have previously modeled. So is there anything about the mix shift based on the overlift that might have driven that? Or is this kind of the right run rate, kind of all else equal?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Actually, our tax rate came in for the quarter at about a 46% rate, and it's a little higher than we have seen here. And what we really had is just jurisdictional mix effect between -- within international operations as well as within the Downstream. In the Downstream, too, we also had the asset sales, and those came through with essentially a very low effective tax rates. And so by default, that, in fact, makes our overall worldwide income more internationally Upstream-oriented here from a tax rate standpoint, and so that tends to boost the number. If you look forward, I would say our best guidance would be in the mid-40% range on a go-forward basis for us.","Operator","Our final question comes from Allen Good of Morningstar.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of questions surrounding your comments on domestic drilling and the preference for liquids over dry gas. Was that in reference just sort of drilling activity or were you referring as well to acreage additions? And if so was there any acreage additions in the first quarter that would be material compared to what the -- I guess, the acreage breakout you gave us during the Analyst Day that would have changed in those allocations significantly?","Patricia E. Yarrington","All right. We haven't had any material acreage additions here in the first quarter. So what we provided back in March is the latest update that we have there. And I was really talking about drilling activity and our focus on production and trying to ensure that we are value-focused in our production efforts and our drilling efforts.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So as far as acreage additions and I don't even want to go as far as saying maybe potentially acquisitions, but as far as dry gas, I mean, is there any more interest here given the level of prices and potential attractiveness of assets? Or is that just something that's completely off the table at this point?","Patricia E. Yarrington","I don't think we want to -- I don't think we ever take anything off the table. I think we're -- I just would emphasize our value approach here. And if there is a combination of opportunity where we can see value down the line, then that's something that we would take a look at, but it has to be able to compete in our portfolio. We've got a very strong portfolio and so the hurdle is already very high for any sort of additions to it.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then can you just give us an update on the Downstream assets that were currently being marketed, if there's any sort of progress there or there's any additions to the list that you provided about a month ago as far as what you're looking at to dispose of?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Yes, no additions to the list. The real changes that have happened we called out with Spain and the Envirofuels in Canada and then also the Perth Amboy terminal, but nothing additional other than what Mark presented at the Security Analyst Meeting.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay, thank you. I think that's kind of run through the queue here. So I'd like to close off here. Let me just say that I appreciate everybody's participation on the call, and in particular, your interest in Chevron. I want to thank all of the analysts for putting your questions forward because it helps everybody's understanding of the company. Thank you very much, everyone. Goodbye.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes Chevron's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Pat Yarrington","Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Jeff Gustavson, General Manager for Investor Relations.","We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s first quarter earnings were $4.5 billion or $2.36 per diluted share. Results are consistent with our earlier guidance, where we highlighted specific negative impacts associated with foreign exchange and selected asset impairments and related charges, which totaled approximately $500 million for the quarter or $0.26 per share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 12%. Our debt ratio at the end of March was approximately 13%.","Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $8.4 billion during the first quarter. Cash capital expenditures were $8.5 billion. At quarter end, our cash balances totaled $16.2 billon, giving us a net debt position of $6.9 billion.","On Slide 5, this week Chevron\u2019s Board of Directors declared a $1.07 per share quarterly common dividend payable in mid-June. This represents an 8% annualized payout increase. Since 2004, we have grown the dividend by a compound annual rate in excess of 10%, which leads the competitor groups.","In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the second quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount. We are committed to competitive, consistent and growing shareholder distributions. This demonstrates the importance we placed on balancing long-term investor return objectives, achieved through reinvestment in the business, with near-term return objectives achieved through distributions.","It also reflects the strength of our balance sheet, our strong portfolio and our confidence in the cash generation potential of our growth projects.","Turning to the next slide. We\u2019ve incorporated two new slides into the presentation this quarter, which provide year-over-year comparisons consistent with our earnings press release. The first, shown on Slide 6, compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year.","First quarter 2014 earnings were $4.5 billion, approximately $1.7 billion lower than first quarter 2013 results. Adverse foreign exchange movements accounted for $325 million or 20% of the overall decline. You\u2019ll recall that foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effects with very little cash flow impact.","Upstream earnings were down $1.6 billion. In addition to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of about $225 million, the deterioration reflected lower crude oil production and liquids realizations and higher tax effects, DD&A and exploration expenses.","Downstream results were essentially flat. And the other segment reflected the impairment of a mining asset, which resulted in an approximately $265 million absolute impact during the quarter, and was offset to a large degree by lower corporate expenses.","Turning to Slide 7. I\u2019ll now compare results for the first quarter of 2014 with the fourth quarter of 2013. First quarter earnings were $418 million lower than fourth quarter results.","Upstream earnings were down $545 million, with adverse foreign exchange movements accounting for two-thirds of this decline. The timing of listings was the second significant contributor to upstream quarter-on-quarter deterioration.","Downstream results increased by $320 million with nearly equal improvements noted in the U.S. and the international segments. The current quarter had favorable impacts from lower operating expenses, stronger chemical results and positive foreign exchange movements, all of which more than offset the adverse volume effects of a heavier turnaround schedule.","The variance in the other bar largely reflects the impairment of a mining asset, partially offset by lower corporate expenses.","Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment. Jeff?","Jeff Gustavson","Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were $109 million higher than fourth quarter\u2019s results. Higher realizations increased earnings by $130 million, mainly due to the rise in U.S. natural gas prices. Overall, liquids realizations also rose in large part reflecting crude pricing strength on the West Coast. Lower production volumes, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico reduced earnings by $50 million.","The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including the absence of year-end LIFO losses and lower exploration expenses, partially offset by higher DD&A.","Turning to Slide 9. International upstream earnings were $654 million lower than last quarter\u2019s results. Realizations decreased earnings by $50 million consistent with the decline in Brent prices between quarters. The timing of liftings across multiple countries decreased earnings by $235 million.","Year-to-date, we are approximately 4% undirected, which as you know, should reverse in the coming quarters. Lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $190 million, mainly driven by fewer exploration well write-offs and overall lower geological and geophysical expenses across multiple locations.","An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $355 million. The first quarter had a loss of about $55 million, compared to a gain of $300 million in the fourth quarter of last year.","The tax in other bar reflects unfavorable tax effects, many of which were non-income related. This quarter\u2019s results includes several non-operational items mainly impairments which negatively impacted upstream segment earnings by about $150 million.","Adjusting for these effects, our unit earnings for the quarter would have been approximately $20 per barrel. The reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP earnings can be found in the appendix of this slide presentation.","The upstream segment was also negatively impacted by FX effects in the timing of liftings, both of which are normally transitory in nature.","Slide 10 summarizes the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter 2014 and the fourth quarter 2013. Production increased by 12,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects contributed 21,000 barrels per day, related to higher volumes at Angola LNG and the ramp-up associated with the Papa-Terra field offshore, Brazil.","Shale and tight resources growth contributed 12,000 barrels per day driven by production increases from the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian, as well as continued production ramp up from the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina. The base business in other bar includes the impact of normal field declines and weather-related disruptions, primarily due to extremely low temperatures in Kazakhstan, partially offset by lower production downtime related to several assets.","Slide 11 is the second to two new slides incorporated into the presentation this quarter, and compares the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of last year.","Production was 57,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago. Growing volumes from our shale and tight resources in the Permian and the Marcellus regions in the U.S. and the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina increased first quarter production by 37,000 barrels per day.","Major capital projects contributed 23,000 barrels per day, driven primarily by production growth from Angola LNG and Papa-Terra in Brazil. Production was impacted by external constraints related to the very cold temperatures in Kazakhstan, as well as lower demand in Thailand, due to a lighting strike which damaged a customer\u2019s gas processing plant in the third quarter of 2013.","The base business in other bar includes normal field declines along with other unrelated impacts. Our base decline rate averaged less than 3% between quarters.","Turning to Slide 12. U.S. downstream results increased $157 million between quarters. Planned turnarounds at our Richmond, California and Pascagoula, Mississippi refineries lowered volumes and decreased earnings by $85 million compared to last quarter.","More than offsetting these volume effects were benefits from lower OpEx worth $95 million and stronger chemicals results worth $80 million. Stronger U.S. chemicals results reflected higher margins for benzene, olefins and polyolefins from our Chevron Phillips Chemical joint-venture.","The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, primarily higher gains on midstream asset sales, partially offset by modestly lower realized margins, particularly on the West Coast, reflecting weak seasonal demand.","Moving to Slide 13. International downstream earnings increased $163 million between quarters. Reduced volumes from turnarounds at our Thailand and South Africa refineries decreased earnings by $75 million during the quarter. Stronger Asia R&M margins improved earnings by $70 million. Increased demands drove refining crack spreads higher particularly for low gas and fuel oil.","In addition, favorable price lag effects improved marketing margins. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $85 million, about half of which is related to fuel costs. Reduced foreign exchanges losses contributed about $70 million to earnings. The first quarter had a loss of $28 million, compared to a loss of $96 million in the fourth quarter.","The other bar includes a number of unrelated items, including higher chemicals results partially offset by the absence of positive year-end LIFO inventory effects recorded in the fourth quarter.","With that, I\u2019d now like to turn it back to Pat.","Pat Yarrington","Okay, Jeff. Thanks. Turning to Slide 14. We hosted our security analyst meeting in early March, where we provided a comprehensive update on the company\u2019s performance, projects and future growth prospects.","At that time, full information was not available for some of the competitor comparisons. It is available now and the segment return on capital employed updates are shown here. Our upstream return on capital employed for 2013 was just over 17%. We have led the direct peer group for three years.","In addition, our returns in 2013 were nearly twice the average returns of the larger E&P group and 3% higher than the very best company in that group. This speaks to the strength of our portfolio and is especially impressive considering our current levels of reinvestment, which we expect will generate peer-leading volume growth going forward.","Our downstream return on capital employed turned to lower in 2013, consistent with the rest of the industry. We delivered a 10% return and held the number two rank in the peer group, our sustained position for the last four years.","Turning to Slide 15. An updated information on 2013 upstream cash margins. During 2013, with the $38 per barrel cash margins, we were the best in the peer group by over $10 per barrel. We continue to post the highest realizations in the peer group. Our oil weighted portfolio is providing us with a lasting relative advantage.","We\u2019re also competitive on operating costs and have made sound investment decisions, both of which support our strong cash margin positions. Over the past four years, the movement in our cash margin relative to the competition has been remarkable, as shown on the chart on the left. While we\u2019ve gained $15 per barrel in cash margin, our peers have gained only $8 on average. Importantly, we expect to maintain or even increase our cash margins going forward.","At our analyst meeting, we used a Brent price of $110 per barrel as the basis for our forward cash flow and production projections. We have received a number of questions around the selection of the $110 per barrel price, and I want to be clear that this is not an internal price forecast, but is simply the actual average Brent price over the 2011 to 2013 time period.","Using prior year\u2019s actual pricing is the same methodology we have applied for several years now in our analyst presentations.","At this historical three-year average Brent price of $110 per barrel, our cash margin is expected to increase to over $40 per barrel later this decade. This is a critical part of our value proposition, as the combination of strong volume growth and an accretive cash margin is expected to drive significant growth in our cash flow from operations over the next several years.","Turning to Slide 16. I\u2019d like to provide a brief progress update on some of our major capital projects and other growth opportunities. These are laid out across three growth themes: deepwater, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico; LNG, in particular, our two large Australian projects; and shale and tight resource areas, most notably the Permian Basin in the U.S. and the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina.","Starting with the deepwater. As noted last month, the Jack\/St. Malo platform was moored in a title location earlier this year. We continued installation and commissioning activities including final testing of flowlines and export lines. The project is on-budget and is on-track for late startup in the fourth quarter of this year.","For Tubular Bells, which is operated by Hess, hook-up and commissioning is nearly 40% complete and startup is expected before year-end. We also made significant progress at Big Foot during March. The oil export pipeline has been installed and we are preparing to let the drilling module to the top sides later this month. We expect startup to occur mid-2015.","Moving onto our LNG project. We continue to make excellent progress at Gorgon, which is now, through April, 80% complete. The final two gas turbine generators have been installed and additional progress has been made on the LNG tanks, jetty and other related infrastructure on the island. All major 2014 milestones are on track and we expect plant startup and first gas in mid-2015.","For Wheatstone, we are now at 33% complete. Progress continues to be made at the plant site on the Wheatstone platform and with the offshore development drilling campaign. Wheatstone remains on track to startup in late 2016. Gorgon and Wheatstone are critical contributors to our future growth plans and we are pleased with the study progress being made on both of these projects.","As in prior quarters, we have posted updated photos of both projects on our investor website. I encourage you to take a look.","We also continued to make progress on our shale and tight resource developments, which nicely complement our large major capital projects. We have an active drilling and development program in the Permian Basin and we have drilled over 120 wells so far this year.","We continue to focus on capital and execution efficiency, as well as the identification of sweet spots throughout our extensive acreage position in both the Midland and Delaware sub basins.","We are also making steady progress in the Vaca Muerta Share in Argentina, progressing this year\u2019s development program, and we recently signed additional agreements for incremental explorations acreage in the play.","On Slide 17, I also like to touch on additional progress made elsewhere. We reached final investment decision and received approval from the U.K. government to proceed with the development of the Alder Field in the Central North Sea. We achieved first projections in the Chirag Oil Project in Azerbaijan and acquired new exploration acreage in Myanmar.","In the downstream, we achieved mechanical completions of our new base oil facility at our Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery. Once fully ramped up, this increases our capacity and premium base oil by over 70%, making Chevron the largest premium base oil producer in the world.","In addition, Chevron Phillips Chemical 1-Hexene project as well as Oronite Singapore Expansion project recently achieved mechanical completions. Lastly, CPChem started construction on its new Gulf Coast Petrochemicals project, which capitalizes on advanced feedstock source from shale gas in North America. This project is expected to startup in 2017.","Now, that concludes our prepared remarks. I appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. We\u2019re now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and to one follow-up if necessary. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, I\u2019d ask that you open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.","Pat Yarrington","Hi Evan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Pat, thanks for the comments on the impairment, as it clearly affects a clean comparison of your quarterly upstream profitability. I missed it. I know you\u2019ve identified $400 million to $500 million of upstream impairments in your reconciliation. I see $150 million. And I thought I heard you mention $265 million. Can you just talk me through those numbers once again please?","Pat Yarrington","Sure. The interim update we\u2019ve talked about a total of $400 million to $500 million in additional negative charges. And that included foreign exchange and impairments, but we did reference strongly in that total the mining component. That mining component is $265 million.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Pat Yarrington","And then in the appendix slide that you\u2019ll see, there is also $150 million worth of upstream-related impairments in the international segment.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I see, I got you on the total. Thanks. And I guess my second question, just your net debt increased. It was at $3.2 billion in the quarter, smaller capital increase. I mean I know you intent to bridge to 2015 and beyond when productive capital begins to drop and cash flow from new projects commences. Where do you see the debt limit? Is it at AA level, at the mid 20s, and then what type of commodity price cushion do you forecast in crossing that bridge and maintaining current shareholder distributions? Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","Okay. Evan, I think you referenced several questions there and we had a couple of really important words in there. One you talked about bridging. That is an important concept for us. Our free cash flow was essentially neutral in this particular quarter. And you\u2019re right, so net debt did increase and that reference that\u2019s related to distribution to shareholders.","We\u2019re very comfortable with that pattern. It\u2019s a pattern that we\u2019ve had for the last few quarters. It\u2019s the pattern that we could see continuing on here in 2014, and then when we get into 2015 and you begin to see these volumes pick-up and the cash flows pick-up, then we get into a different state.","We do want to maintain the AA credit rating. We have a lot of room between where our debt level is today at 13% and what would be necessary to even call that into jeopardy. And by a lot, I mean several billion dollars worth of additional borrowing capacity.","We do test our own plan against a low priced environment. And I can tell you that against the low price environment, even continuing on with the capital program that we have, we are very comfortable with the distributions that we\u2019re making, even in a low priced environment and maintaining the AA.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Can you just share what that low price means?","Pat Yarrington","No, we don\u2019t want to go that far. Don\u2019t want to go that far. So we do look at the overall capital position and financial position of the firm. We test it against the oil prices and we feel comfortable and look where we are.","The other thing I would mention is that we do have \u2013 you\u2019ll recall from the March presentation, we are anticipating assets of proceeds of $10 billion over the next three years.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right. I appreciate. Thanks for taking my questions","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, good morning, and thanks for the extra disclosures in the presentation. Just a question on cash flow, I mean I think capital you said that $8 billion. It\u2019s been running higher than that and volume is flattish in the macro environment and you\u2019ve shouted out under-lifts and some extra tax but where there any other things that may have contributed to a slightly lower cash flow this quarter?","Pat Yarrington","Nothing of any substantial nature. It was not \u2013 I mean with the under-lifting circumstance, it is not a particularly strong U.S. downstream quarter. So I think there are some operational factors that really lead to the $8 billion cap generation, $8.4 billion.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good. Thanks very much. And then Gorgon, you\u2019ve said 80% complete. You\u2019ve obviously just had the Analyst Day and said mid-2015, other people \u2013 perhaps even partners are saying perhaps more later in the year, sort of 2016. I don\u2019t want to get into a debate that, he said, she said, but what\u2019s the critical path that you think in terms of getting Gorgon up mid-2015? What are the risks that you\u2019re now worried about as you get further into the final stages here?","Pat Yarrington","I think we have 20 of the 21 critical process modules for Train 1 and the infrastructure, the common facilities infrastructure on the island. The remaining train is due shortly, will arrive shortly. So it really becomes a process of the hook-up and commissioning. And I think that is \u2013 we\u2019ve just come through kind of weather period. So we\u2019re moving into good weather.","And so I think weather continues to be a risk. And I think labor productivity continues to be a risk, but both of those, I mean those are aspects of this project that we have been managing now for 4.5, five years. And so those are clearly on everybody\u2019s minds at in terms of managing through this. And I want to reiterate that the project is on track. We\u2019re aiming for and targeting that mid-2015 startup.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi, good morning, Jeff and Pat. If I could, kind of a big one and the small one. The big one is, you have an interesting number, Pat, which is on productive capital. Could you update us on that number and talk a little bit about how you calculate the number so that we can perhaps use it to compare with other companies? And the follow-up is on Vaca Muerta and I\u2019ll ask you that due course. Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","Okay. Well, basically we just look at \u2013 it really is just assets under construction, I mean definitionally. It\u2019s assets in our work in progress account as a percentage of our total capital employed. And the information that we provided back in March suggested that we\u2019re at pretty high level, predominantly because of the LNG projects that we have underway, as well as the couple of Gulf of Mexico deepwater projects.","And we indicated that we saw that stepping down significantly over the next three year period of time. And I also said verbally that we saw pretty important stair steps going from 2013 to 2014 and again to \u201815 and \u201816. We didn\u2019t give actual numbers, I don\u2019t really want to do that, but that pattern that was on our slide back in March is still one that we hold to.","So as you see these projects come online, they move out of that WIP account, that work-in-progress account into a producing asset account.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","My other question was that there was an actual numbers on productive capital. And I guess if you could update us on capital employed or at least the last available number?","Pat Yarrington","Well, year-end capital employed was about $171 billion. And what we \u2013 right, so the information we gave in the slide was a three-year average there.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. And what was the unproductive number?","Jeff Gustavson","So Paul, the three-year average \u201811 to \u201813 was in the low 40% range.","Pat Yarrington","Right.","Jeff Gustavson","Moving down to the mid 30s range for \u201814 to \u201816, but that\u2019s the average \u201814 through \u201816, steps down each of those \u2013 in each of those years our historic average here maybe the high 20s.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Yes, that\u2019s right. So it was percentages around corner [ph].","Pat Yarrington","It was percentages. And we use the averages and you should \u2013 I think it\u2019s fair to say that 2011 was the lowest of the three years. 2012 was the middle of the three years and 2013 was the highest of the three years, but the three-year average there was at low 40s. And then what we\u2019re saying is \u201814, \u201815 and \u201816 will reverse that pattern.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Yes, understood. Okay. That\u2019s helpful on that calculation. And then if I can, can you do a little bit more to strip out Argentina. You\u2019ve kind of bundled it with Permian.","Pat Yarrington","Okay.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","And you plan to wish that still acquisition growth as opposed to organic growth? Thank you.","Pat Yarrington","Yes. Well, so I think that in terms of the Vaca Muerta play itself, we\u2019re continuing to make progress there. Our plan is to drill about 140 wells. This year we\u2019ve got about 17, 18 or 19 rigs drilling at this particular point in time in production there. On a growth basis is about 17,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re encouraged by the well we\u2019ve built, both on cost and productivity, but there is still \u2013 its early days. There is still a long way to go but we\u2019re encouraged so far.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. I think I\u2019ll take it offline on rig count in terms of volumes year-over-year. You\u2019re just obviously saying that on the variance you\u2019d bundled Vaca with Permian.","Pat Yarrington","I see. I misunderstood the question.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","No, thanks for the answer. Absolutely, that was just the follow-up really.","Jeff Gustavson","So year-over-year, Paul, we haven\u2019t booked production in the first quarter of last year. We started booking production in the fourth quarter. So there is a contribution fourth quarter to first quarter but over quarters. I mean it is acquisition related, but if you want to talk more specifically about it just talk me offline.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Jeff and Pat. I\u2019ve got also the one big and one small one, if that\u2019s okay. On the impairments part, is that the reason for the high DD&A number, and if so, can you give us an idea of what the run rate should be?","Pat Yarrington","It certainly is a contributor to the high DD&A rate. Absolutely that\u2019s a factor. And in terms of general DD&A, I think that it\u2019s fair to say that overall quarter DD&A is going to go forward, move up. Our expectation would be they would move up in 2014 relative to 2013. And we think opportunities in acre bell [ph] rising for the next couple of years, but then flattening out overtime. The patterns on both the absolute and the per barrel is something that you would absolutely expect because of recent investments and our future investments that obviously is also impacted by reserve ad timing and the mix of our projects etcetera.","PPC or pre-productive capital as we talked about is going to come down. So I think the thing you\u2019ve got to keep in mind here too is that for these investments, there is evidencing itself and will evidence itself in our DD&A rate. We are giving the investments audience to the largest growth rate of the peer group. A 20% growth rate in volumes between now and 2017. So a significant investment, so generating significant volume growth.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. But I\u2019ll take the specifics on DD&A offline with Jeff if that\u2019s okay. My follow-up is really your last point, because I think the growth and the cash margins really actually fairly well understood. What simply we\u2019ve observed over the years is that not really gets paid by the market when it\u2019s accompanied by strong debt adjusted tools if you like, so the balance sheet is not expanding at the same time. So I\u2019m just kind of curious, when you look at your \u2013 you say you\u2019re absorbing the best 20% growth, how do you think about the trade-off that\u2019s $10 billion annual run rate on the balance sheet? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","So I mean I guess I think that if you\u2019ve got the project queue, a slowing project queue and you\u2019ve got a balance sheet that allows you to invest for that. And we do have a balance sheet. In fact you could really argue that for years we were under-levered relative to what might be optimal. So if you\u2019ve got this strong project queue and if you\u2019ve got the balance sheet to support it and the projects are value-accreting for the organization, for the firm, then I think that\u2019s exactly the kind of investment profile you ought to be undertaking.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. I appreciate your answers. Thanks Pat.","Pat Yarrington","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi guys. Good morning.","Pat Yarrington","Hi Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","I don\u2019t know whether you want to answer that. I think a lot of people are asking that for CPC your joint-venture, strategically is there any particular reason you need to owning that so that you can have synergy with your other operations, if not, if you look it as a financial investment, does it makes sense for you to only minority interest and put it up as a publicly traded entity together with your partner Phillips 66 and putting into the market so that you can recognize a much higher value given right now that you\u2019re trading at higher multiple than say both your partner and yourself?","Pat Yarrington","Yes, so I understand the question there. And I\u2019ll just start back with, when we put the two companies together, we had too I guess I would say sort of the meddling performing chemical companies, if we put them together. And it\u2019s been a wonderful marriage. The partners are very much aligned on how to run this business, where you extract value from this business.","And so it\u2019s a joint-venture that has worked very well and has been very successful, so we\u2019re very pleased. So, there no catalysts that\u2019s out there necessarily to say that we need to be doing something different. It is the part of the portfolio that has growth opportunities available to it. And we appreciate that, with this change in the U.S. gas production and advantaged feedstock opportunities here.","I think CPChem calls on the technical expertise of both of its parent company and we\u2019re able to and happy to assist them in that capacity. We think it fits nicely in our portfolio. It has \u2013 the chemical business is highly, highly cyclical, more so than our portfolio. And so we\u2019re able to withstand the adjustments that are there, we think that\u2019s an advantage as well.","So we are really seeing that there is huge catalyst for us to do something different. And it\u2019s not always clear that the PE multiples in these petrochemical commodity companies are always trading at multiples better than ours. So we like the joint-venture. We think it\u2019s well run. We\u2019re happy to assist and its growth projects and providing expertise and technical capability where we can. We\u2019re very satisfied with it, and I dare to say that our joint-venture partner will be feeling much the same.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, very good. Second question, can you give us a quick update where the Angola LNG going out, I just wondering you had 50% capacity. And also in the Permian with the 25 rigs, do you have a number that how many of them is currently running in the conventional and whether [indiscernible] already? Thank you.","Pat Yarrington","Okay, let me start with Angola and then you might to help me again on the second question. So on Angola, we did have recently a technical issue pop-up. We had a piping failure, which did result in an unplanned interruption to production. There was no fire. There were no injuries. It was a pretty localized damage. It was associated with the flare system. We are doing a root cause investigation and in fact that root cause analysis should be completed within a few days here is my understanding.","So the plant is currently shutdown and we\u2019ll need to take a look at that root cause analysis to understand what the go-forward operating plan looks like. That failure occurred sort of mid-April, early April, and it therefore was not an impact in the first quarter results.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Permian, the 25 rigs. How many of them is in unconventional drilling and of which how many of them is in the pad drilling already?","Pat Yarrington","Okay. So all of the 25 rigs in the Permian right now are in the unconventional. We have only one rig drilling in the conventional. And I think you\u2019re asking about pad drilling?","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes, correct.","Pat Yarrington","I don\u2019t have information on that specific at this point, Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Reid from Bank of Montreal. Your question please.","Iain Reid \u2013 Bank of Montreal","Yes. Hi guys. Thanks very much. Sorry about this, but can I get back to the impairments and asset divestments you put in the reconciliation back. Because I didn\u2019t understanding some of the stuff you talked about earlier. You got $150 million of E&P impairments. It looks like in the first quarter, and also $100 million gain on dispositions. I think you also got this mining write-down as well. If you just put those together for me again?","Pat Yarrington","Sure. So let\u2019s start with the biggest element, which is the mining element. We have a molybdenum mine in New Mexico. And the impairment charges that we talked about there and other related charges that I talked to at the very beginning, the $265 million relates to that. That asset from a segmented reporting basis is in our other segment.","In upstream, we noted a $150 million of impairments. It\u2019s in the international sector for us. So these are assets where we feel there is better opportunity in other portfolios basically.","And then the third element that was noted there was a asset sale gain. This was in our \u201cmidstream sector\u201d. It\u2019s really pipeline-related and that showed up in the downstream external segment.","Iain Reid \u2013 Bank of Montreal","Okay. Thanks very much. And secondly was, is it possible to update us on when we\u2019re likely to see the Tengiz hit [ph] to FID?","Pat Yarrington","Our targets for this year \u2013 our target is to have that towards the end of the year. I don\u2019t really have any additional information at this point. We were successful in getting the MoU signed back in the later part of last year, which really is a stage setting document to get all the partners aligned on the go-forward process. And so, we\u2019re in the process now of going through and working the cost estimates etcetera, etcetera. So all I can say is towards the end of this year.","Iain Reid \u2013 Bank of Montreal","And we should expect a kind of overall CapEx \u2013 growth CapEx for this project, and along the line just some of your major things you\u2019re doing in Australia. Is that correct, or is that kind of ballpark, right sort of number?","Pat Yarrington","Well, I\u2019m sorry. So I\u2019m sorry, TCO is Kazakhstan, right. I guess one last thing there on TCO. The FID is not kind of critical path. What was the question on Atyrau, I didn\u2019t quite understand?","Iain Reid \u2013 Bank of Montreal","Sorry, I just want to get an overall ballpark on Atyrau, what the overall cost estimate of the future growth project is going to be? Is it in the same ballpark as what you\u2019re doing in Australia?","Pat Yarrington","I see, Iain. We don\u2019t have an updated \u2013 we don\u2019t have a cost estimate until we go to FID. So that will be later and attached to the FID timings.","Iain Reid \u2013 Bank of Montreal","All right. Thanks Pat.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your question please.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks, good morning. First question on Jack\/St. Malo. You said that it was moored on location. I just want to understand a little bit, how much sort of wiggle room do you guys have from now to the startup to get that project going, and if there is an active hurricane season, have you built in that sort of weather into the startup and end of the year for that project?","Pat Yarrington","Well, it\u2019s my understanding that when we\u2019re putting these facilities out in the Gulf of Mexico, we do as much weather proofing as we possibly can. Obviously, when you\u2019re investing at the size of these facilities, that\u2019s an important consideration. So clearly having it moored is an important step. And so our expectation is that we would be able to handle any weather complications that might arise.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, fair enough.","Jeff Gustavson","Can I just to add, Faisel too.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Yes.","Jeff Gustavson","If there are hurricanes, you have to demobilize. If the folks that are working on it, that could slow things down a little bit, but we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s hard to estimate what\u2019s going to happen there.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand if you guys have sort of incorporated that into your guidance of the startup?","Pat Yarrington","In a general sense from a planning standpoint, we always do factor in Gulf of Mexico weather activities to a degree, right. But each year is a difference degree, you know what I mean.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Sure.","Pat Yarrington","So there is obviously a base load that we include in our plans, yes.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. That\u2019s fair. I understand. And then just on the under-lift, you guys talked about the sequential quarter-over-quarter charge of $235 million. Is that also fair to say that that\u2019s the absolute number too?","Jeff Gustavson","So I\u2019ll give you the absolute for the quarter is about $100 million, about half of that. So the rest of that is swing between the two quarters, Faisel.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, got you. Thanks. I appreciate the detail.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks for taking my questions. You\u2019re obviously talking a lot more proactively about the Permian, presumably you\u2019d like to get more value for that asset. Have you considered any kind of financial engineering solution that might unlock that value, more so than simply as one piece of your U.S. portfolio?","Pat Yarrington","Well, we think we actually try for sitting in, kind of in the catbird seat in terms of the acreage position that we\u2019ve got, the long standing acreage position we\u2019ve got, the royalty advantage that we have there. We have done joint-ventures, of a kind of \u2013 with for example, Cimarex, where we have partnered with similarly situated partners. And those kinds of things you could see us continuing to do on a go-forward basis. If you get commonality of infrastructure and location and you can get efficiencies of drilling where that you\u2019re fracking can really go from our property to their property. So we will continue to look for those opportunities for synergies.","We\u2019ve got a very active program scheduled for this year. It\u2019s over 500 wells. And 25 rigs, we\u2019ve done 120 drilling so far. So the activity level is at or perhaps little bit better than planned at this point. So we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities like that, but we\u2019re proceeding had on our own as well.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And just quickly, can I get an update on the exploration program in Liberia? I haven\u2019t heard about that in a while.","Pat Yarrington","Yes, we\u2019re not in a position to say anything more at this point.","Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. Fair enough, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simmons & Company. Your question please.","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons & Company","Thank you all for taking my question. My first one was on the 2014 production guidance, but understanding it\u2019s still very early in the year, just wanted to get a sense of how confident you guys are in the guidance right now, just considering some of the weather influence that you\u2019ve got in 1Q, the unplanned downtime at Angola LNG, and in 2Q and 3Q typically being heavier maintenance course. Just wanted to better understand how you guys are feeling about that internally and any cushion you might built-in into the guidance?","Pat Yarrington","Okay. That\u2019s a good question. I guess I would just start by saying the year is young. We\u2019ve only had four months or three months in here. There have been some positive. Jeff mentioned a figure about base business declines being at the 3% or little bit less than 3% level. So that\u2019s a very good positive.","One thing we haven\u2019t mentioned of a positive nature is at Frade, we now have 10 producing wells on and we continue to make progress to bring on additional wells there. We talked about the Permian ramp ups and the Vaca Muerta ramp ups that are occurring. So those are all working in our favor.","Clearly weather has been a negative for us in the first quarter. On an absolute basis, we would estimate that that was worth 20,000 barrels a day or so absolutely negative in the quarter. I mentioned the A-LNG operational issues that we have there. So you put those altogether, you got some pluses, you got some minuses.","And the back-end of the year, we\u2019ve got Tubular Bells and Jack\/St. Malo, both of which are scheduled to come online, so our production ramp ups are kind of back-end loaded. And both of those projects are on track. So the best I can say is, and I\u2019ll go back and say, we built-in weather contingencies in our Gulf of Mexico plan in particular, for a base load amount.","I\u2019ll just go back and say the year is young. We\u2019ve got positive and negatives out there. We feel that the guidance that we gave, the $26.10 is the best guidance that we have at this particular point in time. And as we do every year on the second quarter, we\u2019ll update you with how things look at that point in time.","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons & Company","Okay, great. Thanks for that. That was very helpful. And then my follow-up was on, one of your three primary growth themes of deepwater. And I\u2019m more focused on your next generation of projects looking beyond the near-term startups that you have lined up, if we start thinking about look at your reserve additions and then longer term growth potential, but you all have a number of potential FID this year, which you have an interest in, I think Stampede and then you\u2019re Indonesia development at Bangka, and then you\u2019re also reevaluating Rosebank. So understanding that every project is unique, how would provide some more commentary on just how conducive the overall environment right now is to pushing forward deepwater FIDs just in line of your view of the cost environment and the evolution of project economics and what you might see as opportunity for cost savings. Just given what\u2019s generally appears to be a more disciplined approach to screening these projects for you all and with some of your peers?","Pat Yarrington","Okay. Well, I think I would say if I step back and look at deepwater, I think for Chevron portfolio you mentioned a number of projects, but I think the most strategic basin continues to be the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. And we\u2019ve got number of wells drilling now and we\u2019ll have additional wells drilling over the next 12 to 18 months, a significant number of them, six wells in the next 12 to eight months. So that continues to be an area of strategic focus.","And we think we\u2019re competitive there on facility structure as well as drilling costs, completion costs. So that\u2019s important area for us.","If I look at IDD. IDD is a complex project. It\u2019s multiple fields. And right now we\u2019re in a position of waiting for government approvals. And then on Rosebank, we did really with the operator kind of put that \u2013 as the operator put that into a recycle mode, because the cost that had come through we\u2019re really didn\u2019t make it compete for capital within our portfolio. So that\u2019s somewhat in a recycle mode.","So I think the overall impression that you have about the industry stepping back and taking a look at the cost run up for some of these resource place relative to the value capture, I think some of that is being reassessed as you indicate, Rosebank is a good example of that.","Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons & Company","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yes, good morning.","Pat Yarrington","Good morning, Roger.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","I guess to come back to the Permian a little bit, if I understood correctly, you were not or have not to this point drilled any horizontal wells in the Midland Basin. Was that accurate?","Pat Yarrington","We are looking to spud the first one later on this year.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. So thinking about how production from the horizontal wells is typically been a little more, let\u2019s say higher IP rates so that. We should think about the shale and tight production accelerating, I don\u2019t know, call a Q4 certainly into \u201815. Would that be consistent with how you\u2019re looking at things?","Pat Yarrington","So I think it would be fair to say that if you go forward and you look at quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter improvement, we would be looking to see improvements kind of quarter-after-quarter. Our real focus has been on getting capital efficiency, maximize and getting a strong execution of business being well. So it\u2019s really been on optimizing the value creation. And so we\u2019ve been spending time to understand where the best areas are. And what the most efficient rigs had and overall development plan is.","Frankly, a lot of the other producers there have been allowing us to de-risk did play by the work that they have done and that\u2019s in a sense advantageous to us. And we think we can get overtime the same kind of synergies and efficiencies that the smaller operators have. And one of the slides that we have put out in the security analyst meeting gave a good indication of what we see as year-on-year net production increases in the Permian Basin. And at the pretty significant growth rate, we also talk to essentially doubling of our rig count over the next several years from where it is currently.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","All right. Well, I guess we now have a couple of quarters here where you\u2019re breaking out shale and tight from everything else, so start to get a feel for what the quarter-over-quarter year-over-year performance is.","Pat Yarrington","Exactly.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","So just want to make sure I was understanding the way it should progress here.","Pat Yarrington","Right. And we\u2019re hopeful for quarter-on-quarter improvement going forward.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good. I guess my follow-up question, the Angola LNG obviously going to be offline in terms of volume contribution in the second quarter for some significant period of time, but if you think about \u2013 and I know, sometimes you don\u2019t get too granular, but the impact on it from a cash flow standpoint. I mean was this operation given the troubles it\u2019s had so far actually contributing much or should we think about it as mostly a production impact but not a problem for cash flows as we look in the next couple of quarters?","Pat Yarrington","Yes, I think you will see \u2013 it will be more noticeable clearly in the production side than the cash flow side clearly. And I don\u2019t have \u2013 as I mentioned, we need to have the root cause analysis done before we have an indication of when \u2013 what that repair and maintenance \u2013 repair activity will look like, and how long that will take and then when we might get back to a producing mode.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. I\u2019ll leave it with that. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Pat Yarrington for any further remarks.","Pat Yarrington","All right. Thank you, Jonathan. I guess we got through everybody\u2019s question. So I appreciate your time and interest today. I especially want to thank all the analysts on behalf of all the participants for the questions that they asked in this morning\u2019s session. So Jonathan, I\u2019ll turn it back to you and thank everybody. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentlemen.

Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I'll now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington, please go ahead.","Pat Yarrington","Okay, thank you Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jeff Gustavson and Frank Mount who are currently transitioning the General Manager of Investor Relations role. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2.","Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The Company's first quarter earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.37 per diluted share. Excluding gains from asset sales, foreign exchange effects and other special items, earnings were $0.76 per diluted share or $1.4 billion. This is a better outcome than the decline in commodity prices would have implied. This is because operationally, it was a very solid quarter for both upstream and downstream. Production volumes were strong and downstream asset utilization and reliability were high, plus operating cost control was evident throughout the enterprise.","Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was approximately 10% and our debt ratio at quarter end was 18%. During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to shareholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield about 3.8%.","Turning to slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $2.3 billion for the first quarter. This reflected lower upstream results due to the sharp decline in commodity prices as well as negative working capital effects of approximately $2 billion. The majority of the working capital effects are temporary in nature and we expect these to reserve in future quarters. These impacts were only partially offset by strong cash generation from our downstream and chemicals businesses. In the quarter, proceeds from asset sales totaled approximately $950 million, the majority of which related to the sale of our interest in multiple offshore and onshore leases in Nigeria.","In February, the Company successfully executed a $6 billion bond offering. Cash capital expenditures were $7.6 billion for the quarter, a decrease of approximately 11% from first quarter 2014 and over 20% lower than fourth quarter. At quarter-end, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $13 billion and our net debt position was about $21 billion.","Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2015 earnings were approximately $1.9 billion lower than first quarter 2014 results. Upstream earnings decreased $2.7 billion between quarters; significantly lower crude realizations were partially offset by positive foreign exchange effects, higher gains on asset sales and favorable tax items. Foreign exchange gains in the first quarter were substantial, $580 million in total. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. ","Downstream results increased by over $700 million, primarily driven by stronger worldwide refining and marketing margins. Operationally, first quarter results were amongst the very best we've had in several years, a perfect combination of margin strength and improved refining reliability. The variance in the other segment was primarily associated with the absence of an impaired recognized in first quarter 2014 following sustation [ph] of certain mining operations, primarily offset by higher tax and other corporate charges.","Turning to slide 6, I'll now compare results for the first quarter 2015 with the fourth quarter of 2014. First quarter earnings were approximately $900 million lower than fourth quarter results. Upstream earnings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion between quarters, reflecting lower realizations and assets on gains partially offset by lower impairments and operating costs. Downstream earnings were lower by $95 million, stronger U.S. margins and lower operating expenses across the global systems were more than offset by the absence of gains on asset sales recognized in the fourth quarter and an unfavorable swing and timing effects between quarters. The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges.","Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment.","Jeff Gustavson","Thanks Pat. Turning to slide 7. Our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were about $900 million lower than fourth quarter's results. Sharply lower liquids realizations decreased earnings by $735 million, our crude and liquids realizations all dropped by approximately 35% between periods. Gains on asset sales were lower by $330 million. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a gain following the sale of our interests in certain LPG pipeline assets, which are associated with the upstream segment. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items. Lower operating and exploration expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation charges, including impairments for several smaller assets.","Turning to slide 8. International upstream earnings were about $200 million lower than last quarter's results. Significantly lower crude prices impacted earnings by $1.3 billion. Our average international crude realizations were down over 30% between quarters, consistent with the decline in Brent prices. Lower operating expenses across multiple countries increased earnings by $335 million. In March, the U.K. government implemented a change in the petroleum tax law retroactive to the beginning of the year, which resulted in a one-time deferred tax benefit of $350 million.","The absence of impairments from the prior quarter increased earnings by $570 million, while lower gains on asset sales this quarter decreased earnings by $360 million. The other bar included multiple components. Two notable drivers for this positive variance were stronger liftings and foreign exchange effects.","Slide 9 summarizes the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014. Net production increased by almost 100,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price effects increased production by 55,000 barrels per day as lower crude prices increased cost recovery and other volumes associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts. Major capital project ramp ups at Jack\/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico and from the expansion of the Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh, increased production by 42,000 barrels per day.","Plant turnaround activity was heavy in the fourth quarter, particularly at our SGI\/SGP facilities in Kazakhstan as well as in Thailand and Australia. First quarter by contrast was much lighter in planned maintenance and this accounted for higher production of 36,000 barrels per day between periods. Growth from shale and tight assets, primarily in the Permian contributed 10,000 barrels per day. External constrains, primarily lower gas demands in Southeast Asia as well as weather-related impacts decreased production by 18,000 barrels per day. The remaining variance in the base business and other bar reflects greater unplanned downtime in other non-related items.","Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter 2015 and the first quarter 2014. Net production increased by 93,000 barrels per day between periods. Price effects increased production by 71,000 barrels per day due to the roughly 50% drop in crude prices between periods. Last year, Brent averaged $108 per barrel in the first quarter. This year Brent averaged $54 per barrel in the first quarter. Shale and tight production increased by 43,000 barrels per day due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian as well as in the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina.","Major capital projects increased production by 35,000 barrels per day. Production ramp-ups in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Bangladesh, Trinidad and Brazil were all positives. The shutdown of Angola LNG which occurred subsequent to last year's first quarter partially offset these increases. Asset sales resulted in loss production of 34,000 barrels per day, principally driven by divestments of our assets in Chad and in the Netherlands.","The decrease of 22,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines, partially offset by lower turnaround activity and unplanned downtime. Our base business continues to perform well with the managed decline rate below our existing guidance.","First quarter net production rate of 2.681 million barrels per day is a strong start to the year and is above the flat to 3% growth range we indicated in January as our production guidance. While this is above our guidance, it is important to remember that we have maintenance turnarounds and asset sales plans for later in the year.","I would also like to comment on an issue we mentioned in our 10-K about our operations in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait where we produced 76,000 barrels per day net in the first quarter. It now appears more likely that our future production levels in the Partitioned Zone could be negatively impacted due to our inability to secure work and equipment permits. The potential for a shutdown of production was not anticipated in our flat to 3% guidance range. We do not know for sure how production impact will occur and if does occur, we cannot estimate its duration. In any case, we estimate that the 2015 financial impact from a potential shutdown would be minimal.","Turning to slide 11. US downstream results decreased $183 million between quarters. Importantly, the operational results noted in the green bars were over $500 million stronger between periods. Margins increased earnings by $435 million driven by unplanned industry downtime and tight product supply on the US West Coast. US Gulf Coast margins were also strong reflecting industry refinery maintenance patterns and strong seasonal demand.","Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $110 million primarily associated with reduced turnaround in maintenance activities. Timing effects represented a $250 million decrease to earnings mainly due to the absence of positive year-end inventory effects recognized in the fourth quarter and unfavorable mark-to-market swings between quarters on derivatives tied to underlying physical assets. The absence of gains on asset transactions from the prior quarter decreased earnings by $460 million.","Turning to slide 12. International downstream earnings improved by $88 million between quarters. Lower margins decreased earnings by $70 million. Marketing margins fell, largely the result of product pricing lag effects evident in both Asia and Australia. Reduced operating expenses increased earnings by $120 million. Timing effects represented a $215 million decrease to earnings.","As in the US segment, this represented the absence of favorable year-end inventory effects booked in the fourth quarter and adverse swings between the quarters and mark-to-market valuations on derivatives tied to underlying physical assets. The absence of one-time charge in fourth quarter related the economic buyout of a legacy pension liability increased earnings by $160 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items. The largest single component was favorable foreign currency effects.","With that, I\u2019d like to now turn it back to Pat.","Pat Yarrington","All right, thanks, Jeff. Turning now to slide 13. In response to the downturn, we are aggressively pursuing cost savings. Excluding fuel, operating cost in the first quarter are down 13% from the average 2014 quarter. To-date, we have completed more than 2,200 supplier engagements with 700 more in progress. We\u2019re working across all spend categories to negotiate supplier reductions and to rebid contracts when sufficient reductions have not been offered.","The results have been encouraging with over $900 million of contract savings already negotiated. The pie chart shows upstream spend categories, [00:00:57] our supplier cost reduction effort and the $900 million quoted is enterprise-wide. This represents cash savings we expect to capture in 2015. We\u2019ll see it show up as the year unfolds in multiple ways; lower operating expenses, reduced capital outlays, and decreases in cost of goods sold.","Spend categories closer to the Wellhead and activities with the shorter term contracts as well as shorter cycle times from order date to delivery date are seeing the sharpest declines. We\u2019re also seeing more immediate responsiveness from suppliers supporting our US operations.","Looking externally for improvements is only part of addressing our cost structure. We\u2019re also reengineering our internal work processes, initiating organization reviews, rightsizing our work teams to better match spend and activity levels and all of this to align with current market conditions. Our objective is a simpler, more efficient, more productive and affordable organization that directly supports our business priorities.","Finally, we are pursuing capital and operating efficiencies throughout the organization, getting more for each dollar of spend. In the upstream, we are applying our experience with running manufacturing type operations to our shale and tight developments in the US and elsewhere. This is driving significant efficiency improvements and lowering the costs of our horizontal well programs in both the Midland and Delaware basins.","In the downstream, we are using tools like Lean Six Sigma to improve efficiency throughout our operations and one specific example, we\u2019ve shortened the downtime by 30% associated with terminal and tank inspection and maintenance activities, which should lead to sizeable cost savings over time.","Turning to slide 14. You recall a key commitment from our March presentation related to covering our dividend in 2017 from free cash flow. We outlined how we intended to do that and I like to put a few of our accomplishments into that context. Cash flow growth is a near-term priority. While absolute prices in the first quarter were not favorable, our production was.","Base business performance was strong and our base decline rate was less than 2%. We also continue to ramp up at Jack\/St. Malo in the Gulf of Mexico. The fifth well is now online and growth production is up to over 70,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent, exceeding initial expectations.","We completed some critical milestones on the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects in Australia. At Gorgon, we started up the first gas turbine generator successfully, an important step in the overall plant commissioning process. At Wheatstone, we successfully installed the topside for the offshore platform -- production platform. We have posted new pictures today and a video of both projects will be posted early next week. I encourage you to look at these on our investor website at chevron.com.","And finally, our downstream and chemicals business is performing very well. We do think spend is our second priority. I\u2019ve already talked through the cost structure savings we\u2019re pursuing. In addition to that, we\u2019re on a clear path to reduce capital spending over the next several years as our major capital projects come online and our spending flexibility increases. Budgeted capital spending is planned at $35 billion this year, a 13% reduction from 2014. Cash spending is down -- this quarter is down 11% from first quarter a year ago. By 2017, we expect to have over $8 billion in additional C&E flexibility compared to 2015.","And finally, we\u2019re making excellent progress on our asset sales. We realized almost $6 billion in proceeds last year and will be adding nearly $4 billion to that in the first four months of this year with a recently completed lease sales in Nigeria and the divestiture of Caltex Australia. In 16 months, we\u2019ve achieved almost $10 billion in total sales proceeds versus a $15 billion 48-month target. We will continue to sell assets when we can generate good value. ","Moving to slide 15, I would like to close by reiterating the near-term value proposition that Chevron offers. We expect to deliver industry-leading volume growth between now and 2017. That growth is sourced from Gorgon and Wheatstone in Australia, Jack\/St. Malo and Big Foot in the Gulf of Mexico and Mafumeira Sul and Angola LNG in Angola. ","In addition, we are poised for a significant growth in our shale and tight resources, particularly in the Permian in the US. On top of the pure volume growth, we also offer margin expansion. The cash margins associated with these projects, primarily in the orange portion of the shaded bar, are projected higher than our cash margins today and many significant leasehold. ","By 2017, we expect our cash margins on our overall portfolio to increase by approximately 35% from where they are today assuming $60 average Brent price this year and $70 average Brent price in 2017, which is consistent with current futures prices. ","We believe that our outsized volume growth combined with outsized margin should lead to outsized value growth for our shareholders. ","That concludes our prepared remarks, and I appreciate you listening in this morning. We are now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we already have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary and we will do our best to get all of your questions answered. ","So Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please. ","Ed Westlake","Good morning, Pat and congratulations Jeff on the move, and welcome to Frank. Just I guess the question around cash flow to start with. Thanks for shouting out the working capital, I think the market would have had kittens if it was a $2 billion CFO number. I mean obviously, if you have net income and DD&A, you get a high number, but I presume some of the deltas or things like dividends from associates being less than net income and the timing of tax payments, if there is any color on that? ","But my general question is, how does this cash flow stack up against your internal expectations for the quarter appreciate, obviously the oil price is very low. And has anything changed in terms of your cash flow projections going forward in what you see as a more normalized oil price?","Pat Yarrington","Okay, yeah, thanks, Ed, appreciate the question and I appreciate everybody\u2019s interest in cash. You\u2019re right. So it was a low cash from operations quarter, but we did have $2 billion of adverse working capital effects, so if you added those back, we would be at about $4.3 billion. What I would say is, if you looked at our sensitivity on oil price relative to prior quarters and look at it this quarter, this very much is in-line and in fact, it\u2019s actually a little bit stronger than just a pure sensitivity would suggest. ","I\u2019ll just mention the number again for everybody, it\u2019s somewhere between $325 million and $350 million per dollar Brent change. So we\u2019ve had a significant drop in Brent prices, and therefore a significant drop in earnings as well as cash flow. ","You\u2019re absolutely right, Ed, that there were some decrements relative to normal quarters in terms of the amount of affiliate distributions that we received. This quarter was, I would say, pretty minimal in terms of that. We do expect that to turnaround in the subsequent three quarters, so that\u2019s just a timing issue.","In terms of how this looks relative to our plan going forward, if you recall the numbers that we showed you in March, the slides that we showed you with financial projections, all assumed a $60 world for Brent, and I think we\u2019re exactly in that phase. And so I look at our profile this year in terms of how earnings have come in and cash have come in and assuming we end up at a $60 world for Brent, which looks very reasonable given where the futures markets are than I think we are exactly on plan and very consistent with the cash profile that we showed you back in March. ","And you\u2019ll recall, for everybody, that we did have a significant deficit anticipated in 2015 and then we showed you the pattern of how we would move out of that deficit out to 2017, getting full coverage of our dividend by 2017. I mentioned the asset sales that we have, the first quarter was nearly $1 billion and here in April already, we have the sale as well. So already through four months, we've got a significant contribution of about $4 billion. So asset sales are a key component there as well.","Ed Westlake","Thank you. I think I asked three questions in one. So I will defer to the next in line.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, Pat, Jeff. ","Pat Yarrington","Good morning.","Jeff Gustavson","Good morning.","Neil Mehta","So Pat, I wanted you to talk through the dividend here and just how we're thinking about dividend growth, historically, you\u2019ve raised the dividend in the second quarter earlier this week. You kept it flat, so want to see if this represents the departure from the views on dividend growth or maybe just the change in the timing on when you evaluate it?","Pat Yarrington","It's a good question, Neil and let me just start by saying that maintaining a competitive and growing dividend is our number one priority. That has not changed. Our financial priorities have not changed, but what has changed is our immediate financial environment, the near-term environment has changed and so the board chose not to increase the dividend this quarter. ","It is similar to what we did back in 2008 and 2009, when prices last fell significantly. We are supporting a 3.8% yield, but clearly, we are not running very strongly on earnings or cash flow at the moment due to commodity prices. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the first quarter was not a very stable financial environment, it was very fluid in terms of both revenues and costs. And so I think our overall decision is going to be based on what we feel is affordable and supportable in perpetuity, because we don't want to get into a position where we are having to cut the dividend or trim the dividend in anyway. ","And therefore, the timing and the size of an increase will be a function of how cash and earnings and asset sales or major capital projects execution and frankly, future commodity prices, I mean that is a significant factor, how those all play out in the coming quarters. And really how we see commodity prices playing out over a longer sweep of time. All of those factors will influence that decision.","Neil Mehta","Thanks, Pat. And then want to come back to your point on the neutral zone. And I think Jeff, you made the point that the financial impact would be limited or immaterial. The number you shadowed out there represents about 3% of your volumes, so curious as to why earnings impact could be immaterial, is that because the margins associated with those barrels could be lower and just a broader status update on the [indiscernible] field would be helpful as well.","Pat Yarrington","Yes. So essentially you are right. The financial impact is minimal because of the relationship to margins essentially. And then on the steamflood status, it was our -- we did have steam breakthroughs, so we did have success in that pilot. It was our expectation, it is our expectation to go into feed later this year, perhaps around the third quarter, but obviously depending upon circumstances and how they unfold over the next few weeks and these discussions between Saudi and the Kuwaitis on the partition zone.","It could be \u2013 there could be somewhat of an impact there. I will say that there are discussions that are ongoing underway because this is obviously a very serious circumstance and it's being taken seriously. So we put a lot of could and potential and words like that in our language, because we really don't know and the hope is that this can get solved, we are optimistic that this can get solved.","Neil Mehta","Thank you, Pat. And Jeff, congratulations.","Jeff Gustavson","Thank you, Neil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Phil Gresh","Hey. Good morning, Pat. Congrats, Jeff and Frank. First question is just on the OpEx. Thank you for the helpful color on that front. I guess what I'm wondering is as we think about how the first quarter progressed on a year-over-year or a quarter-over-quarter basis and what you called out relative to I believe it was John\u2019s commentary last quarter, I think the last cycle you talked about a $4 billion saved number, kind of where do you think you are in those structural sales opportunities and how we should sequentially be thinking about this as we look at 2Q and the second half?","Pat Yarrington","Right. I think that our profile at least what we've seen so far in the first quarter with all of the concerted and systematic effort that we've got underway throughout the entire enterprise, I feel that we should have really good operating expense trends as we move through the remaining three quarters of the year.","We are seeing cost reductions over a whole series of cost categories anywhere from 10% to 20% and some of that of course will end up in OpEx spend, some of that will end up in capital expenditures, lower capital outlays, but I would just say from the response on the part of suppliers, the intensity with which we are pursuing this, the fact that if we are not getting the cost reductions that we are anticipating from a given supplier that we are willing to move market share and have done so, all of that I think bodes very well for our bottom line and our cash spend really over the course of subsequent periods here.","Phil Gresh","So just a clarification. If you were to maybe put it in terms of innings like what you actually realized in the first quarter because I think the OpEx is down $600 million year-over-year, so I am just trying make that for with $4 billion number and think about how far along you are versus are you actually in the early stages?","Pat Yarrington","I think we're in the very early stages in terms of what has been recognized in the first quarter results. So I think there is a lot of potential still to come.","Jeff Gustavson","This is Jeff. Just to be clear, the $4 billion was a 2009 number. What we saw back in 2009, nothing that we put out here recently. ","Phil Gresh","Understood. Just on -- my second question is on CPChem. I think there has been some discussion out there about the potential to maybe officially leverage that balance sheet. So maybe you could just talk about your thoughts on that and whether there's any potential of that in 2015?","Pat Yarrington","Okay, sure. In the past, CPChem has held debt. And then they've gone through a period here where they were generating tremendous amounts of cash and dividending that to their parents. Now they are in a position where they have investment opportunities through that US Gulf Coast cracker project and so it would not be unreasonable to think that they would go into the debt market in order to fund some of their investment opportunities.","Phil Gresh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Evan Calio","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Pat Yarrington","Good morning.","Evan Calio ","Yeah, thanks for the comment on the dividend and maybe I will kind of try further there. I know in 2009 you raised the dividend in July of your typical kind of April-May period for the raise after a moderate commodity recovery. I know there are many factors and the board ultimately sets the dividend. What's the key metric that\u2019s your focus when you are looking at that decision and does it differ today at all because you are in a kind of bigger project ramp-up period? Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","So I really think it's important to take a long-term view on the dividend and the outlook on cash and earnings over a longer sweep of time. So I think that is really morphed. Fundamentally the issue then will we happen to sit on our capital program at this particular point time. And I think it is fair to say that with what's happened in oil markets in the last six to nine months, there is a complete reshaping of what's going on, a rebalancing of what's going on. And I think it's reasonable to think that taking sometime to understand where things shake out for the long-term is a very important and prudent step. I don't want to get ahead of what the board's views on this might be, so I can't really comment any further.","The dividend is very important to us. We want remain competitive on it. We pay attention to our yield, we pay attention to our payouts on earnings and our payouts on cash flows. We want to be competitive on this, we want to continue to grow it. So all I can say is, it\u2019s got high priority and this is something that gets looked at every single quarter and profiles on out in terms of earnings and cash flows gets looked at every quarter by the board.","Evan Calio","Great. That's fair. I appreciate that. And then a follow-up on the \u2013 particularly, congratulations on the Caltex sale. On the downstream, can you give us any idea of how you expect that asset sale, those assets sales have affected your returns in the downstream portfolio. So as we roll forward with international, I know it was in non-consolidated, but how they compare relative to the rest of your portfolio and how that portfolio may look absent Caltex? Thank you.","Pat Yarrington","Yeah, so, I think you -- we should commented as it had a positive contribution, obviously, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be noticeable in any meaningful way. Its absence will not be noticeable in any meaningful way.","Evan Calio","Okay, yes, fair enough, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please?","Paul Sankey","Hi, good morning everybody, and Jeff, thank you for everything, it\u2019s been a pleasure.","Jeff Gustavson","Thanks.","Paul Sankey","Can I just ask about the Neutral Zone again, how much did you see in for volumes in your targets for this year and for the 2017 3.1?","Pat Yarrington","So, this year would have been in the neighborhood of what we produced in the first quarter here, which was around 76,000 barrels a day. We would have been anticipating a decline between 2015 and 2017 to something a little around 60, maybe 62,000 barrels a day in 2017.","Paul Sankey","Good. And so, Pat, you\u2019re saying that basically that margins are so low there that regardless of losing whatever it is, 70 -- 60 -- 70,000 barrels a day, the financial impact will literally be minimal?","Pat Yarrington","Yes.","Paul Sankey","Well, okay. That was the -- that was the volume question. Is there anything to add on the California downstream market and I\u2019ll leave with that? Thanks a lot.","Pat Yarrington","So, I think in California, we had the fortunate position of having high reliability at a time when the overall industry market was very tight and it was tight for a couple of operational reasons related to other industry -- other industry players. As those get resolved and I think one has been resolved and one is going to take a little bit longer to resolve, but as those get resolved and I think you would anticipate that the margins would move towards a more normal -- a more normal level.","Of course, second quarter is typically a reasonable margin period because of gasoline demand pickup. So, there is seasonality factors there, but in general, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the West Coast margin was impacted significantly here in the first quarter because of these industry factors and Chevron ran well, operated well and was able to take advantage of that.","Paul Sankey","Pat, it\u2019s totally obscure, but I was wondering was that part -- was California part of the working -- why was the working capital movements so enormous in the quarter I guess is what I should have asked. Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","It\u2019s a good question. It was really a function. When you look at our working capital elements here, the biggest drivers really just related to a disproportionate movement in the way our accounts payable and our accounts receivables moved over the quarter\u2019s period of time. Normally, when you are in a more stable price environment, then you expect whatever happens and your receivables and payables to offset. That did that happen in this particular period. And so, we had a net cash consumption of size related to accounts payable, receivables net and this is where I said and I feel very comfortable saying that we expect this to unwind as the quarters progress.","Paul Sankey","I guess what I\u2019m driving at is, the history of that typically is the California operations have a lot of long distance crude, is that what we\u2019re talking about here or is there dollar effect or something?","Pat Yarrington","No, it\u2019s not what we\u2019re -- it\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about and in the past, when we talked about, we\u2019ve had working capital effects related to the California. In many of those circumstances in the past that has been related to the operations, the specific operations or lack of operations at Richmond. That is not the scenario that we\u2019re talking about this year.","Paul Sankey","But I\u2019m still not to why it\u2019s so big, I mean, you say it\u2019s payables, receivables type move, but I just wonder, is it the dollar or is it, what is it?","Pat Yarrington","I mean, it\u2019s just the rate of activity change between what\u2019s happened on your revenue side and what\u2019s happened on your cost side.","Paul Sankey","Okay, I will leave at that. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please?","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys. First, Jeff just want to say thank you for all the help over the last couple of years and best of luck with your new assignment and Frank, welcome aboard to the IR lane. Pat, on the first quarter, the cost saving realization in the P&L, I think you mention talking about $600 million. How much of [indiscernible] in many of the area that you operate as much weaker than the US dollar, so as a result, in US dollar term, the cost is down?","Pat Yarrington","So, your question is about foreign exchange, the 600 -- roughly $580 million. ","Paul Cheng","No, I am not talking about the $580 million, which is related to currency translation. I am talking about the actual operating cost, because let\u2019s say, you pay your employee in UK with the pound and then get translated into your US dollar, even if the cost base will remain the same in local currency in US dollar is much lower, so that\u2019s the amount that I am just curious, how -- of the 600, how much is related to that?","Pat Yarrington","So the \u2013 it\u2019s really \u2013 they\u2019re not related. I mean, our operating expense, the influence of foreign exchange on our operating expense is really pretty minimal through the quarter. It\u2019s more significant in terms of capital spending, but on an operating expense base it has not \u2013 it is not a significant component that has led to the decline in operating expense between periods. ","Paul Cheng","Interesting. So given that in many of your major operating area, the dollar have strengthened against their local currency, but is not much of an impact in USA?","Pat Yarrington","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Cheng","I see. Okay. All right, that\u2019s fine. A final one that\u2019s real quick, over-lifting and under-lifting in the quarter?","Pat Yarrington","Yeah, we\u2019re about 1.7% under-lifted for the quarter. ","Paul Cheng","And Pat, at the end of the quarter, do you still under-lift or do you upper-lift or over-lift?","Pat Yarrington","I don\u2019t know, Frank. I just know for the quarter, it was 1.7% and I don\u2019t know \u2013","Frank Mount","No, at the end of the quarter, Paul, it was \u2013 we were 1.7% under-lifted, that\u2019s at the end of the quarter.","Pat Yarrington","At the end of the quarter, okay.","Paul Cheng","And how about for the quarter your sales?","Pat Yarrington","Within the quarter?","Paul Cheng","Yes, means that the quarter sales comparing to the quarter production, are we over-lift or under-lift?","Frank Mount","I\u2019ll have to follow-up with you that. Paul, I don\u2019t have that number with me, but the 1.7% is the number that you should focus on. ","Paul Cheng","Okay, perfect. Thank you.Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Good morning everyone. And Jeff, let me also say thanks to all your help. Welcome Frank. I got to say, I am optimistic on a better Q position with Frank. I want to see how it goes. ","On asset sales, you are two-thirds of the way through the $15 billion number. One can, you help thinking with maybe some upside yet again to that target. Could you frame for us how you\u2019re thinking about that. ","And if could [indiscernible] this year. One of your competitors in your backyard in California seems pretty keen on asset sales, I am just curious on the other side of the ledger, if you have taken a hard look at bolt-ons to your existing California position? And then I do have a related follow-up.","Pat Yarrington ","Yeah, so we did just increase the target back in March moving to the $15 billion over the four years. We are only six weeks later than that approximately now. And even though the CAL sale is a significant transaction and we\u2019re happy to have it behind us, I am not in a position to change the overall target. ","I feel very comfortable about our ability to conclude the $15 billion over the next year and a half or so that are remaining, actually it\u2019s more than that, more than two and a half years, two and a half years that are remaining. So I don\u2019t want to up that target, but I feel comfortable about our ability to hit that target in the timeframe that we have set. CAL will be booked in the second quarter, it was not a first quarter item. ","And then in terms of any sort of bolt-on activity, obviously we look at circumstances of assets and opportunities around the globe. We evaluate that all the time. I am not going to speak specifically about anything that\u2019s under consideration or not under consideration. It has a pretty high hurdle is all I would say in order to move into our portfolio at this time. Any sort of additional portfolio move like that would have a pretty high hurdle because it would need to compete post acquisition for capital against the assets that we already have in queue. ","Doug Leggate","I appreciate. And my follow-up is, I am afraid I am going to label the working capital issue, just to leave that more, if I may. My sense is at least when you have such a massive move than the oil price at least, a slow down on activity levels, the payables that you would have as a source of working capital, as you pay those, in other words, as cash goes out the door, the subsequent payables that would replace those would be substantially lower assuming your activity level was reduced. So, what I'm trying to understand is, where is your confidence or can you help us walk through why that after a such move in the oil price that working capital position would reverse out if your activity level is moved to a lower level, just your view on that. [ph]","Pat Yarrington","Well, I think it's really the combination, I mean; I look at these on a net basis, right. I look at the movement in your receivables and the movement in your payables and as I say, as you get into a stable environment, any sort of price impact that you get, typically moves through both of those in a relatively synonymous way or a synchronized way.","And so, when you\u2019re in a discontinuous situation like you had in the first quarter, I think, when you get into a stable environment, if prices have come down, and cost structure has come down, then you get into a matching there, and so I think that is what I'm really trying to imply is that, as you move into that matching phase, that's where you will get the reversal and you'll return to a more normal relationship between receivables and payables.","Doug Leggate","Is that through the course of the year, Pat, or you would expect a more quicker resolution for that or is it going to kind of ramp higher or going to be balanced over time?","Pat Yarrington","Accounts payable receivables, I would expect to begin reversing relatively quickly here. I think it's a trend, a change in the pattern that you will see in the second quarter.","Doug Leggate","Great, I will leave at that. Thanks very much indeed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil, your question please.","Blake Fernandez","Folks, good morning and I would also offer congratulations to both Jeff and Frank. I had two questions, one, could you give an update on the recently formed JV you did in the Gulf of Mexico with Keathley Canyon, any status update or game plan as you kind of take over operatorship there?","Pat Yarrington","Well, I think you know, I think I'd like to leave a lot of that for our second quarter here, because our plans are to have Jeff -- Jay Johnson on the line with us in second quarter, and I think we'll let the opportunities go there. But we're pleased with the joint development opportunity that we've got here, this really builds on our Anchor discovery and our Guadalupe discovery and it combines the Tiber and Gila discoveries where BP had success there and so we feel like it's a very good development opportunity potentially for hubs where you can get scale assets, economic assets and going forward, we have a lot of continuing appraisal work to do though. So I don't really want to say much more than that.","Blake Fernandez","Fair enough, we can follow-up next quarter with Jay. The second question Pat is really kind of on the U.S. in particular, where we saw negative earnings, I guess, I viewed the Gulf and Permian as key growth areas where we would expect fairly high margins, I realized there were some impairments kind of one-off in the quarter, but you highlight DD&A being elevated, is it fair to believe that DD&A kind of remains at an elevated level until we book additional reserves over time?","And if I could may be just sneak in a -- finally a follow-up on the Partitioned Zone. You mentioned the financial impact being minimal, I presume that applies to both earnings and cash flow, but if you could please just confirm that, I would appreciate it. Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","Yeah, so just sticking with the upstream loss position, I think we have to look at what the driver was here for the loss position, obviously very poor realizations, only $43 a barrel and liquids realizations, gas overall was $2 in the quarter roughly. So, the significant decline in revenues. I talked about what's happening on our cost structure side of things but we're going to see the cost structure come down with lag effects, you're not going to see that in a first quarter period of time, so the cost structure is continuing to evolve and so first quarter again was not a particularly pretty picture from a margin standpoint.","On depreciation, you're right, we are seeing elevated depreciation and you would expect that depreciation to remain elevated and particularly for some of our deepwater assets until we have time to do, we get response time and we can see what the full recoverable, we can document kind of the full recoverable opportunity of that development play is. And back on PZ, it is the same earnings and cash.","Blake Fernandez","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies, your question please.","Jason Gammel","Thanks very much, hi everyone. Just wanted to come to the milestones that you've achieved in Australia over the course of the quarter. The first question related to the first gas into turbine at Gorgon, that's obviously a huge milestone, is that being accomplished with gas from your hydrogen [ph] offshore or you\u2019re getting that from third-party sources and if it's not hydrogen, you still expect first gas somewhere around mid-year?","Pat Yarrington","It's coming from domestic gas sources and yes, our expectation really is to have, we are on schedule for our Gorgon startup in the third quarter of this year and first gas, before the end of the year.","Jason Gammel","And do you mean, first commercial cargoes, is that \u2013","Pat Yarrington","First commercial cargoes, sorry.","Jason Gammel","Okay, great.","Pat Yarrington","First LNG before the end of the year. ","Jason Gammel","Got it. And then obviously another major milestone you achieved at Wheatstone with the top side placement, but I guess from a schedule standpoint, I would expect that the onshore has got the most potential for slippage, just from a risk standpoint, can you talk about where you are at relative to schedule in terms of the onshore at Wheatstone?","Pat Yarrington","Yes. So we are on schedule for Wheatstone. Obviously, the installation of the top sides on the steel gravity structure was a major milestone. But we've got seven of 24 process modules, major process modules that have been delivered on site. The trunk line is installed and hydro tested. The dredging is complete, the piling activities are completed, the roofs are on both of the LNG tanks, so we continue to make good progress both onshore and offshore and I do encourage you to take a look at the pictures that are on the website, because you'll be able to see the progress there.","Jason Gammel","Okay. Very good. Thanks, folks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. As you are getting into 2015, presumably there was a lift of FIDs the company had on deck, are there any of those other than perhaps Kitimat that have been pushed out or suspended since January 1?","Pat Yarrington","So, I would say the most significant, in fact the only really significant FID that\u2019s on plan for this year relates to TCO and the future growth project and we continue to work that through to FID obviously, it's an opportunity for us to take advantage of a lower cost structure, so we continue to do more detailed engineering and work through the cost estimates of this, continue to work with our partners and the government on this, so our expectation is fourth-quarter FID on that one.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay, understood.","Pat Yarrington","And in terms of the other FID projects, I mean part of the reduction that we took in our capital spending from 2014 to 2015 really did relate to the pacing of other major capital projects. Kitimat is a primary one there. We've moved that, I guess, I would say the spending on that out considerably. We are really only limiting ourselves here to appraisal work and continuing to look at the design and the cost structure of that. Indonesia deepwater development would have been another one. That has moved out. So there several other FIDs or pre-FID projects that we have pushed to see any monies into future years.","Pavel Molchanov","And if I can ask a follow-up about the downstream segment, you've been pretty vocal in the past about the frustrations with California policy on carbon emissions in particular, given the decision last week to extend those rules out to 2030, does that change your view about perhaps retaining any of the California refining assets?","Pat Yarrington","Well, I would just say that we are in a very advantaged California position. We've got two very strong world-class -- very competitive assets at Richmond and El Segundo. We've got a very good market position, very good brand strength. So, it\u2019s a quality asset that we have here and our expectation is that we will be able, over time, to work with whatever the regulatory framework is. ","At the same time, we do still think it's important to alert customers and alert government officials as to what the cost of compliance is for some of these programs. The AB32, the cap and trade portion, fuels under the cap came in to effect in January of this year and there are costs, new costs associated with being a refiner in the state as a result of that. Now, it does get passed on to consumers and so as that continues to move forward, then of course that cost increase could be something that consumers and regulators will be increasingly aware of.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay, I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody and let me be one of the last to wish you good luck, Jeff, in the next assignment and welcome Frank. If I could just go maybe with a couple of specific ones, Angola LNG I think at the Analyst Day you updated, you expected it to come on stream during the fourth quarter of this year back on stream. Any update on progress there that was maybe a little bit earlier than some of our expectations and maybe what all did you end up having to do to the project to get it ready for this year?","Pat Yarrington","Okay. So work is still underway, significantly underway and the overall plan is to still have Angola LNG restart with LNG to the tank in the fourth quarter of this year, probably late in the fourth quarter of this year and then begin to ramp-up to about 75% of capacity by the first quarter of 2015. As is common, the plant will run for a period of time and then ALNG will make a decision as to whether or not they need to take the plant down to perform any sort of shut down, drain removal, that kind of cleanup activity. And they all decide at that point in time whether or not they want to do that early in the first part of 2016. In any case, we would expect ALNG to reach maximum capacity in the second quarter of 2016 if they decide to do those drain removals. ","Ryan Todd","Great. And I appreciate that. And then maybe just one general one, wondered if you can give couple of comments in your release, but I would appreciate any clarity as we've got varying views from different companies over in recent times. Any view on general product demand globally, both in the US and globally what you are seeing across your system? Any demand sort of weak or strong in different parts of the system as well?","Pat Yarrington","I would say that going forward here and I'm thinking really globally here that product demand -- there are some leading indicators that would suggest the product demand as strengthening, I guess I would say modestly. And overall, probably have an overall demand profile for 2015 that would be somewhat stronger than 2014 from an oil consumption standpoint.","Ryan Todd","And in the US, I think in your release it said that the product sales were, I can\u2019t remember, they were flat year-on-year versus 1Q14. Is that US gasoline, is that kind of same-store sales across your system or what number is that?","Pat Yarrington","I'm not sure, which number are you talking, are you looking in the release itself?","Ryan Todd","Yeah. I think it said branded gasoline sales were essentially flat with 2014, is that \u2013 so I am guessing that's kind of the same-store sales?","Pat Yarrington","Well, it really is networks, it's our total network sales. Total network sales. It's really just a function of our branded distributions, right. I mean, our network hasn't changed significantly between periods of time.","Ryan Todd ","That's helpful. Alright. Thanks a lot. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please. ","Roger Read","Yeah, good morning.","Pat Yarrington","Good morning. ","Roger Read","I guess I would like to follow-up, it hasn't gotten much here this time around. Permian, kind of give us an update maybe what you are doing there, maybe your progression on rig count and then also how the cost deflation is flowing through there?","Pat Yarrington","Okay. So our current outlook really for the Permian is to have about 21 rigs running. Currently in the March meeting we said it was something closer to 25. We expect to have about 325 gross wells this year. And that's down a little bit from what we said just a few week ago. Some of the reduction in the wells is due to a shift to horizontal drilling programs versus vertical drilling programs. And some of it also relates to joint venture arrangements what our joint development partner has reduced their activity levels compared to plans. We are transitioning more and more to horizontal work as opposed to vertical work. Horizontal wells obviously work better in this kind of a price environment. And I would just say that we are seeing very good well by well improvement in costs in each of these wells going forward. ","I think the cost reduction efforts are finding their way through to our overall drilling and completions cost, and we will be happy to give you a larger update, more in-depth update on our second quarter call.","Roger Read","Okay. And then the other question I had is we could get back to \u2013 it was chart 14, you talked about flexibility in your spending going forward. I didn\u2019t catch the number, but I was just wondering if we should think about that as kind of \u2013 one, give us the number. ","Number two, can we think about that as ratable as we work through or is it very much going to be chunky as, for example, Gorgon gets going at the end of this year and obviously the CapEx drops off. And then how that may change the way the future FID process will work its way through as well?","Pat Yarrington","Right. So the number that we provided between 2015 and 2017 is $8 billion cumulatively. And I think it\u2019s reasonable for you to think about that as reasonably ratable. I mean, it does really depend and it is forced heavily by the Gorgon and Wheatstone spend follow-up. But I think for purposes of what you\u2019re most likely doing I think thinking about it as being reasonably ratable make sense. ","Roger Read","Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks, and Jeff and Frank, good luck in new ventures. And Frank, I guess we will be talking together quite a lot more. ","Jeff Gustavson","Thank you.","Frank Mount","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Due to time constraints, our final question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Brad Heffern","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how cost savings that you\u2019ve realized today have aligned with what was contemplated by your original CapEx budget, if you are seeking cost deflation happen more quickly than you would have expected. I'm just looking at the international CapEx number for the first quarter, hence down $2 billion, is that good cost savings or is that just normal inter-quarter [ph] volatility?","Pat Yarrington","All right. So I would say in general, the cost savings that we are seeing and that we anticipate seeing would probably be somewhat stronger than what we had baked into our $35 billion budget. And that's really just a function of when we were doing the budget and what we were anticipating versus what we are -- we believe being able to secure going forward. ","I don't think you will have seen much of that in the quarter-to-quarter comparisons as of yet, so what you're seeing quarter-to-quarter comparisons really has more to do with the pattern of actual spending from fourth to first.","Brad Heffern","Okay, understood. And just thinking about that, if you prorate the first quarter for the full year, you are already below the $35 billion number. How should we think about the CapEx trajectory throughout 2015?","Pat Yarrington","Yeah, I think you should think about it as being relatively evenly paced. The $35 billion target is what we expect to hit at the end of the year.","Brad Heffern","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Good day. "],"5123":["Chevron Corp.

My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead.","Mike Wirth","Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements, please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Back in March, I laid out Chevron's strategy to win in any environment. I outlined our three compelling strengths, an advantage portfolio, sustainability at lower prices, and a strong balance sheet. I also indicated that the combination of these distinct advantages together with the commitments to action highlighted in blue will deliver growing free cash flow and shareholder returns.","In 2018, we delivered. We grew oil and gas production by more than 7% achieving our highest ever annual production. We grew cash margins in our operated upstream assets, contributing to an improvement in cash returns. We lowered our unit costs and we sold $2 billion of assets. These outcomes yielded record free cash flow, a dividend increase and the initiation of the share repurchase program. 2018 was a very successful year and we intend to build on this momentum in 2019.","Turning to Slide 4, a view of our sources and uses of cash. Excluding working capital, we generated over $31 billion in cash flow from operations when we achieved record free cash flow of nearly $17 billion, the highest level ever achieved by Chevron in any price environment. This allowed us to deliver on all pore of our financial priorities. For the 31st consecutive year, we maintained our commitment to dividend growth and paid out 8.5 billion in cash dividends to our shareholders.","Earlier this week, we announced a $0.07 per share increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, representing a 6% increase. Second, we allocated capital across a diverse portfolio and funded our highest return projects. We have confident these investments position us for sustainable growth and free cash flow. Third, we strengthened our balance sheet and paid down debt by 4.5 billion. Finally, we began repurchasing shares in the third quarter and increased the rate in the fourth quarter, demonstrating further confidence in our future cash generation.","With that I'll, turn the call over to Pat who will take you through the financial results. Pat?","Pat Yarrington","Thanks Mike. Turning to Slide 5, an overview of our financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings were $3.7 billion or $1.95 per diluted share. 2018 full year earnings were $14.8 billion or $7.74 per diluted share, up more than 60% from 2017. In the quarter, foreign exchange gains of 268 million were offset by a special item related to the project write off. The detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation.","For the full year earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange totaled 15.5 billion. Return on capital employed for 2018 was 8.2%, up from 5% in 2017. Our debt ratio at yearend was 18% and our net debt ratio was approximately 14%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends, brining the full year total to 8.5 billion; and we increased the rate of our share repurchases from 750 million in the third quarter to 1 billion in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 6. For the full year, cash flow from operations totaled 30.6 billion about 50% higher than 2017. Headwinds as we defined them in the past, total 2.2 billion for the year in line with my original guidance. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was 9.2 billion. It was lower than in the third quarter primarily because of lower commodity prices, but it was above first quarter when prices were comparable. This improvement was in the year was due to growth in production.","Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4 billion and 13.8 billion for the year. And resulting free cash flow of almost $17 billion reduced our dividend breakeven price. We are covering our cash CapEx and dividend at just under $53 Brent, without consideration of asset sale proceeds. Before moving off cash flow a little guidance for 2019. As prices hold at current levels, we expect headwinds for 2019 to be between $2 billion and $3 billion.","Now onto Slide 7. Full year 2018 earnings of 14.8 billion were approximately 5.6 billion higher than 2017. Special items, primarily the absence of U.S. tax reform gain of 2 billion lower gains on asset sales and an increase in charges relating to project write off resulted in a net 3.9 billion decrease in earnings.","Our previous foreign exchange impact benefited earnings between the periods by 1.1 billion. Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by about 9.3 billion between periods primarily because of higher realization and increased lifting, slightly offsetting where higher operating expenses largely associated with continued ramp up production along with additional taxes and other costs.","Downstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by just over 90 million, lower volumes reflected sales of our Canadian and South African refining and marketing assets while higher operating expenses were associated with planned turnaround activity in the U.S. These earnings were mostly offset by favorable timing effects and improved results at CPChem.","In the other segment excluding special items and foreign exchange, net charges for the period increased by almost 750 million, due primarily to higher interest expense and lower tax deductibility for corporate charges. Full year net charges $2.3 billion in line with our guidance. Our 2019 guidance for the other segment remains about $2.4 billion in net charges. As a reminder though, quarterly results in this segment are non-ratable.","Now on Slide 8. 2018 production was 2.93 million barrels a day, an increase of 202,000 barrels a day or more than 7% from 2017. This is the highest level of production in the Company's history. Excluding the impact of 2018 assets sales, production grew approximately 8% or 1% above the top of the guidance range we provided last January. Major capital projects increased production by 227,000 barrels a day as we continue to ramp up production at multiple projects most significantly Wheatstone and Gorgon.","Shale and tight production increased 132,000 barrels a day, primarily in the Permian where production grew by more than 70% from 2017. Base declines net of production from new wells, mostly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria were 19,000 barrels a day. The impact of asset sales in particular from the U.S. mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico Shelf and Elk Hills field in California reduced production by 50,000 barrels per day.","Entitlement effects in total reduced production by 46,000 barrels a day, 17,000 of which was due to the effect of higher prices during the year. Higher plan turnaround effects primarily at Angola LNG and Tengiz, reduced production between years by 26,000 barrels per day.","I'll now hand it back to Mike.","Mike Wirth","Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide 9, reserve replacement continues to be a real success story. In 2018, our reserve replacement ratio was 136%. We added almost 400 million more barrels than we produced and divested. This outcome is especially significant because it was achieved while growing production more than 7%. Our reserves to production ratio stands at a healthy 11.3 years, showing the strength and sustainability of our portfolio. Our five year reserve replacement ratio of 117% further illustrates as strength through the price downturn.","Moving to Slide 10. We continue to maintain our commitment to capital discipline. Total C&E in 2018 was 20.1 billion. This included approximately 600 million of inorganic expense for which we don't budget, primarily related to bonus payments for offshore leases in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. The stacked bar depicts our organic C&E budget for 2019 of $20 billion.","Within this budget, the cash component is 13.7 billion while the remaining 6.3 billion is expenditures by affiliates, primarily TCO and CPChem. In our 2019 budget, 3.6 billion is allocated to the Permian and another 1.6 billion is allocated to other shale and tight assets. We expect approximately 70% of our total 2019 spends to deliver cash within two years. Our current spend profile has significantly lower execution risk relative to the past, and we have several large scale major capital projects underway concurrently.","Turning to Slide 11. I would like to provide an update on our portfolio optimization efforts. During 2018, we received before tax asset sale proceeds of $2 billion, with the largest contributors being the divestment of our Southern Africa refining and marketing business and our interest in the Elk Hills field in California. We recently completed the sale of our interest in the Rosebank project West of Shetlands in the UK.","In addition, we expect to close the sale of our interest in the Danish underground consortium in the first half of 2019, and earlier this week, we executed an agreement to sell our interest in the project deal in Brazil. We continue marketing our UK central North Sea and Azerbaijan assets. And with all the investments, we are focused on generating good value from any transaction. The progress we made last year is consistent with our guidance of $5 billion to $10 billion in asset sale proceeds from 2018 to 2020.","Turning to the Permian. Production in the fourth quarter was 377,000 barrels per day, up 172,000 barrels per day or 84% relative to the same quarter last year. Annual production was up more than 70%. In the Permian, we remained focused on returns. We are not chasing a production target, nor are we altering our plans based on the price of the day. Over the last two years, we transacted more than 150,000 acres through swaps, joint ventures, farm outs and sales, further optimizing our large land position.","In 2018, we had Takeaway capacity for oil and liquids that was more than sufficient, and we've already added more capacity this year. We're pleased with our position and leading performance in the Permian. In just two years, we've doubled our rig count, increased our resource base, decreased unit development and operating costs and more than doubled our production. We will provide new guidance for our Permian portfolio in March.","Moving to LNG, the plants at Gorgon and Wheatstone performed well during the fourth quarter and average almost 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was despite higher summer temperatures in December. Higher temperatures as you know generally reduce LNG throughput. We loaded 329 LNG cargoes from Gorgon and Wheatstone last year. We have now commissioned that Wheatstone domestic gas plant and expect to provide gas to the local market in the next few weeks.","We will begin our routine cycle of planned turnarounds at Gorgon this year. We will be on a four-year cycle with one frame undergoing maintenance each of the first three years and the fourth year having no turnarounds scheduled. We expect turnarounds at the Gorgon fence to last about 40 days. These turnarounds offer the opportunities perform routine maintenance and also to make small enhancements that increase reliability and throughput. We anticipate significant cash generation from these assets for many years to come.","Slide 14 shows our production outlook for this year, assuming a $60 Brent price. We expect production to be 4% to 7% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2018 asset sales. Our growth is largely driven by shale and tight assets and full year production from Train 2 at Wheatstone. These forecasts always need to acknowledge the uncertainties in our business as noted on the slide. In summary, we anticipate a third consecutive year of strong production growth.","Moving to Slide 15, as announced earlier this week, we signed an agreement with Petrobras America Inc. to purchase its 110,000 barrel per day refinery and related assets in Pasadena, Texas. This addition to our Gulf Coast refining system allows us to process more domestic light crude, supply a portion of our retail market in Texas and Louisiana with Chevron produced products, and realize regional synergies through coordination with the refinery in Pascagoula. We expect to close by midyear and will provide further updates in our analyst meeting in March.","Now just a few comments about future expectations. We expect positive production trends to continue in the first quarter and throughout 2019, reflected in the 4% to 7% growth forecast. As early as first quarter, we expect additional co-lending to TCO in support of the future growth project. In downstream, we expect low refinery turnaround activity in the first quarter which as you recall from our previous disclosures equates to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of less than $100 million.","Earlier in the call, Pat provided you guidance on cash flow headwinds and corporate charges for 2019. And as we communicated earlier this week, there will be a $0.07 per share quarterly dividend increase and we anticipate $1 billion in share repurchases during the quarter.","Moving to Slide 17 I would like to share a few closing thoughts. As I mentioned before, we intend to win in any abundance. As a result of our advantaged portfolio, capital discipline, lower execution risk, strong balance sheet and record level free cash flow, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if necessary, and will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Your question please.","Phil Gresh","First question, you talked about the dividend breakeven a $53 in 2018, you stepped up a dividend here at a higher rate than last year, and you\u2019re also stepping up the buyback. So I guess may if you could just elaborate a little bit on this breakeven where you see that going? Is it moving lower and giving you more confidence than the more return on capital? Or just how you think about that capital?","Mike Wirth","Well, Phil, we worked really hard over the last few years to get that breakdown. We were in the 80s not that long ago and have made significant progress in bringing the dividend breakeven down. We have provided I think a simple way to think about it in some of our prior definitions, and as we look forward in 2019, we think the dividend breakeven remains in the area where it was last year.","You see we've got really strong cash flows coming in right now, and the commitment to a competitive increase in the dividends the confidence to step up through right a share repurchases is evidence of our confidence that we've got those cash flows coming in, in a price environments, any reasonable price environment as Pat has said, that we will be able to sustain those kinds of payouts.","The other thing I would just point out is, our capital spending is still the same. And we have got the ability to provide strong production growth, sustain the kind of cash margins that you have seen out of our portfolio and do that at really modest capital spending relative to our history.","Phil Gresh","The second question I guess would just be on that capital spending budget specifically for 2019. The Permian piece pretty flattish year-over-year which I think you've highlighted last quarter. The non-Permian shale piece just got the up quite a bit here. And I just wanted to know if you could maybe elaborate on that a little, not just stealing the thunder from the analyst day but. Is that something that is going to be contributing to this 2019 production growth guidance? Or is that something that you're ramping in '19, it would be more of a future contribution?","Mike Wirth","Well, we are beginning to ramp in the other basins. So, we've added rigs actually in all the other shale and tight basins in which we operate. We've seen significant reductions in development costs in the Marcellus, in the Duvernay and in Vaca Muerta as we have shared the learnings and improvements that are emanating from the large scale activity we have in the Permian. The economics on each of these are compelling. The EURs are coming up. And while the Permian maybe in the spotlight within our shale and tight portfolio, it's far from the only asset that we have.","The other thing that I just note is, we have begun an eight well appraisal program in El Trapial in the north of the Vaca Muerta. We are currently producing in the Sothern area Lana Compa\u00f1\u00eda, but our folks are intrigued by the possibilities up in the north at El Trapial, and we continue to prosecute that program. We have also picked up additional acreage in the Narambuena, a 25,000 net acres where non-operated with YPS, and we got a full well pilot that we plan to execute there in 2019 as well.","So great potential in Argentina and we really like our entire shale and tight portfolio; and again, it brings some of the characteristics we have been talking about, which is short cycle time, attractive economics, low development costs and the ability to generate cash relatively rapidly. The last thing I'll say about that is it brings a much lower risk profile than multiyear multibillion-dollar capital projects.","Phil Gresh","And Pat, what was the amount of the co-lend for TCO?","Pat Yarrington","In 2018 the co-lend was zero.","Phil Gresh","For the 1Q guide, I\u2019m sorry.","Pat Yarrington","Oh, the 1Q guide, okay. So, I don\u2019t have like I would say, a confirm number here for you because it will depend on what happens to price. It will depend on what happened and how the cash flow that\u2019s generated from operations matches against the investment profile for the project. It will also depend on the dividend distribution requirements for the partnership. But I think order of magnitude, if you go back and you look at 2016 when we first started the co lending that was about $2 billion, and I think as order of magnitude starting off base, maybe think about $2 billion for this year. But as I say, we reserve the right to change that number as the year progresses and we see what actually happens to prices and the investment profile and as discussions are under way on dividend.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Chain from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Chain","Mike, you talk about Argentina. I'm wondering, given the political environment, the infrastructure or lack of infrastructure over there, how quickly you think you can proceed with the development plan? And any kind of timeline or the pace or the capital outlook, any kind of data that you can share?","Mike Wirth","We will probably talk about this little bit more in March Paul. But I'd just reiterate, YPF has been a very, very good partner there. There Macri government is committed to improving the investment climate in Argentina and has instituted a number of reforms to encourage and support energy development in the country. We have great resource there that\u2019s benefiting from the Permian learning and competitive economics, multiple blocks that we picked up, and much of production can actually stay in the country.","So at this point, yes, the infrastructure is not developed the way that it is in United States or perhaps North America more broadly, but there's a commitment on the part of the government to do that. And we'll pace our developments with the gas and liquids take away and market conditions. So, the realities on the ground in Argentina are a little bit different, but I got to see the resources tremendous, and we\u2019re very encouraged by the policy reforms that have been put forth by the government.","Paul Chain","And for Pasadena, the refinery that you just bought, what's the game plan for that facility? I mean, are you going to need to make a significant investment up front to bring them to the Chevron standard? Because that facility probably has been underinvested at least for 20, if not 30-plus years and the labor relationship has been always very rocky. So what's the game plan? And how much is the upfront investment? And secondly, are you going to run it as a full-blown facility or that is sort of by an extension of Pascagoula?","Mike Wirth","So, let me try to respond to that Paul as best I can. We just executed an agreement this week. We don\u2019t expect to close here until somewhat later here in the first half of the year. So, it's a little premature for me to lay out an investment plan fully actually closed the transaction. In the due diligence, we have satisfied ourselves that we can operate the facility safely and reliably at the standards that we would expect. And so, I don\u2019t think you should have any concerns there. It meets our three primary criteria.","One, we are getting it at a good price, and I believe one of the ways that you take risk out of the final acquisitions as you should don't overpay, and I don't think that we are over paying for the asset. It's in a great location and that allows us to integrate to increasing like crude production. Out of West Texas that allows us to serve our markets in Texas with product that we run through our own system as opposed to exchange or purchase product, and it will allow us to optimize and integrate with the Pascagoula refinery.","The third thing is, it provides good strong economics and because of our system in the three kind of strategic levers that I just talked about we ought to be able to optimize that refinery as a part of our system in a way that is different than what the current owner can simply because they don't have those other assets and those other positions.","And so within our business, this fills a bit of a gap, it gives us the ability to capture value in multiple different dimensions. And overtime, we will evaluate what investments we may choose to make there as we would in the other refinery. I would expect those to be relatively modest. I would expect them to be thoughtfully paced overtime and fit within the level of spending that we've established over the past many years in our downstream business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Neil Mehta","The first question I had with around Tengiz. In the latest on the project are you feeling good about the timeline and thoughts on cost and the contingency as well?","Mike Wirth","So I probably don\u2019t have a lot to add to what we have previously said on this. We are still on schedule, so we are still targeting a 2022 startup. As I think Jay mentioned on our third quarter call, on site productivity has improved. We had a very good summer. The logistics are working very well as we are moving modules now from Korea to the staging points. We can't move through the inland waterway system during the wintertime because it freezes up, but modules arriving from Korea from Italy and from Kazakhstan. The quality levels are very high.","We are about halfway through the project about 50% complete at this point. And in 2019, it will be a key year. There's a lot of activity in terms of moving modules into the Caspian to the site a lot of fieldwork where we will see if these productivity gains can be built upon again in 2019 and it\u2019s certainly a year where we will reduce uncertainty.","Jay is actually headed there this weekend and will be there in next week. And when we get to New York in March, he will have had recent field visits to Kazakhstan and also to Korea. He was in Korea visiting the module fabrication yards last week and he will be in a position to give you very good insight into exactly where we stand and what our expectations are.","Neil Mehta","Yes, looking forward to that. And the follow-up: we just want to get some more color on the share buyback. To follow up on Phil's question, I think most of us were expecting $750 million. It came in at $1 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the share buyback program, our view had been that this program would be kind of a base load $3 billion program into perpetuity, but you are demonstrating that you are willing to flex and lean into it. Can you talk about the philosophy behind that share repurchase program? Is a higher run rate potentially sustainable? And how you think about flexing it from a big picture and then a more granular perspective?","Mike Wirth","Yes, I\u2019m going to let Pat take it.","Pat Yarrington","I think the keyword here is suitability and what you saw with our increase was just, our view of future cash generation, the confidence that we have in our future cash generation and the belief that we could move that rate of quarterly purchase up to $4 billion. When we first initiated this back in the second quarter call, the points that I made were that we really wanted to have this be through the cycle and sustainable through the cycle.","And so that\u2019s really we paid the $3 billion because we thought that would be supportable to any reasonable price environment. We obviously had stronger prices in 2018 and not that come off a little bit, but we still feel very strong about our cash generation in 2019 and frankly in the years to come.","You will note, maybe you won\u2019t note, but we did release an 8K this morning as well that talked to the fact that our board has supported a resolution for a $25 billion with share repurchase program with no term limit. So I think that $25 billion gives you can indication of that commitment, that we have to this program our view about the sustainability. Yes, I think that should be very strong message to our investor about our willingness and intent to boost shareholders distribution.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.","Jason Gammel","I wanted to ask a question about the cost structure of the Company. And the reason I ask is you have already taken a lot of cost out of the upstream, but you seem to be with divestitures and some explorations concentrating more and more into the highest-quality assets. I am just wondering if there is the potential to take further overhead out of the business through medium-term shutting down regional offices, etc. This seems to be right out of the Mike Wirth downstream playbook of taking further cost out and enhancing returns through concentration.","Mike Wirth","Jason, I will give you short answer and the answer is yes. I think in a commodity business you always have to looking for efficiencies, and I think scale matters and we need to continue to look for ways to control our own destiny. And a big part is moving into assets that have inherently lower cost structures in continuous seeking an efficient overhead structure to support that. I will tell you that, not only can you do that through what I would call conventional means in a ways there is always been done, but technology today offers us the ability to do even more as we bring digital technologies into our business and can do things in a business that really grew up in an analog world. There's a lot of opportunity to find more efficiencies.","The other thing when you\u2019re growing your business, it's important to pay attention to unit cost and we've seen unit cost come down significantly. We see this year another 2% reduction or so in unit cost, and as you look out to 2020 and 2021, I think that number can go up even more in terms of the percent reduction or the other way to say as unit cost can come down even more. So, we need to be prepared to be competitive in an environment where prices are not what we look to and we will continue to work on cost efficiencies across our entire portfolio.","Jason Gammel","Just a very quick follow-up, can you talk about the ramp-up progress at Big Foot?","Mike Wirth","Yes, so, we have got the first well online and it's been performing very well. It came on in November of last year. The second well is being drilled and completed as we speak, and we anticipate that going on here in the first quarter. So we will steadily move through the process of adding wells at Bigfoot and you can expect that to be part of the production story in 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your question please.","Paul Sankey","You mentioned that you've done about 150,000 acres of swaps or sales I believe in the Permian, Mike. And hi, Pat, by the way. Sorry, I was slightly caught off guard there. I wanted just an update on where your final numbers are for Permian acreage. And how you feel about that, given that there's potentially some fairly major assets available. I guess you are strongly outperforming your volume targets. Can you also talk about your returns there? Because there's concerns that you are perhaps not as leading-edge as we might want you to be in terms of your Permian performance on a returns basis.","Mike Wirth","Yes, so, we will share lot more detail in March because as you can see, the performance out of the Permian continues to be exceptionally strong. With the large land position that we have, we have got good currency and optionality, we try to improve that because everybody is interested in drilling longer laterals finding contiguous development areas.","And so, with our 2.2 million net acres and 1.7 million in the Midland of Delaware basins, we have got lots of levers with which to optimize our position and the nice thing about these transactions is they are truly win-win because you can transact with other people. There is enough economic value creation that you're not trying to split a finite pie, but you creating a bigger pie for both.","Our currently disclosed resource, there is 1.2 billion barrels that\u2019s a figure that we would expect to grow. So our confidence in the Permian is higher today than it was the last time that I spoke to you. When you talk about returns, we put out data before on the returns that we are seeing and they are well locked in 35% plus range as we have moved to longer laterals of better basis of design and even in a modest price environment, we are seeing very, very strong returns. It's as good as or better than anything else we could be doing.","We are returns-driven and I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and I'll reiterate that, and as returns across the lifecycle of the asset and as returns across the entire value chain. And so we are not looking to put the most wells online or have the biggest IPs, we are looking to get the best returns out of the system. We paused at 20 rigs for several years. We've been telling you we are going to grow to a 20 rig fleet.","And as you go through that kind of growth, you stress the system little bit. And so, we're pausing in terms of adding rates at this point in order to ensure that anything that needs some proof from a thought performance standpoint will. We engage in regular benchmarking within the basin. We have a number of non operated joint ventures, we got really good visibility into what other operators are doing and what levels they are performing at. And I will simply tell you that we\u2019re continuing to improve performance in every dimension in intent to continue to and using benchmarking to identify the areas where we can get better.","So, our Jay will talk a lot more about this in March. We will have a breakout session that will give you a chance to go into details with questions as well. But we feel like we are delivering better performance and across the value chain, I mentioned we been well situated with takeaway capacity and we\u2019ve added capacity already in 2019. So we\u2019re able to capture margin across the value chain and later this year that will include refining margin.","Paul Sankey","Thanks Mike. And we know also that you have got an advantaged mineral right position there, which seems to be one of the issues with any potential major deals that might occur in the Permian in the near future. Mike, if I could ask you another one. I was going to make some elaborate joke about you keeping it competitive by not having just the CEO on the call but also the CFO. But obviously referring to Exxon's CEO being on the call this morning, there is a major number of major differentiations between the two companies and one of them is your flat CapEx outlook. I think that you would do well to maintain that. I think it is a relatively long-term outlook as it stands. You have just drifted towards the top of the range without going above it. What are the prospects of you actually seeing falling CapEx and CapEx that surprises to the downside going forward, given that your growth trajectory looks very good for a company of your size?","Mike Wirth","Yes, so we were committed to capital discipline. We can grow our business at modest capital levels and we have more good things to invest and then we will invest in. Last year there are two notable examples. We relinquished our rights to the Tigris development project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, not because it's not a good project, not because it can\u2019t generate a return but we have better opportunities within our portfolio, same thing with Rosebank good projects, a lot of resource but one that probably fits better for someone else than it does for us given our alternatives to invest. And so, we will continue to make those kinds of choices.","The one thing that came up in the call earlier were the other shale and tight opportunities, and those are really economic as well. And so, there are opportunities for us to whether you're talking in the Permian or some of these other areas overtime to find highly attractive opportunities to invest further capital generate strong returns, minimize execution risk, short cycle annual.","And as our portfolio grows, we were up 5% in production, two years ago 7% last year we just outlined 4% to 7% this year growing portfolio overtime does require modestly higher based capital spending that would go with that. And so, we're committed to capital discipline and I think you've characterized our ability to grow it. So it's relatively flat capital well. We will update forward views beyond what we've already articulated when we get to the March meetings.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons. Your question please.","Blake Fernandez","Two questions for you. One: could you talk a little bit about Venezuela? I know it's early days, but obviously you do have exposure there, both upstream and downstream and just any helpful thoughts that might help us out on our end.","Mike Wirth","Yes, I can give you quick update on Venezuela, Blake. First and most important thing for us is the safety of our people on the ground, and so that's what we are really focused on. We also want to be sure the operations where we have an interest are safe and environmentally sound. And I can tell you that that is the case. We have worked closely with the governments to be sure that we understand the intent of the sanctions within a number of new general licenses issued by the Treasury Department. And so, we are in close consultation to be sure we understand them and how they are to be applied.","And I will say that the U.S. government has been very interested and engaging with us to understand our position on the ground. And we continue to operate and I think for the foreseeable future we feel like we can maintain a good stable operation and the safe operation on the ground in Venezuela. If you look at it from the downstream side in the U.S., Pascagoula is the one refinery of ours that tends to run Venezuelan crude and it runs 70,000, 75,000 barrels give or take. For some time, the prospects of actions like this have been clear and so we have had contingency plans in place."," We have got alternate sourcing. We have got plenty of crude in tank for Pascagoula. We have got crude on the water there. And so, we are good here for the balance of the first quarter and maybe a little bit beyond and then back to visit our contingency planning into a full-scale execution right now. So, we will keep the refinery full with the crude. We will optimize and I think we feel like we are going to able to navigate through this. Our biggest hope is for stability on the ground in Venezuela and the safety of, not only our employees, but the contractors and the people in Venezuela.","Blake Fernandez","The second question: I know you've kind of covered Pasadena and we will get some additional color in March. But just more broadly speaking, I think you have kind of alluded to a potential acquisition of a refinery on the Gulf Coast for some time. The size of this is 110,000 barrels a day or so, which isn't small, but it's not really large in context of some of the Gulf Coast facilities. Does this satisfy kind of your appetite or integration potential there? Or do you think there is additional scope to kind of expand that overtime?","Mike Wirth","I don\u2019t want to speculate really we got one transaction here that we have signed an agreement on. The key is value and the ability for it to not only yield value on a standalone basis, but to integrate into our network and to be sure we can capture value out of them so we are focused on that with the Pasadena refinery. And I think I will leave it at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Roger Read","I know all the really fun stuff has got to wait to March, but maybe to take a look at your CapEx mix. You mentioned 70% has a 2-year or less weighting to cash flow, whereas the rest obviously longer. Do you think as we not so much look at a total CapEx number but the mix within that CapEx, does that start to change back over the next couple years? I'm thinking number one: you signed a long-term deepwater rig contract obviously aimed at some of the more challenging parts of the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So as things like that start to come in, do we see that start to move maybe to more of a 50\/50 on CapEx? Or is that something you want to maintain maybe more at the 70\/30 level as we think over the next several years?","Mike Wirth","Yes, Roger, it\u2019s a good question because our mix has shifted very dramatically from it was not long ago and its come down by 50% from the high watermark and that shifted in terms of makeup. I think both important issues and going back to Paul Sankey's question. I think that is the new normal for us. We got in this year budget a little bit over $5 million for shale and tight, 3.6 in the Permian, 1.6 on other shale and tight. And overtime, I think that number is likely to grow rather than on shrink. We get FGP which is in the peak spending years this year and next. And so, that's a non-trivial amount little bit over $4 billion in this year's budget. And so as that moves past the fleet and comes down, it creates room for other things and that could include deepwater, it could include more shale and tight or other major capital projects.","On the under deepwater our incent was to have a ratable development program and I think one of the things that we have learned over this past cycle I mentioned, we have very large MCP underway simultaneously is that that introduces execution risk that is real. And so, our intent would be to have a balanced approach as we go forward and not to find ourselves. So overly skewed to that kind of risk that that it becomes an issue that's difficult to manage and because we've got the really strong shale and tight portfolio, I think that plus our base business which again is requires investment, but it's typically short cycle and trip to go from capital spent to cash in the door. I think the kind of range that we\u2019re today is more likely to plus or minus be the range you would see in the future as opposed to something that flips back the other direction.","Roger Read","And then just to beat the Pasadena refining horse a little bit harder here, part of the acquisition indicated some undeveloped acreage. Are we wrong to think about this as just a refining acquisition and maybe should think about it more as an infrastructure opportunity across the board? I'm thinking we're moving more and more towards crude exports from the US.","Mike Wirth","I think there is a reason we disclose that because the asset there is not simply the refinery, but it's the port access, it\u2019s the tankage and it's the land. And I mentioned a couple of times that, our goal is to integrate this into our system. That means our upstream system or downstream system our trading system, and when I was young pup one of the lessons I learned from Susan engineer in one of our refineries is, he said, the cheapest process we have in this refineries is call the tank.","And so, there are times when we can fall in love with building complex equipment and there are realities that you can create optionality and margin through infrastructure and commercial activity at relatively lower investment. And I think this asset offers us on the opportunity to not just participate in the refining margin, but also to look at the other ways that through our integrated system we can capture value across the entire value chain both up and downstream and that's the way we are approaching this.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.","Sam Margolin","Mike, I'm going to try to not ask you to say the same thing again in a different way. But one of the outcomes of the much Permian growth is maybe that the free cash flow profile of the Permian as a standalone entity has been pulled forward significantly. And maybe that is sort of an obvious statement or it is not new. But it seems like that is an important pendulum swing with respect to how you might think about additional long-cycle projects. So among all these other factors that are sort of -- that you have commented on kind of pointing you to thinking about expanding the portfolio in deepwater or other long-cycle areas, is that something that's important, too? Or is that more something that is on plan and you are just thinking about that within the buyback and the dividend growth and all your other sort of uses of cash that are out there?","Mike Wirth","So I think the increase performance of the Permian is a good new story. We did spend little more capital last year because we were finding that we can drill more hole we have changed our basis of designs, so little bit of capital overrun was related to the good news story that we are getting a lot more production out of the Permian. And our guidance has been we are free cash flow positive in 2020, and I think that\u2019s still a good way for you to think about it. As we have reached the crossover points it crosses over.","And we have increased the dividend that Pat has already addressed the confidence in increasing the rate at which we are repurchasing shares and our intent to sustain that through the cycle. Having strong free cash flow creates alternatives and we intend to use the free cash flow to be very mindful of the need for shareholder distributions and also to look for good investment opportunities. I mentioned we were able to meet all four priorities this last year in terms of dividend investments balance sheet and share repurchases and our intent is to continue to respect that going forward. This kind of growth and free cash flow allows us to do that.","Sam Margolin","Okay. And just on a related note; I guess this one is for Pat. Is there -- leverage came down a lot. Is there a target leverage to think about conceptually? Or is it just something that is going to be a function of commodity prices in terms of the rate at which the balance sheet fluctuates here?","Pat Yarrington","Sam, we don\u2019t have a target leverage rate, we think of the balance sheet as being the outcome of other previously outstanding decisions about how we use the cash that we are generating. As I have said in the past, maybe a 20% leverage ratio on average through the cycles. And during the stronger price environment, you would obviously build back your balance sheet some and when you are in the weaker price environment you use it some.","So, I think that\u2019s really what we are trying to -- that\u2019s kind of the sweet spot or the sweet area that we are trying to play in. Having a good balance sheet, it\u2019s a good insurance policy. And having a good balance sheet, allows us for both dividend and share repurchases to sustain those through any period of price weakness. And we feel that that\u2019s an important component.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question please.","Alastair Syme","It was really just one on your view on the state of the Gulf Coast chemical polyethylene market and how that makes you think about potential expansion plans. Thank you.","Mike Wirth","We\u2019re still very positive on the petrochemical investments opportunity and particularly here in the states. I think it\u2019s a good long-term story. We've seen some pressure on margins here recently because feedstock costs in the third quarter were up. I think all in the chain margins have been under little bit of pressure, but these things happen in commodity markets with long cycle time for projects, and kinds of ebbs and flows in the economy. So, that hasn't fundamentally changed our view on the attractiveness of the sector.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Doug Leggate","And Mike, we always appreciate you getting on these calls, so thanks again for doing it this time around. Mike, my question might actually be for Pat. Pat, you talked about the $13-billion-plus of cash spending. Can you give us an idea as the affiliate spending rolls off with Tengiz completed, how do you anticipate that cash CapEx to trend, given that you are holding the line on the $18 billion to $20 billion absolute spending at least through 2020?","Pat Yarrington","I think Mike, answer that question in a way, although, we didn\u2019t split out cash verses total headline C&E. But as you see TCO's spending come off and as we move toward first production there in 2022, the other affiliate where we have potentially investment opportunities would be CPChem. And so that what occurs in that particular category will be a function of how decisions are made on investment [technical difficulty] for example.","So it's not something that I can project with any degree of certainty. I think what\u2019s important is that the summation of both, what I would say company owned and operated an affiliate owned and operated, we\u2019re staying that $18 billion to $20 billion range for the near-term here certainly, and we will give you an update in March on prospectively longer period of time. But I think capital discipline is a theme that you want to read through all of this and the fact is that we have the opportunity to be very judicious and very selective about how we work in additional projects into our queue.","Doug Leggate","I know it's a tough one to answer, given all the variables. My follow-up is kind of related, I guess. But if we go back to 2010, 2011, 2012, through 2014, 2015, obviously a lot of big oils, yourselves included, were spending much higher levels than you are today. And one assumes that that created a lot of cost recovery barrels in some of the PSCs. So I guess my question is to the extent you can, as we look forward in light of Thailand, how do you see your entitlement barrels trending if you maintain that CapEx at these levels? Do you start to see cost recovery barrels tail off? And if you can maybe offer some quantification of that, I would appreciate it.","Pat Yarrington","Doug, I don\u2019t think we've got numbers here that we can isolate for you on that. Cost recovery applies across the number of locations in our portfolio here. You\u2019re obviously aware of what happened in Indonesia. So, I don\u2019t think I have a pinpointed answer that I can give you on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question please.","Doug Terreson","Mike, I have a question about portfolio optimization and specifically the divestiture part of the plan. And on this point, you guys have had a pretty active program over the years, but you still also have a decent amount of value left in the queue. So my question is, is this because the market for assets has softened somewhat? Or do you consider it to be kind of normal course of business during the cycle or is it something else? So any color on your divestiture program and the market trends you guys are experiencing is really the question.","Mike Wirth","Yes, I'm not a 100% sure I'm tracking with you there, Doug. We have always had program of divestitures, and there were times it's a little high and times it\u2019s a little bit lower, but in this business you are continually looking to upgrade your portfolio. We have got some things now that are really attractive. And I earlier mentioned a couple of things that we stepped away from because we didn't think they would compete for capital.","Divestments are driven by a view on strategic alignments with our broader portfolio and our view of the future, the resource potential that remains particular asset, will it compete for capital within our portfolio and there are good things as I mentioned earlier that cannot and then can we receive fair value. So that maybe a little bit of a function of what's the macro environment and the forward view on commodity price. But we are in a position that I think you can expect us to continue to high-grade our portfolio.","Doug Terreson","Yes. So Mike, maybe I should have asked it differently. So it seems like you guys are experiencing healthy enough appetite for assets if you were a seller. Is that a good way to think about it?","Mike Wirth","Yes, everything we are talking to people about right now we think we are likely to receive very good value.","Operator","Our last question for today comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Biraj Borkhataria","It was actually on the reserve replacement. In 2018, you had 136%; that was a pretty impressive figure, given the growth trajectory over the last few years. I was wondering if you could just disaggregate some of the impacts there, particularly on the price impact in terms of revisions from 2017 to 2018. And then what the key kind of moving parts where. Thank you.","Mike Wirth","Yes, so, we did have another strong year, and our largest ads came through our Permian shale and tight activity through other shale and tight, and some of these other basins we've been talking about our Gorgon and Wheatstone, so primarily in the unconventional but contributions across the board from Australia, Canada, Asia, Gulf of Mexico, Eurasia. Our price was relatively small negative revision less than 100 million barrels on price. We produced just short of 1.1 billion barrels we sold about 60 million barrels.","So, there was not a big price impact in there and while unconventionals were the big piece, so we had contributions from others. The one thing that I would call your attention to is what we view as very high quality reserve addition. They are barrels that have bring with them lower risk that\u2019s lower execution risk and lower geologic risks and lower breakeven prices. And so, we would expect to continue to have a good strong reserve replacement story as we go forward given the quality of our portfolio and the continued improvements that we see particularly on conventional development activities.","All right, well, that is the top of the hour. I want to thank everybody for your time today. I appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call, and I look forward to see many of not all of you in New York City in March. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5014":["Chevron Corp.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay, good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Steve Green, President, Chevron Asia-Pacific Exploration & Production company. Also joining us on the call is Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on slide 2.","I'll begin with a discussion of first quarter 2017 results. Steve will provide an update on upstream activities, with an emphasis on the portfolio he leads in the Asia-Pacific region. Then I'll conclude with a recap of key messages from our March 2017 security analyst meeting.","Turning to slide 3, an overview of our financial performance, the company's first quarter earnings were $2.7 billion or $1.41 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and special items, as detailed in an appendix slide, earnings for the quarter totaled $2.3 billion or $1.23 per share.","Cash from operations for the quarter was $3.9 billion and included about $1 billion in working capital consumption. Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion.","At quarter end, debt balances stood at $45 billion, approximately $900 million lower than where we ended 2016. On a headline basis, this means a debt ratio of approximately 24%. On a net debt basis, our debt net of cash totaled $38 billion. Our debt ratio stood at approximately 20%.","During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.08 per share payable to stockholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield 4%.","Turning to slide 4, we intend to be cash balanced in 2017 at $50 Brent prices, and this slide demonstrates that we are nicely on our way to delivering that. First quarter 2017 net cash generation of $900 million incorporates the impacts of growing operating cash flow, reduced capital spend, and proceeds from asset sales. Operating cash flow reflects improved realizations and high-margin volume growth. Deferred tax effects were approximately $600 million, and affiliate earnings exceeded affiliate dividends by approximately $700 million. TCO did not pay a dividend during the first quarter. That is more likely a second half event.","Additionally, working capital requirements consumed approximately $1 billion in the quarter. If you look back over several years, you will generally see a pattern of working capital consumption in the first quarter and often the second quarter resulting from the timing of tax and variable compensation payments as well as inventory build. The historical pattern also shows reversal in the second half of the year, and we expect that reversal pattern to hold again this year.","Cash capital spend for the quarter was $3.3 billion, approximately $2.3 billion or 40% less than the first quarter of 2016. Reductions come mainly from finishing our major capital projects under construction, pacing and high-grading future investments, and realizing efficiency gains along with higher cost reductions. First quarter asset sale proceeds were $2.1 billion, primarily from the sale of our geothermal assets in Indonesia.","Turning now to slide 5, here you see current quarter earnings compared against the same period last year. First quarter 2017 results were $3.4 billion higher than first quarter 2016 results. Special items, primarily a gain from the sale of our Indonesian geothermal assets, increased earnings by $795 million between periods.","Upstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased $2.3 billion between periods. This reflected improved realizations, lower operating expenses, and increased volumes. Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by approximately $80 million, mostly due to the swing in timing effects and lower operating expenses. The variance in the other segment was primarily from lower employee expenses and favorable corporate tax items. As we've indicated previously, our guidance for the other segment is $1.6 billion in annual net charges, so quarterly results are likely to be non-ratable.","Turning to slide 6, I'll now compare results for the first quarter of 2017 with the fourth quarter of 2016. First quarter results were approximately $2.3 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Special items, mainly from a gain on the sale of geothermal assets in Indonesia, increased earnings between periods by $600 million, while foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $267 million between periods.","Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $267 million between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations. Downstream earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange were higher by $668 million, reflecting the absence of the impacts of the fourth quarter Richmond refinery turnaround and a swing in timing effects. The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges and a swing in corporate tax items between quarters.","Turning to slide 7, this chart shows first quarter production growth of 82,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or more than 3% from full-year 2016 levels. Startups and ramp-ups, primarily from Gorgon, Angola LNG, and Alder as well as growth in our Permian assets support accelerated production through the quarter. Base declines, the impact of production sharing and variable royalty contracts, along with the 2017 impact of asset sales consummated in 2016, reduced production. Looking forward to the remainder of 2017, we expect to see additional growth from Gorgon Train 3, the first train at Wheatstone, and Sonam. Additionally, we expect to see continued ramp-ups from other MCPs such as Mafumeira Sul and Moho Nord as well as growth in our Permian assets.","Ultimate production growth for 2017 will be impacted by uncertainties, such as the timing and speed of MCP startups and ramp-ups, external events such as the Partition Zone restart, and base decline rates. Price and spend levels will also impact the amount of cost recovery barrels we receive. All said, we expect to comfortably be within the 4% to 9% growth range we provided earlier in the year, again before asset sales.","Our current estimate for the impact of 2017 asset sales on production continues to be a reduction of 50,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement to sell our assets in Bangladesh, which produced approximately 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. The annualized impact of this and other asset sales will be dependent upon the timing of this close and of other individual transactions.","And now Steve will walk us through some upstream updates.","Stephen W. Green - Chevron Corp.","Thanks Pat. Good morning.","Turning to slide 8, all three trains at Gorgon are operational making LNG and in aggregate running over 85% of nameplate capacity, processing gas from both the Jansz and Gorgon fields. The Gorgon project is currently loading a ship about every two days and has shipped 67 cargoes to date, with 38 cargoes shipped since the beginning of the year. Cargo 68 is currently loading now.","Recent highlights include we maintained domestic gas production of about 130 million cubic feet per day through the quarter. The Gorgon offshore field started up mid-February. Trains 1 and 2 operated reliably near capacity, with first quarter net LNG production of 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Train 3 started up mid-March, a month ahead of schedule, and very much like Train 2, above expectations on ramp-up and approached nameplate capacity within two weeks","We recently completed a shutdown of Train 2. The shutdown was planned to address a reliability issue previously identified and resolved on Train 1 and on Train 3 prior to startup. Once all three trains are at nameplate capacity, our share of Gorgon production will be over 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Looking ahead, we'll complete commissioning and startup of additional equipment which boosts efficiency of the trains such as the turbo expanders and the end flash gas compressors, systems that can be started now that all three trains are operational. Once all systems are in operation, we can begin the optimization and tuning of each train, the first step in further increasing capacity. After this, we'll analyze plant performance and look for debottlenecking opportunities that'll increase capacity and capture incremental value going forward.","Turning to slide 9, at Wheatstone, the physical construction of all systems required to commence Train 1 startup is complete, and our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. Presently, we're focused on commissioning a range of systems as we move toward first gas and have begun running and testing the compressors. We've achieved permanent power at both the onshore and offshore facilities. We're also progressing activities such as mechanical, electrical, and instrument tests as well as final integrity inspections.","Within Chevron, we're leveraging our experience locally from Gorgon and more broadly from Angola LNG, which has been operating steadily since the beginning of this year. We're also working closely with our partner, Woodside, which operates several LNG projects. We're preparing for a strong startup, recognizing it is still the first train of a new facility. We anticipate Train 2 startup about 6 to 8 months after Train 1.","Turning to slide 10, a primary strength of our portfolio is our base business, where we generate value and cash flow through a disciplined approach. Capturing incremental value in base business is not new to us. We've been doing it for decades. During my time in Thailand, we continuously reinvented ourselves and increased efficiency. We planned our work to avoid stranding capital by bringing wells online timed to meet contractual obligations and market opportunities. This pattern continues today.","This chart provides an example from our Thailand E&P business, where we drill over 500 wells per year and have net production of 240,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We've seen a substantial reduction in unit development and operating cost through well planning and execution. We've applied these best practices across the company and are seeing benefits in places such as San Joaquin Valley, Indonesia, and the Permian.","We're also leveraging our installed capacity and our technological capability to generate value. An example comes from Agbami, where we've drilled and tied back 36 wells since 2005, which have kept the FPSO full. Another example is the 27-mile Lianzi tieback to an existing host in deepwater West Africa, where technology unlocked the opportunity to produce from a remote satellite reservoir.","We have an integrated operations center in many of our core assets, where we create collaborative environments for cross-functional teams to analyze asset performance data and to make better intervention decisions. These centers are low-cost and consistently generate value. At TCO, it's helped achieve and sustain record production levels, with a focus on reliability and continued optimization of the well portfolio. We also have an integrated operations center in the Permian, which we expect will help us increase reliability and drive efficiency as our activity levels and production grows.","Turning to slide 11, in the Permian, we continue to meet if not exceed expectations. The chart on the left shows our first quarter 2017 production of approximately 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up about 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the first quarter 2016. In March, we gave you our forecasted Permian compound annual growth rate of 20% to 35%, and we're currently well within that range. We're standing up our 12th rig, and our plan is to continue to add rigs at this pace, achieving 20 operated rigs by the end of 2018. In addition to our operated fleet, we'll see our share of production from 13 gross non-operated rigs.","We continue to see efficiency gains and improved well performance, and we're incorporating the learnings into our forward plans. We intend to realize value through accelerated development and deliberate portfolio actions from the 150,000 to 200,000 acres we have identified as candidates for swaps, leases, or sales. Our objective in the Permian is to be fully competitive on our unit development and production cost and realizations and use our superior royalty position to generate leading financial performance.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Pat.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay, thanks, Steve.","Now turning to slide 12, we continue to lower our cost structure and reduce our spend. The chart shows a steep reduction in quarterly average C&E since 2014. Year-to-date capital expenditures of $4.4 billion are down 22% compared to the average 2016 quarter and down 56% compared to the average 2014 quarter. We are trending below annual guidance. We previously communicated that our capital guidance range is $17 billion to $22 billion per year through 2020. If oil prices remain near the $50 per barrel mark, you can expect to see our future spend near the bottom of this range.","Year-to-date operating expense is down almost 11% when compared to the average 2016 quarter and down 26% when compared to the average 2014 quarter. We have made substantial progress on lowering our cost structure, and we are striving to have the remaining quarters of 2017 broadly continue this pattern.","Now on slide 13, we received approximately $2.1 billion in asset sale proceeds in the quarter, the vast majority of which related to the sale of our geothermal assets in Indonesia. Since the beginning of 2016, we've sold approximately $5 billion in assets, and thus have already achieved the lower band of our targeted two-year range.","Also during the quarter, we signed sales and purchase agreements to sell our marketing and refining assets in British Columbia and Alberta as well as our downstream business in South Africa and Botswana. These in-progress transactions are subject to regulatory reviews prior to closing, hopefully later this year. Additionally, we announced an agreement to sell our upstream assets in Bangladesh, a business where gas production is sold into the domestic market at a fixed price.","Turning now to slide 14, I'd like to close by reiterating our messages from our recent security analyst meeting. Our financial priorities are clear and consistent. Our number one priority is to maintain and grow the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. To do that, we're focused on three areas.","First, we are taking actions that should enable us to be cash balanced in 2017. We intend to continue to grow free cash flow thereafter. The first quarter was a good start.","Second, we are focused on improving returns. This will happen as projects are completed and revenue is realized from growing production volume. It will happen as we shift our capital program. 75% of our spend is expected to generate cash within two years, and it will be aided by ongoing reductions in operating expenses and improvements in how we manage our major capital projects.","Third, we're focused on unlocking value from our entire portfolio. Our portfolio is anchored by legacy positions and advantaged by assets that are early in life. This gives us the opportunity to realize efficiency, reliability, and debottlenecking gains with short-cycle high-return capital investments.","So that concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take your questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up if necessary. We'll certainly do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please go ahead and open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies, your question, please.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thanks very much and hi, everyone. I'd like to take advantage of Steve being on the call and ask a couple questions about Australia, if I could. Steve, you referenced in your remarks that Gorgon was currently operating at about 85%. I think each of the trains individually has been able to run at its nameplate capacity. Could you talk about anything that's on the critical path for all three trains being able to operate at nameplate capacity simultaneously and essentially what needs to be done before you can reach full economic capacity at Gorgon?","Stephen W. Green - Chevron Corp.","Sure, Jason. Thanks for the question. We have operated all three trains at or near capacity, and we're seeing good performance from all three trains. There's nothing that is prohibiting us from operating at nameplate capacity except the fact that we have to work through a methodical startup and again bring on the proper blend from gas from Jansz and Gorgon. In my prepared remarks, I referenced there's some additional equipment that we will now commission since all three trains are operating that will allow us to, again, boost capacity and continue working toward nameplate capacity.","But all three trains have operated very reliably. They're operating reliably now. The Train 2 shutdown was a planned event to address a mechanical device that we knew we were going to. So we're looking forward now to a reliable period of operation that allows us to do some tuning and performance improvements.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay, very clear. And then maybe as a follow up, I did note in the media that there was an unfavorable tax ruling recently in Australia that I think was related to interest deduction on some intercompany loans for some prior-year tax returns. I think the number was about $250 million that was referenced. I just wanted to check and see if there was any further potential liability on any past tax returns related to this issue and if there's anything prospectively that you think will affect your tax position in Australia.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","So, Jason, I'm going to go ahead and take that one, and I guess I want to start with expressing our huge disappointment in the ruling. I want to make it clear to everybody though that the courts affirmed that the financing arrangements that we had in place are legal. And so the issue that is being litigated here is the appropriate interest rate for a loan between our corporate group and our Chevron Australia subsidiary.","I would say that the court ruling deviates substantially from recognized international transfer pricing guidelines. And in those guidelines, the courts are to treat related parties to a transaction as if they were standalone separate legal entities. And the Australian appellate court really failed to do this, so in other words they were making no distinction between the creditworthiness of the Chevron Corporation as an entity versus Chevron Australia as an entity, and therefore no distinction on the relative borrowing costs between those entities.","I'd say that there's an awful lot at stake with this ruling, not just for Chevron but for any intercompany lending in Australia and more broadly around the globe, because it fundamentally changes established transfer pricing guidelines and principles. So if the ruling stands, it certainly going to affect any future investment in Australia. And I would say going forward and thinking about it specific to the Chevron case, we're obviously evaluating the decision. Now the decision just came out a week ago. It's a fairly lengthy decision, and we're reviewing our options. Those options include going forward with an appeal to the High Court of Australia as well as continuing on with discussions with the ATO on possible settlements and any other reasonable resolution to the dispute.","Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thanks, Pat, very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays, your question, please.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Steve, I had two questions. First, you mentioned that the Train 2 is done. So when's that supposed to come back? And I presume that you already \u2013 what happened is the mechanical issue you already addressing in Train 3 and Wheatstone. And also for Gorgon Train 4 and also Wheatstone Train 3, what kind of precondition do you need in order that you even consider an FID at this moment?","Stephen W. Green - Chevron Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Paul. With respect to Train 2, it is online and operating and producing LNG this morning. And as I mentioned, a little more color than in my prepared remarks, the issue that we addressed on the recent Train 2 shutdown was a mechanical device that's part of the flow measurement apparatus that we had previously dealt with in Train 1 and we corrected in Train 3 prior to Train 3 even starting up. Certainly, we are transferring all the learnings and experience from Gorgon to the Wheatstone project, so that prior to startup they have the opportunity to intervene and address those known issues prior to startup.","As far as expansion trains at Gorgon and Wheatstone, there are a lot of factors that go into that. Our first priority is to get these assets up, stable, working as intended, and capture the value from the investment we've made. At that point then, it will be that decision, like any major capital project, will be a function of the market and the market's appetite for it and how those individual investments will compete in our portfolio at the time we FID them.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research, your question, please.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone. Pat, you mentioned TCO no dividend. Could you just remind us? I think that you had said that at $50 Brent, below $50 you have to contribute to the capital expenditure programs there, above it's self-financing. I was just wondering what the sensitivity is on the dividend as regards to the oil price and whether I've got about the right numbers there. Thanks.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Actually, Paul, what happened was that in 2016, we and Exxon made co-loans into the joint venture. There was also a third-party borrowing. And a summation of that, when you looked at the amount of funds that came into the enterprise relative to the amount of investment that was going to be required on the capital project, there were sufficient funds projected out for 2017 where there would not be another co-lending requirement needed for 2017.","As you look forward in 2018 and if you assume a $50-ish scenario, there will more likely than not be co-loans going on in 2018 \u2013 2019. Somewhere in the $2 billion to $3 billion-ish range is our requirement for total affiliate spending over this period of time. So what we were saying is that because there was an advance funding of capital requirements in 2016, we didn't see that we would need to co-lend again in 2017. We do anticipate that there will be a dividend receipt in the second half of this year for us.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","That would be around oil prices? Sorry.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","That's exactly right, that's exactly right. And going forward, there will be obviously a lot of planning around what is the pace of spending on the project, what's happening to oil prices, what's the internal cash generation at TCO, et cetera.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Great, thanks, Pat. And then the follow-up is your volume target for this year of 4% to 9% growth is a pretty big range. When I look at the uncertainties that you've listed, you seem to be saying that Gorgon\/Wheatstone are bang-on schedule as far as you're concerned. I'll give you the Partition Neutral Zone uncertainty. I understand that one. I would have thought the base decline was fairly predictable by the time we're in April, and I don't really understand why there would be a PSC [Production Sharing Contract] effect if you were assuming $50 oil. Is it safe to say that we should be looking towards the higher end of that range because of the uncertainties apart from the Partition Neutral Zone are essentially being significantly mitigated? Thanks.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","I think what we were trying to do in addition to PZ, PZ is a significant component there, but we're also trying to say that even \u2013 what people capture in their mind is the 4% to 9%, and they forget the pricing premise that was used for it. And so yes, there are price sensitivities built into that range that influence cost recovery barrels and the like. Also, the investment levels going forward influence the cost recovery barrels as well. So we were just trying to be as descriptive as we possibly could be in naming the things that could either work to the upside or work to the downside.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","I guess my point is that it feels like the downside effects are significantly mitigated.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","If we continue on with first quarter results into second quarter and third quarter results, I would agree with you.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, Pat.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, your question, please.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, Pat.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Good morning.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Hi, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, how are you guys? First question relates to CapEx. It looks like you're tracking below the guidance, and I wanted to confirm, Pat. The $17 billion to $22 billion, it sounds like you're going to be on the lower end of that range at $50 a barrel Brent. And relative to the guidance, what surprised to the downside here as it relates to CapEx?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","I think that we are trending lower than a ratable amount would give you relative to our $19.8 billion target for this year. The affiliate spending was a little bit lower than ratable. And I think as you go through the year, there will be spending by TCO in particular that should pick up as the remaining three quarters get underway. Other than that, I would just speak to capital efficiency. I think we are getting much more output \u2013 much greater activity for a given dollar spend than we were anticipating. So coming in at the lower end of \u2013 coming in below the $19.8 billion could very well be where we end up for the year.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate that. And, Pat, corporate costs were a little funky this quarter, favorable after being unfavorable last quarter. Can you talk about some of the drivers that contributed to that benefit?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yes, it's my favorite topic. Actually, all I would say is that the corporate sector can be really quite volatile. It does include certain corporate expenses, for example, related to employees. I mentioned last quarter, if you'll recall, about pension settlement costs. That's a factor that goes on in here. But more impactful typically would be corporate consolidated tax entries, and those are just very hard for us to predict. They're not necessarily ratable, and that's really what you see going on here in this particular quarter.","I would just again ask you to go back and think about the full year and use the $1.6 billion net charge for that sector for us in your predictions. That's the best information that I have, and it will be not ratable. It will be lumpy.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. Thanks, Pat.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America, your question, please.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning, everybody. Good morning, Pat. Pat, disposals, you made the point that you've already hit the low end of your range. There is some speculation that there could be additional asset sales that you haven't yet put in the public domain, Canada oil sands being the case in point. I'm just wondering if you could frame what the objective is. Is it to achieve the $5 billion to $10 billion, or is it to high-grade the portfolio? And what I'm really getting at is, if there were other things to sell, would you cap the sales at $10 billion, or would you keep going as you upgrade the portfolio? And I've got a follow-up, please.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Right. So I don't think it's an either\/or circumstance. We do want to come in between the $5 billion to $10 billion, but we also are very focused on improving the portfolio and high-grading the portfolio.","So we put this target out a year and a half ago or so now, and we're in the second half of the time period in executing it. I think it's still a good target for us this year, but we will continue to look at the portfolio and continue to see if there are assets that again, either aren't strategic or not closely strategic, whether there's value that others see in it that's greater than ours or that won't attract capital in our capital allocation process.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you address Canada specifically?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Canada, it's a good asset for us. It's a cash generator for us. We're obviously aware of \u2013 you're talking about oil sands. I'm talking about oil sands at least.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, I am.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","We're aware of the transactions that have occurred in this space over the last few weeks. All I would say is that if we were to transact, we'd want to make sure we got good value for it.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow-up, Pat, hopefully a quick one. At the Analyst Day, you talked about evaluating a case to add an additional 10 rigs after the 20 rigs in the end of 2018. I'm just wondering, with CapEx trending below target, I know it's really early days. I get that. But I'm just wondering where you are in that evaluation, whether the pace might accelerate faster than you're currently guiding, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Really I hate to \u2013 Doug, I hate to go off of guidance we gave just four weeks ago or so. It clearly is in our quiver here. We are obviously very much evaluating it. We're seeing great efficiency in terms of what we get per dollar spent. All of the production and operating cost improvements that we noted before continue to happen. So we very well may be able to capture much greater activity and therefore much greater volume per dollar spent. So we'll continue to look at this. We understand the \u2013 we have the same desire that our shareholders have, which is monetizing that asset as best we can, and this is certainly one avenue for doing that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate that, Pat. Good weekend, everyone.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Thanks.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan, your question, please.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, just one additional follow-up on Gorgon, I guess Wheatstone as well. With the production that we saw in the first quarter and where you're running today and then assumed startup cost for Wheatstone, how are you thinking about the real cash flow contribution from these two assets in 2017? I know they're meant to be a big contributor in the long term. But with the startup costs for Wheatstone and Gorgon finally just hitting its full stride, how much of that long-term cash flow contribution do you actually expect this year?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","I would say from a Gorgon standpoint, a reasonable number to have in your mind is a couple billion dollars. And of course, Wheatstone is just going to be ramping up, so I wouldn't expect a significant contribution there.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Would you expect it to actually be a negative with the startup?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","I don't think I want to give a number there necessarily. There are still capital expenditures that are being incurred. And so if you look at it including capital expenditures, the answer on that would obviously be yes. It's probably a net drain on us.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. My follow-up is just...","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","For 2016 (36:35).","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, okay, got it. My follow-up is just on your supplement. The other production bucket for nat-gas has been up significantly. I assume that's Angola. You touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks. But maybe, Steve, if you could just highlight a little bit more for us where you're at with Angola and what you're expecting for the year.","Stephen W. Green - Chevron Corp.","Well, as you know, Angola restarted early part of the year, and it's been running very reliably since that time. And we are consistently loading LNG cargoes, propane cargoes, butane, and we expect that performance to continue. We've gotten the plant where we want it now and it's operating reliably.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley, your question, please.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Hi, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Pat, you mentioned that CapEx runs to a low end for 2017 if oil is near $50. Oil being near $50, can you discuss when you begin to adjust that spending? And is that adjustment within short-cycle Permian or elsewhere, just how that plays out in the 2017 capital program?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","I would just say within upstream, I think there is fine-tuning as the year progresses about where capital opportunities are being generated \u2013 additional spending opportunities are being generated. Obviously, the Permian is going to be one of the first places to draw additional capital, but there are other short-cycle investments, for example, in Thailand and also in San Joaquin that would also be attractive as well. So that is a routine optimization that goes on within the upstream leadership team \u2013 I won't say on a monthly basis, but obviously they continue to monitor that as the year progresses.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. So that works for lowering CapEx as well? I think you phrased it for raising CapEx.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","I did phrase it for lowering it. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I meant...","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect, sure. My second question, I know, for Paul, I know a lot's been covered here within Australia. I know you have a lot of moving pieces in the portfolio that are outside of Chevron's control. Maybe just some update of conditions to outlook in Nigeria, Venezuela, and PNZ, any update in those regions I think would be helpful. Thanks.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay. Let me just \u2013 I'll take PZ first. I can say that negotiations and discussions are underway still. They're still occurring between the parties of the government. I really can't go out on a limb and predict when the resolution might occur. We're going on two years now where this has been an issue. I will say that the longer this goes on, the more challenging it is to get the equipment back up and running. We do continue to reduce operating expenses in PZ and continue to let people leave the payroll because we need to limit the losses that are occurring here. So I don't have any fresh news about when we might expect that restart, unfortunately.","In Venezuela, I would just say it's a very tough circumstance for all of the people of Venezuela. We haven't had any or significant \u2013 it's really been minimal impact to our operations and our facilities. Priority number one for us is keeping our people safe, and so we're operating with that intention in mind.","And Nigeria just continues to be a challenging location as well. There has been some disruption to production facilities in the first quarter of the year. We continue to monitor for safety there as well.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse, your question, please.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes, good morning, a question for Steve on Australia. You had the issue I think with the flow meter, and you sorted that out on the trains. I wanted just to confirm that there isn't any design difference between Gorgon and Wheatstone, and therefore, what the risks are in terms of starting up at Wheatstone, that it's all been fixed based on the learnings at Gorgon, if I understood you correctly.","Stephen W. Green - Chevron Corp.","Yes, Ed. Thanks for the question. There are design differences. They're two different technologies in the plant between Gorgon and Wheatstone. But of any common equipment and any issues that we have dealt with in the startup of all three trains at Gorgon, we have communicated. And those issues have been addressed at Wheatstone to the extent they're common to Gorgon. That also includes \u2013 I mentioned our partner, Woodside, any issues that they have experienced in any of their facilities. We're benefiting from that as well, or Angola LNG. So any place we can get learnings or experience or borrow it, we're factoring that in and addressing it as best we can pre-startup to try to remove those variables.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","And then sticking with Australia, obviously at Gorgon you're talking about debottlenecking. It would be interesting to see what sort of debottlenecking uplift you can get from the plant, but also obviously there's Northwest Shelf, and there are other plants that need filling. Maybe how would those investments compete against each other? I obviously appreciate there's commercial terms to be negotiated as well.","Stephen W. Green - Chevron Corp.","Right. I guess I would start with your second part of your question first. We do have active work going on now to assess our large portfolio of discovered resource and look for commercial opportunities to accelerate that and commercialize that as the market materializes. So that work is ongoing, whether it be through one of our facilities or third-party facilities.","With respect to Gorgon and debottlenecking, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have been looking forward to the day where we are today at Gorgon where we have all three trains up and running. We can begin to now tune and improve performance in the system as a whole. We have some additional equipment that will boost capacity as we bring that online. I mentioned a couple of examples of that in the prepared remarks.","But this is really an opportunity to exercise what I consider a real core competency of the company, and that is getting more and more out of assets once they're up and operating. A terrific example of that is our long experience at Tengiz, where we have consistently improved performance and efficiency and increased the throughput from that facility. And we're looking forward to having a similar experience at Gorgon as we go forward in time.","Specific to the debottlenecking, we'll analyze those opportunities, and some of those will be relatively short-term that we can do while we're in operation. Others are more complex and will require engineering and scheduling into planned outages or turnarounds as we go forward in time.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thanks, Steve.","Stephen W. Green - Chevron Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi, your question, please.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi, everyone. Pat, can you talk about the cost trend on slide 12 a little bit, as you look back, how much you think those have been variable costs, such as energy and chemicals? And are you seeing any signs that that's beginning to come back? And I had a follow-up for Steve as well.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","So I would say just general in terms of inflationary pressures, the only place around the globe really that we are seeing inflationary pressures of any size would be in the Permian, and that's obviously being driven by activity levels in the Permian. And within the Permian, obviously we're working very hard to restrict that through our contracting strategy in terms of fixed-price contracts, indexed contracts, staggered contract terms, performance contracts, et cetera. Overall, we think that will be manageable for us, relatively small impact in 2017. And then outside the Permian, we really just haven't seen inflationary pressures.","So I think in general, that's why I said that we intend \u2013 we're certainly striving to have a continued downward trend on operating expense in the remaining three quarters of the year, acknowledging that we will be bringing on additional production, and that will be an element going in the other direction.","Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. And my follow-up to Steve \u2013 I know this is going to be a sensitive subject. But can you comment on what you think the Australian government is trying to achieve with its PRRT [Petroleum Resource Rent Tax] review and other aspects of the existing legislation that you would like to get changed?","Stephen W. Green - Chevron Corp.","I think as an investor, there's no difference in Australia than we look anywhere. We look for stability of fiscal terms and conditions that we invest under to be maintained over the life of those investments. So we have been and have been engaged with the government on the PRRT question, and that is a cautionary note for all investors, not just us. But the government yesterday in Australia released the initial report, and any changes that are contemplated will be prospective, which is exactly what our position was, is you can't go back and change the rules of the game after the investments are made. And so I think we have good engagement with the government.","It has been a bit of irony. I was there last week, and the second story on page 1A is the emerging gas crisis, or energy crisis on the East Coast, which of course a solution will demand significant capital investment. So I think Australia is appropriately trying to find the right balance between their fiscal needs in the government and preserving what has been a very, very successful regime for attracting large capital investment, especially in our sector.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Alastair.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil, your question, please.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Folks, good morning. Congrats on the results. I had two questions for you on the Permian. I know you already addressed the operated rig count, but my question was on the non-operated rig count. I think you said the base case contemplated 13 non-operated rigs. And just based on the level of activity increases we're seeing in the industry, it just seems like there's probably upward pressure there. So can you confirm whether you're getting pressure from peers to maybe increase activity on that and whether that probably leads to some upside on your base case?","And then I guess tying in with the Permian question, the second is on the oil price realizations in the U.S. It seems like there was a pretty healthy increase in U.S. oil relative to the benchmarks. I didn't know if there was something one-off or this is just a function of Permian ramping up and that representing better realizations relative to the rest of the portfolio. Thanks.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay, yes. So, Blake, I would say on the NOJV [Non-Operated Joint Venture] issue, I don't really have any significant information that would suggest the NOJV plan is any different than we had outlined. Currently, we've got 13 gross NOJV rigs, so that's five net. And I see that \u2013 I think in our plan as we look forward, there was ramping up some, but I don't have any new information relative to that.","And with regard to the realizations, there's nothing unusual there in terms of one-offs on realizations. It really is just as a function of WTI prices, San Joaquin Valley prices, Mars prices, et cetera, and how those move relative to one another.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Fair enough, thank you.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia from TPH, your question, please.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Hi. My first question was really to Steve to think about the Southeast Asia business from a more strategic standpoint. You've divested of the Bangladesh assets. There have been quite a few stories in the press that you've been looking at least at divesting of maybe some of your other Southeast Asian assets. And then on the other side, you have got some predevelopment pre-FID decisions to make on things like Ubon and further developments in Indonesia. So I just wanted to get an idea of how you view Southeast Asia within the context of the portfolio and the strategic decisions that you're thinking about for that portfolio.","Stephen W. Green - Chevron Corp.","Thanks for the question. Southeast Asia has long been and remains a core part of our upstream portfolio. We have a great business in Thailand, have had for 40-plus years. That business continues to perform very well. And in terms of incremental investments in Thailand beyond the base business, those are evaluated just like they are anywhere else in the company.","The market, the terms and conditions, the resource, all those things \u2013 the cost of finding and development on a unit basis, all those things factor into our decision, whether it's Thailand or Indonesia as well. And our process for some time has been to go through the portfolio systematically and look at incremental investments on how they compete within the portfolio relative to our other opportunities. But notwithstanding the asset divestments that have been announced, Southeast Asia's still a very, very core part of our upstream portfolio and is performing well.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Thank you, and then a follow-up for Pat around cash flow. So you mentioned some impacts in Q1 that may turn around in the second half of the year, I think in terms of the working capital in particular. And I'm guessing also you've got the impact of projects ramping up in the second half of the year. So I'm just thinking in a flat oil price environment, should we expect significantly higher cash flow in the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2017? And also just related to that, are there any significant pension contribution impacts through the course of this year?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","So I would say in general, I think that's a good premise for you. If you look back over time, our first quarter tends to be typically our lowest cash generation quarter, and part of it is driven by the working capital. I did indicate that we saw a portion of that working capital most likely reversing between the end of this quarter and the end of the year, so I don't think you will get the same kind of penalty there per quarter. I'd also say \u2013 I mentioned the dividends, a potential coming in from TCO in the second half of the year, so that would be a positive in the remaining quarters of the year.","If you go back to what I said back in March, one of the questions I had was about all of the summation of all of these \"headwinds\", and I had given an indication then of them being about $4 billion, a little bit over $4 billion for the year. And I still think that is a good element to think about when you consider the deferred tax impact, the working capital impact, and the difference between affiliate dividend and dividend earnings during the period.","So all said, when you put that all together, I know there was a lot of numbers there. I do think the second part of the year we'll have stronger cash generation, not only from these reasons that I'm talking about, but production increases and the fact that these are high cash margin barrels that we're bringing on.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Okay, thanks. And just to clarify, that $4 billion, does that include the cash contributions to pensions?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","It would, it would.","Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP","Right, thank you.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Anish.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","To me a positive aspect of the capital allocation and the corporate governance changes that are underway at the company is the increased emphasis on cash returns at the business unit level and specifically on project execution, at least in my opinion. And while John [Watson] talked about this some at the analyst meeting, I wanted to see if you could provide a progress report on this process in the upstream business, the timeframes over which the teams are going to be judged, and really any other factors that you deem relevant to positive execution and performance in this area.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","It's a good question. I think the best place that I would go because where we're seeing it in action is in TCO because this is the most significant capital project that we have underway at this point in time of a longer duration. And so we've talked about the fact that we were increasing the overall engineering that was done before we began to essentially cut steel. We've now started fabrication in Korea and the Kazakhstani yards. We're monitoring \u2013 we've done more in terms of design assurance there on that project, optimizing contracting strategy, taking advantage of the lower-cost environment.","So I really think the benchmark in terms of how this will turn out in terms of all of these elements that Jay [Pryor] and John have talked about before in terms of major capital project execution, the benchmark on how we're doing will be with regard to TCO and how well it is coming forward. And right now, the overall progress, we're on track with elements of fabrication and construction of the port and we're underway with constructing the village, the housing village, et cetera, and the drilling is going very well. So all of those efforts are really being focused in real time on the TCO project.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, great. It'll be a good test case. And then also, Pat, there's a $2 billion sales proceeds figure floating around in the press for Bangladesh. And so my question, is that your number or is it somebody else's number, or is that a no comment at this point?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","That's a no comment at this point, so thank you very much for giving me that third option.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, thanks a lot, guys.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank, your question, please.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Maybe a follow-up to the earlier cash flow questions. You generated I think roughly $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter beyond the dividend and you used it to pay down some debt. I realize there was an asset sale at the tail end of the quarter. But as you start to generate modest amounts of discretionary cash flow beyond CapEx and the dividend, how should we think about the use of the discretionary cash flow? How would you prioritize debt paydown versus buyback versus incremental capital spend?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yeah, so I'm just going to go back and reiterate what our priorities have long been. The first priority is going to be given to growing the dividend when we feel cash flow and earnings can support it for the long term, and by that I mean in perpetuity. Secondly, we look at future additional investment opportunities that we've got because we do need to continue to grow future revenue streams. And then we look at the balance sheet. It is important for us to continue to have a strong balance sheet. And what you saw in this quarter is really a flex in our commercial paper program, and that's part of why we have a commercial paper program is to take flex like this.","So all of those are important to us. We do balance that. We're at a 24% debt ratio, which is an okay place to be, I would say. But over time, I'd like to see us move a little bit lower in the debt profile when cash flow permits us to do that. Maintaining a AA is important to us. We did just meet with the rating agencies. We did just get affirmed by Moody's as a AA stable. We haven't heard from S&P yet, but it's an important element for us.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then maybe you have a slide there in the deck. I think it's slide 10, showing efficiency gains across the base portfolio as well. And obviously for investors the efficiency gains in the U.S. onshore has been a huge area of focus and generally is quite transparent. Can you talk a little bit more about the efficiency gains that you're seeing across the broader global portfolio? Do you think the market underestimates gains outside the U.S? And is the 30 to 35-plus percentage type of gains that you're showing here and a couple anecdotal things, is that representative of the type of gains you're seeing across the broader portfolio?","Stephen W. Green - Chevron Corp.","The chart that you referenced, of course, is specific to our Thailand operations. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are transferring both people and learnings from those operations into the Permian, into AMBU [Appalachia-Michigan Business Unit], into other places where we have this factory well approach. And we are seeing those kind of gains in efficiency and driving down our unit cost.","Another example that's probably a little less visible perhaps comes from Indonesia. Last year in Indonesia, in our Duri operations, which is a heavy oil steam flood, we were able to drive down the cost of our steam, which is our largest line item of OpEx, by over 40%, without degradating the production, no impact to production. So again, as I said in response to a question about Gorgon, this is the sweet spot of Chevron's core capability is transferring learnings and ways to get efficiency and operate assets in the portfolio and get more and more out of them as we go forward.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","Thanks, Ryan.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure, thanks.","Operator","Thank you.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay, I think we've got time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP, your question, please.","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane Ltd.","Yes, hi. Good morning, Pat. Good morning, gentlemen.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Good morning.","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane Ltd.","Just coming back to the financials, could you perhaps just talk a little bit about cash taxes? I know you've quantified the deferred tax impact this quarter. But just going forward at Chevron, let's say at $50, how should we think of cash tax rate?","And then my follow-up question was just on PZ. Again, broadly speaking, what type of run rate should we be thinking about on OpEx and how we actually capture that back if and when PZ volumes are back onstream? Thank you.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Yes, so I'll take PZ first. I don't want to get into describing what our ongoing operating costs are here when we've got an asset that is not operating. I will just say that when it does come back online, these cumulative losses will be taken into account in terms of the eventual recovery, tax recovery that's available to us.","In terms of cash tax, this is a hard area for us to forecast at this particular time because of just issues that I've explained before about tax loss carryforwards and the fact that we've got different jurisdictions with different circumstances as their current tax position standpoint. I would say in general, we do still have some jurisdictions at current prices that are generating tax losses. And so that means that these tax losses will be carried forward into future periods. And when oil prices rise from $50 to $60 to $70, if you assume that hypothesis, we do need higher prices here to recover some of those previously deferred or those tax losses that have been carried forward that cannot then be carried back and will become a cash benefit, a relative cash benefit in future periods. That's really the best guidance that I can give you at this point in time. At low prices, there is not a lot of \u2013 we do have cash taxes in some locations, but it is not in all locations.","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane Ltd.","Is there any way to quantify that number in terms of an aggregate number there, if prices were to recover, Chevron could use in terms of tax allowances?","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","I don't have it handy here. It's something I can consider for future disclosures.","Theepan Jothilingam - Exane Ltd.","Great. Thank you, Pat.","Frank Mount - Chevron Corp.","I Thanks, Theepan.","Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.","Okay, I think that concludes our call for this morning.

My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","","Pat Yarrington","Hey thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Joe Geagea, Corporate Vice President and President, Gas and Midstream and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company\u2019s third quarter earnings were $5 billion, or $2.57 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 15%. Our debt ratio at the end of September was approximately 11%. In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase the same amount. Though not shown on the slide, I\u2019d like to call attention to our track record on shareholder returns. We are in first place on total shareholder returns for the three-year, five-year and 10-year periods compared to our peer group of global integrated energy companies.","Turning to Slide 4, cash generated from operations was $10 billion during the third quarter and approximately $25 billion year-to-date. The third quarter was the strongest cash generation quarter this year. Adverse working capital effects noted earlier in the year continued to abate. Importantly, third quarter also saw stronger operating performance in both our Upstream and Downstream businesses. Capital and exploratory expenditures were $9.6 billion during the quarter and $26.4 billion year-to-date.","I would like to make it clear that major resource acquisitions stemming from our business development activities are not included in our annual budget targets. We have found the success rate, timing and pricing for this effort to be too uncertain to effectively include in our annual budgeting and Board approval process for C&E. Because we have been very successful this year in our resource acquisition effort, taking up acreage and project opportunities in Canada, Australia and the Kurdistan region of Iraq, we anticipate we will close the year with C&E outlays above our planned levels. While there are still some large uncertainties on timing, we presently anticipate our 2013 C&E investments will be around 10% or still higher than our original target for the year.","At quarter end, our cash balances exceeded $18 billion as total debt balances were identical in size, we ended the quarter in a neutral net cash, net debt position. Confirming what I\u2019ve said previously the company continues to move toward a more traditional net debt structure. Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparison. Jeff?","","Jeff Gustavson","Thanks Pat. Turning to slide five, all compared results for the third quarter 2013 with the second quarter of 2013. As a reminder our earnings release compares third quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings were 5 billion about 400 million lower than second quarter results. Foreign exchange movements accounted for more than the overall decrease in earnings worth almost 600 million of the decline. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the second quarter and the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the third quarter caused a significant swing between the two periods. We moved from a net positive foreign exchange position in the second quarter of 300 million to a net negative position of nearly the same amount in the third quarter. Without this element our earnings performance this quarter would actually be better than the prior quarter. Upstream earnings were up 143 million reflecting higher liquids realizations and liftings mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Downstream results decreased 386 million between quarter\u2019s lower margins and unfavorable foreign exchange effects partly offset by higher volumes drove the decrease.","The variance in the other bar largely reflects an unfavorable swing in corporate tax items during the quarter. On slide 6, our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were 57 million lower than second quarter\u2019s results. Higher realizations increased earnings by 90 million driven largely by a rise in crude oil prices partially offset by the fall in natural gas prices. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by 30 million mainly due to maintenance activity in the Gulf of Mexico partly offset by higher production in the Permian. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including higher DD&A and higher exploration expenses.","Turning to slide 7, international upstream earnings were 200 million higher than the second quarter. Higher realizations increased earnings by 430 million average liquids unit realizations increased by 11% consistent with the increase in average Brent spot prices between quarters. The timing of liftings across multiple countries increased earnings by $90 million. At the end of the quarter we were in a slightly over lifted position.","An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by 465 million. The third quarter had a loss of about 190 million compared to a gain of about 275 million in the second quarter. The other bar reflects a number of items favorable tax effects, gains on asset transactions and lower operating expenses were partially offset by higher exploration expenses.","Slide 8, summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production increased 3000 barrels per day between quarters. New wells that are Agbami and Usan projects in Nigeria additional production from the Delaware basin in the Permian as well as volumes associated with Angola LNG increased net production by about 22,000 barrels per day. Plants maintenance activities decreased production by 14,000 barrels per day during the quarter most notably in the UK, Trinidad and Thailand with a partial offset from less maintenance activity in Australia.","External constraints hurt third quarter production by 10,000 barrels per day primarily due to a mid-quarter lightning strike in Thailand which severely damaged and necessitated the shutdown of our customers gas processing plant. This in turn curtailed our Thai gas production. The base business in other bar includes the impact of normal field declines, cost recoveries and the impact of price effects on entitlement volumes. Production for the first three quarters of 2013 averaged just over 2.6 million barrels a day, below our initial full year production guidance of 2.65 million barrels per day. Several factors have affected our year-to-date production results, first Angola LNGs ramp-up of production has been slower than anticipated. Second turnaround activity across various locations has been more extensive than originally planned. Our final contributing factor relates to the damage of the gas plant in Thailand. We expect volumes to be higher in the fourth quarter as production is restored following maintenance related down-time during the third quarter and as new production comes online. For the full year, we expect to come in around 98% to 99% of our original production target.","Turning to Slide 9. The U.S. downstream earnings improved by $111 million between periods, higher volumes increased earnings by $55 million primarily due to our Richmond, California refinery running at normal capacity for the full quarter. Lower refining and marketing margins decreased earnings by $95 million driven by rising crude cost. Reduced industry crack spreads also reflected improved supply conditions and higher plant utilization rates following the end of second quarter maintenance activity. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $30 million, primarily due to lower environmental charges. Greater gains on miscellaneous small asset sales improved earnings in the third quarter by $60 million. The chemicals and other variance, primarily reflects the absence of planned and unplanned downtime CPChem\u2019s Port Arthur and Sweeney plants in the second quarter.","On Slide 10, International Downstream earnings increased by $497 million between quarters decreased by $497 million between quarters. Higher plant utilization rates boosted volumes and increased earnings by $30 million in the third quarter. Refining and marketing margins were lower by $220 million. Rising crude cost, continued soft product demand and oversupply in the Far East weakens industry crack spreads while price lag effects mainly for jet fuel and naphtha in Asia impacted marketing margins.","Timing effects represented a $140 million negative earnings variance between quarters driven largely by the revaluation of inventory. The swing between quarters was primarily due to rising crude prices during the third quarter compared to falling crude prices during the second quarter. Foreign currency swings reduced earnings by about $115 million. Third quarter had a loss of approximately $85 million compared to a small gain of $30 million in the second quarter. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items including various tax items and higher shipping costs.","Slide 11 covers all other. Third quarter net charges were $522 million compared to $350 million in the second quarter, an increase of $172 million between periods. Adverse corporate tax items resulted in a $219 million decrease to earnings between quarters. Our overall year-to-date effective tax rate at just around 40% is trending a little lower than in recent years. As you know, in any one period, this overall rate can be influenced by many factors including jurisdictional mix between Upstream and Downstream, jurisdictional mix within Upstream, foreign exchange and asset sales transactions. Corporate charges and other items were $47 million lower this quarter. Year-to-date net charges in the all other segment were $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $400 million to $500 million for the all other segment is still appropriate going forward.","Joe is now going to provide an update on our LNG marketing activities. Joe?","","Joe Geagea","Thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the LNG market in our LNG portfolio. So turning to Slide 13, I will start by grinding you quickly on the global demand outlook for energy. The world\u2019s economy is growing driving increased demand for all forms of energy and much of this growth is in Asia, where people increasingly aspire for a better quality of life. And achieving this aspiration does require stable, secure and affordable energy supplies. Total world\u2019s energy demand as forecasted increased 30% by 2025 from today\u2019s level. Natural gas demand has projected to grow even more by about 40% by 2025. And LNG demand growth is expected to be even greater.","Turning to Slide 14, LNG demand has already doubled since 2000 and it is predicted to double again by 2025. Meeting this demand would require three elements maintaining the reliability of the existing supply, delivering current LNG projects under construction and investing in the construction of new LNG capacity. Even if the first two elements are well in hand this still leaves an opportunity of around 150 million tons per year of new projects to be sanctioned. Now my buyers are counting on the United States to make up the shortfall with pricing linked to Henry Hub.","Even if you believe the most optimistic predictions of new U.S. supply available for export, there are still projected short fall of more than 50 million tons in 2025 and more reasonable predictions of U.S. exports suggest a GAAP of around a 100 million tons in 2025.","So the U.S. alone will not bridge this forecast demand supply gap. And that\u2019s we believe new supply needs to come from multiple sources. Now developing these supplies will also take time whether that\u2019s for permitting a construction of U.S. LNG export terminals or for exploration, appraisal and development of new producing regions such as East Africa. Building and maintaining LNG facilities is technically challenging, capital intensive and require significant expertise.","The last 35 LNG projects developed globally took on average over 16 years to deliver that LNG to market. Although we do acknowledge that completion times are improving. Additional capacity utilization rates for LNG facilities in production have only averaged about 85% in recent years. Geopolitical instability, resource availability and unplanned turnaround have resulted on average in roughly 35 million metric tons of the existing nameplate capacity being unavailable at any given time. Turning to slide 15, well we have seen growth in global energy trading and expect that interregional trade of LNG will continue to increase, we believe that global gas markets will remain regionally distinct over the medium to long term.","This is mainly due to the high cost and relatively lack of infrastructure to transport and store gas globally. While 2\/3rds of the world\u2019s oil is shipped by tanker only 10% of the world\u2019s current natural gas supply is shipped as LNG and this forecasted increase to 14% by 2025. We believe the majority of this LNG will continue to be delivered under long term contracts. The traditional LNG importing countries of Japan, Korea and Taiwan have no interconnecting pipeline infrastructure and virtually no indigenous energy resources and therefore rely on LNG to meet almost of their gas demand. Only 5 years ago 17 countries were importing LNG, today 26 countries are doing so and this is expected to increase.","So let\u2019s move to slide 16, where I would like to focus more specifically on U.S. LNG exports. Many analysts forecast that U.S. LNG export should reach approximately 50 million tons per year by 2025 equivalent of around 11% of the world\u2019s LNG demand and by 8% of domestic U.S. gas demand. At these levels U.S. LNG exports would only represent the small share of the global LNG market.","Greenfield LNG projects are unlikely to be developed outside of the United States unless its significant portion of the offtake is committed under long term contracts with robust pricing that underpins the financial investment required to monetize these resources. A common perception is the Henry Hub linked pricing will be landed LNG prices in Asia will be significantly less than other world sources. We think that\u2019s not automatically a given.","U.S. Liquefaction cost are likely to rise as more projects compete for resources, including engineering contractors, fabrication yard space and project financing. In addition growing demand in the United States where new petrochemical projects, power plants, exports to Mexico and a transportation segment will mean new demand pull on the same supply base. Coupled with weather and storage effects this could easily increase price strength and volatility for Henry Hub. In order to ensure that sufficient supplies do get developed there needs to be cooperation alignment and understanding between LNG buyers and suppliers. This has helped when buyers diversify to energy mix, maintain a geographically diverse LNG portfolio, recognizing that no one region including the United States can meet all expected demand and finally take equity positions in LNG projects to ensure the right projects are built in the right places for the right price. We have seen this formula work in Gorgon and Wheatstone and we\u2019re confident the same will be true for Kitimat.","Turning to Slide 17. I would like to now talk about our LNG sale commitments. From a portfolio perspective, we believe it\u2019s prudent to leave around 25% of volume for placement on the spot market for operational flexibility. However, at the individual project level, this ratio may vary. For example, on Gorgon, we are 65% committed. We are still prepared to increase volumes under contract. However, Gorgon is scheduled to come online at a time when limited new supplies are expected. So we are confident of being able to place uncommitted volumes into the market.","On Wheatstone, 85% of Chevron\u2019s equity LNG is now committed on long-term basis. In addition to the Gorgon and Wheatstone Foundation projects, we have made good progress this year with buyers for LNG from our Indonesia Deepwater Development, or IDD. For our unsanctioned projects, including IDD, Kitimat and Gorgon Train 4, we are targeting to have around 70% committed under long-term contracts by the time we will reach a final investment decision. Once achieved, we will end up with our desired portfolio objective of having 75% of our LNG production sold through the long-term contracts.","Turning to Slide 18. I would like to close by showing you how Chevron is well-positioned to become a major LNG supplier by the end of this decade based on Wood Mack estimates. With the project under construction at Gorgon and Wheatstone and with our existing equity shares in Angola LNG and Australia Northwest Shelf, we will be one of the top 10 LNG suppliers in the world. If we include Kitimat and Gorgon Train 4, we will potentially move into the top five. In summary, we see strong LNG market fundamentals supporting our growing LNG portfolio, which should allow us to deliver strong future gas generation for many years to come.","I will now turn it back to Pat.","","Pat Yarrington","Okay, thank you Joe. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the latest updates on our LNG projects. The Gorgon project is over 70% complete. We continue to make good progress on all fronts. In early October, we installed the third of five gas turbine generators. To-date, 14 of the 21 LNG Train 1 process modules have been installed, three are in transit and the remaining are scheduled to follow in fairly rapid succession. Work on the jetty is progressing. We now have 43 of the 56 jetty caissons installed, including those needed to support all key structural elements. We have recently reached mechanical completion of the domestic gas pipeline in preparation for operational readiness by year end. Onshore pipelines are complete on the Io\/Jansz 30-inch pipeline. And finally, three wells at the Io\/Jansz field are ready to flow gas and seven wells are completed at the Gorgon field.","Wheatstone is proceeding per plan and is now over 20% complete. We continue to transform the site with ongoing earthworks and good progress on establishing critical infrastructure. Construction continues on the materials offloading facility and we completed our first permanent foundation in concrete pour in September. Site preparation continues with about 19% of our 23,000 piles driven including commencement of the LNG tank pile driving. Platform construction is over 43% complete and we have received critical platform equipment such as the power transformers and process vessels. We just completed our micro-tunnel boring under the shoreline in preparation for the offshore installation of the trunkline. Now, we posted several updated photos of progress made at both Gorgon and Wheatstone on our investor website located at chevron.com and I\u2019ll invite you to take a look at those. For Kitimat, front end engineering continues on plan. We have remained focused on early earthworks at the LNG plant site, where construction on the office, camp industrial site and service road is ongoing.","Key activities for the Pacific Trail Pipeline are obtaining necessary permits, building roads and securing right-of-way access. LNG marketing activities and the engagement with potential foundation customers are underway. The timing of the final investment decision will be determined by our ability to secure sufficient LNG offtake agreements with our customers.","Turning now to Slide 20. I\u2019d like to share some highlights of the strategic progress we have made during the quarter. We signed binding long-term sales and purchase agreements with Tohuku Electric Power Company in Japan to supply just under 1 million tons per year of LNG for up to 20 years. As Joe noted this brings total volumes committed to customers in Asia on a long term basis to 85% for our Wheatstone project. Continuing with the Australian scene we recently announced the acquisition of two deepwater exploration interest located in the Bight Basin off the Southern Australian coast. These are very large blocks with significant exploration potential and further reinforces the importance of Australia to Chevron\u2019s global growth strategy.","In Canada we successfully completed an initial 12 week exploration drilling program in the liquids rich portion of the Kaybob area of the Duvernay Shale Play. Initial well results were very encouraging with average initial production rates in excess of 1200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Both of these developments are consistent with our focus on early entry opportunities which have the potential to generate the most value for our shareholders. We also had a major milestone in our downstream chemicals business. CPChem announced our investment decision for U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals project. This project includes construction of a 1.5 million metric ton per year ethane cracker as well as two new polyethylene facilities each with an annual capacity of 500,000 metric tons.","This is an attractive project one that takes advantage of existing infrastructure and advantage fleet stock. Plant startup is planned for 2017. Turning now to slide 21, I would like to close by highlighting our continued strong performance particularly in our upstream business. Our 2013 year-to-date upstream earnings margin was $23.33 per barrel. Based on these year-to-date results we continue to lead our direct peer group by a wide margin. We\u2019re almost $5.70 per barrel ahead of our closest competitor. This is a position we have now held for 15 consecutive quarters.","We also led on this important metric at the six month mark by over $4.25 per barrel against the wide range of EMP companies. These peer leading financial results are directly related to the quality of our investment decisions and the strength of our portfolio. We appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company, I would like now open up the microphone. Joe and I are happy to take your questions. We do have a full queue so please limit yourself to one question and a single related follow-up if that\u2019s necessary, we will certainly do our very best to see that we get all your questions answered. So Jonathan please open up the lines for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","I will start with an LNG question, so I mean I\u2019m up late and I keep getting these stories from Australia on my iPad which I will see you know going around the market and you know people are very worried about the LNG (indiscernible) or whatever it is something else with the project. Maybe give us a color on how you\u2019re feeling about the startup date and maybe if there are any penalties if the date back in time what\u2019s the sort of pillar date to get Gorgon on screen. Thanks.","","Pat Yarrington","You know I think we have been pretty upfront about acknowledging some of the challenges that we have had earlier, we talked previously about logistic challenges, labor productivity and weather challenges. We have solved for all practical purposes the logistics challenges and in fact we have asked for and received additional lay down space on the island and so we\u2019re able to now kind of build material and inventory on Barrow Island. Productivity I would space is improving on all fronts, but there are still some areas that still needs to improve. We\u2019re still impacted by weather, we had you know heavy rainy period back in June but right now we\u2019re in the good weather period and are making very good progress each month. I think we\u2019re moving into a critical phase from a scheduled standpoint on the project. We talk about getting all the Train 1 modules on to the island. That\u2019s proceeding pretty much as planned. I think they will be here by year end or shortly into the New Year, maybe one that will be mid quarter next year. What\u2019s important next is the mechanical, electrical and kind of instrumentation work and construction or contractor work on those activities is ramping up on the island now, but there are still uncertainties that exist with the projects of our size and our challenge every day is to mitigate the risks, find the risks, mitigate the risks as they arrive, but the jetty I think we are trying to say all the critical elements of the jetty, the main critical elements of the jetty, those that support the structural elements are on plan. Right now, we are in the process of finalizing our budget for the year and should there be any reviews during that, that suggest the material change other than what we said previously will certainly bring that to your attention, but I don\u2019t have anything more to offer.","","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thanks Pat.","","Joe Geagea","And let me address your question on the marketing side, I\u2019d like to say that our customers are our partners, so they fully understand the project challenges. I would also say that Gorgon is not coming up all at once is one train at a time. So that gives us time to work with our partners, with our customers on accommodating their needs and we have those discussions ongoing all the time. I cannot address specifically what\u2019s in our contract with respect to kind of these as you can appreciate these are commercial elements and I cannot address those.","","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thanks very much.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Yes, good morning everybody. And thanks for the LNG commentary as well as addressing that CapEx question. Staying with Gorgon, Joe, I mean can you update us on how the season\u2019s Train 4 is progressing and what is the interplay on Trains 1 and 3, their progress and the ultimate decision upon expansion meaning do your partners need to see more final Gorgon cost estimates before committing to the expansion and albeit at a significantly lower unit cost expansion?","","Pat Yarrington","Yes, I think and maybe I will take the question around Train 4. I think we continue to work with our partners. We are all interested certainly in seeing this continue to progress. I think all of the JV partners are interested though in seeing Train 1 come up and seeing progress on 2 and 3 etcetera. Everybody wants to get an understanding of the cost structure. I also think that people want to get certainty around the fiscal and regulatory regime. And as you know, there has been a change of government in Australia and so a little bit of settling down and stability there would be appreciative. Those factors are going to be taken into account. I also think it\u2019s fair to say that the cost structure in Australia is different now than it was when Train 1 was taken, Trains 1, 2, 3 were taken to file investment decision back in 2009. The cost structure has elevated. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that, that has put at risk some of Australia\u2019s kind of global competitiveness. So from a Chevron standpoint, we are going to look at Train 4 and we are going to assess it under those new conditions and we are going to look at that relative to other opportunities that we have got in our portfolio and look for that next investment to compete with other opportunities. Obviously, a Train 4 does have certain Brownfield economic advantages to it, but we need to take those advantages lay in the new macro conditions that we see in Australia and take a look at the whole portfolio activity. Having said all that, we are continuing on with environmental approvals for Train 4.","","Jeff Gustavson","So maybe I will add a bit of color commentary also, because the marketing is essential to Train 4 and all the reasons that Pat has mentioned, I would also say that the LNG market has different dynamics as well. Our job is to continue to find customer for Train 4, which we continue to do. We believe the offerings of the Train 4 are different than the offering of our other projects like Kitimat. Train 4 is an expansion, is a Brownfield expansion, Train 4 is exposure to Australia. Train 4, however, does not have equity unlike Kitimat where we are offering equity. So it really caters to a different set of customers and in our view from a marketing perspective, it\u2019s truly not competing with Kitimat and I think that\u2019s important for us to say.","","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","So to follow-up does that mean the potential debottlenecking of Trains 1 through 3 is something that could potentially proceed a Train 4, I mean I know there are three different tranches of potential expansion. Does it change, I guess the debottlenecking opportunity move that forward or is that still something that we'd fall if it didn't back follow?","","Pat Yarrington","Yeah. I mean I think Evan that we would -- I mean debottlenecking is always something that you would do kind of as an ordinary course of activity and often times it has the very highest economics associated with it. So that will be taken into account in our normal planning process.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Your question please.","","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Yeah. Hi, just two quick ones. With the Duvernay wells Pat, that how much were they running I know it's science times its early days but I am just wondering an approximate cost?","","Pat Yarrington","You mean you are talking approximate well cost?","","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Well cost?","","Pat Yarrington","Yeah, that's not a number that we want to give out at this point in time.","","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay, that's fine. Next one is on LNG, are you surprised at all that on the demand side in terms of customers that they haven't built more physical gas storage in Asia and do you think that will change as the LNG market builds up more?","","Joe Geagea","That's a very good question John. This is Joe here. It is going to take time for them to get there clearly there is capacity with the re-gas terminals we are seeing that in Thailand we are seeing that in Singapore but remember that market is huge so significant amount of storage has to be made available for it to really make a difference, I think we may get there eventually, but I see a slow pace to get to that point.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Joe first of all can you remind us what the contract resets look like on your base load marketing for Gorgon in particular and maybe when you're addressing the question if you could talk little bit about what are issues around Henry Hub pricing is really more about de-linking and the oil for example went for 150 boxes of course to actually depressing the current price and I've got a follow-up.","","Joe Geagea","I'll start by saying that most contracts that are of that length 20 year for them to be sustainable and to be win, win for both customer for buyer and seller, have reopeners on. We\u2019re not getting into specific, these reopeners are meant to really to make sure that the pricing formula continues to reflect the market.","What I can tell you that all of our projects are paced, that we were not going to see major renewal for a big portion of the volume all in one year. We have been very careful in pacing these renewals over time, because again that's in our interest and in the buyers interest to spread that renewal timing over a longer frame than just having all occur in the same time. Back to your questions on Henry Hub there are two elements to it. We have been public in saying that LNG that comes out of the United States made in the United States it's perfectly okay for it to be price off of Henry Hub.","LNG that is made in Australia, East Africa or Canada it's a harder proposition to see why you would introduce a regional market reference to those markets. So that's been very difficult. In terms of breaking the oil linkage I will tell you that for the last 40 years the industry has learned to operate within an oil framework that saw oil prices go up to $140 and go down to $20.","I submit to you that within these traditional framework you can introduce S curves, you can moderate slops there is a lot of other levers that actually work to prevent LNG from becoming very unaffordable and the regions where affordability is becoming an issue. So I think we can address those excursions that could be harmful from an affordability point of view within a traditional framework without necessarily going to something unproven that could also be a lot more volatile.","We've also said that one way for people to get a better attenuation on price for them to get into the equity side. That clearly gives them direct exposure to the Upstream side to the whole value chain and effectively you are getting an attenuation to pricing, because you are getting the whole value chain benefits from that. So hopefully that helps.","","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It does a lot. Thanks Joe. And my follow-up hopefully also is a bit quicker, but we all watched the unit earnings trends, the very strong earnings trends you guys have had for quite some time now, but whether we want to look at cash, where the focus is earnings. And I guess my question is your DD&A runs about $6 lower than your peer group and it appears to be trending higher, so when you have all this, I guess, non-producing capital coming online from these new projects. Can you give us some feel as to how the DD&A trend is going to look, and I will be going back? Thank you.","","Pat Yarrington","Right. So Doug, I think you should expect we have seen and you should expect the trend to continue higher charges for DD&A. Certainly, that\u2019s the pattern we have seen over the last couple of years, it\u2019s the pattern that we see looking at 2013 versus 2012 and it is the expectation that I would have going forward for 2014 and it is a direct reflection of the capital investment programs that we have had underway and as we bring those new projects online, you see rate increases associated with that.","","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Alright, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks Pat.","","Pat Yarrington","But Doug, I guess I would say it\u2019s important even with that and we still have the leading earnings per barrel margin and we have the leading cash margin.","","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I am just trying to figure out what the future trends going to look like when these projects come up flat.","","Pat Yarrington","I appreciate that. Okay.","","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital. Your question please.","","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Hey guys. Good morning.","","Pat Yarrington","Good morning Paul.","","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Two somewhat related question, one for Joe and I think one for Pat. For Joe, when we look at Kitimat campaign, if you can give us some idea that what is the competitive position relative to building a LNG trend in Kitimat again operate there, which is a pretty remote area and (indiscernible) could be unusual comparing to in Australia, whereas you guys have a lot of operation or in the Gulf of Mexico, which you don\u2019t have a lot of operation. So that\u2019s the first one.","","Joe Geagea","Okay.","","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Pat, do you want to give you the second one first?","","Pat Yarrington","Sure. Go ahead.","","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","If I look at, this is not an issue in the near term, but your current cash flow essentially just barely cover your CapEx and so at what point now of course when you have zero net debt is not an issue today, but theoretically that\u2019s a management standpoint at what point you restart questioning whether you want to continue borrow money to buy back stock and at what (indiscernible) that continue once that you enumerate the share buyback that we have to relook at your CapEx program?","","Pat Yarrington","Okay, good question.","","Jeff Gustavson","I\u2019ll go first Paul on the Kitimat question. And it\u2019s a very good question. I will start by talking a little bit about the resource base. If you look at our acquisition of that resource base, we are very, very pleased with the entry price. So we also know that we have a huge resource base in both Liard and the Horn River. And that resource base sits right at the gate of North Asia, where we continuously see increased demand. So strategically, it is very well-positioned for North Asia buyers and our buyers see that and that\u2019s the value proposition would have been communicated to them. They also see in Kitimat two partners that have complementary skills. They are very aligned and very committed to the project. They see a settled government and a provisional government that are supportive and understand the opportunity. They see a country that is very much in favor of exports and coping toward Asia. They see a project with export permits in hand and a clear line of sight on a pipeline and a transportation solution. And I did say something about the labor cost.","I will tell you though if we are the first out of the gate, we will have an ability to attenuate that versus being the last one coming in to develop the project. And finally, what we tell our buyers this is a great opportunity for them to participate through equity and the whole value chain. And in doing so, they really get direct exposure to North America gas pricing. All of those are good value drivers for any buyer in North Asia. They are getting it. I think we are getting good reception. And obviously time will tell and our ability to sign contracts, but we are very encouraged by what we see and the value that Kitimat can offer to those buyers. And I will go back to Pat for the capital question.","","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Still before that, from a cost standpoint, do you from what you can, because you know a lot about Australia and I presume you know quite a lot about Gulf Coast is developing cost and operating cost of Kitimat is going to be competitive with Australia but cheaper than Gulf Coast or any kind of insight that you can provide?","","Joe Geagea","It is too early for us. I remind you that we have signed a transaction in February of this year. We became operator in July of this year. We are really getting out there. There are two things here that we need to be very careful on it is project development and execution which is really we're focused on and secondly the marketing and they have to go hand in hand. I would tell you though the freight advantage that we see in Western Canada clearly is something in favor of Canada compared to Gulf Coast exports.","","Pat Yarrington","Okay and Paul just going back to your question. I want to start with the priorities that we've always put out there in terms of uses of cash , dividends first, reinvesting in the business, taking care of our balance sheet and then share repurchases really come at the very tail end of that. And you're right we are in a period. Right now our capital requirements are high just to remind you we've got five LNG trains under construction. That's a very significant component we do not have, we do not see in the forward-look that we will have anything as lumpy as that or as sized as that. So we know 2013 is a high C&E year","We have said in the past that 2014 will be a high C&E year. George referenced last time on the call about a flattening that will occur. So we do see that the weakness of our capital spend period right now is not something that we see coming forward in future years. At the same time though we do fundamentally believe our greatest value proposition for our shareholders is finding and investing in the right resources and developing the right projects.","And so we will continue to invest in the business and so you see us doing that in terms of resource acquisitions that I talked about earlier. So we try very hard to balance this returns and growth equation here and we've been very successful. The decisions that we have made and we believe the new resource acquisitions that we have made for future for growth 2020 and beyond are excellent projects. So we believe we're putting that equation together quite nicely. I guess the other thing that I would say is when you bring new resource acquisitions like we've done with Kurdistan or Cooper Basin or Kitimat, et cetera. When you're adding those elements to your portfolio, it does mean that you re-prioritize your portfolio and certain things probably fall towards the bottom.","These would be more mature assets and less competitive in our portfolio, believe that they have potentially had spot in someone else's portfolio and that's where your asset sale or your portfolio optimization component increases. We've been very good doing that in downstream you've seen us do all that restructuring in downstream. Joe has overseen a fair amount of restructuring occurring in our midstream area and I think you can expect some additional assets sales now coming forward from upstream?","","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","","Is there some form of metrics that you look at from a financial net debt to capital or net debt to EBITDA, you would look at say once you reach a certain level, the share buyback will say maybe that come to an halt?","","Pat Yarrington","We obviously are interested in maintaining our AA status, credit rating status. We're not interested in infringing upon that at all so we look at that as kind of a limiting factor but frankly Paul we are such a long away from that at this point it's not a limiting component.","","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your question please.","","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Two questions, first on the LNG facility in Canada, a potential LNG facility in Canada. Can you discuss the merits of owning the entire integrated asset and why not moving to a more asset like model where utility like company owns the liquefaction facility you own the resource and you market the gas and charter the sheds. I mean it seems like it's a very large piece of invested capital. There is a lot of companies out there especially in Canada and the U.S. that have the ability to finance this stuff at a much lower cost of capital. And then my follow-up is that, it seems like building a pipeline from Liard and Horn River to (indiscernible) or even to Kitimat. It's very expensive. There is a lot of depreciated type all the way from there down to the Gulf Coast that has a lower invested capital base. I mean why not they ship the gas down there and sign up any other facilities that are sort of ramping up. So that\u2019s a little bit less feel, but if you can help me answer this?","","Joe Geagea","That was not a less feel at all, Faisel. Good question. Let me tell you that we are not building a pipeline from the field to the LNG facility. We are clearly leveraging existing frontlines that currently won and they are operated and owned by others. The piece that we are building is the link from the frontline to our facility, I call that out umbilical. And that\u2019s very essential for us to actually control that, to control the feet going into the LNG facility. So where we can we are leveraging other facilities, infrastructures, processing plants could be another place, where we leverage as well. So we are adopting some of which you are suggesting. When we do this, we always look at the strategic fit of the asset. Is it essential for us to control it from a commercial point of view? Is it essential for flow assurance to our facility? Those are normally governing criteria for us to decide whether we want to own the interconnecting framework, same thing by ships. We can sell FOB as well and we don\u2019t have to build ships, but sometimes we have to build ships to ensure flow assurance on the back end of the LNG facility. The name of the game is really to get the molecules that we are just acquiring at a very attractive price in the Horn and Liard to the market and maximize our returns. And we look through that whole thing in details. And the other options also we are looking at from lowering the capital investment, we are asking other equity partners to come in. And by farming in for buyers, clearly, we are lowering the capital exposure. So we are looking all of that to basically address the element of the question that you brought, Faisel.","","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. And then the pipeline gas as you could pipeline all this gas down to the Gulf Coast on what\u2019s basically all depreciated pipeline, whether it\u2019s alliance or northern border and then down in GPL to the Gulf Coast, I mean, the invested capital of those assets is far lower than these pipelines at TransCanada and Spectra talking by building to supply that gas to the Canadian West Coast. I mean, is that an opportunity, where you can move that resource down to the Gulf Coast and export it out of the Gulf Coast and with the Panama Canal sort of opening up, I mean, it seems sort of like an asset like sort of model, but I don\u2019t know?","","Joe Geagea","[inaudible]. Thank you, Faisel.","","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay, fair enough. Thanks.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.","","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Thanks very much. Two questions on your unconventional gas exposure U.S. gas production was up almost 5% year-over-year, is that primarily legacy Atlas acreage?","","Pat Yarrington","I think, there is both an Atlas components as well as a kind of newer Permian Delaware Basin component to that.","","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Okay, fair enough. And then on to Europe, lots of headlines recently involving countries where you guys are operating or thought about operating in, Lithuania, Romania et cetera. Any status update you guys want to provide on how you are thinking about that?","","Pat Yarrington","Yes, I think we are trying to say right from the get-go that this would be a long-term development opportunity and that it would take several years really to understand how the overall play could develop. We do think if it works and if it\u2019s proven up, then there is enough here to potentially build the business, but we are just in the very early stages of exploration and so I don\u2019t want to get \u2013 I don\u2019t want us leaping too far too soon with implications here. I mean we are active in Poland. We have drilled four wells there. We have got 3D seismic underway as well there. In Romania, we are picking up seismic activity. In Ukraine, we are still interested in having the PSA in the side we are hopefully getting closer on that. So we continue to make progress. It will be dependent upon the local governments and the local communities wanting to have us be there. And so that\u2019s been a challenge. It is an exploration play and so I think we need to give time to mature.","","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","Right, appreciate it.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.","","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yes. Good morning.","","Pat Yarrington","Good morning.","","Joe Geagea","Good morning.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","I guess I would like to on the upstream side focus a little bit more on that cost side of things I mean obviously it was a good quarter in terms of realizations on the topline but you talked a little bit earlier about DD&A being an issue. Is there anything else maybe particular to the third quarter from an operating cost standpoint that's not recurring? I mean I know maintenance has an issue sometimes but I was just seeing if you could help us there and maybe think about how that unfolds in '14 and '15?","","Pat Yarrington","I think from a cost standpoint exploration was heavier in the third quarter than the second quarter, but if you look on a year-to-date basis it's pretty much in-line with what we have seen previously. We're seeing higher industry costs you referenced that I think that's just a general trend that has been evident but also maintenance in the third quarter was a little bit heavier kind of pre-planned as well as some unplanned as well. So I think those are the factors that I would call your attention to.","","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","And in terms of any thoughts on '14 and '15 I mean are we seeing trends here I mean I agree with you there that the industry is seeing higher cost but are there any trends specific to Chevron that we should think about or even another way of asking it as the LNG projects come on are we going to see that as a significant impact maybe lowering operating cost?","","Pat Yarrington","Yes. I don't think there is anything unique in Chevron's operations going forward that I would suggest and I think I'll differ on the LNG operation side of things. I'm not in a position to comment about what op expense looks like in 2015 and 2016 at this point. Okay. I think we've got time for one more question.","","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Allen Good from Morningstar. Your question please.","","Allen Good - Morningstar","Just a couple for Joe on LNG. You've been pretty detailed on the merits of Canadian gas relative to Gorgon and relative to U.S.. Should we go and take it that exploring natural gas out of the Gulf Coast doesn't fit competitively within Chevron's current LNG portfolio?","","Joe Geagea","You're making too many assumptions right there. We are focused on Kitimat for now and again we have opportunities in Australia. We are not ruling anything out at this stage but at the same time I am not prepared to tell you that we won't look at opportunities anywhere else in the world. For now we're focusing on Canada.","","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","And then finally you mentioned the appeal of the equity availability in Kitimat for some of your potential partners. Is there a minimum equity stake that Chevron would like to retain in Kitimat or vice versa of sort of target that you'd like to sell down as a portion of equity in the project?","","Joe Geagea","We have not put any number out there obviously it's up to the buyer also to indicate interest. We kind of like a number in our mind in terms of what end up but it's really a function of where the buyers are. We're flexible and remember we've got a partner as well and we got to consult with them in terms of where they like to end up. The gate is open though for the buyers to tell us what they think I don't know that we have indicated externally what that number is but we're open to entertain the buyer's ideas.","","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","I'll just get one more quick one. If you've been -- you make a pretty convincing case that demand for LNG will be out there. Do you see any threats in the supply side, though, that could potentially disrupt the potential long-term economic for LNG projects?","","Joe Geagea","In fact, I see the threat in the opposite direction, I see the threat as the longer it\u2019s taking us to enable project to reach FID and you fast forward it 4 to 5 years how long it takes to build them. This market can only go up and that is not really where the buyers would like and that's why our plea with the buyers have been we need to enable supply to come to the market because we have not seen anything on the demand side that is managing that carefully we see more subsidy, we see nuclear out of the energy mix. We see shale gas development, a lot of places slower outside the United States all of that point to more need for LNG and I look at how many projects are actually reaching FID outside the United States. I don't see a whole lot and that can only mean problem down the road and we've seen that play out in the past. Back in 2007, there was an estimate of about 75 million tons of LNG that will hit the market in '14. As we sit today it is only 10 million tons that will come in '14. So we've got to crack this equation both from the supply side and the demand side, and the longer we see projects delayed from reaching FID, I think the price equation gets more difficult.","","Allen Good - Morningstar","Yes, great. Thanks for that.","","Pat Yarrington","Okay, thank you. Before we close off the call, since we didn\u2019t get a question on Ecuador, I would like to provide our investors an update on this matter before we close out here. It\u2019s a very important matter. As you are probably well aware that we are in several recent positive developments related to this ongoing litigation earlier in the year several key witnesses, financiers and other associates including an Ecuadorian judge involved in the case publicly been announced and exposed numerous examples of the blatant fraudulent tactics used by the plaintiff lawyers during the trial. But more recently an International Tribunal convened under the authority of the U.S. Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty and administered by the permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague found that the Settlement and Release Agreements between the Government of Ecuador and Texaco in the mid to late 1990s released Texaco Petroleum Company from any liability for all public interest or collective environmental claims.","Now, this was a definitive ruling on the single most important legal issue in the case. And it was made by an impartial Tribunal in The Hague, where Chevron had picked one arbiter, the Government of Ecuador had picked one arbiter and we both had agreed on the third. And it was a unanimous ruling. Importantly, this ruling confirms that the claims against Texaco were not valid and should not have been brought in the first place. And it also signifies that efforts to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment, which the plaintiffs have so far unsuccessfully attempted in both Canada and Argentina that those are in direct violation of national and international laws.","Now, separately, couple of weeks back on October 15, the U.S. trial began in New York related to Chevron\u2019s civil lawsuit against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters alleging legal violations, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Trial proceedings in this New York lawsuit are expected to last a few more weeks. So we are encouraged by these recent developments, but at the same time, we expect the need to continue to defend our position and defend our assets well into the future before a final resolution becomes available to us.","So with that, I will close off finally here. And again, thank you for your interest in the company and your time here this morning. Good day to everyone.","","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.","Wayne Borduin","Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s third quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide 2.","Turning to slide 3. And Pierre?","Pierre Breber","Thanks, Wayne. We had another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. First, an overview of our financial results: Earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.36 per share. The quarter's results included a $430 million special item tax accrual associated with a cash repatriation in the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange gains for the quarter were $74 million. Excluding special items and FX gains, earnings were $2.9 billion or $1.55 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.","Cash flow from operations was $7.8 billion. We also maintained a strong balance sheet with a low debt ratio. Importantly, our strong cash flow allowed us to continue to deliver significant cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we paid over $2 billion in dividends and repurchased $1.25 billion of shares, in line with our annual share repurchase run rate guidance of $5 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned approximately $9.5 billion in dividends and share repurchases.","Year-to-date organic CapEx was $14.5 billion, slightly below our ratable budget of $15 billion. Total CapEx, which includes inorganic transactions that are unbudgeted, totaled $15 billion. We are maintaining a firm commitment to capital discipline to improve returns on capital.","Turning to slide 4. Third quarter cash flow was strong, down from the prior quarter due to lower Brent prices and the absence of the termination fee received from Anadarko. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of nearly $22 billion funded all four of our financial priorities. With nearly $12 billion in free cash flow, we currently have an annualized yield of about 7%, highlighting our ability to generate strong free cash flow in a lower oil price environment.","Through the three quarters, the company's cash flow dividend breakeven price, excluding working capital is in the low 50s Brent. Asset sales proceeds add to our positive cash flow and further lower the breakeven, while high-grading our portfolio. Since the beginning of 2018, asset sale proceeds have totaled $3 billion, and by year-end after the expected closing of the sale of our U.K. North Sea assets, we will be near the low end of our $5 billion to $10 billion guidance range with one year to go.","Turning to slide 5. Third quarter 2019 earnings of $2.6 billion decreased about $1.5 billion versus prior year. Excluding special items and FX, upstream earnings declined primarily due to lower crude and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher liftings.","Downstream earnings also were down, primarily due to higher turnaround and maintenance costs, lower volumes driven by the Southern Africa divestment, and lower chemicals margins. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects lower corporate charges versus last year.","Turning to slide 6. Compared to the second quarter, third quarter earnings decreased by about $1.7 billion. Excluding special items and FX, upstream results were lower, primarily due to a 10% decrease in Brent prices since the second quarter. Downstream earnings, excluding FX, improved due to stronger refining and marketing margins, partly offset by lower chemical margins and the impacts of planned turnarounds. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects lower corporate charges and tax items.","I'll now pass it to Jay.","Jay Johnson","Thanks, Pierre. On slide 7, third quarter oil equivalent production increased 3% compared to a year ago with higher shale and tight production in the Permian as well as higher production from major capital projects following the ramp-ups at Big Foot and Hebron. This growth was partly offset by unplanned downtime at Hibernia, asset sales, and the impact of Hurricane Barry in the Gulf of Mexico.","Turning to slide 8. Third quarter production was strong at more than 3 million barrels a day for the fourth consecutive quarter despite the impact of planned turnarounds and asset sales. Year-to-date production, excluding asset sales, is about 5% higher than 2018, which is consistent with our earlier guidance of 4% to 7% as shown by the middle bar. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect production growth to be primarily driven by our shale and tight assets as well as the continued ramp-up of Hebron.","Turning to slide 9. I'll provide an update on the TCO project. In the third quarter, we completed a detailed cost and schedule review of the future growth and wellhead pressure management project in Kazakhstan. As a result, the cost estimate for the project has been updated to $45.2 billion with an additional $1.3 billion in contingency.","The expected start-up of FGP has shifted to mid-2023 and will now follow WPMP, which remains on schedule for startup in late 2022. The updated estimate has been submitted by TCO for shareholder approval.","Overall, the increase in total cost including contingency is about 25%. The waterfall shows the key drivers of the updated estimate. As discussed previously, higher engineering costs and engineering impact on fabrication consumed about two-thirds of the original contingency. Additional construction costs represent the largest category of the revised estimate. More than half of the increase in construction cost is due to higher quantities than originally estimated, including significant increases for electrical and instrumentation, which was one of the last scopes of the engineering work to be completed. The balance is primarily driven by higher unit construction rates due to higher market rates and more complex work than originally anticipated. Finally, the schedule and other category is primarily driven by the FGP schedule delay and increased costs for operational readiness and the owner's team. Despite the increased project costs, TCO remains a world-class asset that's expected to generate strong cash flow for many years. ","Turning to slide 10, beginning in 2020, we expect spending to ramp down as we complete the project. The project is approximately 70% complete. Detailed engineering and procurement are essentially complete, mitigating the risk of further impact on fabrication or construction. Work at 3 of the 4 fabrication yards is complete. The logistics system is working well and the 2019 sealift has successfully concluded. Modules are being delivered, restacked, and set on foundations as planned. Drilling is ahead of schedule with 40 of the 55 wells drilled and completed.","The lower chart on the slide shows the completed and remaining capital spend. Most of the remaining scope now resides with construction and start-up activities. Given the work completed, including two full years of on-site construction experience, we believe we're on track to deliver the project in line with the updated estimate. Importantly, we're not changing Chevron's capital guidance. Our 2020 capital to be announced in December will be in the range of $18 billion to $20 billion, and we're reaffirming our capital guidance of $19 billion to $22 billion for 2021 through 2023. We remain committed to capital discipline and delivering leading returns for our shareholders.","Slide 11 highlights some recent commercial developments in our upstream business. First, we recently announced a farm-in agreement to take a 40% working interest in three Mexican blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We also recently participated in Brazil's 16th bid round and were awarded a 35% to 40% working interest in two operated and three non-operated blocks. We're excited about these additions to our exploration portfolio. Last week we signed an agreement to sell the company, which holds our interest in the Malampaya gas fields in the Philippines. We're expecting the transaction to close in the first half of 2020.","Now I'll turn it back to Pierre.","Pierre Breber","Thanks, Jay. And turning to slide 12, this quarter, there were a number of highlights related to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations. Earlier this month, we announced two new greenhouse gas reduction goals. The new goals are aimed at reducing our oil emission intensity by 5% to 10%, and our gas emission intensity by 2% to 5% in between the years of 2016 and 2023. These are in addition to the targets we set at the beginning of the year to reduce our flaring intensity and methane emissions over the same time period.","In Australia, we started up the Gorgon CO2 injection project in early August and are in the process of ramping it up to full capacity. Once fully operational, this will be one of the world's largest carbon sequestration projects and is expected to reduce Gorgon's greenhouse gas emissions by about 40% over the life of the project. Lastly, construction is underway on a new 29-megawatt solar farm, which will supply electricity to Chevron's Lost Hills Field in California.","Now looking ahead. In upstream, we expect full year 2019 production growth to be in the middle of the 4% to 7% range, excluding 2019 asset sales. Asset sales, primarily in Denmark and Brazil, are forecasted to have a full year impact near 30,000 barrels per day.","Planned turnarounds, primarily in Gorgon and Nigeria, will be lower than the third quarter, but are expected to impact production in the fourth quarter by more than 70,000 barrels per day. As Jay mentioned earlier, we have acquired new exploration acreage in Brazil that is expected to add about $120 million in inorganic capital, which is unbudgeted.","Full year TCO co-lending is expected to be below the full year guidance of $2 billion, dependent primarily on the fourth quarter distribution decision. In downstream, we expect high refinery turnaround activity. This includes a refinery-wide turnaround at SPRC in Thailand which occurs once every five years. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make the $430 million tax payment related to the cash repatriation and to repurchase shares of $1.25 billion.","With that, I'll hand the call back over to Wayne.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question, please.","Jason Gammel","Thanks very much guys. I guess the first question related to the updated Tengiz budget. Given that a lot of the spending is already behind you, do you anticipate that this is going to have any significant effects on the co-lending that you'll be making to the venture in the coming years?","And then maybe I'll just ask my second question now. The U.S. downstream earnings were pretty robust this quarter relative to what I would have expected just given a heavy turnaround schedule. Is it just the margin environment that was helping you out or is there anything else that's happening in downstream that is maybe more ratable?","Pierre Breber","All right. Thanks, Jason. This is Pierre. So, on co-lending, we'll provide guidance for 2020 next quarter, as we have in prior years. As you know, co-lending depends on three primary factors: the level of the capital spend, oil prices, the macro environment and any dividends. And I guided in the fourth quarter that we expect the full year for 2019 to be lower than our $2 billion, but it will vary depending on the fourth quarter dividend decision that TCO makes, so if the dividend is higher, the co-lending would be higher. If it's lower, the co-lending would be lower.","So, if you go back to how this cost increase impacts co-lending, you really have to look at it as overall cash flow. So, clearly if you hold prices and dividends constant, higher capital costs will result in higher co-lending, but that does not translate to lower Chevron cash, because we're going to offset the increases in TCO elsewhere in our capital program.","And so, if you remember, TCO capital spend is non-cash and co-lending turns part of it into cash because we think it's the most economic way to finance our share of the TCO spending. But again we're going to have offsets elsewhere in our capital program, which will be cash CapEx, and that will help offset that higher co-lending.","If we go to Downstream in the quarter, we don't -- there's nothing that isn't inherent in the underlying margins that I can really point out to. We've had -- distillate margins have popped up a little bit, and we tend to have some more production in that space. You're seeing some of the effects of IMO are rolling through the system. I mean West Coast margins had some strength at times in the quarter, but I would attribute the third quarter performance largely to how we operated in the underlying margin environment.","Jason Gammel","Very clear. Thanks, Pierre.","Pierre Breber","Thanks Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Phil Gresh","Yes, hi good morning. First question, just coming back to the idea that the Tengiz CapEx increase will not affect the overall capital spending plan, is this -- are we just talking here about the fact that perhaps you're at low end of CapEx ranges and now you move to high end of CapEx ranges or how do you calibrate being able to offset $4 billion to $5 billion of incremental spending net to Chevron within the budget? Is it activity elsewhere or is it just within ranges here we're talking about? Thanks.","Jay Johnson","Phil, there's a couple of different places that we look to. First, TCO itself in its base capital spend has offset and will continue to offset some of the increase in the FGP spend. Beyond that though as Pierre was talking about, we have a much more flexible capital program now with a lot of short-cycle activity, and we're able to pace and adjust that program to fit within the investment levels that we set, and particularly as it relates to gas-related investments, there are opportunities for us in this current environment to scale back some of that as appropriate, and those are things we may have done anyway.","And then the final thing is just the capital efficiency that we're driving throughout the business. Our base business performance has been very strong. We have digital initiatives trying to reduce our -- make our capital spend more effective. And so, right across the board, people are figuring out ways to do more with less.","I'll give you a good example was in Bangladesh recently, where instead of making a major capital project to add some additional compression, the team was able to look at recompleting some wells, adding some perforations and doing some debottlenecking on existing facilities, which extended the production plateau and alleviated the need for incremental capital spend on another project. So, it's these types of spending that we constantly are working through as we allocate our capital each year. We're going to remain capital disciplined. We're going to stay within the ranges that we've given you, and we're going to look to do it while we stay focused on delivering the value and returns that are really what's driving our decisions.","Pierre Breber","And if I can just build off of Jay's answer there and just to be very specific. No, we do not intend to go from the low end to the high end of the range. We intend to find offsets through the way that Jay has talked about. We have a range because we're giving guidance out to 2023. It is a cyclical business. Oil prices can change, COGS can change. We have short-cycle capital that we can flex up or down, as Jay mentioned. So the intent of the range, we still want to keep the range for what it's there for, and our intent is to offset increase elsewhere.","Phil Gresh","Okay, all right. Thank you for that color. And then, I guess, just a follow-up would be for Jay. I'm just trying to kind of rewind here back to a year or so ago, there were some fears that things were getting a bit behind in Tengiz and then back at the Analyst Day, the tone sounded much better that things were back on track. And now that we have a 25% increase, which is fairly sizable. So I'm just hoping you could provide a little bit more color about how these things have progressed to the point that we have this kind of increase? Thank you.","Jay Johnson","Yes. I think what's changed fundamentally is we completed a very detailed cost and schedule review in the third quarter. So that's just been completed. And as we looked at it, there were a couple of key elements. We've talked in the past about the overall engineering program, the cost of that program and the impact the engineering has had on fabrication and construction. And you can see those in the first two bars of page 9 -- slide 9. And that really reflects that accelerated consumption of contingency that we've talked about in the past. What was frankly a surprise was the increasing quantities that we're seeing coming out of the late stages of engineering, particularly related to things like the electrical and instrumentation, controls, fire and gas, some of the late changes in how we're going to do the backfill and quantities associated with it.","Those drove a much higher construction costs than we had anticipated. And if you look at the third bar, you see that represented. The other big surprise was, having to delay the start-up of FGP by the year. This is really driven fundamentally by an assumption change. We had planned to integrate modules. Our estimate was based on the integration of the modules in FGP, each one taking about 12 months from the time it was placed on its foundation until it's fully integrated. While we're seeing very complete modules come from the fabrication yard, just as we've gotten a year of ME&I experienced this year, our view has changed that we're using 14 months as our planning basis, and that's pushed that schedule time out. So the growth in quantities and the longer schedule have really been the surprises that we didn't anticipate previously. So that's really where we are at this point in time.","Phil Gresh","Okay, thanks a lot.","Jay Johnson","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.","Neil Mehta","Yes, thank you. So the first question just on the Permian and the glide path here. You continue to trend above your target levels. Can you just talk, Jay, with some detail about, how the plan is progressing in the Permian and any comments that you would have on sort of this upcoming U.S. election? And any impacts the way you think about prosecuting your acreage?","Jay Johnson","Well, I'll start with just the performance in the Permian. Our view, as you know, has been to be very disciplined and focused on returns and efficiency. And we have seen continued performance improvement in our drilling, in particular.","Our completions have remained very strong throughout. And so we're watching every segment of the value chain from the actual land acquisition to fill in some of the checker boards and allow the longer laterals, right through the drilling efficiency, the -- into the completions, the facilities and on production.","And then, working with our marketing and transportation group to ensure that we're getting the highest realizations we can for the products that we're producing. So we're on plan. We've actually, as we said, doing very well with our production profile. We're pleased with the performance that we're seeing, but we're always driving for better performance.","In terms of the upcoming election, look, hydraulic fracturing has been done for millions of wells, not only in the U.S. but around the world. It's done safely. It's done effectively. We learn more about it all the time. And it's really unlocked an economic -- huge economic benefit for the country, as well as for the companies involved.","It's also unlocked some environmental benefits in terms of the proliferation of gas, which isn't always to our benefit from a profit standpoint, but it's a great fuel for the U.S. If you look at it from our company standpoint, we have less than about 10% of our Permian unconventional acreage that is on federal land and all of that is in New Mexico. So from a relative standpoint, while we would not like to see any kind of restrictions on hydraulic fracturing it's -- that's the context for our company.","Neil Mehta","No, that's great. Appreciate it. And then, the follow-up here is related to Brazil. There's the upcoming transfer of rights auction and you called out some of your increased exploration acreage there. Can you provide some context in terms of the way that Chevron thinks about Brazil and how aggressive it sees itself being there over the next couple of years?","Jay Johnson","Well, we've talked before that we are very happy actually with our existing resource base. We've been doing a lot of portfolio work, as you know, over the last several years to really clean up our portfolio. And part of that has been a reload of our exploration strategy.","But because we're happy with our resource base, we have primarily focused on reloading in the exploration space, because we're looking for resource additions out in the future. And we also want to manage our capital over the period of time. So our focus has been on exploration opportunities. That's what you've seen us do in Brazil and our focus has been that way.","We are interested in Brazil, because we see the pre-salt as a prolific hydrocarbon basin. It's a good place to be to increase the probability of success on exploration and we'll stay focused on that. We have a couple of wells coming up next year, which will be good wells for us. We're looking forward to seeing those results. But we'll continue to stay focused primarily on exploration, as we look forward. ","Neil Mehta","Thanks, guys. ","Wayne Borduin","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Your question, please.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Jay Johnson","Hi.","Paul Cheng","Jay, don't want to beat the dead horse on Tengiz, but what have you learned from Tengiz in terms of \u2013 to further fine-tune your development and project execution process? Clearly, there something was not working in order for us that to have at this stage to have the delay for a year and also that for 25% increase. So what have we learned? ","Jay Johnson","Well, Paul it's a good question. We ask our self all this time -- all the time, how can we do better? Clearly this is a disappointment. I'm very disappointed, because we have taken all the lessons learned from the past and try to make sure we're building those into each project as we go forward.","When we think about what's gone well. There have been a lot of dimensions to this particularly the execution work is going very well. I'm happy with the way the fabrication work has gone in the yards. The modules are coming out very complete. And dimensionally accurate and we set them on their foundations everything is lining up. The logistics system has been flawless. The performance is exactly how we had planned and it's delivering modules to the site very effectively and we've been able to complete the sealift for 2019. So we're happy on all those fronts.","The schedule delay is a disappointment and that has to do a lot with the quantity growth we saw in engineering. And as we've said, we've been unhappy with the overall engineering performance on this project. Not only the engineering costs themselves, but the impact it's had on fabrication and construction.","We need to do better in this area. And it's an area that we're going to continue to learn our lessons from this and build it forward. We don't have any other very large mega projects like this that are land-based anywhere in the world at the current time. So we've got time to take these lessons learned and really think about how we approach this differently in the future. Our commitment remains on capital discipline. Our commitment remains to execute this project to the best of our ability.","When you look at the improvements taking place on the ground in Tengiz, in 2018 we talked about productivity that we needed to improve and we saw a 40% to 50% improvement in the productivity across the site. In 2019, this year we've seen another 30% to 40% improvement in productivity.","So we're seeing great improvements with the production, the construction management system, production management systems. And we're going to continue to stay focused on productivity, on completing work and moving it to mechanical completion and then getting it through systems completion and then to start-up.","Pierre Breber","Yeah. And if I could just build off of Jay's answer Paul. Just to put this in an enterprise perspective, the additional depreciation after tax to Chevron is less than $0.20 per share or less than the cash flow impact of $1 change in oil prices. So as Jay said, we own this and we need to do better. And trust me; we're fighting for every dollar. But I did want to put in perspective what this means for a company like Chevron. ","Paul Cheng","Sure, I understand. But I think Jay when you're saying that you're unhappy about the engineering on this. So is it not upon the finger, but is it an internal issue, or just an external the contract that you guys use?","Jay Johnson","You're asking\u2026","Paul Cheng","How do you -- how are you really going to be able to mitigate it in the future? I mean that -- what -- I mean you say you learned from that, but exactly what have we learned? And what is the change will be? ","Jay Johnson","From an engineering standpoint, Paul I think we have a couple of things. One, is we are doing more to bring the early engineering back in-house and do more focused design development with our own capabilities. And we're trying to minimize the amount of variation that we see in terms of each project team's decisions that they make around engineering. I think that's a key part of it.","And I think looking at the total project in the context of the environment, it's going to be built. It's also important. I do think there are also opportunities for the industry to improve on engineering. I don't think this is necessarily isolated to our company. So there's work to be done as we really understand how to better define and prosecute the engineering programs that are necessary for these projects.","Pierre Breber","And if I can just -- what Jay said is we don't have projects like this in our Q. If you look at our capital program, a lot of base business capital, shale and tight capital, we are going to have some major capital projects but the ones that are coming up are deepwater projects, and they're very different than these. A lot of the spending is in drilling and completion, where we're very good on the facility side, it tends to be standard designs in fabrication yards. As Jay said, it's not land-based projects in remote locations, and we have a better track record in those ones. So, again, we need to do better. We're learning from it. From an enterprise perspective, the portfolio, the investments that are at least in front of us are hitting a different place than where this project has been.","Paul Cheng","My final question, Jay and Pierre, I think in Tengiz even before the cost increase, the full project return on capital -- the full cycle internal rate of return is actually pretty low. And with this that, of course, is much lower. But the cash flow will be great once that they come onstream. So which is a more important factor when you guys determine whether you want to go with a certain project? Is it the internal way of return, or is the cash flow and the sustainability of that cash flow, say, for how long. So I'm trying to understand that the decision-making process?","Pierre Breber","Yes. Look I'll start and maybe Jay will add some comments. I mean, you've heard, Jay and Mike and myself, are all talking about increasing returns on capital. So we are focused on the return on investment. And so we are looking at it. And once you have a cost increase, I think it's stating the obvious that, that dilutes the returns, and we're taking a lot of actions to offset that, both at Tengiz and across the rest of the portfolio. I tried to give, again, some financials that kind of characterize what the impact is, again, on a company like Chevron, less than $0.20 per share. But we are looking fundamentally at returns on capital, but we also know cash is important. It helps pay the dividend and support the share buybacks.","Jay Johnson","I would just say this particular project, Paul, I know your views on it have been the same for a long time, but this is an important project for Tengiz, it does lower the back pressure on all the wells and addresses the declining reservoir pressure that we see there. It provides excess gas handling, which will unlock oil production in our existing facilities as well as for FGP and it helps maintain reservoir pressure in the platform, which is an important aspect of the overall performance of Tengiz, not just the incremental performance.","There also, as Pierre said, we're looking at ways that this can be offset. And one of the key milestones that was achieved was the decision to debottleneck the CPC pipeline. And so that's going to open up some additional export capacity, which will improve realizations and help boost returns and help mitigate and offset some of the increases that we're seeing on project cost.","Paul Cheng","Thank you, all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Devin McDermott","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Jay Johnson","Good morning, Devin.","Devin McDermott","I wanted to follow-up on some of the exploration discussion from earlier. You talked a little bit about Brazil, but you also highlighted in the release and slides, some additional blocks in the offshore Gulf of Mexico, and I think you've been fairly active in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico leasing as well. As we're going to step back and look at where you're seeing the most opportunity from here, can you talk a little bit more about that and the overall strategy here and the desire, if any, to diversified growth options away from shale and tight, but I think you mentioned there were some larger capital projects offshore potentially in the pipe? So a little more color on that would be great.","Jay Johnson","Yes. Thanks for the question. So in addition to Deepwater Brazil, we have been very interested in some of the deepwater in the Mexican areas of the Gulf of Mexico. And this plays on a lot of the knowledge we already have in the U.S. sector of the Gulf of Mexico. So we've recently farmed into some additional blocks and these complement nicely some blocks we'd acquired in an earlier bid round.","One of our strategies has been to move out of more of the frontier highly-speculative areas and really focus our exploration initiatives in the areas that we consider to be highly-prolific basins and that really increases our probability of success.","At the same time, we're doing that, we're trying to balance the amount of capital that what goes in early and really use the fact that some of this is only under 2D seismic or lightly explored to open up new opportunities for development.","In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we've been very active. And one of the key strategies in the U.S. Gulf is to focus a lot of our new blocks around existing infrastructure and we're looking to push that envelope of how far we can tie back exploration opportunities or discoveries to existing infrastructure and avoid having to build brand-new greenfield.","A couple of examples of that would be, for example, you recently heard about the Esox discovery with another operator, that will tie back to Tubular Bells. It's very close. It brings new production in at very low capital cost and with a very short-cycle time.","So those are kind of the low-cost high-return subsea tiebacks that are being enabled and supported by our exploration strategy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We're also talking about extending that reach, as I said, through some of the new technology.","We have used quite successfully the single phase pit floor pumping at Jack and St. Malo and really proven that technology, and we've now finished the technical certification to move to multi-phase pumping and this can really extend that radius, of which we can pull production back to existing hosts that have ullage. So it's entirely in line with our theme of exploring in prolific basins, but also utilizing existing infrastructure and getting more out of our existing facilities whenever possible.","Devin McDermott","Got it. Great. And my second is on some of the comments around incremental efficiencies you're realizing across the portfolio, is one of the things you mentioned in response to the Tengiz's cost pressure. And Pierre, I think you mentioned it also as an area where we've seen success across the portfolio in your prepared remarks.","So I was hoping to get a bit more specifics on where within the portfolio you're seeing these capital efficiency improvements. And then also, to the extent you are cutting back capital in more gassy areas in response to the Tengiz's pressure? Any additional detail on where that is, in North America, gas elsewhere in the portfolio. Additional color would be helpful there as well.","Jay Johnson","Sure. The increased efficiencies, quite honestly, are happening across the board. All of our units are really focused on how to continue to drive better performance out of the investments we've made in the past. We've seen some great improvements in particular, for example, in Angola, where they have developed some new opportunities by using our existing installed base.","We saw a very strong cash flow coming out of Angola, and there's been a lot of good cooperative work with the government of Angola to unlock many of the marginal reserves that can be tied back to our existing facilities. But it really is happening around the world.","In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, we've seen our unit development cost come down to where we're now targeting $16 to $20 a barrel for new facilities and projects like Anchor and Whale, certainly we're targeting in that range. The OpEx in the Gulf of Mexico and the deepwater has come down to just under $10 a barrel, which is a significant reduction from where we were in 2014.","We're taking these lessons learned, we're sharing them across other areas in the company to make sure that it's one thing to share, it's another to adopt these best practices, but we're seeing great cooperation between our business units and we're going to be really focused on doing that even more as we move forward. All of this isn't just in response to Tengiz. But rather it's the context of Tengiz in this environment that's allowing us to do this and I think do it quite efficiently.","In terms of the specifics on where in our capital program we'll be making changes. That's not something that we'll discuss at this point in time, but we'll give more color on that potentially in December with our capital announcement and of course in the SAM, the Security Analyst Meeting that we do early in the year each year.","Devin McDermott","Understood. Thank you.","Jay Johnson","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC. Your question please.","Biraj Borkhataria","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Sorry, I have another one on Tengiz. Jay, you mentioned the significant productivity improvements in 2018, 2019 but taking that on board that would suggest the CapEx increase was coming quite a long time ago. So I guess just want to square that comment with the CapEx increase today and the timing of that. But taking a step back, you look at the last few years and you've had your fair share of issues at some of these major projects. Pierre, you're signing off on these. I just wonder if these experiences make you think twice about embarking on these types of projects of this scale in the future? That would be my first question. Then I've got another follow-up. Thanks.","Jay Johnson","So on the productivity the contracts at site at Tengiz and the construction are largely unit rates. So we pay based on the quantities that are being installed. But the productivity is important, because it relates to the underlying schedule and the ability to finish the work and execute the work in the time frame that we've got. And with the numbers of people we planned, because there's a lot of indirects that come with having to add additional direct labor.","So while the unit rates have been in place, it's really the complexity that has increased on some of the manhours. We've talked in the past about the unit rate costs that were in our bids for the mechanical electrical and instrumentation work. But really the surprise has been the increase in quantities, because when you multiply the quantities times those rates that's what's resulting in the higher cost. And as I said the shift in schedule.","So that's how I square that with what we've given you in the past and really what came out of the detailed cost and schedule review that we just completed.","Pierre Breber","Yeah. And Biraj in terms of -- I think I addressed this. I mean, we don't have other projects like STP WPMP in our queue. Kitimat is being worked but it's not ready. What we have is a lot of base business capital, a lot of shale and tight and hopefully some deepwater projects here over time. So I understand your question, it's theoretical. I'm not going to speculate about it. But as I look at our portfolio right now we don't have that choice.","That said, we're going to be in the business a long time. We're going to learn from it. We have to do better, but we don't have any immediate capital decisions that are in this large scale land based construction project.","Biraj Borkhataria","Okay, understood. Just to follow-up, hopefully, an easier question, but the tax on repatriated cash, are you expecting that to be a one-off, or is it -- should we expect more of these in the future? Can you confirm whether that was cash tax or just a P&L charge? Thank you.","Pierre Breber","Yes. So thanks for that question. So, no, we completed a global cash management review in the third quarter and decided to repatriate this cash, which was previously unremitted. So prior to completing this review, these earnings were expected to be invested outside the U.S., and that's why we didn't accrue for the state and forward withholding taxes. So when we made the decision to repatriate it, that's when we accrue the tax. So it is a cash tax, but the cash -- the tax payment will be in the fourth quarter. We accrued the P&L was in the third quarter. And the actual cash movements, so this will bring non-U.S. cash into the U.S. It will allow us to lower our cash balances, will lower our debt balances.","We're doing it because it's the right economic decision. And this is for prior earnings. We do not expect other types of repatriations of prior earnings like this. At the same time, there could be some current earnings that, of course, are repatriated, and that's in the normal course of business. So, no, this is a one-off. It's over $8 billion of non-U.S. cash being brought to the U.S. You won't see our U.S. cash balances go down by that full amount because some of it had been lent into the U.S., but we expect our year-end cash balances to be $3 billion to $4 billion lower than where we ended the third quarter. We ended the third quarter a little bit high because we were preparing for some of these moves to repatriate the cash.","Biraj Borkhataria","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.","Doug Leggate","Thanks, everybody. Jay, I know you don't or maybe, Pierre, I know you guys don't normally want to talk about fiscal terms, but in light of the Tengiz's cost increases. I just wondered if you could just remind us or walk us through what the implications are for cost recovery, because I'm guessing that with existing production and like of ring-fencing and so on, the net impact of this may not be as severe as, obviously, the headline cost overrun suggested. I just wonder if you could walk us through what the cost recovery ramifications are please? And I've got a follow-up.","Jay Johnson","Well, this is a tax and royalty contract in Tengiz. And so it's really going to be through the DD&A and the way that flows through the books in terms of the recovery. So it's impacting returns more than it will the actual cash flow once we get past the start-up of the facility.","Doug Leggate","I was under the impression it was going to accelerate the DD&A, is that not the case?","Jay Johnson","As I said, we're not going to discuss the terms of the contract, but it's a tax and royalty contract and...","Pierre Breber","And just to be clear, when I refer to the less than $0.20, I'm talking about booked DD&A, booked depreciation, not tax depreciation, which obviously is different.","Doug Leggate","Okay. No, I'm sorry I thought it was an accelerated piece to that. Thanks. My follow-up is really more going back to the Permian. Obviously, the plan you've laid out is continuing to -- you continue to outperform against at least the production profile. But when you laid out the plan, you talked about when you would expect the Permian to be cash breakeven in terms of capital and cash flow and obviously, royalty contribution and so on. Obviously, NGL and gas prices have deteriorated quite materially. So I'm wondering if you could just update your thoughts on that. And specifically, on the takeaway solutions that you've announced over the last several months. What does that do to your ability to improve gas and NGL realizations of those lease line? Or are they going to uplift your realizations with more to work in the Gulf Coast type metric to? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Jay Johnson","Well, we went through a lot of this, Doug, as you know in the second quarter call and that guidance still stands. In terms of the crude takeaway capacity, we have sufficient capacity, not just to produce it into the basin, but to take it to Houston and now we have export capacity opening up as well, 35% now and 40% in 2020. So that's the crude side of things.","NGLs are sufficient through 2020. And in terms of gas, our primary focus was to make sure we have evacuation capacity in the basin and we have 100% of that covered. Our view and our practice is that we have no routine flaring of gas to enable production. And we've been able to honor that.","In terms of moving gas out of the basin, right now, we have about 25% capacity and it's going to vary based on how these different pipelines come on stream, but by the second quarter of 2021 we're expecting to have about 80% of our gas flowing out of the basin. We are still expecting to have free cash flow positive next year.","Doug Leggate","Jay, just to be clear, this is \u2013 is the 60%, 65% gas in NGLs? Or can you \u2013 I know you talk about liquids, but can you split the oil versus NGL portion then I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Jay Johnson","We see -- roughly half of our total mix is in crude, about a-quarter of it is in gas liquids and about a-quarter of it's in natural gas.","Doug Leggate","Helpful. Thanks a lot.","Jay Johnson","Thanks, Doug.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.","Dan Boyd","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just want to actually follow-up again on the TCO spend. And if I recall correctly last year you spent about $600 million more than you initially budgeted. So what I'm wondering is how much of the sort of overrun is going to be already spent or in the budget by the end of this year? That's sort of the first question.","And then, the follow-up is, when I look at your total CapEx budget, in order to be below the $20 billion for next year, given that affiliate spending will still stay high. Are you implying that your cash CapEx could potentially be down next year? And I'm just wondering if there's a potential production impact of that or if the Permian is running ahead of schedule enough to offset any of that.","Jay Johnson","So a couple things, Dan. First of all, I'd take you to slide 10 and that kind of shows our production or our spending profile for the FGP project. And we see 2018 and 2019 as our peak years of spend. And as we look to 2020, we'll start spending at a lower rate as we move and consolidate really the activities largely into site construction work. We have one more year of fabrication to go in one of the four original yards. And that work is currently about 73% complete.","In terms of how to allocate the incremental spend over the total project, I would say, roughly it's about half of it behind us, half of it -- about $4 billion to $5 billion in front of us. But as we look at it, it's really in that increased construction costs where we see the majority of the increase and the surprise. The part that we did in the first engineer -- or the engineering and fabrication was more directed around the consumption of contingency. The increases we've really seen have been in construction and schedule.","Pierre Breber","So Dan again just to build off Jay's comments. I mean, we're coming off of reaffirmed the guidance for next year between $18 billion to $20 billion. TCO will be coming off as Jay said. And so we have -- we're doing -- we're finalizing our plan and our capital program right now. But we have -- between the efficiencies that Jay talked about and choices we can make around deferring low return projects, we absolutely have the capability of landing a capital program in that range. ","Dan Boyd","Okay. And the production outlook more than offset that in other areas?","Pierre Breber","Yeah, I mean we haven't given production guidance year-by-year. We've given the 3% to 4% production outlook to 2023, so no change to that. Again some of the examples, some of the offsets do not impact production. Clearly if we defer some lower return natural gas investments or we decide to flex down some of our shorter cycle spend that could have a modest impact on production, but there are other things that are going better like the Permian and other offsets that we're trying to manage. So we will give our \u2013 usual one-year outlook on production guidance on the fourth quarter call in late January.","Dan Boyd","Okay. Thanks, Jay.","Jay Johnson","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Roger Read","Good morning. Thank you. I guess, maybe it's been mentioned a couple of different times, the weakness in gas, maybe as you think about global gas markets, LNG, what you're seeing in terms of any additional risk we should think about on the spot market side or on the contracted side for LNG? And then there's a little add-on to that, just an update of how Gorgon and Wheatstone are performing here in planned and unplanned maintenance? ","Jay Johnson","Okay. Gorgon and Wheatstone are actually performing quite well. Gorgon Train 1 is currently under a scheduled turnaround or planned turnaround. But as you saw our third quarter production and there's a slide in the back was very strong out of both Gorgon and Wheatstone and we continue to stay focused on enhancing the reliability and the utilization of those facilities as well as creeping the capacity.","We have a turnaround schedule that is going to be planned for both of those and it'll be an annual event. Those will be -- we'll talk about those as we get closer to them. We have another train for Gorgon next year that has been announced. And these will be done to allow us to get into a regular rotation of turnaround, so they can be done safely and efficiently just as we do in our downstream facilities and places like Tengiz.","We do see the potential for spot to be higher as we increase production, as we hit stronger production, we will have more cargoes available for spot. That's a good thing, because we actually have more production than we'd planned for. But over time as the reliability continues to strengthen, we would expect to try and term up some of that anticipated spot cargoes and reduce the amount of spot in any given quarter relative to either long-term or medium-term contracts that we've put in place.","Pierre Breber","Yeah. The only thing to add and Jay mentioned this in the second quarter, we have seen some customers downward flex on the long-term contracts. This is something that is within contractual limits and within the contractual terms. They have to do it almost a year ahead. It's tied to Annual delivery schedule, but we have seen some of that, and that has resulted in a little bit more in the spot market than we otherwise would have.","Roger Read","And any particular weakness in the spot markets that you're seeing at this point, or are we pretty well past that for the summer time?","Pierre Breber","In terms of calling -- and look, it looks -- the macro on spot LNG looks sort of structurally oversupplied. Of course, a cold winter can certainly fix a fair amount of that, but storage levels in Europe, our full Asia seems to be well positioned. So if I look at it right now, again, it looks oversupply and there's more LNG coming on. But markets surprised us all the time. I mean, the takeaway for us is we are just not really exposed to the spot market. We are primarily selling under oil-linked, long-term contracts. Thanks, Roger.","Roger Read","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.","Sam Margolin","Hello.","Pierre Breber","Hey, Sam.","Sam Margolin","So my first question is on the Permian, and it's probably for Jay. I think it's well-understood that your leading-edge wells perform better and better. I'm interested as the base gets bigger and is more important to the overall production targets, how your first-generation wells look if your EURs, that you projected, look like they're intact or growing or changing in any way? And if there's sort of rigless activity work workover stuff that you have to do that you had modeled or maybe it's less than what you modeled, but just any update on kind of your older wells and how that component of the Permian is shaping up today would be great.","Jay Johnson","That's a good question, Sam. Thank you. When we look at our production performance out of our wells, the early horizontal wells have actually performed as we expected them to perform. And so our EURs have been consistent with expectation for the wells as we move through. As we have continued to evolve, though, our basis of design and our completion strategies, we've seen higher and higher EURs and the new wells, of course, are meeting those expectations as well. So overall, the program is working as planned.","The newer wells, as you point out, are much more productive than some of the older wells, but they're all meeting the expectations that we've set for them at the time in the aggregate. Obviously, any individual well may be higher or lower than planned. But as a portfolio, as a program, we've been overall pleased with the performance. And that's really what's underpinning our ability to deliver the production profile you can see on the chart in the appendix.","Sam Margolin","Okay, thanks so much. And then just a follow-up, Pierre, you get this question all the time about the leverage profile on the balance sheet, but the net debt continues to fall. The ratio of your free cash flow annualized and not a great year to net debt is like 1.5 times. Is there a level of net debt that you think is under-levered or suboptimal for the business, especially in the context of Tengiz? If the biggest impact is a return impairment, you can enhance that to the equity with some leverage deployed somehow, so just your thoughts on how net debt's trending and what optimal leverage is?","Pierre Breber","Yes. No, thanks, Sam. Look, yes, we are generating good cash in a challenging macro environment. I think you know our four financial priorities. I will go them quickly. The first is to sustain and grow the dividend and we increased it 6% later this year. The second is the reinvest capital in the business and you heard Jay reaffirm our capital guidance. So we are not going to add to our capital program. The third is to maintain a strong balance sheet and that's what you're asking, I'll get to that. And the fourth is our buyback program that we intend to sustain through the cycle and we have that at a $5 billion annual rate.","So what happens in the short term, clearly, if we generate more cash than those three requirements: in particular the dividend, which we increased earlier this year; the capital program, which we're holding flat and the buyback program. Then it goes to the balance sheet.","That's where it's going to go in the short term, that's just that's just how the math works, but over time, we expect if those conditions continue without speculating about future dividend increases or share buybacks, over time that cash should be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends, and a sustained buyback program, because as you say, we don't need to be an even stronger credit.","We have the leading balance sheet in the industry. We have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. And I've talked about a gross debt to capital ratio of 20% to 25%, we're well below that, I'm comfortable being below that, because that's again the outcome of our cash generation profile, depending on where the macro environment. Obviously, that can change, but we are very well positioned to grow dividends sustain the buyback invest in the business and maintain a strong balance sheet.","Sam Margolin","Thanks so much.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Your question, please.","Jason Gabelman","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to firstly quickly confirm that 2019 CapEx hasn't changed as a result of the TCO overspend. And then, secondly, just wanted to get your thoughts on M&A. That hasn't been addressed this call.","I think in the past, you've discussed wanting to kind of expand or potentially acquire some company that operates in multiple arenas, not just one that operates in U.S. shale. I'm wondering, if that's still the way you're thinking about M&A and how the opportunity set looks right now. Thanks.","Pierre Breber","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. On your first question on capital for this year, our capital budget on an organic basis is $20 billion. Year-to-date, we're at $14.5 billion, so we're basically on track. We've had some modest in organic capital year-to-date, that's been the Pasadena refinery primarily, and we guided to a little bit for the Brazil exploration bit around. So, again, we're on track for delivering an organic capital program in line with our budget of $20 billion.","In terms of M&A, I'm not going to speculate on that. I think you've heard us talk about it. Look, we have a very strong value proposition. We have a 4% dividend yield, a 2% share buyback or the buyback equivalent to 2% of the shares, a free cash flow yield a 7%, an advantage portfolio that Jay has been talking about, with strong resources and reserves that allow us to grow cash flow and grow production over time.","So we don't need to do a deal. All that said, at times in the past we have been opportunistic when we think it's in the interest of our shareholders, it is difficult to make M&A work for our shareholders. And right now, we think we have a very good value proposition on our own for our shareholders. Thanks, Jason appreciate the question.","Jason Gabelman","Thanks.","Wayne Borduin","Okay. Jonathan.","Operator","Yes. And I\u2019d like to hand it back to you for any further remarks.","Wayne Borduin","Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready \u2013 now, that's the end of the call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Pat Yarrington","Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Mark Nelson, Vice President of Midstream, Strategy & Policy. Also joining us on the call are Frank Mount and Wayne Borduin who are currently transitioning in a role of General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's Web site.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement here on Slide 2.","Turning to Slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The Company\u2019s first quarter earnings were $3.6 billion or $1.90 per diluted share. Earnings excluding foreign exchange and special items were also $3.6 billion. A reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange and other non GAAP measure can be found in an appendix to this presentation. This is our strongest earnings result since the third quarter of 2014 when Brent prices were above $100. For the current quarter, Brent price averaged $67 per barrel.","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $5 billion. Excluding working capital effect, cash flow from operations was $7.1 billion. At quarter end, debt balances stood at approximately $40 billion, which resulted in a headline debt ratio of 20.9% and a net debt ratio of 18.1%. During the first quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends. We currently yield 3.6%. ","Turning to Slide 4. We are on track to deliver on our 2018 cash generation guidance from our recent analyst meeting. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital effects, grew to $7.1 billion. Positive impacts of strong realizations and high-margin volume growth were partially offset by equity affiliate dividends that were about $1 billion lower than equity affiliate earnings.","Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3 billion, approximately $300 million or 10% below first quarter 2017, as we continue to complete our major capital projects under construction and drive improved capital efficiency across our portfolio. The results free cash flow, excluding working capital effects, was $4.2 billion approximately $2.5 billion higher than the average quarter in 2017. Assets held proceeds within the quarter were minimal. However, with the closing in April of the Elk Hills transaction and the anticipated closing of the sale of our Southern Africa downstream business later this year, we remain on track for asset sales proceeds of $1 billion to $3 billion in 2018.","Turning to Slide 5. As many of you are aware, working capital effects impact our business unevenly throughout the year. These impacts are to a large degree transitory. Because of this uneven pattern by quarter, many of you exclude working capital impacts from your models. However, while uneven by quarter, our pattern is fairly consistent year-to-year. The chart drawn from this decade average working capital impacts demonstrates the pattern. Normally, working capital is a cash penalty in the first and second quarters followed by a cash benefit in the third and fourth quarters.","The variation has at times been 2 to 3 times the quarterly average is shown. This reason is fairly consistent and may result from seasonal inventory builds and draws as well as the timing of the prior JV partner and tax payments. We anticipate this year\u2019s pattern to be no different. If price levels generally hold where they are today, we expect the majority of the $2.1 billion of working capital consumed during first quarter to be released throughout the remainder of the year. The residual is expected to be most of receivables related to both higher prices and higher production compared to 2017.","Turning to Slide 6. First quarter 2018 results were approximately $950 million higher than first quarter 2017. Special items, primarily the absence of first quarter 2017 gains from the sale of our Indonesia geothermal assets coupled with the first quarter 2018 U.S. upstream asset impairment, decreased earnings by $720 million between periods. A swing in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings between the periods by $370 million.","Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased around $2.2 billion between the periods, mainly on improved realizations and higher listings. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by about $255 million, mostly due to an unfavorable swing in timing effects and lower volumes largely from the sale of our Canadian assets. The variance in the other segment was primarily the result of the absence of prior year's favorable corporate tax items. As we indicated previously our guidance for the other segment is $2.4 billion in annual net charges, so quarterly results are like to be non ratable.","Turning now to Slide 7, a beautiful chart as I do say so myself. This compares results for the first quarter 2018 with fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter results were approximately $530 million higher than the fourth quarter. Special items mainly from the absence of the fourth quarter 2017 U.S. tax reform gain, decreased earnings between periods by approximately $2 billion. While a swing in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by $225 million between the periods. Upstream result excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by around $1.4 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations and listings along with lower depreciation and operating expenses.","Downstream earnings excluding special items since foreign exchange, improved by about $540 million, reflecting higher earnings from CPChem, mainly due to the absence of fourth quarter 2017 hurricane impacts along with improved refining and marketing margins. The variance in the other segments largely reflects lower corporate charges and a favorable swing in corporate tax items between quarters.","Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter production was 2.852 million barrels per day, an increase of 4.5% over average 2017 production and within our guidance range for 2018. This production level represents an all-time quarterly high for the company. Growth is expected to continue during 2018 with Wheatstone Train 2 coming online, major capital project such as Wheatstone, Hebron and Stamped ramping up and continued growth in our shale and tight assets.","During the quarter, the impact of asset sales on production was negligible. In the second quarter, we forecast the quarterly asset sale impact of around 15,000 barrels per day, mainly from our recent Elk Hills and Democratic Republic of the Congo transactions. We\u2019ll also start our plan to turnaround activity in the second quarter.","Our full year production guidance remains unchanged at 4% to 7% growth over 2017, excluding the impact of asset sales.","On Slide 9, first quarter 2018 production was an increase 176,000 barrels a day or 6.6% from first quarter 2017. Major capital projects increased production by 228,000 barrels a day as we started and ramped up multiple projects, including Gorgon and Wheatstone. Shale and tight production increased to 101,000 barrels a day, mainly due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian.","Base declines net of production from new wells, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, were 39,000 barrels a day. The impact of 2017 asset sales, mainly in the U.S. midcontinent, Gulf of Mexico and South Natuna Sea, reduced production by 61,000 barrels a day. Entitlement effects reduced production by 50,000 barrels a day as rising prices and lower spend reduced cost recovery barrels.","Turning to Slide 10, Gorgon and Wheatstone delivered strong and reliable performance in the first quarter. First quarter net production was 202,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Gordon and 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Wheatstone. We shipped 69 LNG and four condensate cargoes, and were able to take it advantage of rising oil linked price, as well as strong Asia LNG spot prices, which averaged over $10 per BOE for the quarter.","We continue to fine tune the plants to enhance reliability and boost capacity. These efforts are yielding favorable results. Gorgon first quarter production is more than 5% higher than our previous best quarter. And Wheatstone Train 1 has been running well. We have a planned pit stop on Gorgon Train 2 next month to replicate performance improvement modifications that we have made in the other two trains. And work on Wheatstone Train 2 is progressing well and commissioning activities are ongoing. The warm end is expected to be ready for start up shortly and we\u2019re expecting begin LNG production this quarter. Dom gas is expected to start up late in the third quarter.","Turning to the Permian. Permian shale and tight production in the first quarter was up about 100,000 barrel a day or 65% relative to the same quarter last year. Looking forward, we forecast Permian unconventional growth of 30% to 40% annually through 2020. All of this is premised on running 20 company-operated and approximately nine net rigs on NOJV properties by year end. In March, we guided to 2% to 3% annual growth from our base plus shale and tight business through 2022 at $9 billion to $10 billion of annual capital spend.","We are currently running 17 rigs and expect to stand up our 18th company-operated rig next month. We also continue creating value through land transactions. We executed nine deals, swapping approximately 25,000 acres in the first quarter, and we have several others under negotiation. As you know, these laterals enable high-value longer laterals. We often get questions about our Permian takeaway capacity, as well as other questions on the industry macro environment. Mark heads up our Midstream and Strategy Group and will provide some additional insight.","Over to you Mark.","Mark Nelson","Thanks Pat. As Pat mentioned, we get questions these days about Permian related differentials, the long-term oil market and LNG supply and demand. So turning to Slide 12, let\u2019s continue with the Permian story. Where we believe optimizing the value chain from well head to customer differentiates Chevron from many in the business.","As you know, our advantage starts with our land position and our factoring model, and continued with the market knowledge of each barrels value at any point in time and ends with the ability to appropriately place those barrels. For example, recent crew differentials in the Midland Basin have widened; and we\u2019ve secured flow and preserved margins by proactively procuring enough capacity to move product to multiple market centers; negotiating highly competitive transportation rates; batching and blending to meet market demands and avoid price discounts; and by accessing the best world markets for each barrels with our export capabilities.","Simply said, our goal is to maximize the return on every Permian molecule. Another question that is often asked is reflected on Slide 13. And that is what role does oil play in meeting the world's growing energy demand in the decades to come. In developing our point of view, as you would expect, we use detailed internal and external analysis to evaluate supply-demand scenarios and the associated opportunities and risks in our business.","Our macro liquids view is similar to a number of independent assessments, and we\u2019re showing one of these assessments, the IEA new policies scenario in the upper right. We believe that oil demand will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, and the need for incremental supply continues to exist in any realistic scenario. Reinforcing this view today is liquids demand continues to be in the higher end of most independent forecasts. The chart at the bottom right illustrates another of our points of view. We believe in a longer flatter supply curve. Despite the recent run-up in prices, we believe capital discipline, cost management and market signpost, will always matter. And we are well-positioned to win in any environment given our advantaged portfolio.","Turning to Page 12 and the macro LNG view, this graph reflects the latest LNG demand projections from Wood Mackenzie with their supply forecast. Highlighting that the LNG market is becoming oversupplied in the short term as new projects continue to ramp up in both the Pacific and Atlantic basin. North Asian LNG demand, however, especially in China was stronger last winter than the market anticipated. In fact, 2017 Chinese gas demand was up 15% year-on-year with LNG imports up 46%. While this growth rate may moderate, the demand drivers appear mostly sustainable with coal to gas switching in residential and industrial applications mandated by the Chinese government to reduce air pollution.","So the LNG market should rebalance with a supply gap expected to open before the middle of the next decade. And this is where Gorgon and Wheatstone capacity Creek and debottlenecking opportunities will fit very nicely. Only the most competitive cost competitive projects we\u2019ll be able to move forward in this space and we will be very disciplined with our investment, and we\u2019ll fund only those projects that will generate top returns.","With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Pat.","Pat Yarrington","Let me close this out here on Slide 15. I would like to reiterate some of our key messages from our recent security analyst meeting and to demonstrate how we\u2019re delivering on those commitments. First, our cash generation improvement trend continues and is in line with previous guidance. In the first quarter, 2018 cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, was $7.1 billion well in access of our cash capital expenditures and quarterly dividend commitments.","Second, we are executing a disciplined C&E program, allocating capital to the highest return projects that compete in our portfolio. Third, we grew production by 4.5% from full year 2017 to 2.85 million barrels a day, achieving an all time quarter high for the company and trending well within the guidance. Fourth, we have an advanced portfolio in the Permian Basin that is delivering on all cylinders.","Year-over-year, we added the 100,000 barrels per day of shale and tight production here, trending ahead of recent guidance. And we\u2019re leveraging our mid stream business to maximize returns on every molecules. And lastly but very importantly, we increase the dividend per share by 4%, delivering on our number one financial priority to shareholders.","So that concludes our prepared remarks. And Mark and I are now ready to take questions. Please keep in mind that we have a full queue and try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up if necessary. And we\u2019ll certainly do our best to try to get all of your questions answered.","Jonathan, go ahead and open the lines please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.","Jason Gammel","Pat, really great quarter just in terms of demonstrating the cash generation potential that Chevron has moving forward. And so I guess we actually get to the high quality question about what you would potentially do with discretionary cash flow. In the capital programs, obviously, we\u2019re disciplined, it\u2019s within a fairly tight range, balance sheet is about where you want it to be that leads us to share buybacks. And what would you potentially need to see to begin a repurchase program?","Pat Yarrington","Jason, thanks for the question and thanks for acknowledging the good quarter. I think at this particular point in time, I\u2019m messaging around share repurchases really haven\u2019t changed from what we said just a few short six weeks or so ago. And at that time, we said we wanted to see the cash flow actually materialize. We said we wanted to see prices sustain a little bit. We do fundamentally believe that it is our fourth priority; and dividend growth is number one, leading the business is number two; the balance sheet, as you say, is number three; and surplus cash. Once we\u2019ve satisfied all those other commitments, it\u2019ll turn into a share repurchase program.","It is part of the value proposition that we have offered shareholders in the past. As you know, 10 out of the last 14 years we have had share repurchases and we only stopped them during the financial crisis, and then in the last three years when prices there collapsed. So it's very much a part of the -- very much part of our thinking these days. And when we re-inaugurated if the circumstances permit that, we want to be able to do so in a sustainable fashion.","Jason Gammel","Maybe just as my follow for Mark. Mark you mentioned the debottlenecking at Gorgon and Wheatstone would be towards the low end of the cost curve in the LNG supply stack. Do you see anything else in the portfolio that would potentially be competitive? And I guess I might even be referring specifically to expansion trends at even one of those projects.","Mark Nelson","I think from Asia LNG perspective, the most exciting thing for us of course is the amount of demand that we\u2019re seeing in that part of the world. And it\u2019s probably premature for us to be thinking about extra trains as we have considerable opportunity moving from both ramp-up to debottlenecking. And having spent much of my career around refineries, I wouldn't underestimate the opportunity there and the size at the price. So we\u2019re focused on ramp up, efficient operation in the building our way into leveraging the existing infrastructure in Australia.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Cheng","I have two questions. I think that both of them for Mark. How much is the oil production from Permian that you are selling inside Permian in the first quarter? And what is your takeaway capacity for the next couple years? Have you already locked-in sufficient according to your current growth plan? And also we have heard some people talking about gas handling in the basin may start to become an issue. I want to see what is your view on that? So that's the first one. May as well have the second one is on the LNG market. Want to see whether you guys have been actively marketing or trying to market additional gas. And what's the conversation with the customer this day and what\u2019s the bid\/ask differences, if there is any?","Mark Nelson","Thinking about and I\u2019ll answer -- I'll address your Permian takeaway capacity question at the high level as you can imagine. We\u2019re very comfortable with our off-take positions today, and it goes all the way back to that advantaged portfolio and maybe equally importantly, disciplined developments. So it allows us to keep up with our production. And we do that by partnering with our strong infrastructure companies and we get highly competitive rates. And then they execute on infrastructure projects that quite frankly might not compete in our portfolio and we view that as activating our value chain at the lowest possible capital investments, which is a written driven mentality. We will hit moments of tightness and length, but we like our position moving forward.","Paul Cheng","How about the gas handling?","Mark Nelson","So from a gas perspective, all three streams so oil, gas and NGLs all must flow in the Permian. And as you know, the oil tends to drive the economics, but we have flow assurance across all three streams today. And again, we\u2019re comfortable with our position looking forward.","Paul Cheng","But do you -- the basin as a whole will you have a problem, if not Chevron?","Mark Nelson","From a basin perspective, you certainly have -- as we\u2019ve all read the news, you can see some competitors who perhaps don\u2019t have either the same discipline or the same advantage portfolio experiencing problems. But in the Permian, in general, most of those would be temporary. We see that as a region that will solve those type of problems and only have temporal challenges.","On your LNG marketing question, as you know, we\u2019ve chosen to do business with some of the largest most reliable customers in that part of the world, and we have long-term contracts. And those -- the natural discussions that go on about wanting reliability and the best sustainable price continues as we would have expected. So we\u2019re seeing customers continuing to like the reliability that we\u2019ve been able to deliver and our flexibility in helping them with some of their operating challenges. So from our perspective, we see those relationships remaining very strong.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Neil Mehta","My first question is just related to cost inflation across the portfolio. If you're seeing early signs of cost increasing, any comment specifically international versus U.S.?","Pat Yarrington","I think that by enlarge the more material cost pressures that we have seen have been limited to the Permian and the U.S. unconventional market. The rest of the world, we\u2019re beginning to see some cost pressures but not of the same -- it\u2019s really as though future rates have declined and the rest of the world probably have stopped, and so you\u2019re probably leveling out there. So you\u2019re beginning to see a little tension there. Whereas in the Permian, you are actually beginning to see cost increases.","I\u2019d like to take a moment though and acknowledge that we\u2019re largely protected in our Permian cost structure this year, because of the contracting strategies that we have followed. And this is again one of the benefits of having a 20 rig program that has been long planned and we\u2019re well disciplined around it. It\u2019s allowed us to line out all of the services and contract arrangements that we\u2019ve made it well in advance. And so we have about two thirds of our spending this year that\u2019s either occurring at known prices or indexed costs, or have cost containment capabilities built into them.","Neil Mehta","And the follow-up question is just how do you get comfortable as a management team that the company has not under-investing, one of your peers is out taking a much more aggressive approach around capital spend over the next couple of years. And I guess one of the things that we hear when people push back on our view on the company is that the fear is that you\u2019re in harvest mode right now, but we\u2019re going to go into early next decade. And what are the projects that will drive the next wedge of ultimately cash flow growth enables you to replenish the portfolio and offset the decline. But just want you to respond to that narrative, because it\u2019s out there in the market.","Pat Yarrington","I think the primary thing that I would say is we\u2019re not after a volume growth for volume growth sake, we\u2019re after growing volume. And we have a tremendous portfolio here. We showed a slide back in March that had 40 years of 2P resource development opportunity, and is very attractive resource that can be developed at relatively modest capital investment program. So we feel very comfortable about the portfolio that we have. And individually, we've got line of sight in the unconventional growth between now and into 2022. And then in 2022, we see the TCOs -- the TCO WPMP FGP project first production coming online. So for the next several years, we\u2019ve got line of sight on very good growth and frankly a portfolio that allows growth beyond that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your question please.","Doug Leggate","So I will take my two as well if I may Pat. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to open up with a buy back question again, just go back to that very quickly. Just philosophically, I'm guessing buybacks are not something you'd want to chop around quarter-to-quarter. So I guess my question is what level of -- what would management need to see to be comfortable to commence a buyback program, assuming you would need that to be ratable? And I'm thinking about level of cash on the balance sheet, whether quarter-to-quarter what we're seeing is a function of cash tax payments and interest charges and so on. At what point would you be comfortable to say okay, now we\u2019re ready to get going with this?","Pat Yarrington","I mean it\u2019s hard to -- I don\u2019t want to put a quantification on this at this point, because I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the internal thinking on this. But clearly, we would have to have sustainability in a view of surplus cash generation. Beyond $18 billion to $20 billion capital program that we want to fund, beyond the growth rate that we anticipate around dividend. And as you say, our balance sheet is hovering in a very reasonable price at the moment. So we have to have a view of sustainability. And when I say sustainability, I don\u2019t just mean this quarter to next quarter to may be the third quarter out, but I really mean over a series of year.","So we would like to be able to average in, dollar average in the cost of that share repurchase program, because we do have some shareholders who are not in favor of share repurchases, because of the concept that you only do them when you have the cash available. And when you have the cash available, your stock price is high. So the way that we can mitigate that is by having a very sustainable share repurchase program. So it really comes down to the longer-term or I\u2019ll say medium term generation, cash generating capability of the firm and expectations around that.","Doug Leggate","So I am guessing a dividend takes a priority as you\u2019ve said previously\u2026","Pat Yarrington","Absolutely.","Doug Leggate","So my follow-up is just a quick one. Obviously, you had a tremendous quarter relative to what the Street was expecting. And when you look through the presentation, there is a couple of comments in there about liftings in other, both U.S. and international. Can you just talk a little bit about what that was? Because were there some favorable timing issues in terms of sales versus production? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","Yes, I mean actually for the first quarter, we were slightly under lifted. So I think it\u2019s just a variance between the position of this quarter versus the prior quarter, very modes stance. I think part of the earnings improvement or the earnings speed that you might be highlighting really relates to depreciation. And in particular if you recall back we had 155% reserve replacement ratio in 2017 and that obviously allows you to, as you go forward, to lower your DD&A rate per barrel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Your question please.","Phil Gresh","First question is a bit of a follow-up to Neil's just around the growth outlook through 2025. You do have some capital spending that will be rolling off after this year, Wheatstone and some other things. How do you think about where that wedge of -- assuming you're going to keep a CapEx cap in place through 2020 as promised. How do you think about where that extra cash flow might go between say adding more rigs in the Permian versus something like Gulf of Mexico where a peer of yours just sanctioned a project with $35 breakeven proposition?","Pat Yarrington","I think that we really feel good about sticking to the 20 rig program in the Permian. We think there\u2019s still opportunity to lower development costs, lower operating costs there and maximize revenue streams out of that, so that will be a primary area of focus for us, getting really good efficiency out of that particular asset. If I think about other areas where there could be small incremental money spent, it would really be around the appraisal and pre fees, pre engineering work perhaps in the Gulf of Mexico.","We have four potential areas of interest there and\/or the areas of potential interest I guess I should say, Anchor, Tigris, Ballymore and Whale, and so that would be areas where we would look to do further evaluation. I should also mention that the development activity around other shales other than Permian, so in the Marcellus and Kaybob Duvernay, in Vaca Muerta, that could like -- those areas could likely pick up additional capital investment.","Phil Gresh","And just one question on\u2026","Pat Yarrington","Can I just go back and mention one thing with regard to deepwater, so that people got misinterpret what I am saying here. We do have multiple opportunities that we can evaluate, but we would be very disciplined and very ratable be working on the pacing of any sort of development that we would do there.","Phil Gresh","So the commitment to the $20 billion cap. Just one question on the quarter. One of your peers on cash flows reported a flip in their deferred tax from a headwind to a tailwind at these higher price levels. I was just wondering, you mentioned $1 billion headwind in the quarter from affiliates' earnings versus distributions, which is about half of the headwind you're expecting for the entire year. Just curious if deferred tax played out as you expected.","Pat Yarrington","I would say directionally deferred tax played out as we were expecting. We did have -- it is influence as you might expect, rather timing of when you place out this as service and when you get bonus depreciation. In regard to the overall set of headwinds, I had given guidance back in March of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion as the headwinds for the year.","But I had said at the time that if we felt working capital would be nil, I would say if prices hold where they are today, there will be a little bit of a penalty in working capital as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So you may want to think towards the -- certainly activity trending towards the higher end of that range that I gave you. I will say this is very hard for us to predict though, and so I do want to reserve the right every quarter to come back and give you an update.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber from Simons and Company. Your question please.","Guy Baber","Pat, I wanted to stick on the cash flow here a little bit, but the $7.1 billion in pre-work working capital cash flow seemed to be better than the framework you all gave at the Analyst Day when we adjust for commodity price. And I understand that 1Q is typically weaker given downstream seasonality and the affiliate dividend timing. So I just wanted to confirm that outperformance versus the internal plan. And I was wondering if you could isolate some of the key drivers of that better than expected cash flow. What sticks out to you all internally? And then with Brent at these higher levels here, just as a check. Do the general sensitivities you all have given still hold or do we need to rethink those a little bit?","Pat Yarrington","Guy, I\u2019d say that the first quarter was really a very clean quarter, and it\u2019s a good basis I would say for you to build into your models going forward. I think we are running a little bit ahead perhaps on the guidance that we gave. I think first quarter is a good benchmark for you there. And the sensitivity that we had given from where dollar of improvement Bren on earnings, on cash flow is about 450 -- on earnings it\u2019s a little less than that.","Guy Baber","And then I had a follow-up for Mark. So appreciate the view on the macro oil landscape here. Can you just talk a little bit maybe about what your base case expectations are from a high level. When you think about this decline in long cycle capital investment that's taken place for the industry over the last few years? So from 2013 to 2018, we've tallied up about 2 million barrels a day of major project capacity that started up per year on average and then that drops to around only 1 million barrels a day from 2019 to 2022 or so. So is the Chevron view -- do you see something similar? Do you see a supply gap emerging for the industry on the oil side over the next few years? And when might you see that beginning to show up in supply\/demand balances?","Mark Nelson","So first from a short-term perspective, obviously, we hit a space where the markets rebalanced and that's on the back of some fairly solid demand; in fact demand has surprised folks, most folks to the upside; and effective curtailment or planned or unplanned declines in certain countries around the world on top of geopolitics. So that\u2019s all short-term price support for today. We\u2019re not designing our business on these prices. We\u2019re driving our business for a lower for longer assumptions.","And I think we\u2019re coming from a time where we\u2019re practiced at production coming from large investments versus short cycle activities. And as an industry, we do not forecast that, as well as we do the large projects. So we have a perpetual supply that\u2019s the industries that we\u2019re in. But I would expect prices to stay in a fairly tight range over time and we\u2019re going to design our business to deal with the lower end of those assumptions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your question please.","Blake Fernandez","Pat, I wanted to go back -- you had mentioned the equity affiliate headwinds, and you\u2019ve addressed that. I guess what I was thinking specifically is on TCO. Is there an oil price level that you would actually begin to start getting distribution from that?","Pat Yarrington","Actually Blake, we do still get distributions. It really is a determination that\u2019s made by the partnership council. It is not solely was in Chevron\u2019s control; but the partnership council folks; take a look at what are the requirements for funding the project that\u2019s under development; they take a look at what cash generation has been; they take a look at what the partners dividend interests are, and will negotiate basically to dividend declaration; and they can do that -- they review that multiple times during the course of the year; and they can do one dividend a year; and they can do a couple dividends a year, it\u2019s really the partnership council.","Blake Fernandez","So it sounds like there is some flexibility and potentially could increase depending on what oil prices do?","Pat Yarrington","Theirs is, we had a dividend last year, expectations are for a dividend this year as well. Again, it\u2019s not anything that we control uniquely within Chevron.","Blake Fernandez","The second question, I'll just take advantage of Mark being on the call. But the 25,000 acres in the Permian that were transacted, it sounds like it was a swap. So I just wanted to confirm that your acreage position hasn't really changed overall. But I guess I was under the impression that a lot of those transactions had already come to fruition and you all were done. So are you still in the process of marketing and coring up?","Mark Nelson","So you\u2019re right, there\u2019s mostly swaps were discussed in the materials that you saw, and never done, would be my answer in regard to potentially looking for ways to get longer laterals in the marketplace. From our perspective, we won\u2019t stop looking and we believe that\u2019s created considerable value for that disciplined execution that we talked about. And in fact, I would expect more transactions in the future in this space.","Pat Yarrington","And I would just add. Swaps are often hard to put together just because you\u2019re trying to both parties optimize. So they may take a little bit longer duration to come to fruition.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Ryan Todd","Maybe a first quick one on the Permian, congrats on a great quarter, I think you guys may have blown out the Midland differential all by yourselves there. Can you talk a little bit about -- obviously, there are some timing issues here. But what drove some of the drivers of the particularly strong quarter-on-quarter performance in the Permian. Whether it was from particular areas, number of completions there, and how to think about the trajectory of that going forward?","Pat Yarrington","Ryan, basically we had a large increase in the quarter, because we put several wells on production at the very tail end of 2017. We also saw increased NOJV activity. And the last point that I would make is that there can be -- it can be lumpy, the production increases that we show can be lumpy. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily have you think that the increase from fourth to first quarter is something that would be repeatable or ratable necessarily.","Ryan Todd","And then maybe -- we haven't talked about IMO2020. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you think about your relative positioning into it? And whether you would envision, or how you think about the attractiveness of any potential investments to take advantage of the situation.","Pat Yarrington","I think the short answer is really that Chevron\u2019s position is pretty well placed, we\u2019re well positioned. We have complex refineries and we produce more distillates than fuel oil. We don\u2019t really produce much fuel oil in the U.S. We do have some exposure there around Asia. But the situation we\u2019ve got from a refining capacity standpoint, as well as the fact that we\u2019ve got midstream and trading capacity that we can optimize over the course of what we think will be an unstable market here as this rationalizes out puts us we think in a pretty good position.","It\u2019s a little hard to understand exactly what the impacts are. So we continue to monitor what the industry response is going to be and what the actions are going to be taken by the various parties there. It\u2019s an unusual regulation in the sense of there is no single actor that\u2019s tagged with compliance. So there's multiple ways that compliance can occur, it can occur on the part of the shippers or that can occur on the part of the refiners. So it\u2019s a little hard to understand exactly how compliance will take place.","Ryan Todd","But at this point, you guys wouldn't envision deploying any meaningful capital to the driven projects?","Pat Yarrington","No we would not.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Roger Read","Jumping in since I've got you, Mark and Pat on here. As we think about your ability to capture whatever differential exists between the Gulf Coast and the Permian. How should we think about that as flowing through your business? The reason I'm asking, Pat, is thinking about is it a realization and so we'll see it in the upstream part there, or does it flow through somewhere else? Just trying to maybe head off at the past concerns that in coming quarters realizations could look weak, but the overall number is fine. So how does it flow through on your upstream business?","Pat Yarrington","It would come through the upstream, upstream realizations.","Roger Read","So whether it\u2019s commercial pipeline or whatever other capture, it all stay in the upstream side?","Pat Yarrington","That\u2019s correct.","Roger Read","And then switching gears just since you put the chart up there with the longer flatter supply curve, you\u2019ve talked a little bit earlier about some of the Gulf of Mexico deepwater opportunities. Price wise, it looks like deepwater non-OPEC would be in the money here. So how do you think about when you're comfortable moving forward with an FID as you complete your studies on those various projects?","Mark Nelson","So it\u2019s about priorities from our perspective in capital allocation. So the good news of having a portfolio that\u2019s so strong with the unconventional with short cycle high return investments, it makes all of the other projects, you have to compete to be brought forward. And I\u2019ve heard Jay Johnson say numerous times, the idea of changing outcomes and improving returns, and when you target a group of engineers on making a project have higher economics, it\u2019s amazing what can be developed for us to consider. But Pat, would you add to that?","Pat Yarrington","So I would just say, first opportunity we\u2019ve got obviously is infill drilling and keeping existing facilities fully loaded here. And to the extent that there is a deepwater, a new reservoir found that can tie to existing facilities, obviously the economics there would be stronger. But we\u2019re working to get the development cost of greenfield down significantly. So standardizing on surface facilities, design one build many, standardizing along with the industry on subsea kit.","We\u2019re also in a mode here now where we would be designing the production facilities, perhaps not the peak production but for the best capital efficiency, so longer subsea laterals. There\u2019s just an awful lot that we think we can do in the deepwater area to continue to get development cost down. But we have to see that actually materialize before we would be in a position to take an FID. We have a number of opportunities that are being evaluated, I\u2019d say at this particular point in time. And I can\u2019t really say which one is going to rise to the top first. But it\u2019s nice to have activity underway there and we\u2019re making good progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP Paribas. Your question please.","Theepan Jothilingam","Just one question actually, coming back to the LNG performance. Could you talk about, just in terms of production both at Wheatstone and Gorgon, how sustainable is it to produce above that nameplate capacity? And just a follow-up question to that would be. Could you remind us in terms of the volumes from those two projects? Is all of it on long-term contracts or have there been some opportunities to, let's say, optimize some of that volume through pricing arbitrage? Thank you.","Pat Yarrington","I would say, we have been spending time and effort and taking these pick stops in order to improve the reliability. For example, at Gorgon, we do think there\u2019s opportunities over time to expand capacity through debottlenecks and gain more capacity and gain more efficiency. So we\u2019re willing to make investments now to get to certain reliability and efficiency today. Longer term I think those debottlenecking activity that will be available to us. And in terms of the contracts, on Gorgon and Wheatstone, we\u2019re about 90% committed under long term contracts for those.","Theepan Jothilingam","Was it particularly good quarter in terms of that remaining 10% or other charge or trading profit\u2026","Pat Yarrington","No, it was a good quarter. In terms of the spot cargoes, Asian spot prices on average were about $10 and so it was a very good quarter from a spot standpoint.","Mark Nelson","So remember, that\u2019s only 10% of our production.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Cowen and Company. Your question please.","Sam Margolin","Frank, I know you like to keep the call tight, but I would be remiss if I didn't say thanks and congrats as well. And my first question is just a mechanics question around the affiliates. I recall in the past some conversations that there would be a co-lending program that would functionally exclude affiliate spending from what we might think about as operating cash flow. Is that still a factor or has the Chevron level found more efficient uses of capital than that?","Pat Yarrington","So the co-lending is really specific to the Tengiz project, and we have coal lending previously. Right now through 2019, we have had no requirement for any c-lending. With prices where they are today and if they stay at this level, it\u2019s not clear whether there\u2019ll be a co-lending requirement in 2018. It\u2019s something you should always have in the back of your mind. But with prices at this level, maybe that\u2019s something that won\u2019t materialize for 2018. The point of the co-lending, obviously, this project was inaugurated back in the lower price environment.","And the point of the co-lending was to be able to assure and allow the fact that all partners being able to fund their share of the project. So it really has been dependent upon what prices have been and the ramp up of spend on the project per se. 2018 and 2019 be the peak years of spending for TCOs and investment projects, but 2018 so far has certainly been into a strong price environment.","Sam Margolin","And then my follow-up is just, I guess it's for both Mark and Pat. The comments about thinking critically on Permian takeaway, I think resonate with the market, because it's come up among a lot of the independents. And given your view on LNG markets globally, how do you see U.S. LNG maybe playing a role, particularly with respect to the areas in the Permian more in the West Texas part of the Delaware basin that are a little gassier, if not is an operator, maybe as a partner or a customer of that solution?","Mark Nelson","Well, from a macro perspective. Obviously, you'll see the company start to -- given some of the length that will occur in the region, you'll start to see people consider further investments in the Gulf in. And the Gulf coast have to compete with landed prices in Australia or in Asia. And from our perspective, we\u2019ve got such an advantaged position taking care of that Asian growth from our base assets in Gorgon, in Wheatstone that we\u2019ll watch what others do. We certainly have other LNG options around the world but all of it has to compete with landed price in Asia.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Rob West from Redburn. Your question please.","Rob West","I'd like to go back to something you said earlier, Pat, which was about the surge in production in the Permian over the quarter. You attributed to more well completions. And the follow-up that put in my mind was can you say whether over the quarter you drew down your inventory of DUCs or whether they were still building. Just in terms of trying to assess the sustainability of that growth rate? That's the first one. I've got a follow-up. Thanks.","Pat Yarrington","I think there was a modest reduction in DUCs during the quarter. But you have to think about it as being modest.","Rob West","The second one is about Indonesia where I know you\u2019ve got an early stage gas project in the pipe. And one of your peers sanctioned a gas project that is this week I think, so topical. And I was wondering -- so I think that particular project you have, the holdup is really on license extensions. Is that right? If so, what's the timing on resolving those? And if it's not right, can you say anything about the other bottlenecks you still need to overcome there?","Pat Yarrington","It\u2019s a called the Gendalo-Gehem project. And we have a new development concept, or we\u2019re reworking I guess the development concept, is the best way to say it; trying to recapitalize; work has been underway on that effort for the last several months; in fact probably more than a year at just particular point in time. So work is progressing on that. But I would also say that the contract extension is also an element here. And we\u2019ve express -- we've deliver an expression of interest to the government of Indonesia with regard to extent of the concession. So we want to make sure that it\u2019s a long lift project and we want to make sure that the combination of the development contract as well as the fiscal terms gives us the high return project.","Rob West","Okay, thank you for those details.","Pat Yarrington","Okay, I think that closes us off here. I would like to thank everybody on the call today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Chevron, and everyone\u2019s participation. Jonathan, back to you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call.

My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Pat Yarrington","Hey good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call and webcast.","On the call with me today is George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President, and Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide two.","Turning to Slide three, the company\u2019s second quarter earnings were $5.7 billion or $2.98 per diluted share. On a year-to-day basis, earnings were $10.2 million or $5.34 per diluted share.","Included in this quarter's earnings were gains on asset sales of approximately $750 million and foreign exchange losses of $232 million, which together equate to a positive $0.27 per share. Year-to-day earnings after netting gains, impairments and foreign exchange impacts was $10.1 million or $5.29 per share.","Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was approximately 12%. This reflects both the strength of our underlying producing assets and the fact that we are in the midst of a heavy construction period for a few key capital projects.","Our debt ratio at the end of June was approximately 13% similar to last quarter. Our financial priorities are unchanged and we continue to reward shareholders with competitive distribution. We repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares during the second quarter and in the third quarter we expect to repurchase the same amount.","Finally, Chevron\u2019s five-year total shareholder return at the end of the quarter was 18.4%, which continued to lead the peer group and also was in line with the S&P500 over the same time period.","Turning to Slide four cash generated from operations was $7.9 billion during the second quarter and $16.3 billion year-to-date. Cash, capital expenditures were $8.9 billion during the quarter and $17.5 billion year-to-date. At the quarter end, our cash balances exceeded $14 billion giving us a net debt position of $9 billion.","Slide five compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2014 earnings were $300 million higher than second quarter 2013 results. Foreign exchange negative affected earnings by $232 million during the quarter representing a negative swing of over a $0.5 million between periods.","As a reminder foreign exchange movements for us are largely book translation effect with minimal cash flow impact. Upstream earnings increased by $315 million. Gains on assets transaction of approximately $610 million in absolute terms and higher realization were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact and higher exploration, DD&A and operating expenses.","Downstream results decreased by $45 million. Higher U.S. refining, marketing and chemical earnings were offset by lower international refined product margins along with adverse foreign exchange effects. Movement in the other segment reflects an absence of a 2013 second quarter impairment and lower corporate expenses largely offset by higher corporate tax charges.","Turning to Slide six, I\u2019ll now compare results for the second quarter of 2014 with the first quarter of 2014. Second quarter earnings were approximately $1.2 million higher than first quarter results.","Upstream earnings were up $957 million reflecting gains on asset transactions, higher lifting, modestly strong realization and favorable tax effects. Partially offsetting were higher exploration and operating expenses in addition to an unfavorable foreign exchange movement between quarters.","Downstream results were essentially flat. The variants in the other bar largely reflects the absence of the impairment and related charges for our mining asset from the prior quarter, partially offset by higher corporate expenses.","Jeff will now take us through the comparisons by segment.","Jeff Gustavson","Thanks Pat. Turning to Slide seven, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $142 million higher than first quarter's results. Higher production volumes at the Perdido and Caesar Tonga Fields in the Gulf of Mexico in the Midland and Delaware Basin and the Permian and in San Joaquin Valley increased earnings by $115 million.` Higher exploration expenses mainly associated with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, decreased earnings by $95 million.","The second quarter included gains on several separate assets transactions worth approximately $180 million in total. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including lower natural gas realization and higher operating expenses.","Turning to Slide eight, international upstream earnings were $815 million higher than last quarter's results. Higher realizations and higher liftings increased earnings by $280 million. Our under-lifted position in the first quarter was essentially neutralized.","Gains on the sale of our interest in Chad and Cameroon increased earnings by $430 million. Lower impairments compared to the prior quarter resulted in an earnings increase of $140 million. An unfavorable movement in foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $95 million.","The second quarter had a loss of about $150 million compared to a loss of about $55 million in the first quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items including favorable tax effects, offset by higher operating and exploration expenses.","Slide 9 summarizes the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2014 and the first quarter 2014. Production decreased by 43,000 barrels per day between quarters.","Shale and tight resources growth contributed 6,000 barrels per day driven primarily by production increases from the Midland and Delaware Basin in the Permian. We are also seeing continued growth from the Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina.","Major capital projects decreased volumes by 13,000 barrels per day due to the shutdown of the LNG plant in Angola partially offset by the ramp up at Papa-Terra in Brazil and Caesar Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico.","Plan turnarounds in Kazakhstan, Australia and in Denmark among others reduced production by 57,000 barrels per day. Absence of first quarter external constrains largely weather related disruptions in Kazakhstan as well as lower demand in Thailand, increased volumes by 27,000 barrels per day. The base business in other bar reflects normal field declines.","Slide 10 compares the change in Chevron\u2019s worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2014 and the second quarter 2013. Production was 37,000 barrels per day lower than the same period a year ago. Growing volumes from our Shale and tight resources primarily driven by the Permian in the U.S. and Vaca Muerta in Argentina increased production by 33,000 barrels per day.","Major capital projects contributed 13,000 barrels per day driven by Usan in Nigeria and Papa-Terra in Brazil partially offset by the shutdown of the LNG plant in Angola.","Higher turnaround activity mainly in Kazakhstan reduced production by 21,000 barrels per day. Lower production in titanium effects due to lower cost recovery, higher prices and higher royalties reduced production by 37,000 barrels per day. The base business and other bar principally reflects normal field declines.","Turning to Slide 11, U.S. downstream results increased $95 million between quarters. Stronger margins increased earnings by $140 million driven by tighter product supply due in part to industry refinery maintenance combined with higher seasonal demand, higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $130 million.","About half of this was due to higher cost related to shutdown and maintenance activities at the El Segundo Refinery during the quarter. The turnaround was completed at the end of June and refinery operations have returned to normal.","The remainder reflects higher maintenance and repair expenses at our other refineries and incremental costs from the startup of the Pascagoula base oil plant. Gains on midstream asset sales improved earnings by $40 million between quarters. The other bar reflects a number of items including stronger chemicals results.","Turning to Slide 12, international downstream earnings decreased $84 million between quarters. Increased volumes improved earnings by $75 million following the completion of turnarounds at our Thailand and South Africa Refineries last quarter. Lower refinery margins decreased earnings by $15 million reflecting higher crude cost that could not be fully recovered in the marketplace.","Foreign exchange losses were approximately $55 million higher compared to prior quarter. The second quarter had a loss of about $85 million compared to a loss of about $30 million in the first quarter. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $30 million. The other bar includes a number of unrelated items including minor asset transactions and lower trading results.","George will now provide an update on our upstream operations. George?","George Kirkland","Thank you, Jeff. First I would like to highlight the progress on our Gorgon project. This photo shows the LNG plant in the foreground with the jetty in the distance. We continue to make excellent progress in the module fabrication yards and on Barrow Island. Module delivers are continuing on schedule and we are achieving our key milestones.","Gorgon remains on track for a startup next year and will be a key contributor to our production grown in 2015 and beyond. I\u2019ll share a bit more on Gorgon later.","Consistent with prior quarters we have posted additional progress photos for both Gorgon and Wheatstone, which can be found on our Investor page at Chevron.com.","Now let's take a look at our Upstream financial performance on Slide 14. Our 2014 year-to-date Upstream earnings margins was $20.32 per barrel. The suggested margin does not include gains from any of our recent asset sales in this quarter. Based on the results for our peer group through the first half of the year we lead all our competitors by an average of over $3.50 per barrel.","Relative to the first half of 2013, our earnings margins have softened. Foreign exchange swings reduced our margin by a $1.42 per barrel. This combined with higher exploration expansions and DDNA have been the primary contributors to this decline.","We are cognizant of the current microenvironment, increasing cost of goods and services coupled with relatively flat commodity prices and we remain focused on managing controllable cost. Looking forward, we are expecting strong contributions from our new MCPs as they come online.","Now I\u2019ll discuss our 2014 production results and outlook on Slide 15. Production in the first half of the year averaged 2.57 million barrels a day at an average year-to-date Brent price of just under $109 per barrel. The first half results are 43,000 barrels per day or 1.7% below our guidance.","Relative to our guidance, production entitlement effects reduced production by approximately 20,000 barrels a day and the unplanned outage at Angola LNG reduced production by a further 15,000 barrels per day.","Our base business performed well. Over the six months of the year, we have maintained a base decline rate of less than 3%. We also continue to see strong growth from shale and tight assets.","During the second half of 2014, we anticipate further production ramp up at Papa-Terra in Brazil and our two Gulf of Mexico developments Tubular Bells and Jack\/St. Malo as these are all scheduled to come online. During the second half of the year, we will perform the second of two planned turnarounds at TCO as well as execute large turnarounds in Thailand and in the North Sea. The product entitlement effects are anticipated to continue and we don\u2019t expect any LNG production in the second half of the year.","Completed asset sales in the first half will of course affect second half production. We forecast 2014 production will average 98% to 99% of our January guidance.","Our 2017 growth to 3.1 million barrels per day remains on track as we bring on our new projects and progress our shale and tight resources. I would like to provide you with a little more detail on the production growth, which we anticipate will occur over the next several years.","Turning to Slide 16, our peer-leading growth to 2017 is largely driven the startup of our major capital projects. For the last several years, we\u2019ve been in a period of high investment while our MCPs progress through the construction phase.","As these projects now transition to operations, beginning with our deepwater projects Tubular Bells and Jack\/St. Malo, we forecast significant volume and earnings growth. We remain focused on executing our industry-leading queue of projects with excellence. We have the right people and processes to deliver these projects and we are excited about the value creation.","While many projects contribute to our growth, the majority of our new volume is generated by aid of our largest MCPs. Gorgon and Wheatstone in Australia; Mafumeira Sul and ALNG in Angola, Papa-Terra in Brazil and Jack\/St. Malo, Tubular Bells and Bigfoot in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Now I will review progress on six of these projects.","Moving to Slide 17. In early April, Angola LNG experienced a failure in the flare blow down piping system. At the time of our first quarter earnings call, the investigation was still underway. Following a thorough analysis, a number of design issues have been identified, which will require modifications. In addition to the piping repairs, the LNG team will utilize this shutdown to perform capacity and reliability enhancements to the plant.","Following completion of repairs and testing, the plant will restart and it is expected to achieve sustained production in the second half of 2015. The Gorgon project is now more than 83% complete. All Train 1 and common modules required for LNG operations have been delivered to Barrow Island and installed on foundations. Other down string work of Barrow continues to progress well with the jetty now 97% complete and the commissioning beginning this month on LNG Tank 1.","Delivery of Train 2 modules has begun and 5 are now on site. On the Gorgon upstream, hydrotesting has been completed on all 660 km of offshore pipelines. The well flow back and clean up operations on the eight Gorgon wells is ongoing and drilling has been completed on the tenth and final Jansz-Io development well. The next major milestone is the completion of LNG tank 1, which is targeted for the end of this quarter. Wheatstone is now 40% complete. Dredging, build and piling work is progressing on schedule.","The shore pool of the main 44-inch trunkline through the microtunnel was completed safely and as planned. Shipments from fabrication yards have commenced with the delivery of the first slug catcher components two side. The Wheatstone platform and topsides are now more than 63% complete and we anticipate the sailway of the platform\u2019s zero gravity structure in August. Wheatstone remains on track for a late 2016 startup.","Now I will review progress on our deep water Gulf of Mexico projects. Moving to slide 18. The Tubular Bells project is nearing startup. All key tie-ins have been installed and tested and the wells are ready for production. Production operations are anticipated to come -- to commence in the third quarter. The remaining work on Jack\/St. Malo is progressing well and the project remains on track for late fourth quarter startup. Overall hookup in commissioning and startup progress is now 73% complete.","Tie-in spools for the Steel Catenary Risers have been installed and gas pipeline pre-commissioning is complete. Jack\/St. Malo will be a key contributor to our production growth in 2015 as production ramps up. Bigfoot shipyard related construction is over 90% complete and preparations are being made for a fourth quarter sailway. Fabrication work on the tension leg platform tendons is now complete and whole and topside integration is nearing completion. The project team marked a major milestone with the heavy lifts of the drilling modules this quarter and as you can see in the picture on the slide.","Bigfoot remains on track for a 2015 startup. We are pleased with the progress on our key deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. As these three projects ramp up during the next year, we will see a significant uptick in production as we move towards our 2017 goal. At peak capacity, these projects will deliver Chevron approximately 100,000 net barrels per day. Now I will provide an update on our shale and tight activities.","Please turn to slide 19. Chevron is the largest producer in the Permian and has an enviable acreage position. We have the largest and developed leasehold and 90% of our acreage is either low or no royalty. We have over 17,000 well prospects identified and the potential to add eight to 10,000 more. Since we are not in a drill or drop situation our approach has been to allow others to derisk acreage surrounding our own.","This enables us to focus our capital on development wells rather than exploration and appraisal. In the Midland basin of the Wolfcamp play, industry drilling today has been predominantly via vertical wells. Earlier this summer, we spotted our first horizontal Wolfcamp well. We now have 17 rigs operating in the Midland basin and 10 rigs operating in the Delaware basin where we added two rigs this quarter. We are on schedule to drill more than 500 wells this year in the Permian basin.","Turning now to Argentina, Chevron is please with our initial results in the Vaca Muerta. Drilling results have helped us identify two sweet spots where we are focusing our activity. In one of these areas, we have commenced a horizontal program.","We have seen a production uptick, which gives us confidence that we will deliver the growth we anticipated when we entered this play. Good progress is being made on our Duvernay program in Canada. Our wells have demonstrated good blow rates and high condensate yields and we are confident of the quality of our acreage.","In the third quarter, we anticipate spotting the first of 16 wells as part of our expanded appraisal program. Also in Canada, we are continuing with the appraisal campaign in the Liard Basin. Results continue to indicate very favorable ultimate recoveries and high IPs, which will support our longer term plans for this asset.","Moving to Slide 20. I will now highlight a few additional ongoing activities. We continue to have good success on our exploration program in the Carnarvon Basin in Australia. Since our announcement of Elphin 1 in April of last year we have made four additional discoveries. This provides us with additional gas resource and optimization alternatives for our Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG facilities.","In March, we stayed at our target to deliver 10 billion in asset sales over the 2014 to 2016 time period and we are on our way to meeting that goal.","Our recent divestiture of the Chad assets is one example of our focus on monetizing a mature declining business, which allows us to generate cash for potential reinvestment in other growth areas. We are also progressing the sale of several other mature assets including the Netherlands, our non-operated interest in Draugen in Norway, several leases in Nigeria as well as several smaller assets from our conventional North American portfolio.","We recently achieved a major milestone at our Escravos gas-to-liquids plant with the production of GTL diesel in that. We anticipate continued ramp-up in first product lifting later this year. Our exploration and development program in the Utica is yielding good results for both liquids and gas. Industry results in the Utica shale have been encouraging from Ohio into West Virginia and Pennsylvania. We recently achieved a test of more than 32 million standard cubic feet per day on a 22\/64\u2019s choke at one of our wells in the emerging southern trend.","We anticipate this well will be turned into line this fall. And finally we\u2019re also very encouraged with the initial results in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Exploratory drilling and logging has indicated multiple play zones in a large structure. We have begun initial drillstone test and the formations have demonstrated the ability to deliver high liquid blow rates. On one of the two wells, we plan to test upto nine different zones. We\u2019ll continue with our KRI testing program over the months ahead.","Now I will turn it back to Pat.","Pat Yarrington","Okay, thanks George. Turning to Slide 21. I would like to close with just a few thoughts. Global energy demand continues to grow and satisfying demand growth is a great business opportunity for us. We\u2019ve had the same basic strategies for a long time now. We believe they remain relevant and that they will continue drive future value growth for our shareholders. We continue to focus on executions. You just heard from George that our base business in the upstream continues to perform well and that we\u2019re making significant progress on our major capital projects.","In the downstream we can also report success. The Pascagoula base oil plant or PBOP as we call it is now online. First commercial production began in June and the plant rampup to full production ended July. We are now the largest producer of premium base oil worldwide.","Focus on execution also means operating safely and reliably. Through six months our personal and process safety performance has been strong across all the measures we typically share with you. The days away from work rate Tier-1 loss of containment and spills.","Sustained value creation requires reinvestment in our business. This is necessary to meet future energy demand and is vital to sustaining growing rewards for our share holders. We have a broad, balanced and deep queue of investment opportunities and take a highly disciplined approach to capital allocations.","We are actively managing our portfolio and are on track to meet our stated target of achieving proceeds from asset sales of $10 billion over the 2014 to 2016 time period. Through six months, asset sell proceeds at total $1.6 billion now are making good progress on a number of other planned transactions.","We have the best growth profile amongst the peers between now and 2017. Every quarter as project milestones are checked off, we get one step closer to the inflexion point. Indeed, two of the projects George highlighted are set to startup in the second half of this year and two more in 2015. Along with this sizeable growth in volume, we expect will come significant growth in cash flows. We expect free cash flow to grow as well, thereby enabling higher shareholder distributions over time. I short we are very excited about what lies ahead for the company.","So that concludes our prepared remarks. I certainly appreciate you listening in this morning. We are now ready to take some questions. Please keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so try to limit yourself to one question and one followup if necessary. We\u2019ll do our best to get all of your questions answered.","Jonathan, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes, good morning and thanks, George, for your time on the upstream as well. Maybe just firstly a question on cash flow. Last year about $36 billion, this year sort of $33 billion if you annualize the first half and obviously oil prices have state higher.","It looks as if your turnarounds are in high margin areas, but is there any other deterioration in the cash flow relative to your expectations? Obviously you have given us some guidance on the Analyst Day of relatively strong cash flow growth from the 2013 basis as these major projects come on stream.","Pat Yarrington","Ed, we still feel good about our cash flow projections going out 2015, 2016 and 2017 and again it is obviously predicated on the production growth that George went through on major capital projects growth in the Permian and then also of course oil prices will be quite impactful there.","If you\u2019re looking at the first half of this year, relative to the second half, I think one of the comments I would make would be downstream. Downstream has not been as cash prolific perhaps as certainly we would like. Many of the turnarounds that have -- we talked about on the slides are in the rear-view mirror so to speak at this point and so the second half of the year, we believe should be a better cash generation from a downstream standpoint.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. Then a question on the upstream just generally. I'm looking at Slide 10 and of course you are slightly lower on production this year. But if you add up the turnaround production entitlements and base business you are losing some volumes, but even without major capital projects the volume trajectory is relatively flat.","And then as I look at the slide that you put out, helpfully, on MCPs getting up to 900,000 barrels a day from the big projects and the other stuff that you are doing. And then I think about shale, it feels like something has to get worse to miss the 3.1 million barrel a day sort of 2017 guidance, which is a good position to be in. But I am just wondering what is it that gets worse in your assumptions as you look out?","George Kirkland","","Ed I just don\u2019t have any things to get worse on our assumptions. If you remember when we came through at the SAM meeting and gave you our forecast of 3.1 we showed a 50,000 barrel a day buffer, so there is a buffer in there.","The only and part of the reason we had that buffer in there was always the forecasting ability but recognize that we\u2019ve talked a lot more about asset sales and we have asset sales in our plan. We don\u2019t always know exactly what assets sales will actually occur.","We are very focused always on the value proposition of those and that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve got to focus on, creating the greatest value on those asset sales and it is a reminder, when we look at asset sales, we\u2019re looking at two pieces. We\u2019re looking end of life assets, do they have continuing investment opportunities and then of course we look at some of our assets that are on the front that don\u2019t compete for funds.","So we\u2019ve got a little bit of latitude in there to cover some of the assets sale losses that occur when we sell these properties but I can\u2019t give you the details on those because we are very value driven. We\u2019re going to make the best decision on getting the greatest value for anything we sell.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","And very sneakily at the end, just in terms of three questions, it is not an entitlement change as you go forward. The pace of current entitlement changes stays flat through the forecast, do you think?","George Kirkland","","Let me explain a little bit about the entitlement change in there and this probably heads off a question that we\u2019re likely to get from others. Each year when we give you our production forecast we have modeled and we have all kinds of assumptions on production entitlements.","We do our very best job to try to nail those entitlements. We have a 20,000 barrel a day impact in our entitlements that are greater than what we had anticipated. We've shown that in that section, for me -- you have to understand. When we model this we\u2019ve all kinds of assumptions there. I\u2019ll just deal with two of those, the two biggest ones that make up most of this 20,000 barrels a day.","The two of them are in TCO and in Bangladesh. The TCO one, we make assumptions of how much crude we\u2019re going to move via rail versus how much crude we\u2019re going to move on the CPC pipeline. We have that assumption. That comes up and tells us what we\u2019re going to -- gives us a really good indication of royalty net back that the well has.","That gives us net back that the well heads, which impacts our royalty assumptions. This year we have moved more barrels on the CPC because it was available, actually about 80,000 barrels a day in TCO was moved more than was in the plan. That\u2019s great for us. That\u2019s great for Kazakhstan, great for the partnership because we get higher net backs.","We\u2019ve also had higher prices on the sulphur and sulphur sold at a higher price translates to a higher net back for us that the well had also. And that reduces net production. It\u2019s a really good thing for all of us. So that\u2019s really positive. So if the value decision, right value decision.","Similarly in Bangladesh, we\u2019ve had an agreement on how we would look at that. That is now going to be reimbursed and the reimbursement will not will in effect reduce our cost barrels. There is a impact on that. It\u2019s good for us to clear up the bad issue. It\u2019s good from a profit gas or profit oil basis going forward that removes that cost out of it.","So that\u2019s another value creator for us not nearly as big as the TCO one but it\u2019s a positive for us and those two items made most of the difference on this entitlement. Good things, right way to run the business but we didn\u2019t have it modeled that way in our plan, so -- and I\u2019ll tell you we\u2019re always going to go after the piece that makes the most value sense. Maybe that will help.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your question please.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Hi, good morning everyone.","Pat Yarrington","Good morning","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","The first question I had is for George. Relating to the startups in the lower tertiary. George, you said in the past that the key to really good returns there would be increasing recoveries from I think you plan on 10% towards 20% recoveries. What is the path towards us -- and the timeframe I guess, towards us getting a better idea of how those recoveries will play out? Thanks.","George Kirkland","Paul thanks for the question. Historically what we had actually said is we looked at recoveries initially would be in the 8% to 10% range and then that we saw technologies, either completion technologies, reducing back pressure on the reservoir, items such as those technologies that would increase the recovery towards the 15 and then onto 20%.","We do believe we are on track for that. I am going to feel a lot more confident as we get the first Jack\/St. Malo wells on and we see our new completion technology, how successful we are there. We\u2019ll be watching production rates.","I\u2019ll tell you I am encouraged that we\u2019ve done the cleanup on a number of those wells already. So when the facilities are ready, we\u2019ll be able to turn them on and we\u2019ll initially get a quick look of course at production rates. If our production rates are at the high end of our assumption, that\u2019s going to give us confidence that we\u2019re going to get a little bit more recovery.","We should actually have some pretty good confidence in that on the little bit of impact on our recovery view and of course we\u2019ll have a much stronger view on production volumes as we get to the end of the year end March as we get a little bit of runtime on these wells. I feel good about what we\u2019ve seen on the cleanup though and I\u2019ll just leave it there qualitatively.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","","Okay. Interesting. And then the follow-up I had was on Gorgon start up. When you say mid-2015 is that the first production of gas, the first production of LNG or the first sale of LNG? Thanks.","George Kirkland","","It is the first production of LNG. It\u2019s not gas introduced into the plant. We\u2019ve a target to see gas introduced into the plant this year because we need the gas introduced into the plant to start commissioning activities. So one of our early activities is getting gas introduced in the plan getting the turbine generators running, get the power support for the operations. That utility piece is very critical to the startup and it\u2019s actually a milestone that we\u2019ll be talking about more in the next quarter\u2019s call.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","","Cool and then the actual sale of LNG. When would that be?","George Kirkland","I am not going to go that next step. I am going to leave it till we have the first LNG in the tank, which we will announce and once we have first LNG we\u2019ll be announcing our target for first lifting.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","","Interesting. Thanks. And you are still trying to sell more contracts there, aren't you? Is there any reason why we haven't heard more about that given you have shown modeling of a shortage of LNG long-term? I'm just surprised we haven't heard more about contracts. And I will leave it there. Thank you.","George Kirkland","","Paul. We are still looking at opportunities so to sell more gas. We really don\u2019t have a lot more to sell. Remember on the Wheatstone side, we already stood at 85%. so we are fully sold out there.","As a reminder, we have some ability to move gas in our contracts from different assets we own. So we have some flexibility there. We are still once again looking to increase that, but we are value driven so we need to get a price that we think is appropriate. The spot market has been good on a seasonal basis the last year so we feel pretty good about the volumes if we had to move them into the spot side. Preferentially we would move them to a longer term sales contract if we get the right kind of price.","Pat Yarrington","","And Paul, I would just add that with the degree of uncertainty that there is about U.S. exports and the size of U.S. exports, I think there -- you can understand why buyers might want to wait a little bit to see how that all lands out before going forward to secure longer term contracts.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","","Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. Pat, I wonder if I could follow-up on Ed Westlake's question because this is something we have been kind of wrestling with.","It may be overly simplistic, but you gave us cartoon at the Analyst Day that showed how the cash margin improves let's say in a $110 oil environment, so let's call that same-store sales with last year at $36 billion. But when we take the delta on production growth and the delta on the margin, it only adds about $8 billion to the cash flow, so that gets you to $44 billion, you are spending a little under $40 billion, the dividends are $7 billion and your buybacks are $5 billion.","So can you help me with what else are you assuming in that inflection in cash flow that you talked about in your prepared remarks because your offstream guidance doesn't really seem to get us there.","Pat Yarrington","","Are you talking about 2015 or 2017?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","In the cartoon it shows the post 2016 portfolio which I assume is, if we look at 2.1 million barrels a day in 2017 and the current portfolio at 2.7 million barrels a day last year would generate the $36 billion. So I'm trying to understand how big do you think the delta is, because according to your cartoon it is only about $8 billion.","Pat Yarrington","","Let me just start. So we -- if you start from a 2013 base and you look out to 2015, let me just be clear on the assumptions that we have in there.","So we\u2019re moving from the 2.7 million barrels a day last year to the 3.1 million barrels a day in 2017. The assumption on price in that slide was $110 a barrel Brent and when you get the increase in volume and you also get an accretion on the cash margin and that accretion is coming from significantly the major -- major capital projects that George has just run through, predominantly Gorgon and Wheatstone are huge contributors to that. That is really what gives you an underlying increase in upstream cash flows between what we saw at the base in 2013 and what we\u2019re expecting in 2017.","On top of that, there will be we believe higher contributions in cash flows from our downstream sector. Obviously it's not as significant growth element there but there will be contributions on the chemical side and on the lubricant side and some of the R&M side.","So when you put those components altogether we feel comfortable about saying under those set of assumptions particularly price and volume we\u2019re going get to $50 million cash generation figure.","And I think the point that\u2019s really important here is the margin accretion that George has -- we've talked it for a couple of years here is not just on the incremental barrels, it's on the full portfolio and that\u2019s really what is the compelling point here, is that those projects coming online have the capacity to pull up the entire cash margin over the whole portfolio.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","I appreciate the answer. I will take it off-line with Jeff because, like I say, I am using your numbers and the delta looks like $8 billion, but I will talk to Jeff offline. My follow-up is really a Gorgon question, George, and thanks for getting on the call this morning.","You talk about start up on Train 1, but can you talk to the ramp up to Train 3? Because obviously -- you are obviously familiar with the charter that has been out there constantly while this project has been moving forward, but start up is one thing but what about the ramp beyond that? Can you give us some comfort level on the pacing of Trains 2 and Trains 3 and I will leave it there?","George Kirkland","","Historically what we\u2019ve said, we said we saw six months between train startups. So I\u2019ll try to give you a little more context to what\u2019s happening on train 2 and train 3 and I think very frankly it\u2019s very good news on the train 2.","Modules we expect we\u2019ll have almost -- well, I'll just say most of the modules we\u2019re trying to own Barrow Island by the end of the year and we will even have a few we think of the train 3 modules. So the module piece of the work is going quite well, so it\u2019s moving forward very well. We don\u2019t see any of the module work at this point on the critical path.","So all of that puts us in a strong position to say we\u2019re not seeing any slide on time between the startup of train 1 and train 2 and if anything, we may even see that tighten up a little bit but it\u2019s a little early to go there so but it looks good at this point and that\u2019s a real positive. Critical for us to get \u2013 get we'll try to get it offline.","Jeff Gustavson","And then we\u2019ll answer a lot of questions. Okay?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks very much indeed. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","","Hey, good afternoon guys. The position on free cash flow is clear. A question for George. Staying with LNG, one of your partners, Apache, yesterday announced plans to execute on that LNG and Wheatstone for that matter. Any update on that project and does Apache's exit change any as how you think about the risk profile of that potential project?","George Kirkland","","Let me on -- we're -- we need to get our partnership resolved. That means Apache needs to move through the issues and we need to get a new partner in. That needs to happen. That\u2019s I think quite obvious.","As long as we keep moving forward in the assessment of the resource in Liard I feel very good about the resource assessment. I think we already can check off our confidence level on the other resource, the Horn River resources is already high. We\u2019ve really done that appraisal so the focus on the resource side is really drilling in Liard, some appraisal work there and getting some production work. We think we\u2019ll have those actually those wells -- those first wells that we need to get some production data.","We\u2019re going to be complete with them somewhere near the end of the year. So that\u2019s really important step for us. The other pieces that we\u2019re spending money on only aren\u2019t related to Liard. There\u2019s a little bit of money on how we\u2019re going to actually handle the upstream initial production and then of course we\u2019ve to focus on the pipeline and the pipeline quarter. That\u2019s important for us.","We\u2019re putting some money into that to try to finalize a pipeline, rounding it all in clearances and then we\u2019ve got work at this point going on field work. Some field work on the plant itself. We have to understand cost and schedule on that plant.","Those are the important things. We\u2019re not spending huge money but it is a lot of money in the sense I am sure for -- in the terms of 100s of millions of dollars. Now it\u2019s critical for us to have all of that where we can deal knowledgably with buyers. We have to understand cost.","We have to understand resource where we can deal with the particulars of pricing, but we are not going to do a project unless it\u2019s economic. We\u2019ve always told you we\u2019re not going to go to FID one project till we have 16% of the gas sold. We\u2019ve to understand the project in a good sense to do that. So we\u2019ve got to understand project. We\u2019ve got to understand resource. I think we\u2019re moving quite well on answering the resource issue.","I am not concerned with -- if Apache leaves that there I think we could easily step in and be operator of the upstream, quite confident there. Apache has been very good to work with in this early stages of the assessment at Liard.","So I think we\u2019re in good shape but we need to get clarity, we need to cope, we need to get the closure on the partnership and this work. I\u2019ve mentioned we need to do all of that where we can deal with buyers and understand cost and understand economics. We are very value driven. We\u2019re not going to go to an FID and do a project until we have gas sales and we understand the economics of that sale.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","","Great, thanks. And my follow-up is if you could discuss Permian production in the quarter, and just how much did that contribute to the sequential 5% increase in U.S. volumes? And then as you think about 2015 and really bridging to the major project volumes in 2016 through 2018, do you see a scope and ability to further ramp Permian more significantly to bridge, like I said, the other major projects? Thanks.","George Kirkland","","Let me start with the last part of that a little bit. Permian for us is an area we can increase investment and increase production. We will rather ramp at a appropriate speed where we are very cost efficient on drilling and on our infrastructure. So from that perspective, it is a little bit of an asset that we can gauge and move to speed.","Specifically in the quarter I think we had a 5,000 barrel a day plus in from the Permian area that was good. We\u2019re right now running I said 27 rigs. We\u2019ve 14 verticals and 13 horizontals. So that\u2019s really good. I gave you the numbers on the slide of how many wells that have been drilled this year and I believe that was 265. We had told you in March this year that we were going to drill 500.","You can see that we are ahead of schedule on that. I take it\u2019s related to some efficiency we\u2019ve seen in the rig operations. We\u2019ve got a grand focus on reducing cost. This business out there is frankly about two things. It\u2019s drilling cost, getting your drilling cost down and getting your recovery up.","We\u2019ve got great focuses on both of those and like we\u2019re seeing the response. We\u2019re getting a few more wells and we\u2019re getting more barrels. We like what we\u2019ve seen. The more we continue to see that of course we are going to be more willing to push more money there.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","","Great. George. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your question please.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","","Hi guys. George, two questions if I could. On both Wheatstone and Kitimat, can you talk about from Chevron's position whether you have any interest to further increase your existing interest?","George Kirkland","","Paul, I\u2019ll be happy to and maybe I\u2019ll for everyone on the phone I\u2019ll put in perspective a little bit. Wheatstone and our interest is relative but to others and I\u2019ll try to do that on Kitimat.","At the Wheatstone asset level, so this is Wheatstone and Iago, the upstream piece of it, we hold 80% of that. Remember you have a partnership that\u2019s between Apache and KUFPEC that is Brunello Julimar online into a common facility offshore and that our investments in the Wheatstone project and the LNG portion of it is unitized if you will after that.","The fields are not but we have a joint project from a central platform, a trunkline and into an LNG plant and at that point when you look at the LNG portion of it downstream, that portion of it -- we are investing 64%.","We\u2019ve got all the interest we really want. It\u2019s a high end of our interest that we would normally have in any operation. I typically like to be when I operate in this 40% to 60% range. So our working interest is at the high end of that and we\u2019re quite comfortable. We don\u2019t see any reason to have any more working interest in Wheatstone or other assets there.","Now speaking on Kitimat and I\u2019ll build off on some of those earlier comments. We hold 50% of the interest in Kitimat, Liard, Horn River assets. That\u2019s right in the middle of the sweet spot where we like to be on working interest where we\u2019re committing to run the projects and run operations.","What we\u2019ve told the street in the past and I will reinforce this, we actually hold 50% of it and I don\u2019t want any more than the 50% and we do have available some small amount of working interest that we would provide to an LNG buyer and there\u2019s always been plan for us and Apache to have some volumes that we could -- some interest that could be sold down to buyers where they would be a part of the development and they would be in the full value chain. That has not changed and I am not looking to increase our working interest beyond the 50%.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","","Second question, if I am looking at page 16 of the presentation, next year the major projects, the current expected increase is 150,000 barrels per day. Your base operation previously assumed is at 3% underlying decline curve, I assume that has not changed. That translated to roughly about an 80,000 barrels per day job year over year.","So that means that based on this particular graph it would suggest this seems to imply your expected production growth for next year about 2% to 3%, get to about 2.65. I don't know whether you can give us a number what is your current projection for 2015 or if not can you tell us whether there is any other things that we should take into consideration in this calculation?","George Kirkland","","Paul you are good with numbers. Okay, let me speak qualitative to this. First up, we give you our commitment number guidance in January each year.","So in January 2015, we\u2019ll give you our guidance. I\u2019ll only give a few qualitative comments about -- you've done the numbers right relative to the MCPs. Our base decline is running in this 3% or less. That\u2019s true. We haven\u2019t yet given you guidance on two other items and I will tell you we\u2019re working that at this point in time.","How many barrels are we going to have on our shale and tight? We have got investments going in shale and tight and the Permian. That\u2019s not in this number. How well is Vaca Muerta going to actually perform? So we\u2019ve got those two that are significant and we\u2019ve got to identify those as we got through our business plan process and of course we\u2019ve got another one that we haven\u2019t told anyone and we haven\u2019t ourselves haven\u2019t decided on which assets we\u2019re going to sell. So we\u2019ve got some sells that are going to occur.","We are once again value drive. Actually I don\u2019t know which ones are the ones that we\u2019re going to end up and sell. What\u2019s the whole value open for us versus what will someone else pay on these late life assets. So those are the two aspects that I can\u2019t really answer at this point in time. But we will be able to give an answer in January.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jeffries and Company. Your question please.","Jason Gammel - Jeffries and Company","","Thanks, everyone. I wanted to come back to Gorgon if I could. George, if I was interpreting your comments correctly, it seems that critical path on Train 1 would be more delivering first gas on the island and commissioning work on the train itself and also the utilities. Can you confirm that is correct? And when you think about the risks towards meeting that mid-2015 objective, where would you put labor amongst those and what is your labor contract situation? I am just thinking in light of what is happening on Curtis Island right now?","George Kirkland","","Let me start off on the critical path items going for us. ME&I is critical for startup. That is heavily dependent on labor productivity. We\u2019ve got over 5,000 people working on the island. It\u2019s all about for us getting as much of that effort focused on the ME&I piece of it\/","And I guess I would add one other thing and we don\u2019t find any unknown problem. As we get closer and closer to startup and this is true for every project that everyone does in the world, it's these unknowns that you just frankly don\u2019t know what's going to come up and is it something that is easily mitigated or is it something not and we don\u2019t ever know that until we get them all done.","The good news is that every day you get closer, you eliminate more and more of them and being an 83% we\u2019ve already eliminated a lot of them like logistic we know is not a critical path. We were worried about the jetty. It\u2019s not the critical path. So we\u2019re eliminating those every day.","Some big milestones that we\u2019ll report out in the following quarters. An example of big one that we don\u2019t have the tank. We want to make sure we got LNG tank 1 ready. Often on LNG projects the tanks are the critical path. We\u2019re just about to the point to say LNG tank 1, with it being complete, it\u2019s not going to be in the critical path.","I mentioned ME&I one of the big next ones for us is the startup of our turbine generators. We\u2019ve got all five of our generators there on the island, the next big step and a big important step for us milestone is of course power.","We get the power running. That puts us in a great position on the commissioning and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll talk about on our next call, so we\u2019ll keep giving you this information as we click them off and I do encourage everyone since this being brought up again is -- take a look at some of those photos that we have. They are -- I think they really give you a flavor of what work is being completed.","Jason Gammel - Jeffries and Company","","And George, where do you set in terms of labor contracts -- or excuse me, where do some of the contractors set in terms of their labor contracts? And do you have any changes to cost estimate? I think I know the answer to that one. And would you expect to do a Wheatstone cost evaluation at the 50% completion mark like what you did with Gorgon?","George Kirkland","","That\u2019s a yes. We always do that on all our projects Jason. Labor is very important. We never take that for granted. We always have a strong focus on the industry relations piece. We do have some contracts that have to be renegotiated and of course we\u2019re going to focus on making sure we deal with them where they don\u2019t become an issue.","Jason Gammel - Jeffries and Company","","Thanks a lot George.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John herland from Societe Generale. Your question please.","John Herland - Societe Generale","","Thank you. I have got a couple of quick ones for you, George. With Jack\/St. Malo, are you going to ramp those wells up the way you would a Miocene well since they are different? Just curious.","George Kirkland","","I would actually think that we\u2019re going to probably see a little bit slower ramp up on those. Remember these are very high pressure wells. The last thing we want to do is do any damage to the completion.","So we\u2019re going to be very focused and I would say probably a little bit on the cautious side on the ramp of these and make sure we really understand what\u2019s happening at the place of the completion.","John Herland - Societe Generale","","Great, thanks. Then with the Permian, you are talking about drilling a lot of wells. Any issues with basin evacuation in terms of fluids or gas -- in terms of infrastructure.","George Kirkland","","I think it is becoming a little more challenging for the industry in total. We feel very good about where we are and our position. That\u2019s one of the huge benefits for being a company that\u2019s been a large producer there for the long history of the basin.","So we\u2019re in a good position on that. I would tell you the other real positive, the industry in Texas moves darn quick in solving infrastructure problems.","John Herland - Societe Generale","","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","","Great. Thanks, everybody. If I could follow-up on an earlier question in terms of the pace of the onshore. If we look at your performance, I think over the past 12 months these biggest bar on the growth side was from your tight and shale assets. You have got extremely high quality positions in the Permian and Argentina and a number of other places.","And given the volatility of performance in some international offshore assets on timing and the smoother profile and the returns on the onshore side, is there a case to be made, not just over the next 12 months, but over the next five years to reallocate more capital in that direction and away from some of the other projects?","George Kirkland","","We had to look at it on a portfolio basis and that\u2019s what we do each and every year as we build a new three year business plan and actually a longer strategic plan.","We have a portfolio that has lots of options out there. You can move things in and out quite easily but it takes a portfolio that\u2019s got these options available.","We do that each and every year. We don\u2019t like to jerk any of our business around. We would like to keep our rig counts if they are growing. We would like to keep them growing in a gradual manner not a big spurt. We\u2019re more efficient when we do that and of course we have to balance all that with our capital programs.","We don\u2019t have an infinite amount of capital spend. So we try to get our capital focused on how we can get the best returns. So we\u2019re going to I guess high grade our view going forward of how we want to spend our money in our business plan each year.","We told you at our Analyst Meeting that in the next three years, we\u2019re going to be really capital flat, pretty capital flat. That means we\u2019re going to be looking at how we get the most value out of that capital we spend. My anticipation is that we\u2019ll continue to see a little more money continuing to grow, go the Permian Basin but the Permian Basin or these other shale plays cannot offset the impact of these big projects either.","We need all of that in our portfolio to grow. We must have all the big projects and frankly what the continuous plays give us. They give us another piece that\u2019s more continuous in growth and a nice part to have in your portfolio and we\u2019re going to grow that a little bit over time. So it\u2019s going to give us a little more flexibility as we go forward.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","","Okay.","Pat Yarrington","","Okay I think we\u2019ve got time for just one more question here.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","","Thanks. I\u2019ve two quick ones. You\u2019ve highlighted the production uplift from the Vaca Muerta but given the headlines from Argentina this week are you reconsidering or just doing any investment?","George Kirkland","","We believe our contract and the terms we have and have them negotiated provide us appropriate cover and I am just going to leave it there. We feel good about our investments. The way it\u2019s set up. We\u2019re frankly pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making there. We\u2019re making good progress.","The next big thing for me is actually continuing to watch the performance of the asset and I am particularly interested in these two new sweet spots where we\u2019re drilling more wells and what I want to see there is I want to see a production kick-up and then I\u2019ll feel better but I feel contractually with what we\u2019ve established.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","","Okay, that is helpful. And on Kitimat, given the pending Apache exit, are you still likely to be able to reach FID by the end of this year or are we looking at 2015 at this point?","George Kirkland","","We will reach FID when we -- and we\u2019re running our business there to be able to get to FID shortly after having 60% to 70% of our gas committed to an SPA, a sales and purchase agreement. That is the critical decision maker on both timing and the investment decision.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","","Okay. So irrespective of what happens with Apache?","George Kirkland","","Irrespective of what happens with Apache. We\u2019re driven by once again having a sales contracts or sale contracts that give us 60% to 70% of the gas committed and for an economic price.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James","","Okay. Thanks very much.","Pat Yarrington","","Okay thank you. Before we close the call, I would like to mention that going forward we will no longer be issuing an interim update. For those of you who have followed us for some time, you will know that we have modified the format of our update over the past few years in an effort to have it be a clear and effective document.","I have to say that that effort has not met with 100% success. Rather many investors have suggested that it has not been all that helpful or insightful and at times has added confusion rather than clarity. That\u2019s not a good place to be and hence our decision to stop the practice.","We do remain committed though to full disclosure and transparency and as we have in the past, we\u2019ll strive to be very candid and clear in describing company performance in our earnings releases and our earnings call and our 10-Ks and our 10-Qs and in all of our other investor outreach activities.","I would like to thank everybody for your time today. We truly appreciate your interest in Chevron. Jonathan, back to you.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5127":["Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call January 31, 2020 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Wayne Borduin - General Manager of IR","Mike Wirth - CEO","Pierre Breber - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Phil Gresh - JPMorgan","Jason Gammel - Jefferies","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Paul Cheng - Scotia Bank","Jason Gabelman - Cowen","Biraj Borkhataria - RBC","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Alastair Syme - Citibank","Jamaal Dardar - Tudor Pickering","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.","Wayne Borduin","Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber are on the call with me. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mike.","Mike Wirth","All right. Thanks, Wayne.","Last March I laid out Chevron's strategy to win in any environment, focused on four elements that differentiate Chevron from its competitors; an advantaged portfolio; a resilience to price downside; the commitment to capital discipline; and a superior capacity to return cash to shareholders. And as we've done in the past, we delivered again in 2019.","We generated over $27 billion in cash flow from operations. We executed our $20 billion capital program. We grew annual production to a record high. We continued to high-grade our portfolio and we further strengthened our industry-leading balance sheet. As a result, earlier this week, we increased the dividend by more than 8%, and we expect to sustain the increased share buyback rate of $5 billion per year going forward.","And we did this despite the cost increase at TCO and the fourth quarter impairments, which Pierre will cover in just a minute. 2019 performance delivered on all four of our financial priorities, which I'll cover on the next slide. These priorities don't change. They've been the same for a long time. For two years in a row, we simultaneously increased our dividend, increased share repurchases, grew production and reduced debt. Not everyone can say this.","You can see the sources and uses of cash on the slide, including the $13 billion returned to shareholders, nearly the same amount as our cash CapEx. 2019 was a good year and we intend to do even better.","During our Analyst Day in March, we'll lay out our plans to further improve performance in order to continue to deliver superior returns to shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierre, who will discuss our 2019 financial results. Pierre?","Pierre Breber","Thanks Mike.","Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter results included a net $9.2 billion charge in special items and a foreign exchange loss of $256 million. Excluding special items and FX, earnings were $2.8 billion or $1.49 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.","Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion. This is lower than the prior quarter in part due to higher taxes on repatriated cash, including the cash impact for the $430 million tax charge that was accrued in the third quarter.","Total capital spending was $21 billion. This includes around $800 million of inorganic spend, which we don't budget primarily relating to the purchase of the Pasadena refinery and acquisition costs for exploration leases and additional working interest in El Trapial.","Return on capital employed was about 7% when adjusted for special items and FX. We're committed to improving returns on capital and we'll share more about our plans to do so at our Analyst Day in March.","Importantly, our strong free cash flow enabled us to pay over $2 billion in dividends and repurchased an additional $1.25 billion in shares in the quarter. As Mike mentioned earlier, for the full year, we returned $13 billion in dividends and share buybacks to our shareholders. And we end the year with a stronger balance sheet and the lowest debt ratio among our peers.","Turning to Slide 6. In the fourth quarter, we recorded over $10 billion in impairments and write-offs. These were triggered in December by our decision to reduce funding to various gas-related opportunities and to lower our long-term oil and gas price outlook. Line item detail is available in the appendix. While we're disappointed by these charges, we're confident that we're making the right decisions to prioritize our capital on our most advantaged, highest-return assets. These charges were partially offset by $1.2 billion gain from our U.K. asset sale.","Turning to Slide 7. Excluding the impact of special items and FX, earnings decreased $3.6 billion in 2019, compared to the prior year. Upstream earnings declined primarily due to lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher liftings. Downstream earnings also were down due to lower refining chemical margins, together with lower volumes due primarily to the Southern Africa divestment. The other segment charge, adjusted for special items and FX was modestly higher, but in line with full year guidance of $2.4 billion.","On Slide 8. 2019 production was a record 3.06 million barrels per day. An increase of over 100,000 barrels a day or more than 4% from 2018. Excluding the impact of 2019 asset sales, production grew by 5.4%, right in the middle of our 4% to 7% guidance range.","Shale and tight production primarily in the Permian and the ramp-up of Wheatstone and other major capital projects increased production by 235,000 barrels per day. This growth was partially offset by base decline and the impact of asset sales, primarily in Denmark and the U.K.","Turning to Slide 9 and our reserve replacements. In 2019, our one-year reserve replacement ratio was 44%. Our decision to reduce capital funding to Appalachia natural gas resulted in a negative revision of about $400 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves. And asset sales reduced reserves by another 100 million BOE. Adjusting for these two items, reserve replacement was around 90%.","Annual reserve replacements are lumpy by their nature. Five-year reserve replacement ratios are more meaningful and ours is 106%, highlighting our continued focus and sustainability to replace the proved reserves that we produce over the longer term.","Moving to Slide 10. Slide 10 highlights some recent commercial developments. First, we acquired an additional 15% working interest in the El Trapial field in Argentina, giving us 100% ownership of the conventional production and the unconventional potential in this block. We also recently announced an agreement to acquire terminals and retail sites in Australia, allowing us to further integrate our refinery production in Asia with the strong retail network after the deal closes.","Late last year, we also signed agreements to sell our interest in our upstream assets in Azerbaijan and Colombia, both transactions are expected to close in the first half of this year. And a few weeks ago, we joined the Hydrogen Council, building on our knowledge and experience with hydrogen and our commitment to explore ever-cleaner energy solutions for the future.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mike.","Mike Wirth","Okay. Thanks, Pierre.","On Slide 11, we are maintaining our commitment to capital discipline. And in 2020 our capital budget will be flat for the third consecutive year. The stacked bar depicts our organic C&E budget of $20 billion, which includes more than $6 billion in expenditures by affiliates primarily TCO, CPChem and GS Caltex.","In the 2020 budget, approximately $5 billion is allocated to our upstream base business, $4 billion to FGP\/WPMP, another $4 billion to Permian development, $3 billion for downstream and chemicals and the remainder goes to other MCPs exploration and other projects.","Chevron's capital program is unlike our peers. Our spend profile has low execution risk and is focused primarily on short cycle, high return investments that are expected to sustain and grow the enterprise for many years to come.","Slide 12 shows our production outlook for this year, assuming a $60 Brent price. We expect production to be up to 3% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2020 asset sales. Our projected growth is largely driven by the Permian, partially offset by ordinary base declines and the effects of prior year asset sales. The range reflects key areas of uncertainty in our business as noted on the slide. After another year of record production in 2019, we expect a fourth consecutive year of production growth excluding the impact of potential 2020 asset sales.","Moving to Slide 13, I'll share a few closing thoughts. As I've mentioned before, we intend to win in any environment. We're not making excuses for tough commodity prices or margins. As a result of our advantaged portfolio, capital discipline, low execution risk and financial strength, we're well positioned for 2020 and committed to maintain organic capital spending at $20 billion and return significant cash to shareholders through our dividends and buybacks. More detailed guidance related to the first quarter and full year is in the appendix.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Wayne.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks Mike.","I'd like to remind everyone that we have our annual Security Analyst Meeting in New York in early March, where we will share more about our business performance, long-term strategies and five-year outlook. We're looking forward to seeing you there. For those not attending in person, it will also be available via live webcast.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Neil Mehta","The first question and this might be one for you, Pierre, is cash flow in the quarter earnings looked good, cash flow a little light. It did seem like there were some one timers in there. So can you just spend some time talking about what some of those one-time items are and how should we think about that rolling off as we go into the next quarter?","Pierre Breber","Yes, thanks, Neil. So cash flow was a little light perhaps. In the third quarter, we did provide guidance that we expected to pay the taxes on the repatriated cash. So if you recall in the third quarter, we accrued in our P&L for that tax effect on repatriating cash, but the cash taxes weren\u2019t actually paid until the fourth quarter, when in fact, you saw the cash move. So you saw cash balances go down from over $10 billion to less than $6 billion at year-end. And then the second item I would cite for was lower affiliate dividends.","So we have lower dividends from our Chemicals affiliates, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, and no TCO dividend in 2019. So at times in years past TCO - we received a dividend from TCO in the fourth quarter and we didn\u2019t have that last year.","Neil Mehta","And the follow up is just on production guidance. Up to 3% in their number of variables that you called out there, but can you kind of talk a little bit more about how you think about volumes in 2020. What are some of the pluses and minuses that we should be focused on. And how should we think about - thinking about some of the timing of those elements recognizing that you\u2019re solving for - value over volumes?","Mike Wirth","Yes, Neil I\u2019ll take that one. We\u2019ve had, as I mentioned, three years of production growth of 7% I think two years ago, 4.5% last year, 5.5% without asset sales. We continue to be on a good, strong program in our upstream that\u2019s delivering volume growth. And as we said, up to 3% this year. The Permian is the biggest piece of that, and you can see over the course of 2019, what we delivered.","And - what I would call full factory production mode right now in the Permian. And so, that machine continues to click along very well. Jay will talk more about that, including not only kind of the near-term view but lay out I think a little bit of a longer-term view for you in March. We\u2019ve got contributions from other shale and tight, where we continue to invest in both Canada and Argentina.","And those are beginning to contribute, not at the same magnitude as the Permian, but certainly strong growth Gorgon and Wheatstone through improved reliability and addressing constraints and optimization within the LNG plants. So we\u2019ve got growth coming across a number of those. ","And as you note there, we\u2019ve got some uncertainties on the PZ [ph]. It looks as if we will begin production there here at some point over the next few months.","There\u2019s still some details being worked out on that, but that starts to come back in. Hard to say how things go in Venezuela really difficult to say right now. And then, the other one of course, is - non-operated joint ventures and we certainly have some expectations for activity there. How that trends with funding levels decisions by partners, et cetera. A little hard to predict, but look, we\u2019re going to, we expect to grow production again this year.","As I said, setting aside if we do anything else with asset sales in the portfolio. And, fundamentally, the underlying drivers that we laid out last March, where we said a 3% to 4% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. Those drivers remain intact.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please?","Phil Gresh","The first question here - some of your peers seem to be signaling a return trend in buybacks, need to protect balance sheets. Obviously, you\u2019ve talked about the strength of your balance sheet and willingness to continue the $5 billion buyback here in 2020 despite the big increase in the dividend earlier this week. So, as you look at that I mean, is there any reasonable scenario where you would think it would not make sense to do the buyback from a macro perspective.","Or is this something that I know a year ago, when you put this in place, the idea was it would stay there through most reasonable cycle so, just your latest thoughts on that? Thank you.","Mike Wirth","Yes Phil, it\u2019s Mike. No change in our expectations there. We\u2019ve indicated we increased the buyback last year. If you look at our cash flow, you can see that we certainly can afford this, as Pierre mentioned. Debt came down again last year, and we have the capacity to see this through cycles, which is what our intent is and no change to that guidance at all.","Pierre Breber","Yes, and if I can just build off that and address Neil\u2019s question on fourth quarter cash flow, but if you look at full year cash flow, it was very strong. Again, we paid a higher 6% dividend per share in 2019 covered that. We fully funded our capital program and grew production as Mike said over 4%. We paid down more than $7 billion of debt.","And in 2019, we bought back $4 billion of share. So, we\u2019re exiting the year confident in our ability to generate future cash. That was expressed with the 8.4% dividend increase and, again, this expectation of sustaining the buyback through the cycle.","Phil Gresh","Mike, second question just to follow-up, would be it sounds like you\u2019ve been doubling down here on cost reduction efforts, and it\u2019s been a big focus for you recently. So it would be helpful if you could talk about what\u2019s been happening lately on that front. Do you see this as something that would be material to investors in terms of Chevron\u2019s ability to reduce costs in the upstream and\/or downstream businesses in a way that we could see? Thanks.","Mike Wirth","Yes, Phil so I may sound like a broken record on this, but in a capital intensive business, capital discipline always matters. And in a commodity business, cost discipline always matters. We\u2019ve done a good job in taking costs out of our business over the last several years in response to the downturn we saw earlier last decade. You can never assume that you\u2019re done, when it comes to seeking efficiency and driving to an even more efficient cost structure.","And so that is certainly my expectation as we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to do that. We\u2019ve taken cost out at the same time production has grown significantly over the last number of years. And so unit costs have come down dramatically and my expectation is we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to reduce both absolute costs and unit costs over time. In March, we\u2019ll lay out a little more specifically what some of our ambitions are on this, and the kinds of things you can expect to see.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please?","Jason Gammel","Yes thanks very much, gentlemen another solid year in terms of execution in the Permian. I was hoping that you could address whether you still see the Permian as on target for being able to be essentially free cash flow positive. The capital budget picked up a small amount for 2020, and I know commodity prices have some influence there. But if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing?","Mike Wirth","Yes, Jason, the short answer to that is yes, we do. We fully expect to be cash flow positive in the Permian this year. We exited the fourth quarter with very strong production, if you look at the growth Q3 to Q4. And across all the metrics, we continue to see improved performance. We\u2019re getting more feet drilled per rig every year, lateral lengths are increasing, EURs continue to go up, development costs continue to come down.","And we are becoming more efficient from both a capital and an operating cost standpoint. You put all that together with the royalty barrels and the benefit of the fee acreage that we hold, and the picture in the Permian looks as strong as it ever has. I mean, it just gets better.","Jason Gammel","And then just as a follow-up, and this may be something that you prefer to largely defer to March, but a lot of your European peers are putting a fairly significant amount of capital into businesses that they call low carbon, which generally look to be relatively low rate of return type of investments.","Can you talk about within Chevron how you think about lowering the overall carbon footprint of your portfolio? And whether these are the types of investments that make sense for you?","Mike Wirth","So let me start with lowering our carbon footprint and then I\u2019ll come to investments, Jason. We absolutely are committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations. Last year, we announced two metrics tied to methane emissions in flaring that are driving significant changes in what we do. We have adopted two additional metrics which I expect to also be included in compensation related to carbon intensity of oil production and gas production.","We are doing a lot of work around marginal abatement cost curves across our entire portfolio to look at the intersection of technology, investment and opportunity to reduce our carbon footprint. We\u2019re integrating renewables into our business in a much greater way with green power purchase agreements, feeding biofeedstocks in our refineries as soon as this year, and codeveloping renewable natural gas projects with dairy farmers, for instance.","And then the final thing is, we are investing in technologies, looking for things that can scale up, that can provide solutions to these challenges. And this includes not only things like carbon capture from ambient air, but other things to try to decarbonize the more difficult sectors where energy intensity is high.","Last thing I'll say is, just to remind you that we operate the largest on purpose carbon capture and storage project on the planet at Gorgon. And we have two of the trains running right now. The third will start up this year. That will, at full capacity, be sequestering 3.5 million to 4 million tons per year.","So we're absolutely committed to finding ways to address the climate issue. When it comes to investments, it can be challenging because the returns, as you say, historically, have not been competitive with some of the other things that we invest in our portfolio. We're looking for ways to improve that and find things that we can invest in that would offer attractive returns for investors, also be good for the environment and, importantly, can scale. And this is a big challenge and we need things that we can do at scale. And so we continue to be committed to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your question please.","Jeanine Wai","I think just following up on that question. Last month, Mike, you were quoted by saying that companies wait until changes forced upon them fail. And we were just wondering, are those comments specifically related to the gas write-downs and Chevron's longer-term view on natural gas versus liquids? Or was it more broadly speaking to Chevron's strategy related to the LNG transition or else just something else?","Mike Wirth","Probably the final. The something else. And it really is, we need to continue to adapt and our Company has been around for more than 140 years. And we have reinvented ourselves many times over that period of time. We live in a world today with 7.5 billion people. 20 years from now, there will be more than 9 billion people on the planet. There's an expectation for a reduction in the impact of what we do. And at the same time, we need to support affordable, reliable, access to energy for a growing population and growing standard of living.","Now we also have technology tools that are available today that we've never seen before. And so what we need to do is continue to evolve our culture, our applications of technology, our cost structure, our competitiveness and our discipline to be part of that equation for many, many decades into the future.","And so my comments really are a message to our employees that we need to change. We need to evolve and it addresses all of the things that we've talked about. It addresses a more efficient and lower carbon intensity in our operations, but also calls for us to find ways to adopt new technologies and change the way we work in response to them.","Jeanine Wai","My second question is on the Gulf of Mexico and potential upside to medium-term growth there, especially post 2023. So with tiebacks to existing infrastructure there being very attractive from a rate of return perspective in the portfolio. Can you talk about any technology that you're working on that could potentially extend high back ranges? And then any update you might have on estimated resource that we can be excited about in terms of exploiting through existing facilities or infrastructure, given the continued focus on free cash flow?","Mike Wirth","Yes. So we've sanctioned projects at the end of the year, which is a greenfield project with Anchor at a much lower cost structure, both capital cost and operating cost than we've seen before. So I think when we find projects where that's the right answer, you'll continue to see us do that. And we've got a lot of exploration acreage out there and a good track record over time on exploration. But the concept of tiebacks, I think, is one that we need to continue to invest more in.","We had a discovery last year with Hess as the operator called Esox, a low-cost, high return tieback, which actually will turn a 2019 discovery into 2020 first oil. It's about five miles away from tubular bells.","We've been working on technology to extend subsea tiebacks and this includes longer distance pumping of fluids, compression and movement of liquids and the ability to avoid formation of hydrates and other things on the sea floor, pushing the range of tiebacks from the neighborhood of 30 miles out closer to 50 miles, and that really expands the opportunity set for us to use existing infrastructure to improve production.","We're working on multi-phase subsea pumps and a number of these technologies. And so I think as we go forward, what you will see is an increased blend of tiebacks and use of existing infrastructure as well as the occasional large greenfield project that comes in.","And things like Anchor, for instance, you've got an initial phase of development. And once that's in, that enables what we just - what I just described, which is these additional follow-on phases of development, which are much more economic.","And I think technology just moves in one direction, and it really builds on my prior comments that we need to look for ways to use technology standardization and other approaches to make the deepwater even more economic, a lot of progress has been made on that, and I'm optimistic we'll see more in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Roger Read","Guess, if we could, I've got kind of one that's maybe on the risk side question and one that's on the upside question. So with the good news first. You highlighted some of the things at a risk to 2020 production. But recent talk has been about restarting the neutral zone, you have a position there. And then I was curious where else we could see some upside in the portfolio in 2020? I mean, should we be thinking Permian? Or should we focus on some other portion of the operations?","Mike Wirth","So on the partition zone after several years of being shut down, there's been progress with an agreement between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. That memorandum of understanding has now been ratified by the Royal Court in the Kingdom and the parliament in Kuwait, and we're moving on to some administrative actions required to implement that.","All of that suggests that we should resume work in the PZ this year. It's been shut in since May of 2015. And so we will be careful to ensure that any startup and resumption of activity is safe that we really focus on equipment integrity. And so it will be a careful restart and a gradual ramp.","And so I think in terms of production this year, we're likely to see a start-up at some point and then some work before we begin a gradual ramp. So what that nets to is not a lot of impact this year. But if - it could be some positive upside.","I think we'll see more of the ramp completed in 2021. We eventually will have to get some new rigs in there to begin drilling additional wells. And so, but it should be on a trend line over the next 18 months or so back towards something that looks like we saw before we shut down.","In terms of other upside, the Permian has kind of continually surprised us to the upside, even as we raised expectations in the past. And so certainly, that is a possibility. I mentioned the other shale and tight and those also continue to really show strong improvement in terms of performance. And so I think those are some other areas where you could see production upside.","Roger Read","And then for my bucket of cold water on you. We've seen global natural gas prices take quite a hit, obviously, fairly mild winter across. Northern hemisphere hasn't helped. But part of it is your own LNG facilities and everyone else continues to run better than expected? Are we seeing some start to run above nameplate capacity. And so as we think about gas in 2020, what - do you feel that if we look at North American forward curves, that's probably a pretty good indicator of the year ahead? Or is there a reason for optimism in one place or greater pessimism in another. Just sort of curious how that would fit into your outlook.","Mike Wirth","Overall, Roger, I think the market is, as you say, pretty tempered on gas pricing. And we have had a relatively mild winter, both in North America and in Asia. And forward markets reflect that inventory levels reflect that. We're not banking on a recovery in gas prices. We've got an under - we're underweight gas as a percentage of our portfolio versus others.","And I'll remind you, we've got pretty good term contracting on our LNG with oil-linked pricing across a lot of our portfolio there. So from a relative weighting standpoint, we may not be quite as exposed. So maybe it was a bucket of cool water rather than ice water that you dumped on me there. But yeah, the markets are setting up, I think, to be pretty flattish. And that's why we've got to focus on self-help and things like cost, as I discussed earlier.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Your question please.","Doug Terreson","Mike, so in integrated oil, returns on capital have converged between the companies during the past decade or so, which suggests that competitive advantages may be converging, too. And on this point, while you guys had this mantra of disciplined, return-driven capital allocation and that's clearly the appropriate approach, at least in my view.","My question is whether you think that historical advantages and project management, multinational experience, logical superiority, cost of capital, maybe leaving something out are still strong and defendable for Chevron. And if so, are there examples that underscore the strength of the advantages that you guys have. And on the other hand, are there areas of historical competitive advantage that you sense are being eroded and where you'll need to redeploy capital away from in the future.","Mike Wirth","Well, there's a lot in there, Doug. Number one, you're right. I think we have seen this convergence of returns in part by the last cycle we came through in high prices. We had a high cost structure. We had lot of investment across the industry, and we are now living in a world of more abundant supply and prices and returns reflect that with the capital sitting on the books of everybody.","I do believe the advantages that have historically been associated with the companies like ours are still strong, and the project at Tengiz, while we wish that the execution was going better than it is and disappointed in the cost and schedule update, there are not many companies in the world that can do a project like that at all and so I think there are strong advantages there.","Our sour gas handling capabilities, our heavy oil expertise continues to be of value, and as we get back to work in the PZ, we will be doing things there that very few other companies can do. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve been hanging in, in Venezuela, which has tremendous potential and our capability there to help over time develop that resource in a responsible way is something that is differentiated.","So I think there\u2019s some historic capabilities that are differentiators. The other thing I would point to is portfolio, and certainly as we\u2019ve talked about many times, want belabor it, but our position in the Permian both from a size standpoint, a quality standpoint, the lack of relative lack of royalty given the fact that it\u2019s fee acreage and our experience with factory drilling, which is a capability that not everybody has, and we continue to see the benefits of that year after year, is another point of differentiation. So I still do believe there are areas that we do differentiate.","A \u2013 Pierre Breber","And if I could build off Mike\u2019s answer there, look, we get, and I said in my prepared remarks, that our returns are too low and we\u2019re committed to improving them and we\u2019ll share more at our Analyst Day. But I\u2019ll also talk about cash flow. We talked about our strong cash flow in 2019 and call it whichever macro environment you want to call it weak or whatever but we\u2019re able to do all those things, increase the dividend, fund the capital program, grow production, reduce debt and sustain the buyback program.","At our last Analyst Day we showed that over the next five years we\u2019re going to grow cash from ops. We said we\u2019re going to keep capital essentially flat. That means we\u2019re going to grow free cash flow and so I think one of the things that\u2019s not fully understood is that the capital efficiency of our program going forward is different than we\u2019ve seen in the past.","So we\u2019re able to grow and sustain cash flows at lower capital than almost any time in the past and certainly better than our peers. And that\u2019s what enables us to do the kind of dividend increase that we announced a couple days ago, sustain a buyback program and still grow the enterprise for the long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotia Bank. Your question, please.","Paul Cheng","My idea. You did an impairment charge, which is quite large and obviously that means the decision made at the time some of the parameters did not work out. So what have we learned from this process, or this impairment and how your future M&A or project accession, the process has changed?","Mike Wirth","Yes, Paul, two of the big drivers of that charge were our Marcellus position, which is essentially mostly dry gas. We\u2019ve got a little bit of Utica but mostly dry gas, and also the Kitimat LNG project which is Canadian gas that is quite a ways away from the Kitimat site. And both of those, at the time those transactions were entered into, we and the world had a different view on natural gas.","I think the Permian and unconventionals have really been a game-changer. You look at the prolific gas production in the United States today, the market conditions that we were talking about earlier with Roger, and we didn\u2019t see those things at the time. And so I do think there\u2019s a lesson about testing M&A ideas against scenarios that are not the then-prevailing view on forward markets.","We did that with the Anadarko transaction last year, and there\u2019s a reason that we \u2013 we like Anadarko from a synergy standpoint. There\u2019s a reason we saw a certain value level that we would be willing to transact at and there\u2019s a reason we wouldn\u2019t go beyond that. And that\u2019s because commodity markets are hard to predict, and we certainly looked at cases that would have stressed an acquisition because we might experience a different market environment than the one that we premised maybe our central analysis on.","And so Yogi Berra said predictions \u2013 I think it\u2019s Yogi Berra predictions are hard, especially when they\u2019re about the future. That\u2019s certainly true. It\u2019s not lost on us, and I would say that\u2019s the big lesson from these two is if you\u2019re going into the future with \u2013 or into a deal with a pretty strong view on commodity price, make sure you take a look at what happens if you\u2019re wrong and whether or not you\u2019ll be happy with it in the scenario where you are wrong.","Paul Cheng","On the second question, I think Pierre already addressed someone, I mean return on capital employed. Last year, you earned 7% at a $64 Brent price, which is lower than the SMP market return, I think. And that for most of the investors, they probably think $60, $65 Brent is as much as they\u2019re willing to give companies into long-term assumption. So you\u2019re talking about a improvement. Can you give us some idea that where \u2013 given the big portfolio you have, I mean, where that you see the biggest opportunity you may be able to really drive up that return. I mean, we\u2019re looking at some of the project, whether it is Tengiz, the Future Growth Project or the Anchor; we don\u2019t see those projects would be able to improve your overall return at all.","Mike Wirth","Yes, Paul, look there\u2019s no silver bullet on improving returns in a flat commodity price environment. You roll up your sleeves and you get to work on all the little things that cumulatively can drive returns higher. And that\u2019s costs, that\u2019s margins, that\u2019s value chain optimization, it\u2019s reliability, it\u2019s technology.","There\u2019s a whole host of levers that you have to be working on. This is what we do in the downstream business every day and what we\u2019ve done in the downstream business for decades is you assume margins are going to be worse in the future than they are today, and you\u2019ve got to find a way to get more efficient and productive with your operations in every little thing that you do. And that\u2019s what we need to do.","I\u2019m not satisfied with returns at the level that they are. We\u2019re not going to wait for prices to be the answer here. We simply have to \u2013 we have to get after it, and you\u2019ll hear more about this in March. We\u2019ll talk more about our plans to improve returns then, but there\u2019s not a magic wand here. This is good old-fashioned hard work, and it\u2019s things that we know how to do; we just have to get after it.","A \u2013 Pierre Breber","Yes, let me just add in addition to the cost and margin and value chain and all those efforts, the Permian investments are very accretive to our book returns. We showed in the second quarter that even in a growing asset, and we are investing and growing in the Permian that returns are heading to 20% and north of that. So we do have investments that are accretive to the portfolio. I just said earlier, we have some really capital efficiency that enables us to sustain and grow the enterprise at lower capital levels than we have in the past.","So when you take the capital efficiency plus all everything Mike talked about, we intend to increase our returns over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Your question, please?","Jason Gabelman","Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess this follows what Paul just said. Specifically on Anchor, it seemed like CapEx for the project was a bit high. And I was wondering if you could talk about returns. You\u2019ve kind of danced around it, but maybe talk about returns specifically for that project. And is that kind of one of the more competitive projects in your project queue, and I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Mike Wirth","Yes, Jason. If I go back to an earlier period of time, our development costs for deepwater projects were north of $30 a barrel. Anchor is actually south of $20 a barrel. And that includes some investment for new technology that we have to prove out here because we\u2019re dealing with deeper reservoir, higher reservoir pressures \u2013 so 20,000 pounds technology. A little bit of additional export pipeline, which is unique to this project as well.","Operating costs have come down from the high teens per barrel down into the range close to $10 a barrel. So we\u2019ve seen significant improvements in drilling and completions performance. And all of those things come together to bring the cost down. I\u2019m not going to give you a specific return number, because frankly, we run these things at different prices and different assumptions around recovery. So we look at a range of potential outcomes.","But I will tell you, it is competitive in our portfolio. It sets us up for additional follow-on development that will, I think, improve returns. And the technology development unlocks a resource type that we believe holds a lot of potential as we go forward. And so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re done in terms of driving these costs down. And in the deepwater, we\u2019re going to continue to look to make these projects even more economic.","Jason Gabelman","When you say unlock a new resource type, is it kind of a high pressure, high temperature, more further? Yeah","Mike Wirth","Correct.","Jason Gabelman","And then there\u2019s not a lot of visibility to your project queue beyond 2025. There\u2019s a couple of Gulf of Mexico projects per Permian and TCO, and that\u2019s kind of all you\u2019ve given us. I wonder if you plan on providing more visibility to some of your projects that you have options around. And then kind of attached to that, do you see an opportunity to step into some international projects, maybe with companies that are looking to farm down stakes? Thanks.","Mike Wirth","Yes, so we will in March lay out a longer view to give you some more transparency. I know that\u2019s a question that a number of people have been asking. The one thing that I would suggest is we went through a period of time over the last decade where I think we conditioned ourselves and our investors to believe that the only path to the future was by doing these great big projects and stacking up lots and lots of them, because that\u2019s what we were doing at the time.","We have a very different portfolio today. We have large traunches of production that are pretty flat and facility-limited in Australia LNG and Kazakhstan. Our unconventionals begin to behave this way as you build up the scale there. ","And so at the margin, we continue to look for the right projects and highly-economic projects as it appears that those that are accretive to returns. But we\u2019re not nearly as reliant on those alone to sustain and grow cashflows into the future. We just have a much more resilient, durable, long-lived portfolio.","And so grinding away on enormous unconventional positions may not be quite as glamorous as doing the big projects in terms of giving you a lot of things to talk about, but it really drives strong financial outcomes. And it\u2019s durable, I think, longer than most people believe.","And so we\u2019ll talk about that more in March. We\u2019ll talk about other opportunities we have in terms of captured opportunities that people may not be paying much attention to. We\u2019ll talk more about our exploration prospects. And the question on farm-ins, that\u2019s always something we evaluate, and if the right opportunities present themselves, we look at those.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC. Your question, please?","Biraj Borkhataria","The first one is actually just on the base decline. If I look at the figures on slide 8 and take the base from there, it looks like the base decline was less than 1% in 2019. And I guess that excludes shales, but I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of whether that figure is relevant and if there\u2019s anything funny in the 2019 number that is not applicable going forward. Just some comments around that would be helpful.","Mike Wirth","I mean, our base portfolio was large and there\u2019s a lot of different assets in there. There are some things that now are in the base that are things like Jack\/St. Malo and Perdito, and so we\u2019ve got some of these deepwater projects that are all on our new projects.","Some of the new investments in there to do next phases of development and the like give you some growth that offsets some of the underlying decline, but it also comes back to this point I was just making to Jason, and a larger percent of our portfolio now is facility limited, not reservoir limited, and so this mental model that reservoir dynamics drive our overall production, the shape of our production profile is one I think that needs to be calibrated appropriately to a larger and larger portion that does not behave that way. So that results in more stable, predictable production.","There\u2019s modest investment required to sustain that, be it facility investment or some new wells. But you look at that, you look at the brownfield opportunities we have, and the ways we\u2019re using technology to arrest declines, and base decline is just less in our portfolio than it was a decade ago, and that\u2019s not a short-term phenomenon. That\u2019s a structural change in how our production looks.","Biraj Borkhataria","That\u2019s helpful.","Wayne Borduin","Thanks, Biraj. Do you have a follow up?","Biraj Borkhataria","Yes, the second question is just on a slightly different tact, but as you guys sit in California, I wanted to ask about renewable fuels, given the favorable regulation there. So what we\u2019re seeing is a number of the U.S. refiners announce expansion projects in renewable diesel in particular. I was wondering if that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in. What do you think about the economics? And then, if it\u2019s attractive to you, what\u2019s holding you back from investing in that space?","Mike Wirth","Well, we\u2019ve been selling renewable fuels in California for the better part of the last two decades. A lot of blending. We\u2019ve been looking at manufacturing, but we really have chosen not to go into the ethanol business.","On renewable diesel, we\u2019ve got close relationships with suppliers of renewable diesel, and we are, I mentioned earlier in a response to a question, we are making modifications at California refining facilities in order to co-feed biofeedstocks in order to produce renewable diesel.","So our view is rather than going into new projects and greenfield developments, we\u2019ve got existing infrastructure and kit that we have now proven the way to safely and reliably introduce biofeedstocks and co-feed. So it\u2019s a more economic way to do it. It takes advantage of existing capital investment, and so we\u2019re working on that. So we are and will continue to be growing in the biofuels value chain.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Mike and the guys, happy New Year to all of you. Mike, I wonder if I could just hit we\u2019ve had some concerns about this particular issue for a second, and it\u2019s the Permian. I\u2019d like to just get your perspective on it. I realize what you\u2019re saying about returns and the benefit of royalty interests and mineral interests and so on, but by 2023, this is going to be 25% of the company, and when I think about the underlying decline rates and the skew towards NGLs and gas given the state of the U.S. gas market, help me understand why the increase of the putting not much of your portfolio on high decline assets and skewing toward U.S. gas is incrementally positive for the overall cash flow capacity of the company.","Mike Wirth","Doug, so look, an individual well is a high decline asset. The Permian Basin, as you add hundreds and then thousands of wells on production and you have infrastructure built, the ability to keep that infrastructure full and have it be a very flat production profile at modest incremental investment relative to the production that you\u2019re producing is profound.","Jay will explain this more in March when we come to New York, but it is a factory, and running a factory, you\u2019ve got certain costs and certain investments in the factory and then you push out the product or the factory, and that\u2019s how to think about the Permian.","The commodity mix, look, it\u2019s 75% liquids. We\u2019re 50% oil in our portfolio right now, 25% NGLs, 25% gas. As the volumes continue to grow, we get a lot of oil production and we take a long view on markets. Pierre mentioned earlier that returns on investment there are greater than 20% and growing. And so look, if we\u2019ve got something that somebody mentioned earlier your current returns are 7%, those need to improve.","Well if you\u2019ve got opportunities to invest in things that are north of 20 that\u2019s a way to start to lever up returns. And so look, we look at the commodity prices on it all, we optimize it. We\u2019re moving commodities to markets near and far to add value to that but these are high return, long lived positions and it is a competitive advantage.","Doug Leggate","I look forward to what Jay has to say in March but just to be clear, those returns are full cycle including infrastructure and all of the plant build out and so on?","Mike Wirth","And fully loaded with costs including corporate costs.","Doug Leggate","My follow up, Mike, is more philosophical I guess for the broader energy space. All we all seem to be, it seems like there\u2019s been a kind of an awakening if you like to ESG issues just in this last past six months and particularly this year. More headlines this morning about pension funds just divesting out of fossil fuels altogether. I\u2019m just curious how in your position obviously as an advocate of the industry, how do you anticipate challenging those kind of questions over fossil fuels, everything else good kind of thing? How does Chevron compete for the incremental investment dollar? And it\u2019s an answer I\u2019m looking for some help with because obviously it\u2019s a challenge role for all of us in this business right now.","Mike Wirth","Yes, well first of all we believe in ESG. We have been a responsible operator across ES&G for a long, long, long time and we invest enormously in that. The E is getting a lot of attention right now and look, over the history of our industry, we have, we and others have reduced the environmental impact of our operations time and time and time again.","We are doing it again today, and we have the scale, the technical capability, the financial capability, to be a big part of addressing this challenge. And no one country, no one industry is going to be the one that solves everything, but collectively, we will respond to the challenge.","The world needs more energy. The world needs more affordable energy and people in developing economies deserve the opportunity to see their lives improve and affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy is essential to improving the quality of life on the planet, which is better today than it has ever been at any point in history, and will be better in the future.","And we intend to be a part of that solution. We acknowledge that the climate is changing. We acknowledge that human activity and fossil fuels contribute to that. And we acknowledge that we will be part of addressing that as we go forward. And so we are investing time, people, money, technology in being part of that solution.","And look, I\u2019m an optimist. There\u2019s a lot of pessimism that you can hear out there. And as you say over maybe the last six months that drumbeat is even louder. But we\u2019ve solved big challenges in the past, and I\u2019m optimistic that we will be successful again.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citibank. Your question please.","Alastair Syme","With the impairment, I guess you\u2019re signaling something about LNG. So the question is are you happy to tack away completely from LNG? I mean, you\u2019ve been one of the biggest global investors in the last decade and clearly created a lot of competency within the organization. So are you happy to do nothing in effect?","Mike Wirth","No, we\u2019re happy to do things that are competitive and economic, Alastair. And look, we\u2019re a big player in LNG. The demand for LNG will grow over time and you have to take a long view on these things. Commodity markets get into positions where they get over built, demand grows in linear fashion, supply comes on in stair steps.","And so we\u2019re in a position right now where the near-term market fundamentals are a bit tough but long-term, like petrochemicals, like refining, you need to be in low-cost positions that are highly competitive where you\u2019ve got scale, technology, operating efficiency. And so those are the kinds of things we\u2019re looking for and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities to add to our LNG portfolio.","Our assessment on the Kitimat project is, given all the other investments out there in the world that, that one was going to be tough to compete versus our alternatives. And so it\u2019s a hard decision to come to, but it doesn\u2019t condemn the asset class for us as an investment proposition. We just want to find the very best projects.","Alastair Syme","My follow-on, I just wanted to get an update on where you\u2019re at in TCO; specifically, any discussions you\u2019re having with the government. I\u2019m not sure where the government\u2019s been sort of informed on the cost overruns and where that leaves it?","Mike Wirth","Yes, so the discussions are ongoing. The government\u2019s obviously key stakeholder in this, and so our people in-country have been engaged. Jay Johnson will be there next week, and both visiting the site and meeting with people from the government. And so when you go through one of these things, there\u2019s a whole series of engagements and we\u2019re in the process on that.","Pierre Breber","Yes, the only thing I\u2019d add to that, Alastair, is that unlike other agreements in Kazakhstan, our contract\u2019s tax and royalty, right. It\u2019s not a production-sharing contract. So in production-sharing contracts, the government reimburses the concessionaires for their cost which is not the case for tax and royalty. So of course, they\u2019re an important stakeholder but it is a fundamentally different contractual structure.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Jamaal Dardar from Tudor Pickering. Your question, please?","Jamaal Dardar","Just wanted to touch on the outsize dividend growth that we saw versus previous years here. So just curious on the thought process there. And as you continue to shed assets and large MCPs roll-off and capital intensity is lowered, just wondering how repeatable outsize dividend growth could be over the long-term?","Mike Wirth","So if you look back at our dividend history \u2013 and we were looking back at it not long ago \u2013 whether you\u2019re looking over multiple decades or over the last decade, we\u2019ve grown at kind of a compound annual growth rate of about 6%.","And so this is a little bit to the upside of that, but we\u2019ve been lower than that here in recent years and we\u2019re well positioned. Pierre talked about our strong cash flow and the capital efficiency that we have now in our portfolio to sustain and grow cash flows with a much lower level of capital investment than I think people have become accustomed to over the prior-period.","We would not have increased the dividend if we weren\u2019t absolutely confident that it\u2019s sustainable in perpetuity. And just as we said, we intend to sustain our buybacks through the cycle. We intend to sustain strong dividend distributions.","Our number one financial priority, I\u2019ll remind you, is to sustain and grow the dividend. And so this was a signal of confidence in our portfolio. It\u2019s a signal of confidence that we can sustain strong cash generation, even in a commodity price environment like the one we\u2019ve been in and the one we continue to be in. And we will talk about this more in March, but we have a very, very strong position to generate cash out of our portfolio, very efficient capital profile going forward, further efficiencies coming on the cost side, and we\u2019re very confident in the capacity that we have.","Decisions are made by the board. I can\u2019t get ahead of the board on what they may do in the future. But I\u2019ll tell you, the board shares the confidence we have in our cash generating capacity.","Jamaal Dardar","And then just a quick one on the buybacks. You mentioned the sustainable nature. It\u2019s difficult for us to model the impact of the PSC roll-off, but it seems very temporarily there could be at strip pricing, time periods where in order to satisfy the full buyback, maybe you lean into the balance sheet there. Just wanted to verify the comfort there; obviously, given where you sit as best of class on your debt ratio?","Mike Wirth","Yes, thanks, Jamaal. No - yes, if we have to lean on the balance sheet for some point in time, that\u2019s okay, right? We\u2019ve said we want to sustain it through-the-cycle. We\u2019ve never said the buyback has to be funded every single quarter from free cash flow.","So that\u2019s not our expectation. We have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Our net-debt ratio is 13%; gross debt is 16%. We have the capability to take on some debt. I\u2019ve talked about we don\u2019t have a target debt range. But certainly, I\u2019d be comfortable higher than we are right now.","But if we\u2019re outside of, if we\u2019re a little bit low, that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s how the math works. So if we generate cash at surplus to our top three priorities, which is to pay the dividend, invest in the business, and have a strong balance sheet. And we\u2019ll return that in the form of share buybacks. ","But we also want to keep that ratable and sustainable, so we just don\u2019t want to ramp-up buybacks because we want to be able to essentially dollar cost average and do it through the cycle. So the short answer is yes. There will be times we\u2019ll lean on our balance sheet. Our balance sheet has that capability. And our intent is to sustain the buyback through the cycle.","Mike Wirth","Thank, Jamaal. Well, with that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone\u2019s participation on today\u2019s call. Jonathan, back to you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Sean, and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn the conference call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Sean. Welcome to Chevron\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today is Jeff Gustavson, General Manager, Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron\u2019s website.","Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.","Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The Company's first-quarter earnings were $6.2 billion, or $3.18 per diluted share. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was 18%. Our debt ratio at the end of March was approximately 9%. In the first quarter we repurchased $1.25 billion of our shares. In the second quarter we expect to repurchase the same amount.","Turning to slide 4, this week Chevron\u2019s Board of Directors declared a $1 per share quarterly common stock dividend payable in mid-June. This is an 11% increase and reflects the performance and strength of our current portfolio and are confident in our compelling growth prospects. Since 2004, our dividend has grown at a compound annual rate of 11%, a growth rate that is well in excess of the S&P 500 and better than our peers. You can see this on the left chart.","This pattern demonstrates the priority be placed on rewarding our investors through increasing distribution. The chart on the right provides updated information on five-year rolling total return to shareholders, through the end of the first quarter. Our strong financial and operational performance and superior growth prospects for both production and value are being recognized by the market. We have led on this rolling total shareholder return for an extended period of time now and we are off to a strong start in 2013.","Turning to slide 5, cash generated from operations was $5.7 billion during the first quarter, a lower level than it has been in some time. This was primarily the result of working capital impact. Overall, working capital requirements for the Company increased by $3.4 billion in the quarter. This working capital consumption of cash was principally in our Downstream operation. This is not an atypical pattern for us for the first quarter of the year, though this quarters increasing working capital requirements is larger than we have usually seen. The increase reflects the timing and pricing of commodity purchases and sales between quarters as well as the operational downtime we had at several refineries this quarter. The vast majority of these effects are temporary in nature and the impact that cash flow are expected to reverse in future quarters.","Importantly, our Upstream business continues to generate strong cash flow. Capital and exploratory expenditures were $8.2 billion during the quarter, including expenditures associated with our buying to the Kitimat LNG project. We've continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and at quarter end, cash balances exceeded $19 billion, giving us a net cash position of almost $5 billion.","Jeff will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.","Jeff Gustavson","Thanks, Pat. Turning to slide 6, I'll compare results of the first quarter 2013 with the fourth quarter 2012. As a reminder, our earnings release compares first quarter 2013 with the same quarter a year ago. First quarter earnings were $6.2 billion, about 1 billion lower than fourth quarter results. Upstream earnings were down $942 million, reflecting the absence of fourth quarter asset transaction gains, partly offset by higher realizations and a favorable swing in foreign currency effects.","Downstream results decreased $224 million between quarters, driven by lower volumes largely associated with seasonal maintenance activity in the absence of fourth quarter asset transactions, partly offset by a positive swing in foreign currency effects. The variance in the other bar largely reflects lower corporate charges.","On slide 7, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the first quarter were $231 million lower than fourth quarter's results. Higher realizations improved earnings by 95 million, driven largely by an increase in crude oil prices. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $80 million, mainly due to increased maintenance activity in the Gulf of Mexico and fewer producing days in the quarter.","The net of higher DD&A and lower operating expenses reduced earnings by $85 million. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including the absence of favorable tax effects and gains on small asset transactions in the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide 8, international Upstream earnings were $711 million lower than the fourth quarter. Earnings increased approximately $130 million, due to higher realizations, partly offset by lower liftings. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects improved earnings by about $200 million. The first quarter had a gain of $170 million compared to a loss of $30 million in the fourth quarter.","Lower operating expenses increased earnings by about $200 million between periods, primarily due to reduced maintenance activities and employee costs. The other bar reflects a number of items, including favorable tax effects in addition to lower exploration expenses.","Finally, earnings decreased by about $1.5 billion between quarters, primarily due to the absence of the gain on the Browse asset exchange recognized during the fourth quarter.","Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 23,000 barrels per day between quarters. Lower cost recoveries on production-sharing contracts spread across multiple countries reduced production by about 16,000 barrels per day. This is an investment timing issue which we noted in our interim update.","The base business and the other bar includes the impact of planned turnaround activity, weather disruptions and normal field declines. Contributions for major capital projects increased first quarter production by 9,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico and Platong II in Thailand. ","Turning to slide 10, U.S. Downstream earnings fell $196 million between periods. Lower volumes reduced earnings by 190 million, primarily due to planned maintenance at the Pascagoula, Mississippi and El Segundo, California refineries. First quarter 2013 was a particularly heavy refinery maintenance period for the company. Maintenance at both Pascagoula and El Segundo has now been successfully completed.","We also reintroduced feedstock to our Richmond Refinery crude unit earlier this week and will continue bringing the Downstream conversion units to full capacity over the coming days. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $65 million. Seasonally weak demand particularly for gasoline combined with rising crude cost, pressured refining and marketing margins.","The other bar reflects several miscellaneous items, including lower operating expenses, higher chemical earnings and the absence of year-end LIFO inventory drawdown benefits that were recognized last quarter.","On slide 11, International Downstream earnings were $28 million lower this quarter. Lower volumes reduced earnings by $75 million primarily due to plant maintenance at the Burnaby, Canada and Cape Town, South Africa refineries. Lower operating expenses increased earnings by $95 million reflecting lower transportation and environmental expenses. Foreign currency effects represented $175 million positive earnings variance between quarters. First quarters FX gain was about $75 million compared to a fourth quarter loss of $100 million. Gains on asset transactions were $135 million lower reflecting the absence of prior quarter asset sales. The other bar again reflects a number of unrelated items including lower shipping results, weaker lubricants margins and higher withholding and other tax related charges.","Slide 12 covers all other. This segment broadly consists of corporate administrative functions our worldwide cash management and financing activities as well as our mining, power generation, real estate and energy technology and services businesses. First quarter net charges were $439 million compared to $538 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $99 million between periods. A favorable swing in corporate charges resulted in $111 million benefit to earnings while corporate tax items were $12 million higher this quarter.","With that I would now like to turn it back to, Pat.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. Now turning to slide 13, last month we held our annual security analyst meeting where we provided updates on our projects and future growth plan as well as our financial performance relative to our key competitors. We now have fully updated relative performance data in a couple of areas. Segment returns on capital employed and Upstream cash margins.","First, our Upstream adjusted return on capital employed was 21.5% for 2012 and we can confirm this placed us in the number one position relative to our major piers for the second year in a row. We completed the restructuring of our Downstream business and our adjusted return on capital employed in 2012 improved again to over 18%. Here we rank a strong number two against our piers and we have been closing the gap versus the leader for each of the last five years.","Slide 14 shows our updated Upstream cash margin comparison. We have led the pier group in Upstream realizations for several years a trend which continued in 2012, combined with our competitive cost structure and the quality of our portfolio we also continue to lead the pier group on unit cash margins. In fact our cash margin of just under $37 per barrel exceeded the average cash margin for our pier group by $11 per barrel or over 40%. This superior performance is a function of the quality of our assets as well as our strong execution capabilities.","Turning to, slide 15. I would like to share some highlights of the strategic progress we made during the quarter. We announced successful well test results at St. Malo in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico where oil flow rates while limited by testing equipment constraints exceeded 13,000 barrels per day. With new technology we saw drilling efficiencies and good reservoir stimulation and this board\u2019s well for improving the recovery and the economics on our existing and future Gulf of Mexico projects.","The Big Foot haul has arrived in the Gulf of Mexico and the Jack\/St. Malo haul is on its way. The picture is of the Jack haul being transported. We announced the signing of a binding long-term sales and purchase agreement with Chubu Electric to deliver one million tons per year of LNG from the Wheatstone Project. Our Wheatstone LNG project has over 80% of its off-take secured under long-term sales contracts. In the Downstream our new gas oil cracker achieved start-up making the Yeosu Refinery in South Korea the largest processor of heavy oil in that country.","We continue to be successful with our exploration program with new discoveries at Coronado in the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico and in Australia\u2019s, Carnarvon Basin where we announced discoveries at Kentish Knock South and the Elfin-1 prospect. The Elfin-1 prospect is our 21st discovery since 2009. We added new offshore exploration acreage in both Morocco and China. We also reached an agreement to enter the Cooper Basin in Australia another early low cost entry opportunity focused on unconventional resources.","And finally, we recently sanctioned the Moho Nord development located in the Republic of Congo, the largest ever oil and gas development in that country.","I'd like to close by saying we're off to a great start in 2013. Earnings were strong. Upstream activity is on plan not only in terms of production, but also in terms of executing well against our major development project milestones.","I encourage you to visit our investor website where we recently posted updated photos of our progress on our Gorgon and Wheatstone projects. We also continue to pursue future profitable growth opportunities, which will create additional value for our shareholders over time.","Our healthy dividend growth pattern remains in place. This marks our 101st year of paying dividends and our 26th consecutive year of growing our annual dividend distributions. We continue to provide the strongest returns to shareholders offering a good balance between share price appreciations and dividend yield.","We truly appreciate you listening in this morning and your interest in the company. I'd like to know open up the microphones for questions. We do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up if necessary. We'll certainly do our best to see that we get all your questions answered.","Sean, please open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Hi. Good morning, Pat. I've got a quick question on the tax rate, if I may. Obviously it dropped down to 39.3% and you flagged favorable tax rates in some of the commentary. Are there any sort of structural changes here in terms of shifts or is this just tax optimization in the quarter?","Patricia E. Yarrington","There's nothing structural here, Ed. As you probably know that as certain projects mature and particularly as they get to the FID stage, it's not unusual to have certain tax impacts triggered by reaching that project milestone and that's really what we saw occurring here in the first quarter. That's what gave us a low effective tax rate in first quarter '13. We expect this to balance out over the end of the year. And so I think from a longer term perspective, thinking back to the 2012 effective tax rate, which is about 43%, that's a pretty reasonable place for you to peg the overall expectation for the year.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Thanks, that's very helpful. And then just switching topics, on natural gas in the U.S., obviously a bit of benefit from Marcellus and Atlas over the last couple of quarters but the gas price, I guess it's rebounded a little bit. Should we expect that gas production probably turns down a little bit as it started to in the first quarter as you go through the balance of the year?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Well, I think what we have said in the past, we have really restricted all of our dry gas production to minimal amounts, principally in the Marcellus area. And of course, we're being helped there economically by the carry that it's still in place. All the rest of our gas production efforts really are geared towards heavy liquids concentration efforts. And so we should continue to see those ramp up.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Okay, thanks, very helpful. Thanks very much.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Good morning, Pat and Jeff.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Good morning, Evan.","Jeff Gustavson","Good morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Let me ask maybe a longer term question of how you think about the longer term CapEx and cash return strategy. And I ask in the context of my view Chevron's relative free cash flow inflection in 2014, '15 time period, as you begin to see the cash benefit of these relatively heavier and current period of capital investment. And the question hence becomes, do you believe that when you likely have incremental cash during this period, the cash returns to shareholders via buybacks or dividends increase or that you see additional reinvestment opportunities in the portfolio to maybe replicate this '14 to '17 growth period. How do you think about that?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. Well, I would say broadly. I mean first of all, we believe the best way over time that we create value for our shareholders is by making the right investment choices. And if we have a strong queue, if we have projects that are very nicely attractive, nicely economic then obviously that's an important element for us. We have been in a stage where we have had very nicely attractive projects. And so that is really what has given rise to the heavy investment period of time.","We do take our dividend commitment to our shareholders very, very seriously. That is the first priority of return of distributions to the shareholders. So you should expect that to continue to grow as long as earnings and cash flows continue to grow, and we of course are able to grow earnings and cash flows if we invest appropriately. So we work very harder trying to get that balance right between attractive projects for investment in the business and then also dividend distributions to the shareholders.","If we get into periods of times where we have surplus cash, free cash flow beyond the C&E requirement, beyond the dividend requirement that\u2019s really what we pay to your share repurchase program to distribute. And we look at that every quarter, we evaluate what we think the kind of the medium term requirements for the firm are in terms of reinvestment, we obviously have a hypothesis about what our Board might do on dividends. We look at, what we think is happening from a commodity price standpoint and therefore what net generation into the firm might be and that's how we take our share repurchases. It is the most flexible element of our cash distribution formula.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","I mean, then I understood, I mean, let me try may be what \u2013 kind of one different way and if I could, I mean, the percentage of CAPM that\u2019s invested in the project queue, that is not anything I need to know about today, is relatively higher than where its been historically. I think you gave a 35% number at the Analyst Day and I know there is lot of variabilities, but under current conditions would you expect that to normalize back into this -- 25% to 30% range, once you are exiting this kind of peak spending period through call them the 2015 timeframe? I will leave it at that. Thanks.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay and I think the best guidance I can give you on that would be to have you take a look at the duration of the investment cycles for some of the projects that we have underway. When you're talking about LNG projects, of course we have got Gorgon and Wheatstone underway, we have Kitimat, which is just in a very, very embryonic stage here, but those have very long investment cycle, 60 months plus. That's much different than what you would get in sort of the factory investment types of cycles that you might achieve and say a Permian ramp up for example. So, I think you need to look at the kinds of projects that we have in our queue and the overall investment cycle times for those projects in the queue. And that is going to give you an indication of how much pre-productive capital we might have built up on our balance sheet at any point of time.","I did say back in March that our pre-productive capital was in the high 30s and that is an abnormally high level for us. And so all things being equal, once you get through the heavy spend period, we would expect that to come down as long as we don't have another set of projects moving forward. We do try to balance this all out and in the end I think we have certainly demonstrated a history of doing that being able to that successfully, because our project queue has been very economic and its producing the returns that we're benefiting from a cash flow standpoint and our investors are benefiting from a distribution standpoint.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks. I appreciate it.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Question on the Cooper Basin, when we were over in Perth last fall sometime, Chevron did not sound particularly excited about some of the East Coast LNG opportunities or stuff over in Queensland. Just curious whether this Cooper Basin entry signals any change to that view? Maybe I misread it.","Patricia E. Yarrington","You know Arjun, I wouldn't read too much into them, and I think we were talking very broadly back in the fall and as a general rule as a Company we are always on the look out for what I will consider low-cost early entry opportunities, and that's really what the Cooper Basin represent. It's a very new play, I can\u2019t really indicate how that may in fact turn out for us, we just think it was an opportunity to expand our unconventional portfolio and there is an off a lot of work that will need to be done to evaluate the Basin. But we're hopeful that something could turn out there. I think you need to think of it as low-cost entry and very early in the evaluation phase.","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","Got it. That's helpful, Pat. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. Any update on the timing of Angola LNG start-up and Frade start-up? Thank you very much.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Sure. So on Angola LNG, our expectation is that we will have first LNG here in the second quarter. Assuming that happens, we would expect then to get to full capacity by year-end. And again, assuming that things move as we think they will, it's probably going to add to us about 20,000 barrels a day for the full year. Obviously that would just be a partial year contribution for us. It's worth about 60,000 barrels a day net to us once fully operational. From a Frade standpoint, we have received approval for a production restart for four wells basically, no injection activity. And that should be here in the second quarter as well. But it will be ramping up relatively slowly and so the contribution for the year will be relatively modest, only about 5,000 barrels a day.","Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs","That's great. Thank you so much.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Pat, just a quick one. Was there some tax changes in Kazakhstan as related to exports is the first one? And the bigger one which you may be able to answer or not is can you talk a little bit about the sensitivity of your CapEx levels to the dollar \u2013 to appreciation in the dollar? I assume an appreciating dollar would bring down your global CapEx. I wondered if you had a sense for sensitivities. Thanks.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Right. So the first answer no, the tax change didn\u2019t relate to Kazakhstan. And in terms of our capital program, we're really most sensitive to movement from a capital program standpoint to the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. And I think we've explained in the past that yes, it's been a component. We have had higher foreign exchange impacts that was part of the Gorgon cost increase up to $52 billion. About a third of that increase from the original FID number was related to foreign exchange effects, so that has impacted us there. This year it has really been much more modest than that. And as we said in the past, we haven't hedged against the Australian dollar or hedged the Gorgon or Wheatstone activities because usually the Australian dollar is moving with commodity prices and usually that means that we've got a natural hedge.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Yeah, I was just kind of wondering because I guess it's the dollar strength and just globally it would tend to imply that the oil price will come down, but clearly what you're saying is the main sensitivity by far is the Aussie dollar.","Patricia E. Yarrington","That's exactly right.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Not some \u2013 for example, the euro wouldn't make a whole lot of difference either way.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Not from a C&E standpoint, no.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","By the way, going back to the first question that Kazakhstan had changed its exports tariffs. Was I wrong?","Jeff Gustavson","No, Paul. This is Jeff. That's correct. They did increase the export tax but our assets are not affected by the increase \u2013 our netbacks are not impacted.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Thank you. That's perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your questions. Doug, your line is open. Could you try pressing your mute button?","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm sorry, I had mute on. Good morning, everybody.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Hello, Doug.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, Pat. We were looking forward a couple of years just some very substantial step-ups in production, but we don't really hear you talk much about portfolio high grading. Is that something that \u2013 you're very happy with the asset base you have now or is it an ongoing effort to pair, if you like, the bottom 10% in portfolio on a regular basis? And I've got a follow-up please.","Patricia E. Yarrington","I would say that we have a standard practice of pairing components of our portfolio and I'm speaking here about the Upstream, pairing components of our portfolio where we find that it's not going to continue to attract the capital that it needs to perform well where we feel others might find more value in that asset. So we will continue to do that pairing, I think about a year-and-a-half ago because I'm a little shy on the timing, but it's fourth quarter \u2013 last year I think it was \u201811, the Cook Inlet sale occurred. So, that\u2019s just a good example of continued pairing of the portfolio. I will say on balance we\u2019re very happy with our portfolio because you see it in our earnings margins and you see it in our cash margins. So, on balance we like the assets that we have, but having said that we obviously looked for opportunities to pair if we think the asset has more value to somebody else and it's not going to compete in our portfolio.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","[Indiscernible) particularly material, how does that result a fair assessment?","Patricia E. Yarrington","I think that\u2019s true, that\u2019s fair. I mean, normally you can expect for the enterprise somewhere between $1 billion and $3 billion of asset sales in a given year. Over the last few years more recently we have had a little bit heavier restructuring occurring in our Downstream segment, and so that effort is largely behind us and so you wouldn\u2019t expect that continuing size to go forward in 2013.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. My follow-up is really \u2013 I guess it's kind of a related issue. We monitor your, if you like, cap rate on your Upstream business and for most of the last year, it was \u2013 I won't give numbers, but let's assume it was relatively low and in Q1, we have seen a big jump in your international margins relative to your weighted revenues, if you like. Has something changed there? Was it an absence of maintenance that\u2019s more sustainable going forward or to Paul\u2019s point has there been any kind of incremental tax changes that have led to that rebound. I am just trying to understand how sustainable this might be on a go-forward basis, because it was quite a significant number relative to what you were expecting?","Patricia E. Yarrington","You\u2019re talking about our Upstream \u2026","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","International \u2013 international margins.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Upstream international margins, right. I think that it really, when you look at 2012, if you look at the whole quarterly pattern for 2012 had a significant deterioration in the third quarter really associated with the downtime at TCO. And now we have really just moved backup into what would be a more normal pattern. And that impact of the downturn in the third quarter and the re-ramping backup here in the fourth quarter you can see in last years results.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Patricia E. Yarrington","We\u2019re back to a more normal position for us.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s what I need. Thank you ","Patricia E. Yarrington","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your question.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.","Congratulations on your results everybody.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Thanks, Doug.","John S. Watson","Thank you.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.","Pat, I want to say -- if you\u2019d provide an update on the situation in Argentina and also the plan or next steps for Kurdistan for 2013, if there are any?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay, well Argentina we continue to work with YPF on the Vaca Muerta discussion. We're hopeful that, that will be able to be concluded. So far we have drilled about three shale wells on our existing acreage and we\u2019re encouraged by the results that we have there. There are some above ground complications, I guess I would say that exists in Ecuador as they relate to Ecuador, and we need to have satisfactory resolution of those above ground complications before we proceed in a material way on Vaca Muerta.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.","Yeah. In fact could you just provide a little color on that point?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay, well basically Ecuador has \u2026","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.","You don\u2019t have to go that far back. Just kind of the next steps, I guess legally that you guys envision? Yeah.","Patricia E. Yarrington","On the Ecuador \u2013 on the overall Ecuador case?","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.","No, no. Just the Argentina component. I\u2019m sorry, yes.","Patricia E. Yarrington","On Argentina. Argentina, okay. So right now there\u2019s a, I guess I would call it a partial freeze of assets in Ecuador.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.","Sure.","Patricia E. Yarrington","It really hasn\u2019t impacted our liquidity in a substantial way. We\u2019ve been able to modify our liquidity provisions and so operationally we\u2019re in good shape. There is a freeze underway.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.","Right.","Patricia E. Yarrington","We are basically petitioning to the Supreme Court in Argentina to have them review that case. I don\u2019t know when the Supreme Court may take it up or if they will take it up. We\u2019re certainly hopeful that they will take it up.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.","Okay.","Patricia E. Yarrington","We don\u2019t believe that there is any merit to having the freeze in place. And we believe in a country that abides by the rule of law that kind of justice will prevail on this element as well.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Thank you. I just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions on the exploration success in the quarter. First of all in Coronado, obviously in a pretty good neighborhood there. Can you talk about any follow-on drilling plans that you have? I believe that you're about to spud a sidetrack or maybe already have spud a sidetrack on the discovery well?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Well, not really sure what I want to be saying here on Coronado. I mean we do like the area. Let's see here\u2026","Jeff Gustavson","So we're still evaluating that \u2013 Jason, we have spud \u2013 a sidetrack on it.","Patricia E. Yarrington","But there's not much more that we really want to say\u2026","Jeff Gustavson","Not right now, it's still under evaluation.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's fine. And then maybe if I could just shift to the Australian exploration success. Obviously between drilling results and then the swap that you had with Shell for Carnarvon Basin versus Browse Basin, a quite a bit of incremental gas. Now you've talked about being able to move into a Gorgon feed for a training 4 relatively soon. But given the gas you've accumulated, when do you think you could actually start evaluating a training 3 at Wheatstone?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Well, I think that is more distant certainly. I think we need to get trains 1 and 2 up and moving forward. We're only the second year into that, the whole development construction phase here for Wheatstone. So I think it will come. It is a hugely prolific area, as you know, and with both the Kentish Knock and Elfin-1 prospects may just continue to add. And so the more that full region continues to add to our gas holding then it gives us more flexibility about which particular or gas molecule we send to which particular plant. So I think you should think of it as after discussions around training 4 for Gorgon.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful.","Patricia E. Yarrington","And any further expansion of Wheatstone.","Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with you questions.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Hi, guys. Nigeria GTL, are we still on track for the year-end start-up? And based on your experience with the GTL, I presume that you're probably not interested in a GTL plan in the U.S. natural gas market?","Patricia E. Yarrington","So with regard to EGTL, we're in the process here of commissioning the plant. It's a complex plant and the commissioning activity really go on for the bulk of this year, for the rest of this year. I would say we don't see \u2013 GTL will not rank high in terms of our project alternatives for U.S. natural gas.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","In Nigeria, Pat you're saying should be continued to be ramping up, is that any PSC you said related to Nigerian production or your just natural under 90 rate?","Patricia E. Yarrington","No, there's no PSC of fracs there.","Jeff Gustavson","I'd say there are some cost recovery there, Paul. So investment levels were slightly lower because quarters since we had lower cost to our barrels.","Patricia E. Yarrington","And that's really a timing issue not anything more sustaining than that, timing of investments and therefore the timing of cost recovery barrels.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Okay. Can I just maybe a real quick one for clarification. On the favorable tax impact for the international E&P, do you have an absolute dollar amount in the first quarter? You showed in the chart saying that sequentially it's a benefit of $214 million. What is the absolute dollar amount in the first quarter?","Patricia E. Yarrington","We're not going to disclose that. Again, I think the important point about this is to understand that that was a timing event associated with moving some projects through various project milestones and the taxes that are triggered commensurate with that. For the overall year, you should think about the overall effective rate for the company of being in the low 40%.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc","Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to actually get some clarification on the Downstream business. You guys mentioned a lot of sort of downtime between Pascagoula, El Segundo, Burnaby, South Africa, Richmond, the OC Refinery that's just all of that. Could you guys just let us know what was down and what\u2019s back up in its full production right now and maybe give us a little bit more detail on the upgrader here, which is so you\u2019re going to consume more heavy oil at Yeosu? And I just have a follow-up. Thanks.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. So I think, what we can say we really have said already. So El Segundo and Pascagoula are back at normal operating level. Richmond crude unit is just now taking FEED and we will continue to line that out over the next several days, so certainly as we progress through the quarter, you should expect that to be back to full operation. The downtime at the smaller refineries is same sort of circumstance has occurred. So, it was just a very heavy first quarter of maintenance period. You should expect the second quarter will be substantially back fully operational. We don't go into specific details about which units we have down at which plant, for which duration for commercial reasons and I'm sure you can appreciate that. And then in terms of South Korea here, we did have the new VGO FCC up and online with on-spec product during the first quarter. It's a 53,000 barrel a day plant; it does allow us to process heavier oil.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc","Okay, got it. Perfect. And then my follow-up is on the Marcellus. Is there any chance you give us sort of how production has going for you in the Marcellus, last year and for this year. So you talked about it, I guess, in your prepared remarks, so just trying to understand how much growth you\u2019re seeing at that particular asset of yours?","Jeff Gustavson","So that \u2013 I will take that \u2013there has been production growth between year-on-year quarters and a lot of that\u2019s driven in the U.S. by both Marcellus and the Midcontinent for us which is respectably the Permian and some of the assets we picked up from Chesapeake later last year. So Marcellus continued these carry and continue to bring on production.","Patricia E. Yarrington","And we would expect the Permian component to continue to grow during the year.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Asit Sen with Cowen Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Asit Sen - Cowen Securities","Thank you. Good morning. Two quick questions, one with Brazil and one on Australia. Just a follow-on on Brazil, given Friday\u2019s start in second quarter and small contribution in 2013, how should we think about Papa Terra, still at 2013 start-up or slips into 2014?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Right. So \u2013 we really need to refer you to the operator on this, but the operators continues to have a 2013 start-up.","Asit Sen - Cowen Securities","Okay. And then, secondly on Australia, a more strategic question, in a scenario were floating LNG becomes viable. How does it impact your thought process and future LNG trains that either Gorgon or Wheatstone, any early thoughts on that would be appreciated. Thank you.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Right. So, I think the floating LNG obviously is a technology that is still yet to be proven and my expectation will be over time that will prove out to be a development design that will be appropriate for certain types of reservoirs. In terms of Wheatstone and Gorgon, we\u2019re really in a position where we have invested already in the Greenfield and our best opportunity for further expansion obviously will be Brownfield. Brownfield as you know can be much more economic, particularly on the Downstream component of the plant, certainly we think may be 15% or so \u2013 15% to 20% more capital efficient on the Downstream side. So, we think the Brownfield expansion that we have at Gorgon and Wheatstone and given the resource size that we have at Gorgon and Wheatstone will allow those developments when the time is right to be attractive and competitive.","Asit Sen - Cowen Securities","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.","Allen Good - Morningstar, Inc","Good morning. I just wonder, if I get a follow-up on the Marcellus, I guess in March you announced you had the $850 million left on the drilling carries there and were running about eight rigs. At your current level, when would you expect to exhaust that drilling carry and when you do, would you imagine that you continue almost on with that eight rig drilling program or would you reduce the activity at that time?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Right. So the 850 is the number that we have at this particular point in time. We are not going to continue to provide interim updates on that. That really is a function of kind of the drilling program and the rate at which the investments occur. Our expectation really is and I think we've said this for some time here that our expectation is that the drilling carry works through a period of what I'll call relatively low US gas prices it allows us to understand the reservoir allow for kind of the build up the development plans for that basin and by the time the carry is over, it's our expectation that we would be sitting in a stronger US natural gas price environment. At the same time we've had good success and improving the economics of our drilling program in terms of cost per well the footprint per well and also the environmental impacts per well. So we're really pleased with the progress that we've been able to make and we're happy to have that carry and we'll continue to prosecute the plan over the next 12, 18, 24 months just as we have in the last couple of years.","Allen Good - Morningstar, Inc","Okay. And I wondered if I could just get your update also on the acquisition front, obviously you did a deal with last year, a couple of years ago the Atlas deal. What's your view right now as far as evaluations are concerned in the US unconventional space whether it be natural gas and oil and how much opportunities do you see today relative to last year given I guess some of the oil prices and maybe some of the other evaluations of some of these small EMPs that are out there that may fit into your portfolio.","Patricia E. Yarrington","And I think that I don't want to have a generic statement on this because I think it really does depend on the quality of the asset in the unconventional space. As we have no \u2013 as we've seen there's a big difference between sweet spot areas and non sweet spot areas and we continue to always be focused on the value proposition first and that really stems from the quality of the asset and in certain times here we have seen that the high quality assets have been very, very expensive and that our entry point was really too late. In other circumstances, we have found that for whatever reason in Chesapeake I think was a good example of this. There were certain circumstantial above ground issues that were face that we could get in and get a good value for that. Kitimat in the unconventional space we feel very pleased with having the opportunity to buy into that particular project. It's a tremendous resource space and we like the overall dynamics between the partners now. There's only two partners and we've got a good partner in Apache with a strong capability on the Upstream side. We obviously bring the Downstream side. So we tend to look at the overall project. And if we can find value in the overall project, we're going forward but it's not \u2013 there's not a blanket, gee, everything's overpriced or gee, everything's under priced right now. It's very resource specific and circumstantial specific.","Allen Good - Morningstar, Inc","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our final question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a big picture question on your overseas unconventional, one of your European competitors recently made some very downbeat comments on shale development outside North America. You guys have been about as active as everyone in the cumulating acreage. I would just like to get your latest thoughts on that?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Right. Pavel, I think we have said that I know George has said that this is a long-term development opportunity and we have always had the expectation that it would take several years to understand what this play could develop into. You just don't have the same infrastructure in these European countries as you have in the US. You don't have the same knowledge of the reservoir. In the US of course the US have been drilled for decades and decades and there was an awful lot of reservoir knowledge that is not the case in Europe. In the US we have a lot of service providers and a lot of infrastructure. In Europe that is not the case. We have well established fiscal and political regimes here. As it relates to hydrocarbons, that's not always the case in Europe. And so there are a number of differences between the US environment and the European environment and so we have always thought that this would be a longer term development opportunity.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Just a quick one on Kitimat. Is it still your sense that you will only move forward with the project if you can get crude linked off take?","Patricia E. Yarrington","Our belief is that selling Kitimat gas into an Asian market will require, I guess I would say economic provisioning that will underpin the asset investment. And in our belief the best mechanism for doing that is the oil linked contract. So we believe that, that will continue to be the basis that will be needed to spur on the investment for new LNG developments like Kitimat.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. I appreciate it guys.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","I am showing one follow-up from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Hey Pat, two quick one actually. One in page 10 of your presentation you show in the U.S. Downstream a negative bar of $190 million, and you\u2019re saying that primarily relate to the downtime. Is that just the, we take also that\u2019s including your estimate of the opportunity cost. And if you are not into the opportunity cost, do you have a rough estimate that how big that may be?","Patricia E. Yarrington","No, I mean this is -- I mean, there\u2019s an analytical derivation to get to the volume bar and what we\u2019re really trying to say there is that, that compared to last quarter and the volumes that we had running through the equipment and the margins that were achieved back then relative to this quarter and the margins achieved this year we break that up between the volume and margin analysis here, various analysis. And that\u2019s really just trying to say that the primary driver for poor U.S. Downstream earnings really had to do with having so much of our equipment down, Pascagoula, Richmond, El Segundo.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","So that\u2019s the best estimated opportunity cost to you?","Patricia E. Yarrington","No.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","That\u2019s fine. I'll just follow-up with, Jeff later on. A final one, at the end of the first quarter from an inventory level, do you roughly balance at a normal level or that you\u2019re under-levered or over-levered and do you have any under-lift or over-lift in the first quarter also?","John S. Watson","We\u2019re slightly over lifted, but it's immaterial. It's less than half a percent in the first quarter.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","How about at the end of the quarter. Are you roughly balanced?","John S. Watson","Well that is the end of the quarter.","Patricia E. Yarrington","That is the end.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Oh, that is the end. How about in the first quarter, did you have any over-lift or under-lift at all?","John S. Watson","Well, like I said we were slightly over lifted, but less than a half a percent. So it's not material to our results.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","I\u2019m not showing any other questions. Thank you.","Patricia E. Yarrington","Okay. Then I\u2019d like to thank everybody for your participation here today, especially for the folks who asked the questions. With that again I\u2019ll reiterate my appreciation for your interest in the company, and I wish you well for the day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.
